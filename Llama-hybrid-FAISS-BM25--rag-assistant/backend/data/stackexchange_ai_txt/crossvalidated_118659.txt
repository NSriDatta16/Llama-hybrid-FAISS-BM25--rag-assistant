As I understand it, you want to compare group 1 with group 2, based on data consisting of 10 class averages in group 1 and 12 class averages in group 2. You can do this reasonably well, as long as the class sizes don't differ too much from one another. It's OK because the $t$ test is fairly robust to minor departures from its underlying assumptions (independence, normality, equal variances). If the classes are wildly different in size, though, then the normality and equal-variance assumptions go awry, because you wind up with mixtures of distributions with different variances.
