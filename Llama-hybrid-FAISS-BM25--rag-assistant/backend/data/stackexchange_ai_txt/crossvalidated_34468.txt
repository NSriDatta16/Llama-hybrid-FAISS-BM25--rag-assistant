Here is an R implementation. With it I find that the algorithm does not always converge; sometimes, even when it does, it produces negative covariances; and it tends to be optimistic concerning the coverage of the confidence ellipse (about half the 95% confidence ellipses do not cover the true values). That could be due to bugs on my part, so check and test carefully! In this simulation result the true location is in blue, the estimated location based on 16 very noisy bearings is in red, the bearings from the reference points are gray rays, and the 95% confidence ellipse is shown centered around the estimate. library(MASS) # ginv() lenth
