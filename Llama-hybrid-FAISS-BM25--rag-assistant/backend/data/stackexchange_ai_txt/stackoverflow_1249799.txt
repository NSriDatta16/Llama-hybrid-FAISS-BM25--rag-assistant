BlackBerry HelloWorld deploys in Eclipse under 8130 simulator but not 950

I followed the steps in www.thinkingblackberry.com/archives/21 If I pick the 4.5.0 JDE with the 8130 simulator, I can navigate to the HelloWorld icon, click it, the app runs, I can hit breakpoints, etc. I then switch to the 4.7.0 JDE, erase the simulator files (Blackberry | Erase Simulator File | Erase All), and change the simulator from Default to 9500 in Debug Configurations When I run the simulator, I get the series of messages in the Eclipse Console window as the simulator comes up. If I then click on BB button to get more icons, then click on on "Applications" button, I don't see any HelloWorld icon, and I don't see any up/down arrows that indicate there are more icons. Am I missing something obvious? Here's what I see: http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O2EgfLK-19N8nssbdatyhg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIjcnNLmhbWgeQ&feat=directlink Thanks In Advance for any help. Chris
