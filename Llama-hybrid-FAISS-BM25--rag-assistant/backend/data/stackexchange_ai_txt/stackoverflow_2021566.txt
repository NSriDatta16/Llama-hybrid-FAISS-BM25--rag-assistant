Currently SVN cannot efficently store those types of files. There has been some discussion about it though http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=651443 This SO question shows a graph when storing an OpenXML office document. The results were pretty linear Will Subversion efficiently store OpenXML Office documents? Although your question wasn't specifically about that format it may still apply. You might just need to run a test in SVN and see what kind of storage it takes. SVN is pretty good at storing binary files, so it might not be too terrible. The SO question above also mentions saving the file as a plain text XML 2003 document, which you might investigate also.
