You can use Paperclip on Heroku - just not the local file system for storage. Fortunately Paperclip can use s3 for storage. Heroku has a tech article here that covers it. Also when an asset that's been uploaded is displayed on a page (lookup asset_host ) the image would be loaded directly from your s3 buckets URL so you will pay Amazon for a get request to the image and then for data transfer involved but also for storing the assets on s3. Have you looked at the s3 calculator to get indicative costs?
