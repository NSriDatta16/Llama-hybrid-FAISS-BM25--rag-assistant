REST: Is http code 300 appropriate in this redirect situation?

I have a multi-locales website. I need to redirect users to their locale when they access the site without the locale code in the url. e.g. http://www.mysite.com automatically redirected to either http://www.mysite.com/uk or http://www.mysite.com/us I'm looking at rfc2616 and I'm hesitating to use Code 300 (Multiple Choices): The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations, each with its own specific location, and agent- driven negotiation information (section 12) is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to that location. Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection. If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD include the specific URI for that representation in the Location field; I think I understand, but the wording still makes it a bit cryptic for me. Can someone familiar with response codes confirm if I'm on the right track and explain the following excerpts? [...] and agent-driven negotiation information is being provided [...] Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) [...]
