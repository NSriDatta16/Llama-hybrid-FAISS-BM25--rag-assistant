What Model to Choose for a NN with a Very Wide Output Layer?

The input of my neural network consists of 20 features, whereas the output consists of 20,000 of them (predicting a "quantum classical shadow" based on a few parameters: the rotation angle as the input and a few hundreds of shots of random measurements as the output). AFAIK, it's a linear regression problem. What I've tried: an FCNN (doesn't work good); Scikit-Learn Lasso (the same results); MSE regression using Neural Tangents (the same). Any ideas on how to solve this? Thanks a lot in advance!
