If you want $c$ to be exactly 0, just fit a linear regression without an intercept. Dividing $y$ by $x$ would be a bad idea, unless you assume the error is proportional to $x$ . There is no reason why you should take the sum. No need to square the data. If you only need a soft constraint, i.e. $c$ near zero, you could fit a Bayesian linear regression with a prior on $c$ centred on 0 and arbitrarily sharp.
