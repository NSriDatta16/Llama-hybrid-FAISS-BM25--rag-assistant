You can cluster SQL Server 2005 or 2008 with some caveats. I think that you've got to install SQL Server as a cluster from the beginning. If you have separate instances of SQL Server already, you can't cluster them ad-hoc. You'd need to reinstall, in that case. Clustered instances must have shared storage You must cluster those instances at the same version and SKU. You couldn't mix a 2005 and 2008. Service packs have got to be the same as well. You CAN cluster different versions of SQL Server .
