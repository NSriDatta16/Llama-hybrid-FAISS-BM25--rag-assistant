Much of the burden on your system coming from your indexing process is probably the disk I/O, so besides what ShuggyCoUk said, if your process works in Vista/Windows Server 2008, you can also change disk I/O priority to background. That's how most paging, defrag and other maintenance tasks work on those systems. If not, you can also monitor the disk i/o queue to see if there are pending operations coming from user interaction.
