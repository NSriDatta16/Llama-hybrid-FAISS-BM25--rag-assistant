App Engine - Datastore vs Blobstore for user uploaded profile pics?

Which one should I use? What are the pros and cons to using each? The images will all be less than 100 kilobytes. 3 kilobyte thumbnails of each image will be retrieved quite often, like 2 to 5 on each page view on average. Which would be better to use, considering latency in retrieving the images, cost in CPU time of retrieving the images, and any other factors?
