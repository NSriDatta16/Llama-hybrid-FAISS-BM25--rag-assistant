Classifying compositional vectors of time series

I am interested in classifying vectors of time series $x_t=(x_{1,t},\ldots,x_{n,t})$ . In addition these vectors are subject to the restrictions $\forall i,t$ : $0 \leq x_{i,t} \leq 1$ and $\forall t$ : $\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,t}=1$ . So the $x_{i,t}$ are actually percentage values. The vectors come from several groups and given a new vector of time series, I want to classify from which group this new vector might come from. I know a little bit about dynamic time warping, but this doesn't deal with vectors. And even more, I got the additional structure of the problem which stems from the above mentioned restrictions. Does anybody know a method to do this?
