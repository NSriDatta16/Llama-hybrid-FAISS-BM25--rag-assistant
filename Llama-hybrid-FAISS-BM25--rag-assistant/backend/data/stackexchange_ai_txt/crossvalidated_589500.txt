I find it useful to draw a distinction between the standard use of Markov chains for statistical modelling purposes from use of MCMC techniques for integration. In the latter case, we are talking about a clever use of Markov chains to write an integral of interest as the stationary distribution of the chain, in order to allow a new form of numerical integration. This is essentially the reverse of the standard use of Markov chains, where the chain itself is specified, but its stationary distribution is derived from specification of the model. Outside of the use of MCMC methods for numerical integration, Markov chains are most commonly used for direct statistical modelling of data. There are a number of results in this analysis that are made easier if you can derive the spectral decomposition of the transition probability matrix (or more generally, the Jordan normal form ), which includes derivation of the stationary distribution(s). Knowledge of this form allows you to get a number of simplified results in the analysis, so it is a common early computational step. There are a few reasons that analytic derivation of the stationary distribution(s) is preferred over just running the chain for a long time: Derivation of the stationary distribution(s) is often just seen as one piece of the broader derivation of the spectral decomposition (or Jordan normal form) of the transition probability matrix. Once you derive all the eigenvalues and unit eigenvectors of this matrix, it is helpful for various aspects of later analysis. As part of this derivation you will have identified the stationary distribution(s) of the chain. There are cases of Markov chains where there are stationary distribution does not exist or is not unique. In the latter case, any convex combination of two stationary distributions is also a stationary distribution. Consequently, deriving the stationary distribution merely by running the chain for a long time may not work, and if it does it often misses the full specification of all possible stationary distributions in the chain. Direct analytic derivation of the stationary distribution is often computationally quicker and more accurate than derivation via running the chain for a long time.
