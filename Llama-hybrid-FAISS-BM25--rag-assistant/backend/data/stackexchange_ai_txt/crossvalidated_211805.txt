Estimating classifier performance using cross validation, average accuracy and standard deviation and

I want to estimate a classifier accuracy on benchmark data. Data is not split into training and testing so I use 5-fold cross validation, using 80% of data as training and testing on 20%. Each test is repeated 20 times, so in total there are 100 runs (20 test runs * 5 tests on each fold) Accuracy is defined as number of correct predictions divided by number of records in a training data I do not know how to calculate average accuracy and its standard deviation: Should results from each fold be averaged and then the stdev calculated on 20 samples? or Should I calculate average and stdev on all 100 samples? Another question is should STDEV or STDEVP function be used to calculate standard deviation, they are defined as follows: STDEVP - Calculates standard deviation based on the entire population given as arguments. STDEV - Estimates standard deviation based on a sample.
