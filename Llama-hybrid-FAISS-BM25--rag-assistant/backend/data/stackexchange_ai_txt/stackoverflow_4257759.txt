Asp.net MVC Multiple (of the same) Partial Views on a page with tags inside Partial View

Looking for an elegant way of having scripts added once on a page and that's it. I have a partial view that requires 2 CSS files and 2 JS files. In most places, there is only need for 1 of the partial views. On a single page though, I need 3 of these same partial views, and each partial view has the 4 files, so I have 6 JS links and 6 CSS links. Quite ugly. I original idea was to use jQuery to see if the tags (by id) are existant on the page yet or not. If they aren't, then add them in. Otherwise, do nothing. This was going to be an inline script like.... function(){ var jQueryUICSS = $("#jQueryUICSS"); if(!jQueryUICSS){ document.write('link id="jQueryUICSS" href="/Content/smoothness/jquery-ui-1.8.5.custom.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />') } ...And so on for the other 3 tags. }; But, I'm not sure that will work (or will the lead dev accept it):P Any other ideas?
