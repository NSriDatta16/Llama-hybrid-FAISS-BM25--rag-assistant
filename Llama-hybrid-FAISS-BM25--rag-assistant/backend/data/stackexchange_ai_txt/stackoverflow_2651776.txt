Thread Management Object

I feel rather foolish as this is just a short question. I was reading about a bunch of thread management helper classes in .net, specifically one that aids the storage of threads to help a service manager object automatically invoke delegates onto the subscribing thread. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with creating dispatchers. Totally forgotten the name, can't find it :( Anyone know what I'm talking about?
