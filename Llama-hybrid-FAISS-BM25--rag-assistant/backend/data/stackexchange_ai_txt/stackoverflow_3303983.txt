Your average function is non-lazy -- it needs to realise the entire coll argument while holding onto its head. Update: Just realised that my original answer included a nonsensical suggestion as to how to solve the above problem... argh. Fortunately ataggart has since posted a correct solution. Other than that, your code does seem lazy at first glance, though the use of read-lines is currently discouraged (use line-seq instead). If the file is really large and your functions will be called a large number of times, type-hinting seq-iter in the argument vector of seq-length -- ^NameOfBiojavaSeqIterClass seq-iter , use #^ in place of ^ if you're on Clojure 1.1 -- might make a significant difference. In fact, (set! *warn-on-reflection* true) , then compile your code and add type hints to remove all reflection warnings.
