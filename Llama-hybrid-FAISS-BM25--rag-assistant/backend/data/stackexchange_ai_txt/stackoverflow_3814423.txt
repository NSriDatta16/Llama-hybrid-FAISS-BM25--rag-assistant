I've read The C++ Programming Language and Stroustrup doesn't use any kind of convention for naming members. He never needs to; there is not a single simple accessor/mutator, he has a way of creating very fine object-oriented designs so there's no need to have a method of the same name. He uses structs with public members whenever he needs simple data structures. His methods always seem to be operations . I've also read somewhere that he disencourages the use of names that differ only by one character.
