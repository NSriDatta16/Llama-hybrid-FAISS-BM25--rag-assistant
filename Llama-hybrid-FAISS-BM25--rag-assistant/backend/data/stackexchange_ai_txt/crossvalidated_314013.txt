Always remember that every machine learning problem is unique in itself. No two datasets can be the same. One model might give a better result on your performance measure on one problem but may give the worst result on some other problem. Since you mentioned that you need a $0/1$ prediction, you might want to play around with supervised learning algorithms. Some of the popular ones are K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks (or if you have enough computation resources you might also want to try out Deep Neural Networks). Visualize the data the data and find out if it is linearly separable on the given features. If yes, bingo! Otherwise, try out to project features in some high dimensional space and then apply the models.
