In your case, I'd use Java6 and Java DB (aka Derby). It's not that installing and using MySQL is complicated (its quite simple actually) but well, why would you do that if you already have a capable database? Having that said, to get started with JavaDB, have a look at the Java DB Reference , there are plenty of technical articles there. Pay a special attention to Working with the Java DB (Derby) Database - NetBeans IDE 6.5 Tutorial . For the data access itself, you could use the Java Persistence API (JPA) as in Creating a Custom Java Desktop Database Application . But I wouldn't do that for homework. Instead, I'd start with the basics i.e. with JDBC and do everything by hand. You mentioned it and I think its a good idea. Have a look at Tutorial: Java databasing with Derby, Java's own open source database , it might be very useful (I'm not saying the code shown there promotes all best practices but it's pretty simple and will get you started). Don't pollute your mind with advanced topics such as connection pooling, don't use frameworks like Hibernate, JPA or even Spring (these frameworks know how to do things, you don't and the point is not to learn using frameworks, at least not right now). Keep it simple and sexy but do it by hand.
