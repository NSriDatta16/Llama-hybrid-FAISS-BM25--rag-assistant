How to present results of time series forecasting

I'm doing some electricity load forecasting in which I've used 5 fold cross validation and have calculated MAPE for each split as follows: NIC 12.4070736159999 12.4381016317022 13.012084025233 12.8202279490414 13.0173158393873 QLD 11.1222557214741 11.2011253786453 11.0949104146992 11.0204844071916 10.9866043178404 SA 18.1933345652622 16.5824118552869 16.9662739986567 22.0912790309511 18.7201687363193 TAS 10.9283795353769 10.8375790347786 10.9969285266692 10.65564127531 10.830705163829 VIC 14.4304582955302 13.749822370597 14.185836762341 14.1723784565888 14.8015564381059 I want to show the results in my research paper but I don't know how to present the results. I want to know, other than showing MAPE for each folds what else is shown in the paper? (like standard deviations of the error, confidence interval etc)
