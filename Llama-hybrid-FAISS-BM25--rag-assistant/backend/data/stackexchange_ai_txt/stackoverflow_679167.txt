This article is very helpful because it shows the benefits of DataContractSerializer in contrast to XmlSerializer . This was the first article I used when learning about WCF and DataContractSerializer . Not to be disparaging but isn't a Google search the best way to get this kind of information? The most helpful and informative links will be on the first page as those will be the most linked and visited.
