I'm not quite sure what you're asking. I'll try showing you a couple of applications of t tests and the resulting P-values. In order to do a t test comparing two populations, you need to have data. Suppose you have $n = 100$ observations $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{100}$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=0.4, \sigma=0.05).$ Also $n = 100$ observations $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_{100}$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=0.3, \sigma=0.04).$ Data simulated using R: set.seed(915) x = rnorm(100, .4, .05); y = rnorm(100, .3, .04) all = c(x,y); gp = rep(1:2, each=100) stripchart(all ~ gp, ylim=c(.5,2.5), pch="|") In the plot below, it certainly looks as if the $X_i$'s (bottom) tend to be larger than the $Y_i$s. Then you could do a two-sample t test $H_0: \mu_x = \mu_y$ against $H_a: \mu_x > \mu_y$. Because we know the variances are not equal, we should do the Welch version of the t test. t.test(all ~ gp, alt="greater") # alternate equiv code: 't.test(x,y,alt="g")' Welch Two Sample t-test data: all by gp t = 17.153, df = 185.85, p-value In this particular case the P-value is $2.2 \times 10^{16},$ showing very strong evidence that the sample means $\bar X = 0.399$ is significantly larger than $\bar Y = 0.296.$ The exact P-value will depend on (a) the sample size and (b) the luck of the draw in taking the two samples from their respective distributions. You might want to know the average P-value for two samples each of size $n = 10.$ P-values will be larger for small samples. We could do a simulation to find out the the average P-value for many samples of size 20. pv = replicate(10^5, t.test(rnorm(10,.4,.05), rnorm(10,.3,.04),alt="g")$p.val) mean(pv); mean(pv Even with this smaller sample size, the average P-value is 0.0008, and such two-sample tests will reject $H_0$ 99.9% of the time. Without data or hypothesis testing, we can show that values of $X$ tend to be larger than values of $Y$ by plotting the CDFs of their respective distributions. If you had something else in mind, please edit your question to clarify. But remember that P-values refer to tests of hypotheses, and tests require data.
