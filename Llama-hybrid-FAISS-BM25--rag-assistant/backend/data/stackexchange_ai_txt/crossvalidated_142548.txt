You need to define more what you mean by 'similarity'. Does magnitude matter? Or only shape? If only shape matters, you'll want to normalize both time series by their max value ( so they are both from 0 to 1). If you are looking for a linear correlation, a simple pearson correlation will work fine - which essentially measures the covariance. There are other techniques, for instance, that could fit a line or polynomial to the time series (essentially smoothing it), and then comparing the smooth polynomials. If you are looking for periodic similarity (i.e. the time series has a certain sinusoidal component or seasonality), consider using a time series decomposition into the trend, and seasons components first. Or using something like FFT to compare the data in the frequency domain. Thats about all I know without more definition of what 'similar' should be. Hope it helps.
