Natural brute force algorithm is to build a list of all possible nodes taking into account each possible decision on every crossroad. I doubt that within 1km you would get more then 10 crossroads on average and assuming avg of 3 choices on a crossroad you would end up with 3^10 - around 59,049 end nodes (notice that you need to have 10 crossroads on every branch of the road to reach the full number). In reality the number would go down and I would assume getting to the same node by different route would not be uncommon, especially in cities. This approach would give you an exact answer (providing you have good street map as input). It is potential time, but the n does not seem to be that high, so it might be practical. Further improvements and optimizations might be possible depending on what do you need these nodes for (or which kind of scenarios you would consider similar enough to prune them).
