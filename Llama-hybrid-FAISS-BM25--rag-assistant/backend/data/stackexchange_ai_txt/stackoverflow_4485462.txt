Tabbar with same navigation controllers

I have implemented an navigation based view controller with several views and a model. Now I add my navigation controller to the Tabbar via interface builder. (just dragged the whole bunch into it). It worked, I have got a new tab with all my views in it. But now I want to add exactly the same navigation view controller again to another tab. I can also do this, the problem is, when I e.g. delete an entry in my table view, the entry is still visible in the other tab. So what I need a way to update my model when I switch the tabs. Update: I added the addObserver in my RootViewController containing the table view. I placed it in "view did load", the postNotification in my delete method. No compile Errors, but also the tables do not update each other. I uploaded my project, perhaps you could have a look?: http://www.perry-paul.de/unternehmenf.zip
