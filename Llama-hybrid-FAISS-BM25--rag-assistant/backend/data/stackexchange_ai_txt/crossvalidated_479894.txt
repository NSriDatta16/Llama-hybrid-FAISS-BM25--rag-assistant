You just need to do a frequency decomposition of your data. The fft command in $R$ should get you what you want. The more difficult question is how to address variations in that frequency to determine the "average" frequency -- since you might want to look at a range of frequencies together as representing one frequency with some minor variations, and you might want to ignore some higher frequencies as noise.
