Combining info from two population coverage levels from a tolerance interval

I have some existing product data from which I've calculated a tolerance interval with a 95% confidence level with at least 95% of population covered. I would like to use this tolerance interval as a specification for testing a new product to help understand both the safety and efficacy of the new product. Falling below the low-end of the tolerance interval could represent efficacy issues, while exceeding the high-end could represent safety issues (with the assumption that existing product is both safe and effective). I'm proposing to test new product, and calculate two tolerance intervals (both with 95% confidence level) from the resultant data: One with a 95% of population covered, and one with 99% of population covered. I would like to then compare the new product bottom value from the 95% population coverage interval to the existing product tolerance interval bottom value as an efficacy measure. I would then like to compare the new product top value from the 99% population coverage to the existing product tolerance interval top value as a safety measure. My thinking is that this will give me a reasonable indication that new product is both safe and effective while putting additional emphasis on staying away from potential safety issues. Is this a sound rationale and/or is there a better way to show that? Thanks, Ep
