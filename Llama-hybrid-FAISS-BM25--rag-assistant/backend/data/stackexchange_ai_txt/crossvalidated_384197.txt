How to handle unrelated input such as letters on a trained deep learning MNIST dataset

The MNIST dataset (usually trained with CNN) aims to recognize the following numbers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. So it is trained under the assumption that the input should be a number between 0 to 9. Thus by default there is 10 classes. This means that even if someone gives a totally unrelated input such as a picture containing an animal, a handwritten Chinese character or even a Latin handwritten letter from a-z the model will 'believe' that it is a number between 0 and 9 and will output the number with the highest probability score. So my question is how to make the model predict a 'unrelated' class? Should I create an extra 11th 'unrelated' class before to train my model? If yes how should I do. I can't imagine using all the existing pictures and handwritten symbols different than {0,...,9}... That sounds completely infeasible...
