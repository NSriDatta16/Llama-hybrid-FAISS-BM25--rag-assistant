What is signal dimension

Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing is a paper about sparse signal. I am just learning the concepts. In the first paragraph, it says that when the number of observation data samples $n$ is less than the signal dimension $p$, then the desired signal $x$ is sparse. I have never come across he term signal dimension. Can somebody please explain what is signal dimension ?
