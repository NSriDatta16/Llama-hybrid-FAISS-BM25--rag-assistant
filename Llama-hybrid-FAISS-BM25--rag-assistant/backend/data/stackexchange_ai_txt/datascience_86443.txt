Comparing youtube view counts between historical release dates

I've written a script to use youtube-dl to collect all view-counts and ratings from all listed videos on a youtube channel: https://gist.github.com/philshem/ca0b8f964458c63ee4f0e68c0f700f39#file-get_stats-sh To compare ratings is relatively simple, because they are already averaged. But I would like to compare views, which is not clear to me because the number of views is related to how recently the video was released. I am looking for a metric that normalizes somehow the age of the video with the number of views. I could do something simple, such as view_count * days_since_release , but I don't expect that to be statistically meaningful. Is there an example metric for comparing historical, cumulative data? https://twitter.com/philshem/status/1295725069268910081
