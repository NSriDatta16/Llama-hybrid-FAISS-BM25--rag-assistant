How to test if 2 means are significantly different for non-normal non-paired data

I have 4 averages from 4 samples and I want to test if the means are significantly different. When I look at the QQ plots and the shapiro wilk test (all have very low p values) the data is not normal so I was thinking of using the WIlcoxon signed rank test but that seems to be for "matched pair samples". My data is not paired. They are 4 independent samples. What tests can I use to test if the means are significantly different from each other? Thank you.
