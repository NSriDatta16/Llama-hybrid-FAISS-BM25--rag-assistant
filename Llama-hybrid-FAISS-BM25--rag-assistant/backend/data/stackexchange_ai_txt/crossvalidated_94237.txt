AR(1) on autocorrelated data that is not a time-series

I need to apply a regression model on observations that is not time series data but each observation presents a store and the amount of cartons that gets sent to that store. For instance a_i = number of cartons sent to store i and is my dependent variable. Each carton contains products of different kinds and my independent variables is the number of units for a certain product for each observation. Thus x_ij = number of units of product j sent to store i . So essentially i need to forecast the number of cartons given the amount of units of each product that needs to go to a store. The problem i have is that the data is autocorrelated, where smaller carton forecast tend to have bigger errors and larger carton forecast smaller errors. I would like to use AR(1) to transform the data with the following formula, Y_t - pY_(t-1) = B_0(1-p) + B_1(X_t - pX_(t-1)) My model will have more than one independent variable, but it is correct of me to first sort the data ascending according to the dependent variable a_i before applying the above formula as i does not represent time but rather a store?
