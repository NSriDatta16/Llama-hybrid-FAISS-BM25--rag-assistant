Several Terracotta users have built systems like this in the past, so I can you tell you by proof of existence that it can be done. :) Compass does have support for clustering with Terracotta so that might help you. I suspect you might get further faster by just being careful with how you create your clustered data structures. Regarding your requirements and Terracotta: 1) 10k objects is quite small from a Terracotta perspective 2) 5 sec update rate doesn't seem like an issue. Might depend how many nodes there are and whether there is any natural partitioning you can take advantage of. All updates will be persistent. 3) 1-5 second query time seems quite easy. Building your own well-organized data structures for lookup is the tricky part. Obviously you want to avoid scanning all the data. 4) Terracotta currently supports Glassfish v1 and v2. If you post on the Terracotta forums , you could probably get more Terracotta eyeballs on the problem.
