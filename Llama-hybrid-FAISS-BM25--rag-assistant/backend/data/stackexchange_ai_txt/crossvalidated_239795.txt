I've real world data of withdrawals on policies, as you can see in the image below, max withdrawals are done during great recession (2008-2010). we must treat this as outliers, right ? what is the best approach in this case, if want to use this data for simple Machine learning task to predict the probability of partial withdrawal on policy ?
