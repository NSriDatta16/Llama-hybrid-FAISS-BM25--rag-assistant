How to properly present data set with categorical, numeric and time series data?

I have a following toy dataset example with target variable repair_type id | car | mileage | repair_type | sex | age 1 | Honda | 12000 | engine | 1 | 50 1 | Honda | 12000 | suspension | 1 | 50 1 | Honda | 15000 | brakes | 1 | 50 Basically the dataset represents that some customer with id 1 at mileage 12000 repaired engine and suspension. After a while he returned and at mileage 15000 repaired brakes. I cleary understand that mileage and repair_type should thread as time series data . Also i have a categorical and numeric variables. Should i recombine a dataset? Should every records of customer be transposed as a single record ? In that case, with mixed time of data, what ml algoritm should i try to predict repair_type
