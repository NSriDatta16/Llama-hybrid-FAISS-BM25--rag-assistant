You can solve the two problems by first loading the arrays from the files files into a list of arrays, and then using concatenate to join all the arrays. Something like this: x = [] # a normal python list, not np.array y = [...some list of files...] for file in y: ncfile = netcdf_file(file,'r') xFragment = ncfile.variables["varname"][:] ncfile.close() x.append(xFragment) combined_array = concatenate(x, axis=0)
