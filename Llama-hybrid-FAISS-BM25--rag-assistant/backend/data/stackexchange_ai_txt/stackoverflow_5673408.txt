Send JQuery DOM Object as XML to server

After searching Google for hours, I'm still stuck with this problem. Hope you guys can help me out. I am building an application that lets user design their pages for a photo album. It first loads the standard format for each page using an XML. The XML is loaded through an AJAX call using JQuery as in: $.get('http://www.domain.com/ajaxcall.php', function(responseXML) { $xmlDoc= $(responseXML); )} The XML file is now loaded as an object, and I can perform JQuery methods on it, which reduces the amount of code for me. Editing from the user side is saved in the $xmlDoc. So when a user drags a photo over the page, the new cordinates are saved as an attribute of that photo. After all the user editing has been done, I want to export the new XML and save it to the server. This is where my problem starts. Since I've loaded the XML as a JQuery object (by using $(responseXML)), I can not export it as an XML file anymore. I've checked this by calling $.isXMLDoc($xmlDoc), which responds with false. Since it was so easy to convert the XML to an object, I guess there must be a way to do the other way around. Any ideas on this? XML from original file: test
