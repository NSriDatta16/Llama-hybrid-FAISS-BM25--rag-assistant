Are you familiar with the Lasso, Elastic Net and similar regularization techniques? The Lasso specifically is used in regression with many regressors to yield a result where "many" cofficients are zero, which looks like what you are aiming for. It looks like there is some interest out there in applying the Lasso and similar concepts to ARMA models. See, e.g., here or or here . I would recommend that you look into regularization and google for terms like " regularization technique time series technique ".
