Time (timestep) is a concept from Markov Decision Processes. It is the way how the evolution of an MDP is indexed. For example, steps in a game. Episode is a concept from Markov Decision Processes. It is a run of given MDP with a given policy. For example, when the game is over. In your code, you restrict the length of your episode to 500 timesteps. Epoch is a concept from Deep Learning. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch/ The fact that epochs=1 in your code means that an update of the weights happens with the given data set only once. From the RL context, it makes sense because of an online nature of your learning.
