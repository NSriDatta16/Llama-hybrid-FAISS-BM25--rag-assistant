Multiple T Tests

On one of my questionnaires, which measure learning behaviours, after PCA, I have 4 subgroups, Efficacy/Perseverance/Effort/Achievement - I have run a T-Test and I have 4 sets of data comparing my samples of Undergrads to Graduates - Is it appropriate to only use T Test to report the results. Similar with my next questionnaire...Approaches to learning - 3 subgroups, Deep/Surface/Strategic - T Test with 3 results for each. This would mean that I would so far report 7 sets of T Test results? (+ 1 questionnaire with no subgroups)(So 8 altogether) This has been edited to give a little more information
