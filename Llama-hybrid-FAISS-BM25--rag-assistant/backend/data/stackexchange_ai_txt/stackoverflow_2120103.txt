I think I've figured out what I want to do. For some reason even on my high res devices the DPI still shows up as 96 according to the WinForms API so the auto scaling isn't doing anything. Instead, if I manually call Scale on my controls I get them to scale out exactly how I want. Now, this doesn't completely solve my problem in scenarios where I don't want to do any scaling but I do want to reorganize my controls if the screen is in the opposite aspect ratio than what I originally designed for. For that case, I think I'm going to look at using different layout panels (e.g. FlowLayoutPanel and TableLayoutPanel ) to hopefully organize the controls appropriately. Hopefully this will help any future Googler...
