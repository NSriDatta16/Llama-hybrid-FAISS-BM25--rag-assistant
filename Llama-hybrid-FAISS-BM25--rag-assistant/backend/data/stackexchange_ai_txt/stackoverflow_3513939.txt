Can't add Google Plugin for Eclipse to Eclipse for Java EE developers (Helios edition)?

I just installed Eclipse Helios (Java EE edition) and tried to install the Google App Engine plugin for Eclipse. I get the following error: Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found. Software being installed: Google Plugin for Eclipse 3.5 1.3.3.v201006111302 (com.google.gdt.eclipse.suite.e35.feature.feature.group 1.3.3.v201006111302) Missing requirement: Google Plugin for Eclipse 3.5 1.3.3.v201006111302 (com.google.gdt.eclipse.suite.e35.feature.feature.group 1.3.3.v201006111302) requires 'org.eclipse.platform.feature.group [3.5.0,3.6.0)' but it could not be found Is it only possible to add the plugin to Ganymede - not Helios?
