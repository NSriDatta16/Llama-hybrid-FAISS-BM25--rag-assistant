Ordinal logistic regression (polr in R): DV wrong level order

I am (trying) to conduct an ordinal logistic regression for the first time using the polr function in r. I seem to be encountering a problem with the order of my levels of my DV. My DV should have four ordered levels: 'no problems', 'low risk', 'moderate risk', and 'problem'. I think that we have coded it in this order: mutate(pgsi_label = factor(t2_pgsi_cat, levels = c("non_prob", "low_risk", "mod_risk", "prob_gamb"), ordered=TRUE, labels = c("Non-problem gambling", "Low-risk gambling", "Moderate risk gambling", "Problem gambling"))) %>% When I run the analyses, the intercepts seem to indicate to me that the categories are being entered in the wrong order: # regression model fit I assume the intercepts should read: non_prob|low_risk low_risk|mod_risk mod_risk|prob_gamb Any ideas if this is an error and what might be the source + solution? Thanks!
