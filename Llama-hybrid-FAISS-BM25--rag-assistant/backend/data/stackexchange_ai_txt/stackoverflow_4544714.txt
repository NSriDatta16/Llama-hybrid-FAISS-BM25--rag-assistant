as RageD said, it's a big difference in networking between different types of games. A FPS server typically sends complete game state to all clients regularly (e.g. 60Hz) over UDP. Other game types can use TCP (tuned a bit like TCP_NODELAY and forcing immediate ACK packets) or reliable UDP (raknet lib or others). Network protocol can become really wide so you'll need to think how to make it easily extendable.
