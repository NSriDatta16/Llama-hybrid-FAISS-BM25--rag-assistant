How about: select contentID, title, created from content where created This sticks closer to the question. 21 days is fine, obviously means the same, but I find that it's good to use the terminology used in the question. For example... a while back I was asked to survey an average of 1 in 50 visitors to a site. I described this as a proportion of 0.02, and the client wasn't happy. I pointed out to the client that they're the same, but I learned my lesson, and now if I change the way that something is described, I make sure I comment to that effect, and preferably don't change it in the first place. If the client wants 3 weeks, do it as 3 weeks, not 21 days.
