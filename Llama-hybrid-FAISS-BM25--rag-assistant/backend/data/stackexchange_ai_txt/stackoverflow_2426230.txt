Merging elements in a scala list

I'm trying to port the following Java snippet to Scala. It takes a list of MyColor objects and merges all of the ones that are within a delta of each other. It seems like a problem that could be solved elegantly using some of Scala's functional bits. Any tips? List mergedColors = ...; MyColor lastColor = null; for(Color aColor : lotsOfColors) { if(lastColor != null) { if(lastColor.diff(aColor)
