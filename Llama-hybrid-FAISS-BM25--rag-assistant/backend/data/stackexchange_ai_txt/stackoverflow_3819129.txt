When I find it difficult to pick a meaningful name, it alerts me that the class is too big or I don't really understand the domain of whatever I'm coding. When you do finally come up with a good design addressing the concerns brought up by Uncle Bob in Clean Code regarding concepts like appropriate abstraction , single responsibility principle and whatnot, then the names become easier to pick. Difficulty picking names is almost always a sign that the logic's organization still needs work. After all, the compiler doesn't care how well or poorly your logic is organized. Organization is there only to help manage complexity and the sanity of your fellpw developers.
