ANCOVA simply means they used another variable (covariate) to adjust their ANOVA model, similar to an example that incorporates age (covariate) into an ANOVA model for systolic blood pressure = Drug treatment (placebo, treated) and gender, since SBP correlates with age. It would be useful to know if the main effect, i.e., drug teatment in this example, was significant and that it's coefficient was negative, meaning it reduced SBP, and it was significant (p-value less than 0.05). As you know, if a drug is effective for treating hypertension, it would lower SBP (so a negative drug coefficient). In any ANOVA, ANCOVA, or regression mode, what's important is sign of the coeff (+/-) (i.e. did drug elevate or reduce SBP) magnitude of coeff (how large of a mean change, if it's 0.0001 $\rightarrow$ "so what") p-value for coeff. Next comes the p-value for the overall F-test, which portrays whether all the coefficients are significant (except the Constant term, or y-intcp). So yes, the p-value for the F-test can be significant, but it may not be if the other "adjusting variables" or the covariate is not. But the main effect (main experimental variable) should be significant. Whenever you add variables to models, coefficients and p-values for variables often change, and this is usually addressed in the off-topic called "effect modification vs. confounding." In other words, the covariate mentioned in the manuscript could be an effect modifier or a confounder, which is not what you're asking -- but I wanted to raise this issue since modeling always drags you deeper into the "rabbit hole" of model-building complexity. FYI - I never call anything being reviewed a "paper," until it's accepted. Before they are accepted, and during review, they should be called "manuscripts."
