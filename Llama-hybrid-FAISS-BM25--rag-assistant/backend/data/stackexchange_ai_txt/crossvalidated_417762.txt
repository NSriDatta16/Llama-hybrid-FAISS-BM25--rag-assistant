Are there any problems with using an average of percentages for a 2 proportion z-test?

Let's say I have a 2 groups of test scores (ranging from 0% to 100%), and I wanted to compare their means to see if there was anything significant. I know I can average the test scores to obtain a proportion for each sample. Can I safely use a 2 proportion z-test for this scenario? From my understanding, the 2 proportion z-test is used for dichotomous data, and treating each result as a success/failure, and taking the average based off of that. What I am doing instead is counting each individual as a sample value from 0.0 to 1.0. I'm not sure if that is acceptable or not.
