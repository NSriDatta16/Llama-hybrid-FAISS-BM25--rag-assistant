From scikit-learn documentation: The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time scales at least quadratically with the number of samples and may be impractical beyond tens of thousands of samples . For large datasets consider using sklearn.linear_model.LinearSVC or sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier instead, possibly after a sklearn.kernel_approximation.Nystroem transformer. Yo can change clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear').fit(X_train, y_train.ravel()) by from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC clf = LinearSVC(random_state=0, tol=1e-5) clf.fit(X_train, y_train.ravel())
