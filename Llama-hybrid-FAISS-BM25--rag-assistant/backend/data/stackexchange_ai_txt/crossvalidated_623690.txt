Normalization of Time Series for GARCH

It is generally observed that financial times series is not normally distributed. So I want to clear the following doubts: Is it necessary to normalize time series data especially before proceeding with models such as GARCH? If the time series is stationary is it still necessary to normalize it? How to normalize it?
