This $transactionID = (isset($authNetCodes[4])) ? $authNetCodes[4] : 0; Can be read as if (isset($authNetCodes[4])) { $transactionID = $authNetCodes[4]; } else { $transactionID = 0; } Similarly, this $transactionMessage = (isset($authNetCodes[3])) ? $authNetCodes[3] : ""; can be read as if((isset($authNetCodes[3]))) { $transactionMessage = $authNetCodes[3]; } else { $transactionMessage = ""; } In plain english, both code fragments are saying "if this array element is set, assign the value of that array element to this variable, otherwise assign some other values (0 and and empty string). The ? : construct is called a ternary operator.
