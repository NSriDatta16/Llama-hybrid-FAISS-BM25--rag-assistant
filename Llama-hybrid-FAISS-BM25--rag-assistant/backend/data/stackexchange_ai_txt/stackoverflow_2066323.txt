Rails form helpers only work if you are working on one object at a time. If you want to update attributes of other records at the same time, you need to use text_field_tag for those fields, and include custom logic in the controller for interpreting/saving that data. IMHO, this is far from best practice. Alternate solutions include using AJAX inline-editing, or if the idea is to be able to associate organizers with events when editing, to use a select field. However, if organizers are so closely tied to events in your domain that you would want to edit their fields at the same time, why not just have organizer_name on your event object? At least, that would be my instinct without knowing more about your object model.
