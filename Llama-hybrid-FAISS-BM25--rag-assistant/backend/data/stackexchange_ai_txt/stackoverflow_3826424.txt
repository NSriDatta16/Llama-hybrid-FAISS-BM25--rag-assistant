You are correct that this is not a trivial job. There are differences between different javacards, but generally you need to do 4 things: initialize secure communications with the card (because many javacards are "global platform" cards they require a secure channel) send a command saying "i wanna install an applet" send the binary data for the applet to be installed send a command to "instantiate" the applet after the binary data is sent I'd recommend using the eclipse plugin to install the applet initially, because you can see the APDUs generated by the plugin to do the steps above. Once you know the APDU commands you must send to install your applet, you can directly send these commands using the PCSC interface from your C++ code to automate installation on a large number of cards. My company makes a web browser plugin called Card Boss for doing this kind of thing (card communications via pcsc) from a browser - there's a web page you can use where you can type your own APDUs and send them to the card at the follwing URL: https://cardboss.cometway.com/content.agent?page_name=Card+Boss+Lab If you use our tool, your applet installation script should look something like this (note that this is a script for a JCOP card using the default jcop keys) MESSAGE BOX Installing applets...
