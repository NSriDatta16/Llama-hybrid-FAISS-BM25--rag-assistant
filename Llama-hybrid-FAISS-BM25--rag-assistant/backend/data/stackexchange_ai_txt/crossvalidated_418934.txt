I'd recommend just using the continuous body fat values instead of binning them into groups. That allows you to avoid any problems with different classification thresholds, and also uses all the information you have (information is thrown out when you bin continuous data). Then you can do a logistic regression with body fat , sex and age as predictors, with appropriate interaction terms.
