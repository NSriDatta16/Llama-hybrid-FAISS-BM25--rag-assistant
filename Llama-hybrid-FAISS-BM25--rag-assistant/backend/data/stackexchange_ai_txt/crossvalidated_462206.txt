Comment: Here is a figure to go with the Answer of @DemitriPananos (+1): The blue curve is for the population density $X\sim\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=140,\sigma=8).$ The maroon curve is for the distribution of $\bar X,$ the average for $n = 49$ hot dogs: $$\bar X \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu_{\bar X} = 140, \sigma_{\bar X} = 8/7).$$ This curve is 1/7th as 'wide" as the population curve, so in order to enclose area $1,$ it must be 7 times as tall. The area you seek is the (tiny) area under the maroon curve to the right of the vertical black line: $P(\bar X > 45) = 1 - P(\bar X \le 45) \approx 0,$ computed in R statistical software where pnorm is a normal CDF. 1 - pnorm(145, 140, 8/7) [1] 6.071624e-06
