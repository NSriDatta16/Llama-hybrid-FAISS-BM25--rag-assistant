it depends a lot on the video technology you use. Quicktime clips, for example, have a clear and easily manipulable distinction between media (data) and 'movie' (metadata). Long ago, you could open a clip in 'simplemovie' (the video equivalent of notepad :-) ), select the part you want, copy, new (empty) file, paste, save, and pick "with references". The result was a very small file that contained no media but was absolutely valid movie file for every purpose, as long as the 'big' file was still around. I'm sure SMIL has a similar capability; but who implements that? As for other containers, i have no idea. I guess your best bet is to check the API of the player you're embedding in your webpage. It probably has some parameters to specify new 'beginning' and 'end' points. With some luck, it could even make it seem as the sub-clip is all there is.
