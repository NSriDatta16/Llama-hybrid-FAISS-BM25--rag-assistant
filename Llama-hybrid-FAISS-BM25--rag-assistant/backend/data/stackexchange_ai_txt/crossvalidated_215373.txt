While you use the same notation $\beta_1$ in both models, the parameters $\beta_1^1$ for the first model and $\beta_1^2$ for the second model are different parameters and hence cannot be compared in a Bayesian manner. (Take for instance the extreme case when $X_2=X_1$.) The models can be compared by a Bayes factor, for instance, but this is another issue.
