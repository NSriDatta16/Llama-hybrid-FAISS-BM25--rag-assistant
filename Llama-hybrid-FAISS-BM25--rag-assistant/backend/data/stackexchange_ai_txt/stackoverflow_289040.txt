Do keep in mind that you don't need a stable sort if you compare all members. The 2.0 solution, as requested, can look like this: public void SortList() { MyList.Sort(delegate(MyClass a, MyClass b) { int xdiff = a.x.CompareTo(b.x); if (xdiff != 0) return xdiff; else return a.y.CompareTo(b.y); }); } Do note that this 2.0 solution is still preferable over the popular 3.5 Linq solution, it performs an in-place sort and does not have the O(n) storage requirement of the Linq approach. Unless you prefer the original List object to be untouched of course.
