Help for planning a neuroscience experiment

I'm new here. I am planning a neuroscience experiment. I will be measuring brain signals from about twenty subjects. I will present the subjects four different kinds of stimuli. After all the data processing, I will have four power spectrums for each participant (one per stimulus type). That is, I will see the magnitude (power) of each frequency (something like this but calculated from the brain data). There is also a fifth stimulus type, which is rest (no stimulus; used as as control measure or "baseline" in neuroscience jargon). From each of the power spectrums, I will pick two frequency bands and calculate the average power in each band. The first band is 8-12 Hz ("alpha" in neuroscience jargon) and the other 16-22 Hz ("beta" in neuroscience jargon). I am expecting to observe four phenomena: For stimulus type 1, alpha is larger than beta. Both are larger than baseline. For stimulus type 2, beta is larger than alpha. Both are larger than baseline. For stimulus type 3, alpha is larger than baseline activity. Beta is equal to baseline. For stimulus type 4, beta is larger than baseline activity. Alpha is equal to baseline. How should I do my statistical tests? Is my experimental design sufficient? Note that the power of beta is always less than the power alpha in the rest state. I am asking this because our field appears to have some problems regarding the rigour of statistical analyses (see e.g. http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n9/full/nn.2886.html ).
