I think this article sums it up. Basically, machine comes from machine learning , a term that was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, way before the final developments that led to the soft marging kernel SVM in the 90's and the Boltzmann Machines in the 80's. Vapnik and Lerner called their algorithm the Generalized Portrait algorithm back in 1963, see more here . A machine in this context would be the output function, or as the article puts for historical reasons, the hypothesis , built from the learned parameters.
