I won't reiterate the good information ak1123578 gave. However the COM API is actually older than the JS API, and is on its way out. See here for some history and announcement: Sunset for the Google Earth COM API Today weâ€™re announcing that the Google Earth 5.2 client will be the last version that supports the COM API. Earth 5.2 and older clients will continue to support the COM API while these versions are supported. Future releases will no longer have COM API bindings. We believe that the JavaScript API provides the best mechanism for reaching the most developers. Note that you may be able to use the JS API for a desktop app by embedding a web browser component in your app. See these two threads for some hints about that.
