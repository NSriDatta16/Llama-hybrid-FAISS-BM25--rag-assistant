From no code changes to more modifications: 1. try to shorten the names of your resources 2. split your dll into multiple ones with a smaller number of resources (good way to organize them by nature or subject) 3. combine your image resources into multi-images strips (works well for icons, glyphs, etc... when the size is the same)
