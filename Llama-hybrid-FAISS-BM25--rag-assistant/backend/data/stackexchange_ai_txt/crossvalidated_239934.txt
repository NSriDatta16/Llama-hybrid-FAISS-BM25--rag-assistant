How to get a convinced outcome from Random Forest classification

I use Python to run a RandomForestRegressor on my dataset. It usually happened that every set of result (estimators, feature importance, ROC score, accuracy score etc.) from a single run is different from others. Let's set apart the issue of parameter tuning, how can I get the convinced outcome from various running output? Do I choose the one with highest ROC score? To be generalize the question, how to identify the best result from algorithms which give varying outcome from different iteration of running? Thanks
