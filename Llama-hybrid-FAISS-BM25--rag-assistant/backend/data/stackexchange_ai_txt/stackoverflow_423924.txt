How to get Hibernate session inside a Hibernate Interceptor?

How to get Hibernate session inside a Hibernate Interceptor? I'm trying to use Hibernate to enforce data access by organization id transparently. I have set a global Filter to filter all queries by organization id. Now, I need to use an Entity interceptor to set Organizational Id on all Entities before Save/Update. The organization id comes from HttpSession I've set Organizational Id as a Filter property in Hibernate session which i want to retrieve inside my interceptor and use for all Inserts and Updates as well. The problem is i dont seem to have access to Session inside the Interceptor. Any workarounds for this?
