Calculate it this way: size of file (in KB) / elapsed time (in sec). That gives you KB per second (KB/s). It's a bit different than kbps, but I think it's more useful to the average user. Be sure to use a large enough file. Something large enough where you're pretty sure the elapsed time will be at least a few (3-5 maybe) seconds.
