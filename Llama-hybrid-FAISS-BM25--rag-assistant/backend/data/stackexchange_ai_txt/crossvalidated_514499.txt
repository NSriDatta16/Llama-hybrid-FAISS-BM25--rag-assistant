I work for a large airline in the revenue and pricing area where we forecast revenue and bookings and other things. We tried 2 approaches. One was effectively scaling from pre-covid data. We tried predicting a lower quantile instead of the mean and having a dynamic scaling factor from 2019. This worked ok. What has worked best for me is just dropping all the pre-covid data and starting from around May. We add in a feature of 'days since the massive covid drop' and that's been very effective. Since airline revenues dropped by > 90% in some cases when covid started we basically had no ability to adjust since everything was wiped out. Plus there were so many last minute schedule changes and policies that we struggled to incorporate those quickly enough. Our current accuracy is near where it was pre-covid for many models but it varies depending on the approach and problem type. For the very beginning of covid when we had no data or idea what was happening, I actually just built a Markov Chain model showing how erratic bookings and cancellations were when our directors were asking for forecasts. It opened their eyes to the amount of uncertainty and variance that was present in the pre and post covid environment.
