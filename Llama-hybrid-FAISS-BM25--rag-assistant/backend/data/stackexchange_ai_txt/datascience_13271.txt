Neural network with fixed weights in Python lasagne

I am trying to train a neural network with the lasagne module in Python. I do not want a fully connected network as defined by lasagne.layers.DenseLayer. Instead, I would like to fix some of the weight parameters to zero. Does anyone know how to do this? The closest solution I have found is something like: params = lasagne.layers.get_all_params(network, trainable=True) layer1.params[layer1.W].remove("trainable") However, this fixes the entire set of weight parameters to their initial values. How can I fix only a subset of these weights?
