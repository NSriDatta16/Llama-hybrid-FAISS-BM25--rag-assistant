Your understanding is only half correct. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique that finds underlying patterns in data to reduce the number of features in a dataset. It does not make predictions; rather, it generates new dimensions from existing data for further analysis or visualization. PCA can be reversed (or "back-transformed") to reconstruct the original data, but this does not imply predicting a new point in the PCA space. To do so, you would need to use a supervised learning algorithm, such as a regression model trained on the PCA-transformed data, predict a new point (in the PC space), and then use the inverse transform to project the predicted principal components to the original space. I'm not as familiar with UMAP, but it appears to be similar in that it can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset and then inverted to reconstruct the original data. This is not, once again, the same as making a prediction. I hope this helps!
