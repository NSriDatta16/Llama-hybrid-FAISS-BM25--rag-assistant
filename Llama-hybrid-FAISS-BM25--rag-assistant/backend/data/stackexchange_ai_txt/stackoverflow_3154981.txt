installing Opencv on mac os x 10.6 for use with Xcode 3.2.2 project

I am trying to install OpenCV on my Mac (OS X v10.6.3) for use with an Xcode (v 3.2.2) project. I have downloaded the current OpenCV tar ball from SourceForge, and am following these installation instructions: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port (scroll down to the section called Using the OpenCV libraries in an Xcode OS X project). Unfortunately, the instructions were written for Xcode 3.1.1 and so there are some differences between that version and 3.2.2. So I have a couple of questions about the installation, which I hope someone who has been down this road before can answer for me... First, The 7th - 10th bullet points say to add a new Group to the Project and include some specific files from /usr/local/lib (libcxcore.dylib, libcvaux.dylib, libcv.dylib, libhighgui.dylib, and libml.dylib). I cannot find any such path on my mac. And I cannot find the files via Finder, either. Any idea where to look for them? Second, Way back up on the first bullet point it had me create a new Xcode project using the Command Line Utility template. There was, however, no mention of which "type" to select (C, C++, Foundation, Core Data, etc.). I chose C, but would like to know if this is correct? Thanks for any help.
