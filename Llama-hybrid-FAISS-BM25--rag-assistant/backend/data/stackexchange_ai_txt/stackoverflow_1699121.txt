Now hold on. You state that a manager might be assigned to ALL the customers? A manager might be responsible for a hundred million customers? Honestly, it sounds like something's wrong there. If you have a simple manager customer relationship as described, then the design you described (a many-to-many linking table) is correct. But if you really want to be able to link ALL the customers to several of the managers, I'm guessing that there's a hierarchy of managers that you haven't told us about â€” that is, a manager can manage other managers, who can manage other managers, who then manage customers (with additional levels possible and direct management of customers mixed in with management of managers at any level). You see this kind of structure in multi-level marketing organizations and also in commission systems in certain industries (I just happened to come across it in insurance the other day). If that's the case, you need to express the relationship among the managers separately (either with a self-referential column in the managers table, if there's only one direct parent manager possible for each manager, or a separate table if it's many to many) and only link the customers to their ultimate, direct manager.
