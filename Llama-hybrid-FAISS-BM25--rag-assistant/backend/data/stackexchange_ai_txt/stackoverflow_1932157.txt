iPhone Optimal Stack Data Storage

I have a set of data that I need accessible insdie my iPhone app. The data is constant and currently in a simple CSV format. One of the columns could easily be used as a key in a dictionary but what is the most efficient way to have this const data accessible inside the app? I'm thinking instantiating and populating a NSDictionary at launch is not optimal.
