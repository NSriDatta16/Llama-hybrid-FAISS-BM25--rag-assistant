I strongly believe that you should never reduce your code readability and good design because of performance optimizations. If you are writing code where performance is critical it may be OK to lower the style and clarity of your code, but this does not hold true for the average enterprise application. Hardware evolves quickly and gets cheaper everyday. In the end you are writing code that is going to be read by other developers, so you'd better do a good job at it! It's always beautiful to read code that has been carefully crafted , where every path has a test that helps you understand how it should be used. I don't really care if it is 50 ms slower than the spaghetti alternative which does lots of crazy stuff.
