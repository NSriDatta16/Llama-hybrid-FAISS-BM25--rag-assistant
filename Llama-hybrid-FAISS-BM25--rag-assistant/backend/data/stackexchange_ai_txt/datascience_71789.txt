Thematic clustering of text

Please advise on starting points, research (papers,frameworks) related to thematic clustering of text. In particular on a system with two levels of clustering where second level has a temporal nature. Thanks! Update: Sorry for ambiguity in my initial question. I need to clarify, that I have experience with clustering in general and document clustering in particular, for text using TFIDF, word embeddings (word2vec, Glove and BERT Sentence embeddings) in a vector space. My question originates from some text mentioning "two levels of thematic clustering of text where second level has a temporal nature". Just wanted to know about this technique and in particular "temporal nature" used in clustering.
