The standard says it allocates storage for up to n elements. In other words, your example might return a buffer big enough for 5 objects only. It does seem pretty difficult to imagine a good use case for this though. Perhaps if you're working on a very memory-constrained platform, it's a convenient way to get "as much memory as possible". But on such a constrained platform, I'd imagine you'd bypass the memory allocator as much as possible, and use a memory pool or something you have full control over.
