Architecture-wise, yes, it's a special case of neural net. A logistic regression model can be constructed via neural network libraries. In the end, both have neurons having the same computations if the same activation and loss is chosen. This makes it a special NN, but since logistic regression is the simplest model, it's possible to train it using second-order methods, e.g. newton . Second order methods use Hessian matrix, in addition to gradients. But, this computation is not efficient for larger NNs and libraries prefer to use gradient descent alternatives or quasi-newton methods, that are either entirely first-order or approximate second-order methods. So, the slight difference lies in the possible optimisers , though this doesn't mean you'll get different solutions due to convexity properties of the problem (at least numerically).
