Why is K-fold cross validation bad for time series?

If you are about to answer "because k-fold incorporates future information", I'm going to challenge you on that answer :) If my time series exhibits some pattern (e.g. annual seasonality), that pattern must obviously occur every year, in the past and in the future. For example, if some summer seasonality appears in the 2017 data, it should also appear in 2010, or in 2007, etc. Otherwise it's not really a pattern! But if seasonality appears every year, then training the Model on chunks of future data and validating the Model on chunks of past data, should be fine as well. So cross-validation rocks on time series too, right?
