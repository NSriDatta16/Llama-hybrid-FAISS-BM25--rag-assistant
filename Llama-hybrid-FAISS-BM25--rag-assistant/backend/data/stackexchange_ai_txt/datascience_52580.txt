How can I train a many-to-one RNN with an array of 2D matrices?

I have eye tracking data for every word of a novel. Features for every word is given separately. I want to take groups of 100 words to make a sample and then use each of these samples as a single training instance (instead of a single word). My samples are 2D matrices of shape (no. of words, features). How can I train my many-to-one RNN with these samples?
