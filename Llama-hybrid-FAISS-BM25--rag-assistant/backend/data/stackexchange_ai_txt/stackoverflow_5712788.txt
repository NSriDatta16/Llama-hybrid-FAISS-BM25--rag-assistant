Problem with FilesMatch not matching correctly

We are having an issue with FilesMatch , it does not seem to be matching some file types. We are using the FilesMatch directive to allow me to add custom headers using mod_headers , config file details snippit below: Header set Last-Modified "Mon, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT" Header set Expires "Mon, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT" Header set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0" Header set Pragma "no-cache" We are using mod_jk to pass connections to Tomcat and the Struts to rename the files to .dept & .list ,etc. The issue appears to be with matching the text/html , as files that are being served as files with .png (used in the regex match for sanity check) are matching fine. Is there a specific file extension that I should be trying to match in Apache when the files are being renamed with Struts?
