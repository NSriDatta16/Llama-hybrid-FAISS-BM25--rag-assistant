Many time series methods consider the time series to have 4 components. Seasonality and error (which should be random) you mentioned are two of those four, but also the level and the trend. So it would not be reduced to just randomness. That being said, there are some methods that want your time series to be "stationary", which would mean it only has a level and random error. The seasonality and/or trend would be removed through transformation. That doesn't mean it does not have seasonality, it just means that the time series is to undergo a transformation before modeling (there are many types of transformations, google "Box-Cox transformations"). With exponential smoothing there are some methods that are used for series that do not have seasonality (eg, simple exponential smoothing). Exponential smoothing can handle seasonality: it just would not be that specification.
