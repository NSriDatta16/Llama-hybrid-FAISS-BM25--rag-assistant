If you are only looking for a way to organize your files, then you can create a folder for each sub-project. This way you'll be able to get to the content of app_code and maintain a level of separation with very little rework. If you are looking for the best way to do this, then refactoring your code to have a common Class Library based on what is reusable in the app_code folder and multiple, separate projects that reference that library is the way to go. You may run into problem refactoring the code this way, including not being able to reference profile or user information directly. You are now going from the Web Site to Web Application paradigm. http://www.codersbarn.com/post/2008/06/ASPNET-Web-Site-versus-Web-Application-Project.aspx
