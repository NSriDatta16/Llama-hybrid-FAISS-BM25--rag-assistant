I think you downplayed too much about GA. GA is still used actually in machine learning although not as widespread. You can see some implementation by code bullet and a more academic one for example . One of the issue with GA is it is most of the time it is computationally expensive and to some degree requires luck (because you are mutating instances randomly), hence it is usually not popular when we already know a more deterministic solution to a problem. But there is a set of problems where GA could excel, one of that is when you don't have differentiable objective e.g. parameter search, or reinforcement learning.
