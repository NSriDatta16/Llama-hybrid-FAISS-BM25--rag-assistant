Generative models for time series simulation

I have a basic understanding of generative models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). It seems that they are mostly used to in the field of image processing/computer vision as in https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/ But somehow after a very long quest in searching for ways to emulate/simulate non-stationary time-series processes, i got to generative models in mahcine learning. Does anyone know of any way that generative models have been used on time series data? especially to generate similar time series out of observed ones? If anyone can suggest another approach to modelling and simulating time-series data that would also be of great help!
