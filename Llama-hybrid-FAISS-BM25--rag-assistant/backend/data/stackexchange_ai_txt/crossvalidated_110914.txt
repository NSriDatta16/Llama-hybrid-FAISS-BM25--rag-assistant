Your proposed computation makes no sense because $0.4$ and $0.6$ represent probabilities, not the value of a random variable. If you are modeling something as a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 0.4$ and standard deviation $0.49$, then you are saying that there is some underlying random process that generates a real number that, loosely speaking, on average tends to be "close" to $0.4$ with a "spread" of $0.49$. Such a distribution would have a significant chance of giving you a number less than $0$ or greater than $1$. If you are modeling realizations of an unknown proportion, such a choice of mean and standard deviation is decidedly not realistic. This leads to another flaw in your interpretation: the parameter of interest in this case--i.e., the probability of a particular candidate to win an election--is assumed to be known to you. You have some kind of belief or prior evidence to suggest this value. If you wish to simulate outcomes of success/failure, then this is the value you're going to use. In other words, if I give you a coin and tell you that it has a $0.6$ probability of landing heads and $0.4$ probability of landing tails, then your expectation of the outcome from tossing it many times is that out of $n$ trials, approximately $0.6n$ heads and $0.4n$ tails will be observed. Now, you can do some hypothesis testing to determine if my claim about this coin is in fact true--for instance, would you believe me if you tossed the coin $100$ times and had obtained $10$ heads and $90$ tails? Under an appropriate hypothesis test, you could actually quantify the probability that you obtained as extreme a result as this had my claim been true. But as I have noted, this is not germane to simulating the outcomes of individual coin tosses themselves.
