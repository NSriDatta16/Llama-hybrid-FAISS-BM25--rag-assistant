arrival time poisson processes

The arrival times of customers in a bakery can be modeled by a Poisson process (Nt)t≥0 with some rate λ > 0. On average, there are four arrivals per unit of time. I want to ask about the question above what does it mean by "four arrivals per unit of time" and how can I get the rate(lamda) by just knowing the above information? Thank you!
