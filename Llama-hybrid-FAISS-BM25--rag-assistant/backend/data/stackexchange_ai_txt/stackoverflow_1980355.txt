Linux API to determine sockets owned by a process

Is there a Linux library that will enable me to tell what IP sockets are owned by what processes? I guess I'm looking for the programmatic equivalent of lsof -i . Ultimately, I want to correlate packets seen through libpcap to processes. UPDATE: A couple of people have suggested using /proc/ /net/tcp and udp , but on my system, the same data is shown for every process, so it doesn't help.
