Correct syntax to compare values in JSTL

I have an if statement that I am trying to perform with JSTL. My code is below (the variables values is an ArrayList that contains a user defined object and type is a private property of that object, with public getter/setter methods): What would be the correct syntax of the part within the test attribute. The docs don't really help with that part http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/index.html Thanks.
