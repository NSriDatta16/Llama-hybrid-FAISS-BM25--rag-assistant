Simulation study: how to choose the number of iterations?

I would like to generate data with "Model 1" and fit them with "Model 2". The underlying idea is to investigate robustness properties of "Model 2". I am particularly interested in the coverage rate of the 95% confidence interval (based on the normal approximation). How do I set the number of iteration runs? Is it true that larger than necessary replications may result in spurious biases? If so, how is that?
