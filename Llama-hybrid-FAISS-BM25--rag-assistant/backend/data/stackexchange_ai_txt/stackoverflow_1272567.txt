IBM mainframe operating systems supported virtual storage back then - although you could buy a condo on the beach today for what the yearly IBM lease was! I don't remember any insurmountable program size issues. One thing to consider is that back then almost everything was run in "batch programming" mode. This limited how complex any one program needed to be. One program would pre-process the data and store it on disk. The next might sort it and add some calculated result. Then next might update a database. Then the last one in the batch might print out a report. So complexity (and size) was broken up over several programs running in sequence.
