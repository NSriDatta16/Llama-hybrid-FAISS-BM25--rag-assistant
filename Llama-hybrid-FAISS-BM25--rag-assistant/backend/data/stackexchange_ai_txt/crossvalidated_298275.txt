Excluding predictors with small effect sizes: not worth it to obtain data?

Suppose I have the following completely-made-up logistic regression model: will_die_from_cancer = 0.50 + 0.07*age - 0.05*weight - 0.000001*passed_expensive_screening_test All predictors are significant at any reasonable threshold. The variables age and weight are cheap to obtain and have relatively large effect sizes. passed_expensive_screening_test , on the other hand, is really hard to obtain (it's an expensive screening test, duh!) and has a small effect size (a relatively minuscule coefficient). Perhaps the inclusion of passed_expensive_screening_test ensures that my model is correctly specified, but its effect on the likelihoods is so small that it doesn't seem worth it to continue collecting these data, when age and weight (again, a very minimal example) seem to do the trick. Is this (a) correct way of thinking about passed_expensive_screening_test and whether it should be included?
