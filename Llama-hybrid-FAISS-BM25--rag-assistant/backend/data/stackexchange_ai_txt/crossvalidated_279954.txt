In statistics, multivariate and multiple mean two different things all together. In a regression model, "multiple" denotes several predictors/independent variables. On the other hand, "multivariate" is used to mean several (2 or more) responses/ dependent variables. To this end, multivariate logistic regression is a logistic regression with more than one binary outcome . For example including both HIV status (positive or negative) and Condom use(Yes or No) as response/outcome in the same logistic regression model. Both responses are binary (hence logistic regression, probit regression can also be used), and more than one response/ dependent variable is involved (hence multivariate). NOTE In multivariate analysis, there should be some correlation between the responses used in the model. Otherwise, separate logistic regression models should be fitted for each response. In the above example with HIV status and Condom use as dependent variables, there should be some within subject correlations between HIV status and Condom use. As opposed to multivariate logistic regression, a multiple logistic regression is a logistic regression with only one response but several predictors . For example predicting HIV status (Positive or negative) using the number of sexual partners, and the practice of safe sex as possible independent variables. Here, only one response is involved (HIV status). However, there are two or more (in this case only two) predictors / independent variable namely, 1.number of sexual partners, and 2.practice of safe sex
