Storing data in binary format has two advantages: it occupies less storage (less disk IO) it is faster to read (no time-consuming string parsing) So there will be performance improvements if you convert your textual representation to a tightly-packed binary format, but if they are significant depends on your particular situation. If data streaming is already a performance bottleneck, switching to a binary format (and possibly even compressed - reading from disks is inherently slow ) can bring a lot.
