Apart from the methods @Media mentioned, here are some more: Imputing with info from other variables This method is to create a (multi-class) model based on target variable. So that missing values would be predicted. The steps are likely to be: Subset data without missing value in the variable you want to impute Machine learning on the data with predict model Predict on data with the missing value from model created Clustering Whether missing values are mainly related to a combination of variables? Unsupervised methods may help here. An example using randomForest: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/107530/using-cluster-information-in-multiple-imputation Domain Knowledge If we known that the reason for missing value, we can assign the missing value to a proper level. For example, a survey data are collected from web where given choices are not applicable for some cases, hence leave blank. In this case, it would be better to leave as a separate value. Implementation There are some R package can impute the data for you; MICE Amelia missForest Hmisc mi https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/tutorial-powerful-packages-imputing-missing-values/
