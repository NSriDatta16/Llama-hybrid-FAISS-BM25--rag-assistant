Not sure about your second question. You are still at the limit of KMO test, on the other hand, if those new variables make theoretical sense, I would go ahead and include them. Regarding the first question. the short answer is no. If you do the following: pca x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 predict index1 the "index1" will consider only the first component, which is the idea behind a wealth index. The other components you are interested in could be used perhaps for a multidimensional index that captures different dimensions of wealth. HTH
