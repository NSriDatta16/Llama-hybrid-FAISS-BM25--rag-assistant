Highly correlated variables in exploratory factor analysis

Do I have to eliminate variables that are highly correlated before doing an exploratory factor analysis, like it has been discussed for PCA already here ? To specify, some items of my data are highly correlated r = 0.8 , some items stem from a similar/partially same test [Example: Persons had to remember 20 words, they had to repeat them directly after (one item) and many minutes after (second item).] Even though this should capture different cognitive dimensions (working memory and short term memory), they are of course highly correlated. Can I use both such highly correlated items as an exploratory factor analysis? (and yes, they do load highly on the same factor). Is there a cutoff for a correlation between items that is ok?
