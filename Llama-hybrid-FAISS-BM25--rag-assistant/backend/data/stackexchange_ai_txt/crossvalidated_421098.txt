Time Series equivalent of the Generalised Linear Model

I have a time series $y_t$ which is measured at regular intervals over a long period of time. The values of $y$ are between $0$ and $1$ , it represents a proportion, and these values change slowly over time. I want to predict the value of $y$ at future time periods. I wanted to start in the most simple way possible, so I creates a linear regression based on the previous time period: $y_t \sim y_{t-1}$ This can be extended to include $y_{t-2}$ and some covariates. To account for the fact that the dependent variable is between $0$ and $1$ , I subsequently turned this into a generalised linear model by including a logit link function: $logit(y_t) \sim logit(y_{t-1}) + logit(y_{t-2}) + covariates$ This already works quite well for predicting future values of $y$ . However, I realise linear regression and GLM are not appropriate for time series. Why not though? What assumptions are violated if one used such models on times series data with autocorrelation? What would be an equivalent simple model to use for such time series? A model able to deal with a dependent variable between $0$ and $1$ , but otherwise as simple as possible.
