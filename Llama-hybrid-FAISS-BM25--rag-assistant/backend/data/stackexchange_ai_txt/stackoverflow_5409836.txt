You should really only write data to local storage that should persist across pages. If you're constantly parsing/stringifying JSON, then your code is likely much slower than it needs to be. Aside from reducing performance, there's a limited amount of space available in local storage, so you should use it judiciously. Ask yourself: "How much of this data needs to stick around after the user leaves this page?"
