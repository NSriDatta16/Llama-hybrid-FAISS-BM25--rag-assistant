Basically the fact that you describe depends from correlations among regressors. If you change regressors list the changes in parameters values are usual. The fact the one or more coefficients change their sign depends on particular correlations structure. To check the correlation matrix can help you. Only in the particular case where regressors are orthogonal, as in PCA case, the coefficients remain unchanged.
