MLP: Classification vs. Regression

Abstract I am teaching myself about NNs for a summer research project by following an MLP tutorial which classifies the MNIST handwriting database. I want to change the MLP from classification to regression to understand more about the structure of the network. Problem The original training data was a $(28,28)$ image array vs. 10 labels Assume it is now 28 timeseries of length 28 from $t=-27$ to $t=0$ that are assumed to contribute to the value of a timeseries at $t=1$ (any better examples would be welcome!) Current MLP Structure Currently the structure of my MLP is as follows: Input Layer $28^2$ = 728 Hidden Layer = 500 Output Layer = 10 Logistic Regression Layer = (softmax then argmax) Classification = one of 10 digits Goal I would like try to implement two difference approaches: Output a PDF of possible real values Output an exact real value estimate From a high level, what should I change in my structure to alter my classifier MLP to a regression MLP? Thanks! Edit This paper seems to suggest the following structure for learning time series i.e. a real value regression problem: Input Layer $28^2$ = 728 Hidden Layer = 500 $b_{pj}$ as a bias vector(?) Linear transformation (should this just be $y=Wx+B$ ?) Output Layer = 1 real value
