Perforce is a decent system, and scales well. I'm working at an organization of about 5000 employees, and perforce is a fast and efficient system. It scales well, has good branch support, has atomic commits. Each change has a change number that can be used for "software archaeology" and a host of other great features. Additionally, it has good support for windows, mac and unix, including good command line and has good script support. I've used CVS before, and it doesn't scale well to groups greater than about 25-50 engineers (mostly because of atomic operations and performance)
