The poisson regression model does not predict counts, it predicts a rate . The poisson model is: $$ y \mid X \sim \text{Poisson} \left( \mu = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k) \right) $$ So the model predicts $\mu$, which is interpreted as the rate parameter of the conditional distribution $y \mid X$. Even though the rate parameter cannot be zero (as an outcome of a fit model), it is still consistent with the data (which are counts) being zero. This is exactly analogous to the situation in logistic regression: the predicted probabilities cannot be zero or one, but the data is always a zero or a one.
