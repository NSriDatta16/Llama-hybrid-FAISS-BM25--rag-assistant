Includes and persistent storage in CustomRules.js of Fiddler

I've been using Fiddler for a few days now, extending CustomRules.js with my own logic. However, the file is becoming quite heavy (it's fairly heavy to begin with). I'm not very familiar with .NET or JScript, but I would like to be able to split CustomRules.js into several smaller files that I can just include into CustomRules.js. Is this possible? I'm also finding a need to have some sort of persistent storage across requests. Is there a simple way to store values in CustomRules.js for use in later requests?
