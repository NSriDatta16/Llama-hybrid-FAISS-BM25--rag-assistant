1) You can use HMM , SSM or UCM if u have assumption that transition is happening from some hidden state. Considering 20 data points, I wonder how model fitting will happen. 2) markov chain would not follow assumption for hidden states. But this will give you robust bayesian based probabilistic model to forecast future states. 3) this article might help- https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markov-chains-python-tutorial To know the basics of HMM and hidden states.- https://machinelearningstories.blogspot.com/2017/02/hidden-markov-model-session-1.html
