A typical use case is storage of additional object attributes. Suppose you have a class with a fixed set of members, and, from the outside, you want to add more members. So you create a dictionary object -> attributes, where the keys are weak references. Then, the dictionary doesn't prevent the keys from being garbage collected; removal of the object should also trigger removal of the values in the WeakKeyDictionary (e.g. by means of a callback).
