What you're asking for is the command 'which', ie me@stackoverflow:~$ which which /usr/bin/which On linux it's a shell script, so take a look a gander. However, I don't think this is required to make a UNIX shell. If you type man 3 exec you'll find that execlp() and execvp() take care of the details of searching PATH for the given command and executing it.
