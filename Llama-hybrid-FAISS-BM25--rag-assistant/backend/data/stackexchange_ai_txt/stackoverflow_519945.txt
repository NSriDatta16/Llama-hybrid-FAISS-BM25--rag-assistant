How to style in IE6 CSS?

Is there any elegant way of applying a certain style to all elements under IE6? I can do it with some JavaScript, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way of doing it. Note - I cannot apply a certain class to all textboxes by hand. And I'd like to avoid CSS expressions .
