How to analyze and determine the specific causes of failure from parity plots

I am using Random Forest to predict a target variable from about 20 independent variables in a 40000 entry database. As you see from parity plots of test set, I have sever overfit and probably other problems. The fact that I have some overerestimation in smaller target variables in the training set's parity plot shows me that there is imbalance and outlier effect (I think). The fact that in the test set parity plot we have various points in a complete horizontal line also shows lack of unique characterization of the system. My question is how to tackle these problems? It is possible for me to extract more and more variables (so 20 independent variables are not fixed and I can extract more). How should I approach variable extraction? Should I change modeling approach like tuning parameters? Any type of systematic guideline or technical keyword to look into will be appreciated.
