Linear Logistic Regression where Dummy variable is strictly dependent of other covariates

I want to do a logistic regression for something being granted or not. In this I have independent variable that is dependent of a dummy variable. For example, I want to regress glm(granted ~ age + score + coperson + coscore + , family=binomial(logit)) Here, "coperson" is a dummy variable and "coscore" is dependent of "coperson". So if coperson is 1, then coscore has a value (any continuous value, from 0.0 to 100.0) But I feel that this setting of regression is incorrect. If coperson = 0, then "coscore" should have a "hole" right? Should I write the equation in another form? Like interactions?
