How to interpret the direct comparison of Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)?

Say I have a trained Random Forest (RF) consisted of $m$ decision trees and I am interested to estimate $y$ from $t_1$ to $t_n$ . The good thing about RF is that I have an ensemble of estimators and a deterministic estimator in one place. After using RF for estimation, I calculate the MAE for RF, and I calculate the CRPS for ensemble members of RF: $m$ decision tree regressors. CRPS is a probabilistic measure that seeks to evaluate the accuracy of the ensemble, and MAE targets the same quality but for the deterministic model. Is there any point in comparing these two metrics? What could be the intuition behind say: my CRPS is slightly smaller than MAE in this case. I don't have any statistical muscle, but my gut feeling is that this is a vague comparison: Accuracy of an ensemble vs accuracy of single model. They are not meant to compete, they don't belong to the same world. ensemble is targeting to resemble the distribution of y, while the deterministic model is after the average of y. I hope I could express my confusion in a not confusing way.
