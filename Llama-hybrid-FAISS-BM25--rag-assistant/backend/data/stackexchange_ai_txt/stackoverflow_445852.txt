Consider the opinions of Raymond Chen as well as Microsoft's x64-thinking. (( raymond chen exceptions )) as a Google-query is enough to get you to his classic essays "Cleaner, more elegant, and wrong -- Just because you can't see the error path doesn't mean it doesn't exist." and the clarification "Cleaner, more elegant, and harder to recognize". (( x64 exception model )) gets you to the MSDN article "Everything You Need To Know To Start Programming 64-Bit Windows Systems", which contains the quote "The downside to table-based exception handling (relative to the x86 stack-based model) is that looking up function table entries from code addresses takes more time than just walking a linked list. The upside is that functions don't have the overhead of setting up a try data block every time the function executes." To summarize this quote, in x64 it is free or nearly-free to setup a "catch" which is never used, but to actually throw-catch an exception is slower than in x86.
