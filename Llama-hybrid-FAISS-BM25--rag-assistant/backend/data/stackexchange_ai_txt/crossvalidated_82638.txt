The paired Mann-Whitney test is a rank based test. Little wonder why it's difficult to interpret and visualize the results of such a test when a T test would have been much superior. Nonetheless, just as you'd visualize paired t-test results, you can apply similar methods for rank tests. The visualization for paired t-tests works by plotting values from pre/post on separate 0/1 scales on the x-axis with continuous responses on the y-axis. You can draw lines between pre/post values. For rank tests, all you do is convert the y-axis to a rank. Draw lines between ranks. See how many on average appear to fall upward vs downward in the groups.
