poisson vs logistic regression

I have a cohort of patients with different length of follow-up. So far I´m disregarding the time aspect and just need to model a binary outcome-disease/no disease. I usually do logistic regression in these studies, but another collegue of mine asked if Poisson regression would be just as appropriate. I´m not that into poisson and was left uncertain as to what the benefits and disadvantages of doing poisson in this setting would be compared logistic regression. I read Poisson regression to estimate relative risk for binary outcomes and I am still uncertain as to the merits of poisson regression in this situation.
