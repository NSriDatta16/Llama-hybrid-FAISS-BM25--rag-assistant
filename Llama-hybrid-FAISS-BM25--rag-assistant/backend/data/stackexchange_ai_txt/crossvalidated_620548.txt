SVM and logistic regression: steps and selection of predictors

I need help, I am a statistics student and I am doing my final degree project and I am a bit lost, the steps I have taken to make the svm and logistic regression models have been: univariate analysis, elimination of nulls, etc... Transformation of categorical variables to dummy variables (all the variables in my data are categorical) Multivariate analysis: Spearman's correlation for ordinal variables and Pearson's correlations for nominal variables (the dummies). All this to study multicollinearity. VIF method on dummy variables Regression lassos for the choice of predictors to apply it in SVM models and logistic regression. Decision tree on the original variables (without transforming to dummies). Please, I need to know if all these steps are ok and am I doing this right?
