Supporting Select * from System.table-x or user-table alone does not qualify a product as a Relational database. SELECT support can be implemnted by any DBMS (non-relational inclusive). As for meta data, again an Online Query SQL front allowed anyone to do a SELECT * FROM USER_047 (against the meta data in Dictionary) to IDMS as early as 1984. That time IDMS was a pure CODASYL network database. IDMS did come up with full sql support in the 1990s with SQL DDL and DML in native form. Pure RDBMS must support fullscale DDL and DML using SQL like commands (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE) and GRANT, REVOKE etc for Access Control. Besides one could insist that no other access should be allowed. That is one should not be allowed to read any data if one doesnot go through the DBMS software of the product. Many PC databases of the 1980s fail this test. They were all some kind of file systems with some access (Sql or not ). In a real DBMS, the database software alone should be able to update or even 'see' data. Operating system's own file programs should not be allowed to browse through the data in ASCII / EBCDIC form. DBMS in a way takes control of the whole storage areas of the files which is 'loaned' from the operating system. OS access methods are involved at the lowest level, but here user cannot intercept.
