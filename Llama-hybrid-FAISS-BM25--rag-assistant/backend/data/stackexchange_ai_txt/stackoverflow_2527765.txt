Add a background color to text, but with space blank space between lines of paragraph

I was wondering if something was possible to do in CSS. Basically i want to recreate the text on the RHS of the image using html/css, but currently I'm getting the LHS of the image. The HTML: This is an example of what I have The CSS: div#banner { background: green; width:300px; height:300px;} div#text { margin: 20px auto; } div#text p { background:#fff; padding: 5px; margin: 5px; font-size: 2em; } Now I realise that this can be done already either by: Using an image Using separate p tags (By Point 2 I mean: This is an example of what I have ) But what I would really like to know is if it's actually possible to do what is on the RHS of the image, using only css and a single p tag? alt text http://chris.carrotmedialtd.com/example.jpg
