The difference is that with ABC you do not need an analytic expression for $P(x|\theta)$ and instead approximate it by simulating data and seeing for which values of $\theta$ simulated data most often (approximately) matches the observed data (with proposed values e.g. drawn randomly from the prior). For simple cases, such as a single binomial random variable with a not too large sample size you can even require an exact match and in those cases, there really is absolutely nothing you could not do with these posterior samples that you could not also do with standard MCMC samples. For more complex situations with continuous (even for multivariate discrete outcomes) and potentially multivariate outcomes requiring an exact match is no longer feasible. There are in fact MCMC versions of ABC, which addresses the issue that if you have a prior that does not closely resemble the posterior (e.g. because the prior is very uninformative) sampling by drawing from the prior is extremly inefficient, because you very rarely will get a close match between the observed and the simulated data. When $P(x|\theta)$ is analytically available, I assume it will nearly always be preferrable to use a standard MCMC. I suppose it is conceivable that somehow the evaluation of $P(x|\theta)$ is so incredibly computationally expensive that ABC performs better. Perhaps someone knows an example of this. In contrast I would consider ABC or MCMC-ABC (or one of the many other ABC variants) primarily when a standard MCMC approach is not an option, because $P(x|\theta)$ is not analytically available. Of course there may be some other possible options in such cases (e.g. INLA, quadratic approximations to likelihoods etc.) that may be more efficient/successful for particular problems. In a way, any limitations in what you can do with posterior samples from ABC come from only requiring an aproximate match between the actual and the simulated data (if you could require an exact match, there would be no issues, at all). There are several good introductory papers e.g. this paper by Marin et al. (2012) . At least one of the co-authors (@Xi'an) is an active contributor here and I'd love to here his thoughts, too - I believe he may be able to say a lot more on the testing topic.
