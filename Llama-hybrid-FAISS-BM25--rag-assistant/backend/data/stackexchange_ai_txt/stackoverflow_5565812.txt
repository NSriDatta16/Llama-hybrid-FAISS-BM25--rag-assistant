Supposing you're under Win and making a console app (give more details next time), the solution found in The Art Of Assembly Language (in capital letters because that's a great book) is: 13.3.6.1 Allocate Memory Function (ah): 48h Entry parameters: bx- Requested block size (in paragraphs) Exit parameters: If no error (carry clear): ax:0 points at allocated memory block If an error (carry set): bx- maximum possible allocation size ax- error code (7 or 8) This call is used to allocate a block of memory. On entry into DOS, bx contains the size of the requested block in paragraphs (groups of 16 bytes). On exit, assuming no error, the ax register contains the segment address of the start of the allocated block. If an error occurs, the block is not allocated and the ax register is returned containing the error code. If the allocation request failed due to insufficient memory, the bx register is returned containing the maximum number of paragraphs actually available. 13.3.6.2 Deallocate Memory Function (ah): 49h Entry parameters: es:0- Segment address of block to be deallocated Exit parameters: If the carry is set, ax contains the error code (7,9) This call is used to deallocate memory allocated via function 48h above. The es register cannot contain an arbitrary memory address. It must contain a value returned by the allocate memory function. You cannot use this call to deallocate a portion of an allocated block. The modify allocation function is used for that operation. 13.3.6.3 Modify Memory Allocation Function (ah): 4Ah Entry parameters: es:0- address of block to modify allocation size bx- size of new block Exit parameters: If the carry is set, then ax contains the error code 7, 8, or 9 bx contains the maximum size possible (if error 8) This call is used to change the size of an allocated block. On entry, es must contain the segment address of the allocated block returned by the memory allocation function. Bx must contain the new size of this block in paragraphs. While you can almost always reduce the size of a block, you cannot normally increase the size of a block if other blocks have been allocated after the block being modified. Keep this in mind when using this function. page 719 if you need it ;)
