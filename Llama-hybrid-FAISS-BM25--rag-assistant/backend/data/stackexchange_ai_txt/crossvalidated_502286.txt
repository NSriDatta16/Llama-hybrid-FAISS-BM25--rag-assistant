Why is scaling usually done within the range of -1 and +1 in machine learning?

I observe that in machine learning, scaling is done to make the numeric input fit within the range from -1 to +1. Why not a bigger range like -10 to -10? If smaller range is better, then why not -0.1 to +0.1? Why is this numeric range (-1 to +1) preferred? Is there a mathematical reason to choose this range?
