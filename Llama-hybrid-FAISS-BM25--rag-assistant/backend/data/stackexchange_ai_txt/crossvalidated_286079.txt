I believe this paper will be of help. It explains the backpropagation algorithm. Also note that for LSTM's that process passages, multiple LSTM blocks are used in a sequential and parallel manner. And additionally, neural networks are black boxes : we don't know how the work internally, and they make up which details are important themselves.
