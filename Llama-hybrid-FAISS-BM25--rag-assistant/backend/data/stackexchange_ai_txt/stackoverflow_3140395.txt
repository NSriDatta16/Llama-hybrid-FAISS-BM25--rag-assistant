Ok this isn't the most elegant solution because it doesn't really fix the cause of the problem, but for it was the quickest fix to get the site looking "normal" again. I forced the response to be a 200 in the individual files, which isn't ideal I know, but hey. header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK'); Seems to have done the trick for now. If anyone else has any ideas as to what the root cause may be, feel free to comment still
