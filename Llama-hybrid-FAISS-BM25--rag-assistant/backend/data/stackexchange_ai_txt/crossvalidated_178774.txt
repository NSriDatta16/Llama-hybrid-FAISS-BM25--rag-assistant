The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is unaffected by monotonic-increasing transformations of the data (such as exponentiation and logarithms) -- since they don't change the rank order, they cannot change the statistic, and hence the p-value should be unaltered. There are any number of possible reasons why you might have seen a change in p-value: if you computed $x^{10}$ instead of $10^x$ (your question implies you might have) and some $x$'s were negative, that would change the rank order If you actually calculated the log-data from the unlogged data (rather than the other way around, as you describe) your data might have inadvertently contain numbers that are zero or negative, which precludes being able to meaningfully take logs; this could lead to the omission of some data and some programs mightn't warn you about the problem (or perhaps it did but you didn't pay attention to the warning) you might have accidentally computed some other quantity such as a Wilcoxon signed rank test you might have somehow changed your data along the way in a manner which impacts the ranks (other than those already mentioned) you may have called the function incorrectly without realizing it you may not have treated both samples identically the software you're using might be doing a form of resampling (in effect a randomization test) to compute the p-value in the presence of ties and the number of resamples used might have been much too low. the software you're using might possibly contain an error $\vdots$ and so on (a complete list isn't really possible - there's too many ways for something weird to come in). Without additional clues we really won't be able to pin down the cause.
