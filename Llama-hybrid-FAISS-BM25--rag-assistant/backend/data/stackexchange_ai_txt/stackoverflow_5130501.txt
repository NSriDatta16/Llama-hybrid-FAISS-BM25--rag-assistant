Multiple icon images in Honeycomb

I'm trying to change my app icon to make it match the blue of Honeycomb but maintain the green icons for previous Android versions. I've come across a problem where if I put the blue 72x72 icon in drawable-xlarge, it uses it correctly in the launcher but it also uses that for the ActionBar. 72x72 is so large, it extends beyond the ActionBar top & bottom. My res directory is as follows: drawable - images for ldpi & mdpi screens (48x48) drawable-hdpi - for hdpi screens (72x72) drawable-xlarge - just images for tablets How can I correctly organise the blue icons so 72x72 is used for the launcher and 48x48 is used for the ActionBar?
