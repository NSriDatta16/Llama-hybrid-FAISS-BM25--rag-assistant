Would you say this is a trade off between frequentist and Bayesian stats?

I'm trying to review frequentist and Bayesian in parallel. Let's say we are doing the typical scenario of estimating the population mean. In frequentist stats, if sample size is large enough, we can use CLT to say that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. Then we can make inferences about the population mean. Here it seems like we DO NOT have to make any assumption about the shape of the population distribution because of CLT and as long as sample size is large enough. In bayesian stats, it seems like we HAVE to make an assumption about the shape of the population distribution so that we can use the likelihood function to generate a posterior distribution. Thus, we don't get the benefits of CLT when doing Bayesian analysis. Would you say a tradeoff is, in frequentist, you get to use CLT, thus allowing you to tackle a wider range of problems - especially if you know the population is non-normal? For example, there's no burden of proof to show if the population follows a gamma or beta distribution since it doesn't matter. In Bayesian, since you always are using the likelihood function, you must always make an assumption about the distribution of the population data - limiting your flexibility to modeling populations with known distribution functions. And, does this imply that there is some burden of proof to show that your data follows whatever distribution assumption you make? HOWEVER, you do get to inject prior views of what you think the parameter value should center around. You also have an estimate of the distribution of the parameter itself, for situations where you think the parameter might be random.
