Looking at the images, it seems an image segmentation problem . As you see, the Autoencoder is not returning a more or less accurate representation of the original input image, but the segmentation of it . Each of the output colors are segments of the image that have been classified. Probably the classes are something such as: "road", "tree", "building", "sky", etc. In other words, it's an Autoencoder performing a classification task. That explains the softmax layer at the end.
