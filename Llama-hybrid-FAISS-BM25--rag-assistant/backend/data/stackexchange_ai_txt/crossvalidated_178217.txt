Is it safe to run 2 or more RStudio sessions simultaneously?

I am working on some neural networks' benchmarks and they take a significant amount of time to finish. So, I am using multiple RStudio sessions to run them simultaneously. Is this safe? I mean is it safe from the perspective of the variables, because I ran the same script with slightly changed the parameters of the neural networks. Are the variables being affected by these sessions? Do they overlap? e.g. if I have a counter variable does it increase from both sessions?
