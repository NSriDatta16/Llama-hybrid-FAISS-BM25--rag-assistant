PuTTY usually comes with a client called psftp which you can leverage for this purpose. I don't believe you can do it through the standard PuTTY client (although I may be proven wrong on that). PuTTY only gives you access to manipulate the remote machine. It doesn't provide a direct link between the two file systems any more than sitting down at the remote machine does.
