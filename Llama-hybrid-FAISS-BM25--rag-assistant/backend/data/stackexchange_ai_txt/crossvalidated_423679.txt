HMM can use EM, but typical applications also include Baum-Welch. GMM, k-means typically use it. MCMC is a simulation method, not EM. If EM is in some part of an algorithm, the convergence is sure for that part. EM finds you a local optimum depending on the initial values. If the initials change, you may end up with a different local optimum, and you don't get the same results.
