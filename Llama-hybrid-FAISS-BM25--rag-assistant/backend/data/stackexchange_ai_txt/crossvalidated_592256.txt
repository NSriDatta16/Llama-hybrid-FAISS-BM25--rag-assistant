Weighting feature by time

Context In the price elasticity of demand modeling field. I have some data to use, which the basic is average weekly price and volume of a product. As you can see in the image, each point represents the weekly value of transactions. The goal is to weight values in order to give importance to more recent value. According to a business solution resource, it was proposed to fix this by weighting, so as to help the model fit and better interpret these relationships. In other words: "More recent observations weigh more" is how it looks on the left graph. Question With this contextual framework I ask myself: What transform/weighting do you think is interesting and how would it be applied to the data series? In this case the exponential weighting is proposed.
