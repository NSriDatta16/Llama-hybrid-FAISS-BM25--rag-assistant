It is well-known, at least from the late 1960', that if you take several forecasts † and average them, then the resulting aggregate forecast in many cases will outperform the individual forecasts. Bagging, boosting and stacking are all based exactly on this idea. So yes, if your aim is purely prediction then in most cases this is the best you can do. What is problematic about this method is that it is a black-box approach that returns the result but does not help you to understand and interpret it. Obviously, it is also more computationally intensive than any other method since you have to compute few forecasts instead of single one. † This concerns about any predictions in general, but it is often described in forecasting literature.
