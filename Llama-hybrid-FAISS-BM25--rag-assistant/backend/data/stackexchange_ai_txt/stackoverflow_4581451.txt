You have a lot of values, and some of them figure into your average - or percentage - and some of them probably don't. You are not expressing the problem clearly enough for anyone to be able to give you a meaningful answer. A percentage represents a fraction, one value divided by another (multiplied by 100 to express it in percentage, but that's trivial and not part of the problem). What is the value that represents 100%? And what value are you trying to assign? In what way do you think that the quantity of bonuses should affect the percentage? Some possible answers: The total bonus earned by an individual, as compared to her nominal salary. If she earns $50k and her bonus is $20K, that is 20/50 *100 = 40%. The total bonus earned by an individual, as compared to all the bonuses given out that year. If she received the same $20K, but the company gave out $100K in bonuses, then the percentage is 20/100 * 100 = 20%. The most recent bonus earned by an individual, as compared to all bonuses awarded to her this year. If she got $5K for her last bonus, and the total was $20, that's 5/20 * 100 = 25%. We really don't have enough information to go on; it could be any of these, or something entirely different. It is entirely possible to have a percentage value greater than 100%.
