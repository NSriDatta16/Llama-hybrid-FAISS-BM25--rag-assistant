What would be an appropriate Y axis when plotting several functions shifted one under another?

For some seismic data I made a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of its frequency content: where the y-axis shows the rank of the principal component, and the numbers on the right show first the amount of data explained by this component and then the cumulative explanation by that component and all below. The problem now is that each line is normalised, i.e. it runs in [-1 1] , and the current representation suggest that the top line actually runs in [9 11] , which is misleading. The question thus is: what would be a representative y-axis for this kind of plot? Note that I am looking for a theoretical visualisation, although hints as to how to actually implement it would be appreciated. I'm using MATLAB.
