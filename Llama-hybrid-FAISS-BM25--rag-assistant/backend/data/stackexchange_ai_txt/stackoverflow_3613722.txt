Can one combine android resource strings into new strings?

Android allows to create aliases of resource strings like: somestring @string/foo by which the resource "bar" becomes an alias for the resource named "foo". What I would for my app is a possibility to combine an existing resource prefix with different suffixes, i.e. to extend it like: foo @string/foo+bar @string/foo+else where the resource "bar" would yield the string "foobar". Its clear that '+' doesn't work here but is there some other option to achieve such a string concatenation, so that one could define a bunch of string resources that have a common prefix? I realize of course that I could do such resource string concatenation at runtime but defining them statically in the resources would seem so much more elegant and simpler. Michael
