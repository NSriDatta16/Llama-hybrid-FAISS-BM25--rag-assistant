The answer here is the famous "libpcap". Use your favourite language as long as there is a good libpcap wrapper available for it. C/C++ is of course a perfect choice if you like it since you don't need any wrapper. JNetPcap ( http://jnetpcap.com/ ) is a java winpcap/libpcap wrapper Sharpcap ( http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/sharppcap.aspx?msg=2472909 ) is a C# libpcap parser. I did some stuff with it some times ago. ... So pick your language, check the existence of the wrapper and go on. If there is no wrapper for this language, either change your choice, or create your own wrapper
