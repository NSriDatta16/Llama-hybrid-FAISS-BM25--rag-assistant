Scale invariance means that rescaling any or all of the columns will not change the results - that is, multiplying or dividing all the values from any variable will not affect the model predictions ( ref ). As @ericperkeson mentioned, rescaling in this manner is known as dilation ( ref ). Scale invariance for metrics about contingency tables refers to rescaling rows as well as columns, though I don't believe it applies here (see the scaling property section here ). As to why PLSR is not scale invariant, I'm not completely certain, but I'll leave notes on what I've learned and possibly a better mathematician can clarify. Generally, regression with no regularisation (e.g. OLS) is scale invariant, and regularised regression (e.g. ridge regression) is not scale invariant, because the minimisers of the function change ( ref ). Now, I can't see an explicit penalty term in PLSR, but I it's constrained in a similar way to PCA. PCA chooses the axes of maximal variance - so if you rescale a variable, the variance relative to other variables can change ( ref ). PLSR tries to find the ' multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the Y space', hence rescaling an input can change the direction of maximum variance ( ref ).
