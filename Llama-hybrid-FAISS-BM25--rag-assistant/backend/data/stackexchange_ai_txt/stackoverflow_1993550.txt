If the digits you want to display exist in some form as a font, then you should almost certainly show them in a text field set to that font - make sure to embed the font in question! The important thing is that there's no reason to use images if the images are coming from a font - just let Flash display the font information. If however the digits you want to use began life in some other way - if they're hand-drawn, or the come from photos, etc., then the solution you're describing sounds like the right way to go.
