How should strongly correlated covariates for logistic regression be treated?

I have to build a multiple logistic regression model with two strongly correlated covariates (predictor variables). How should they be treated? Am I to exclude one of them from the regression? There is also a covariate that is a logical (Boolean) variable and is TRUE only for 2 observations (of 107 total). Am I to exclude this covariate from the regression, or is there any sense of taking the covariate into account? I have 6 covariates and 107 observations. All covariates are Boolean, but may be I will replace some of them with the source numerical variables. Thank you very much for your answers. I am a mathematician but a novice in applied statistics, so I need detailed answers. I need to estimate the influence on the outcome of each of the covariates, so I need to calculate odds ratios or something like that.
