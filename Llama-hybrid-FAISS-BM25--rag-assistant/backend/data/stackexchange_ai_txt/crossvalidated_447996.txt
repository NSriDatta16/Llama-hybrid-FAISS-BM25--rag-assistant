Back-transforming forecast points and error bounds from a VAR model applied to alr-transformed compositional time series

The data I have a k=3 compositional time series from which I am trying to forecast future values. The series is compositional in that at each time t , the series is a vector of three values which are non-negative proportions that sum up to 1. Modelling approach I am modelling the data by: first applying an additive logistic transformation (alr) to the data and then modelling the resulting series using vector AR models ( VAR ) This is one of possible approaches suggested in the literature ( here ) Here is a reproducible example in R , with n = 20 , where s1 , s2 , s3 make up the original compositional time-series (D=3), and alr1 , alr2 the corresponding alr-transformed series (D-1). mydata Problem I need to back-transform the alr forecast and error bounds (sample space R^(D-1) ) to the original scale (i.e., a compositional time-series whose sample space is S^(D=3) ), but I am getting results that do not make sense. Questions: Why is this the case? And how can I get around this problem? Code and problematic results library(compositions) library(vars) library(forecast) library(ggplot2) mydata The results make no sense : lower and upper bounds do not include the forecast point, and upper bounds for s3 are lower than its lower bounds. Just to visualise the problem, a quick plot of the results on the original scale for s1 : # plot results on the original scale and s1_fcst % autoplot()
