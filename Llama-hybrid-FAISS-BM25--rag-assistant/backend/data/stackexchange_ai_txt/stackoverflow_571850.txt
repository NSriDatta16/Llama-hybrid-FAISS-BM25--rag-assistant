Adding elements to python generators

Is it possible to append elements to a python generator? I'm currently trying to get all images from a set of disorganized folders and write them to a new directory. To get the files, I'm using os.walk() which returns a list of image files in a single directory. While I can make a generator out of this single list, I don't know how to combine all these lists into one single generator. Any help would be much appreciated.
