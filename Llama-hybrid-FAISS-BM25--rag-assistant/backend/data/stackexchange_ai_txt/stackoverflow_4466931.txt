Say, for example, I add some code to my android project and save, those changes will have no effect on master repo unless I commit? And that's the case even though, in terms of the actual local project, those changes were saved. Actually they won't change anything in the master repo until you push. It will change your local repo when you commit. It's really up to you how you want to organize your branches (really depends on how many things you work at the same time), but you can always have those branches, commit to them and when you have something consistent, you can always create a new branch of things to merge, use cherry-pick and/or rebase -i to make it a clean serie of commits and merge/push that branch.
