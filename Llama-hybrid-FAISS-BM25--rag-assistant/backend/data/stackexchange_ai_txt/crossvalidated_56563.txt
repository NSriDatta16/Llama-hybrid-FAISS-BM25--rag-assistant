A naive approach to this question, possibly a motivating example for the subject of time series, is to linearly model the effect of time in both variables, $Y$ and $Z$. If we specify that the observed outcome of these variables is so that: \begin{array}{c} E[Y(t)|t] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t \\ E[Z(t)|t] = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 t \end{array} you can arrange the data in a stacked (long) format with an indicator ($i$) of which variable is observed at that time with a single outcome variable, $U$. t i U 1 0 34.3 1 1 36.5 2 0 39.0 2 1 37.4 3 0 40.1 3 1 40.4 4 0 40.6 4 1 44.0 and setting up a regression model for the outcome, the growth rate can be explicitly estimated using a stratified model. $E \left( U(t) | i, t \right) = \delta_0 + \delta_1 i + \delta_2t$ so that $\delta_1$ is the difference in means between $Y$ and $Z$ at time 0. But we have assumed the growth rate is the same between the two variables, and that is given by $\delta_2$ which is interpreted as an expected difference in outcome for a unit difference in time. Compare that model with the saturated model with interaction terms: $E \left( U(t) | i, t \right) = \delta_0 + \delta_1 i + \delta_2 t + \delta_3 i t$ Now $\delta_3$ is a measure of the difference in time based growth between $Z$ and $Y$. Under the null hypothesis $\delta_3=0$ because there is no difference in growth rate over time. By testing this hypothesis using the stratified (nested) model using a likelihood ratio test, you have a simple, naive approach to testing whether there is a difference in growth rates.
