You could possibly circumvent this issue by changing the z-index of the object on a mouseover (for an x-windows follow focus type affair), or mousedown event (so that it fires just before the draggable z-index kicks in) that is bound to the '.elementsIWantToDrag'. This could then occur before the draggable event starts, and so it would 'revert' the z-index back to whatever you set it to in the mouse down event, as opposed to what it is being set to currently.
