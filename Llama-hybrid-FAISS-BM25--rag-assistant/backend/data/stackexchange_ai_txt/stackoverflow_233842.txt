Programmatically Printing in Adobe Reader 9 using .NET Interop

I am using VB.Net WinForms. I would like to call the Adobe Reader 9 ActiveX control to print some PDFs. I have added the ActiveX control to the VS toolbox (the dll is AcroPDF.dll, the COM name "Adobe PDF Reader". After some experiment the following code works. Dim files As String() = Directory.GetFiles(TextBoxPath.Text, "*.pdf", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly) Using ActiveXPDF As New AxAcroPDFLib.AxAcroPDF Me.Controls.Add(ActiveXPDF) ActiveXPDF.Hide() For Each filename As String In files ActiveXPDF.LoadFile(filename) ActiveXPDF.printAll() 'Begin Yukky Hack ' Dim endTime As Date = DateAdd(DateInterval.Second, 20, Now) Do While Now Without the Yuk bit this will only print some of the PDFs, it seems that the End Using statement is calling dispose on the control before it has finished printing. Therefore it seems the call to printAll is non-blocking but I can't find a callback or status property I can query to see if the print spooling has been completed. I am missing a property/method or is there a more elegant (and more responsive) work around?
