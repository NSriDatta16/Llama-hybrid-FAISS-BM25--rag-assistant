As long as the percentages all add to 100 ((not the case in your illustration) and reflect mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (not the case either), you can compute $X^2$ using the percentages, and multiply it by $N/100$. In your case, you really have a 3-way table. It appears that what you'd really like to know is how age and sex affect relapse rates. So I think you're better off forgetting the chi-square stuff, and instead using the actual frequencies for each cell: relapse n Age Sex 667 1802 18-25 M 759 2108 25-34 M ... Then run a logistic regression model with Age, Sex, and Age:Sex as the predictors. You can then see what the effects of those factors are, do comparisons among predictions, etc. It'd be a lot more informative than a chi-square statsitic of some independence hypothesis.
