One possibility would be to fit both a nonseasonal and a seasonal exponential smoothing model to each SKU's time series. Note each model's AICc. SKUs where the seasonal model yields a lower AICc are "more seasonal". The absolute difference in AICc measures the strength of the evidence (to a degree). As a rule of thumb, Burnham & Anderson suggest that a difference in AICc of about 2 constitutes weak evidence, a difference of 5 constitutes clear evidence and a difference of 10 constitutes strong evidence that the model with the lower AICc describes the data better. Alternatively, use a holdout sample for each time series. Fit seasonal and nonseasonal models to the initial data, forecast into the holdout sample and check whether a seasonal or a nonseasonal model provides better forecasts. If you need a statistical test as to whether the forecast improvement is significant, you can use the diebold-mariano test. Look at ets in the forecast package for R. While you are there, look at the seasonplot command to visualize seasonality.
