Set the style of the setControlStyle property of the UIMoviePlayerController instance to MPMovieControlStyleNone . Edit: I guess the best way to get the buttons exactly as you want would be to create your own UIView subclass that handles the visuals of the controls, implement the buttons that you're after, position them on your custom view, and then position your custom view over your MPMovieController's view. You would then need to hook up the target and actions of your cutom view's buttons to a controller that uses the MPMediaPlayback functions to control the playback of your MPMoviePlayerController . The work will come in having to create and position your own UIView subclass. You should also pay attention to the fact that using this method will not be as efficient as using the built-in controls that you can specify with Apple's setControlStyle property.
