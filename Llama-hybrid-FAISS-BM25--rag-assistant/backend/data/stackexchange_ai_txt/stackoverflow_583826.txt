How should source code files be organized? By function, or type?

In my early coding days, I would tend to group classes that functioned in a similar way. For example: Data transfer objects Object A Object B Dialogs Dialog A Dialog B After a while, it started to frustrate me that when I was working on a particular part of the application, I would have to jump all around to piece it together. In the last few years, I tend to organize things by feature. Classes that are commonly shared, such as database objects, I still keep together. I think this even makes sense for things like websites: Page A images Resource 1 Dialog 1 Page B images Resource 2 Dialog 2 Is this the best way to do it? Does anyone have a good rule of thumb to follow?
