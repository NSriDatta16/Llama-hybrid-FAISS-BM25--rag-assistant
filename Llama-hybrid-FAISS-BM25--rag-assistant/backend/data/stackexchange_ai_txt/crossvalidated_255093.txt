There are two different questions you are addressing: Which cointegrating relationship to test for? How to test for presence of a constant in a cointegrating relationship? I will answer the first one, while the answer for the second one should be included in standard textbooks and lecture notes on cointegration (please correct me if I am wrong). If you have three time series, $U$, $C_t$ and $Y_t$ where $U$ is constant through time, then $U$ has no place in the cointegrating relationship. Cointegration may take place between integrated series, whereas $U$ is stationary. (Even though the true relationship between the series could be $C_t=U+Y_t$, that does not mean $U$ belongs to the cointegrating relationship.) In your setting, you could test for whether the cointegrating vector is $(1,-1)$ for $(C_t,Y_t)$. You could do that, for example, by examining the stationarity of the residual series $\varepsilon_t=Y_t-C_t$ by the ADF test with the "standard" critical values (the ones used for unit root testing of a single series). This is because the cointegrating vector is not estimated but determined by outside knowledge. Or you could test cointegration with the Johansen procedure allowing for a constant term.
