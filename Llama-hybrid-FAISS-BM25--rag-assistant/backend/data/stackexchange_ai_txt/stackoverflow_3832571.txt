I really don't think this can be answered objectively. You should do whatever you can to keep it as small as possible so you're not wasting storage space on the device. Just realize the app bundle's size isn't a reflection of the exectuable's size. If the executable is huge, that's a (memory) problem you should try to address. If most of it is resources, compress as well as you can without sacrificing too much (or any?) quality, and that's the best you can do. In other words: there is no such thing as a "normal" size for an app.
