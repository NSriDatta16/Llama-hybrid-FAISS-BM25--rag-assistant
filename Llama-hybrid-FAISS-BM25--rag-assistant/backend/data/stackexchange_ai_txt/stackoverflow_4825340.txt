DevExpress XtraGrid Problem

I want to show excel data in DevExpress data grid. The problem that I am facing is as follows:- I select one worksheet from excel work book and display it in data grid, this works fine but, When I select another worksheet from same same excel workbook it appends all the columns to the previous view. I want to remove all previous columns. I tried to remove from column collection but it did not work. I also tried to call PopulateColumns() method of the view but it also did not work. Please help. Thanks, Omkar
