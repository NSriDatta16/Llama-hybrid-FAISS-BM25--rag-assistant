Storing application runtime properties in a database

Is it a good idea? I've never seen it done before. The application in question is an enterprise project deployed as an EAR file on an app server. Properties include path to log file, name of JMS topic, etc. The intention being properties can be queried at runtime from the database, rather than having to redeploy the entire application, which might cause downtime and require developer/administrator attention. How else would I modify runtime properties of the enterprise application? Thanks.
