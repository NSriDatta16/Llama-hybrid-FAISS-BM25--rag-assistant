An alternative to "Granger Causality" test when (short) time series are not stationary?

I have two short time series (x and y), and I wish to find out if x "effects" (is correlated with) y. Obviously, since the two are time series, using a simple correlation is the wrong way to go. I would have used Grenger test, but when checking it appears that the series do not seem to be stationary (nor when I take their diffs). Any suggestion on how to deal with such a case? Here is a sample code with my data: # reading data DATA
