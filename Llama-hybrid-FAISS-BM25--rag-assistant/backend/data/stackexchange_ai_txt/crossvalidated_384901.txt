Why do you need an estimator of the variance $np(1-p)$ ? Recommendations would probably depend on context. An easier problem is to construct a confidence interval, see Confidence interval around binomial estimate of 0 or 1 . A simple ad-hoc solution to get a variance estimator when $X=0$ is to take the upper limit of that confidence interval, and base the variance estimate on that. To find an unbiased variance estimate which is non-zero when $X=0$ is probably hopeless (unless it is sometimes negative!) Proving that would be an interesting exercise. If these adhockeries are not good enough, then you could go for the Bayesian ideas mentioned in comments.
