upcast at runtime. (Morph from Base Class to derive Class)

class B{ private: int a; } class D: public B{ private: int b; } B* b = new B; Now for some reason I want turn b into a D* Type of Object. e.g. retain the information of B and become D with extra Informations required. What I am currently thinking of is. static_cast to do the upcasting. the additional attributes will be set to null or garbage. then assign the additional attributes manually. But this leads to a dangling pointer risk. If the copy constructor is not coded with enough care. So what else could be the proper Solution ? and is there any solution of the Puzzle if we think it from a PHP perspective ?
