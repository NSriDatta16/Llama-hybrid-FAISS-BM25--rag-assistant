Averaging ES from the same study in a MA

I'm completing a meta-analysis looking for an effect size for rates of forgetting for people with epilepsy vs controls. I've already decided to separately extract effect size for the verbal and non verbal measures used. However, some studies use more than one verbal measure, or indeed split their analysis for the same measure (e.g spatial recall, descriptive recall etc). What's the best approach for a meta-analysis and meta regression (of methodological quality and effect size)? Can I simply add ES for spatial recall and descriptive recall etc and then divide by 2 for an average for that specific measure? Can I get an average of two measures used within the same study for an overall ES of the study's use of that measure? Or is there a standard approach to resolving this issue? I'm also unsure how I would even enter an average ES to MA software, as I wouldn't have a p value for that average (but I have one for each measure used) I hope these garbled questions make an ounce of sense?! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
