Using MCA/PCA together?

If I have a large dataset with continuous, discrete, and categorical data, is it appropriate to use MCA on the categorical features and PCA on the continuous, separately? I'm preprocessing my data right now, and am currently one-hot encoding all my categorical features. This has added far more columns (3x) to my dataset than originally, is this a problem if I was going to use, say LDA or Random Forest for feature selection?
