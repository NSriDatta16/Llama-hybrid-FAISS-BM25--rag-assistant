Cross validation for time series classification

Relying on the documentation provided by scikit-learn ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation-of-time-series-data ), the TimeSeriesSplit method is implemented such that each training set is a superset of the previous ones. Can anyone provide theoretical justifications behind this choice ? Why not using training set of constant size (while still being careful about the time dependency of course) ?
