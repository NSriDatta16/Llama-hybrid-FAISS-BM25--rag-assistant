How does lme4 handle participants who only have data for only one level of a categorial variable

I'm using the lme4 package to assess the impact of a variable 'A,' which consists of three levels (1, 2, and 3), on the responses of 15 participants. My model is structured as follows: m Following the model fitting process, I realized that one of the participants only has data for Level 1 of variable 'A', but not for the other two levels. Unsurprisingly, this issue doesn't trigger any warnings because my dataset is organized in such a way that each row represents a response, ensuring there are no NAs in the dataset. I'm interested in understanding how lme4 handles this specific participant, especially in the context of estimating random slopes. Should I retain this participant's data in the dataset and rely on the model estimates, or would it be advisable to exclude their data altogether and re-run the model? Thank you.
