What is the difference between ANOVA and logistic regression using two groups?

So just correct me where I go wrong, but my understanding of the differences between ANOVA and regression analysis is that ANOVA is comparing two independent groups while regression is used on one group with independent observations . But then my question is: Imagine we have two groups of patients, group A and group B. We have variable "x" that we want to investigate whether there exists a difference in between these two groups. Now we could do an ANOVA but what would be the difference between doing this and simply making a binary variable with 0 denoting group A and 1 denoting group B and then running a regression with this variable as the dependent and "x" as the independent? Thank you!
