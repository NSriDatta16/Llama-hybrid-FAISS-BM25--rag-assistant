Is sqlite db file available under any platform?

For example, can I generate a SQLite db file and put it as a resource in the project. When the project first launches, copy the db into isolated storage without worrying this db file may be unavailable in the phone. Furthermore, can I copy this empty db file into another platform, like android or iPhone, and operate this db by in SQLite api of the platform.
