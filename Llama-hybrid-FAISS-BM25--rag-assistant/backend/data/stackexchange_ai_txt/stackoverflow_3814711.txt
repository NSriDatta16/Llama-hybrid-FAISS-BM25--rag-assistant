Merge Changes for specific Work Item

In TFS 2010 we have a development branch where all development is done for one product. I want to merge some of these changes to a release candidate branch, so it can be tested and rolled out. Therefore I would like to merge all changesets that are linked to specific work items we want to put into the release candidate. I can track all changesets for a specific work item but I cannot easily merge them into the RC-branch. I can neither drag more than one changeset in the hierarchy tracking view nor pre-select the changesets in the Merge Wizard. By default it always wants to merge all changesets UP to the dragged one, which is definately not what I want. Since it could be dozens of changesets I don't want to select them all manually. Is there any way to do this in the "right" way?
