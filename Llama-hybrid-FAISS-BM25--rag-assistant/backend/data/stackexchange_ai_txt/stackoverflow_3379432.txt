I had the same issue, encountering these two errors: integrity constraint violation (ORA-02291) "Can not insert entity with the same key if key is not database generated" The problem was that the child object's identity column was not set properly. If DotConnect LINQ does not assume an identity key, then objects properties seem to be set ad hoc, resulting in non-sequential updates, leading to integrity violations. Here's the fix: LINQ needs to know that the child's primary key is an entity key and auto-generated. In Oracle, setup an auto-incremented key for the child object. First create a sequence: DROP SEQUENCE MyChild_SEQ; CREATE SEQUENCE MyChild_SEQ MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999 START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 CACHE 20; Next create the OnInsert trigger: CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER MyChild_AUTOINC BEFORE INSERT ON MyChildObject FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT MyChild_SEQ.nextval INTO :NEW.MyChild_ID FROM dual; END MyChild_AUTOINC ; ALTER TRIGGER MyChild_AUTOINC ENABLE Modify the storage model to incorporate the new auto-generated primary key: In the EntityDeveloper for dotConnect, open your LINQ storage model (.LQML file). Set the child object's entity key to 'Auto Generated Value', and Auto-Synch to 'OnInsert'. Save the storage model, and in Visual Studio, clean and rebuild the solution. Remove any code that explicitly sets the child's primary key. LINQ will implicitly recognize this as auto-incremented, and retrieve the trigger-created ID. In code, after creating the child object, attach it to the parent, as below: ChildType newChild = new ChildType(); DataContext.InsertOnSubmit(newChild); Parent.Child = newChild; Here are further resources: Insert rows with incrementing primary key http://www.devart.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=45900 Problem on saving entity context with cascading sequence ORA http://www.devart.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=45850 Auto Increment column support (LinqConnect+Oracle) http://www.devart.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=18577 Cheers!
