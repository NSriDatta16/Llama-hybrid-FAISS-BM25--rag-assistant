Ordinal Logistic Regression and standardization

I am running Ordinal Logistic Regression on a data with Ordered Dependent Variables (1 to 5). In my multiple linear regression analysis, I have standardise my dataset with scale() before running lm command. Should I do so for Ordinal Logistic Regression or it is not relevant?
