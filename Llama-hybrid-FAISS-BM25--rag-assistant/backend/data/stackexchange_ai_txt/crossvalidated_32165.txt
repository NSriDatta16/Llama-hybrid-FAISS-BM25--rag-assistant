I agree with use4733. My planned answer was to be "ask the experts". Regarding this particular technique I personally can't say much because I hadn't heard of it before even though I have some expertise in time series analysis. However, since the references seem to all be over the most recent three years it could just be that it is a very new method. New methods in almost any field take time to catch on. So I don't think that you should assume that it is not useful. It may eventually prove to be useful.
