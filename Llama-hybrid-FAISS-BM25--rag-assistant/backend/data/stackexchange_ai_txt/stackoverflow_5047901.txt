This is a typical problem with "mobile agent" appearing in different places or using different providers (in this case just one provider, but it's almost the same). Usually it's solved using some kind of home agent - a server that the mobile connects to and gives details about how to reach it or if it can't be reached directly then the home agent acts as a proxy. Client always contact the home agent first and then if it is possible they contact the mobile or if it's not they use the server as a proxy. In some cases dynamic dns might be sufficient in other you need real proxy/ fa√ßade. There's a good book: Andrew S. Tanenbaum & Maarten van Steen :"Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms"
