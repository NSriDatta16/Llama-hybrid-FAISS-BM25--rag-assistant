PHP object overflow

I'm trying to organize classes in a project in a fashion similar to: $TheRoberts = new family; class family { public function __construct() { $bobby = new father; $cindy = new daughter; } } class father extends family { function PayBills() {} function GoToWork() {} } class daughter extends family { function AskForMoney() {} function GoToSchool() {} } Literature on the subject is pretty abstract, but, if I understand correctly, this is how it's done. Why, then, is PHP throwing errors about memory exhaustion and exceeding execution times? In short: why is the constructor looping?
