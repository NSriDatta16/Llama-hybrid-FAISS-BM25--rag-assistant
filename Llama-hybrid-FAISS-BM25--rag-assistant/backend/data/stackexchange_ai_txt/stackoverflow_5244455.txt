Best practices for SessionId/Authentication Token generation

I have seen people using UUID for authentication token generation. However, in RFC 4122 it is stated that Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants access), for example. I was wondering, what algorithms are used for example in Java and .NET for SessionId/AuthenticationToken generation. Is UUID indeed unsuitable for these purposes in an application that has more than average security needs?
