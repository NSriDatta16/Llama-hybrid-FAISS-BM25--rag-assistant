Complex analysis, Functional analysis for deeper understanding Machine Learning

I want to get deeper into the Machine Learning(theory and application in Finance). I want to ask how relevant are complex analysis and functional analysis as a basis for Machine Learning? Do I need to learn these subjects or should I concentrate myself on other topic (if so, on which?)
