Scrape a dynamic website

What is the best method to scrape a dynamic website where most of the content is generated by what appears to be ajax requests? I have previous experience with a Mechanize, BeautifulSoup, and python combo, but I am up for something new. --Edit-- For more detail: I'm trying to scrape the CNN primary database . There is a wealth of information there, but there doesn't appear to be an api.
