The original cookie specification of Netscape (see this cached version ) does not say anything about listing multiple cookie declarations. But as of Set-Cookie as defined by RFC 2109 allows a comma separated list of cookie declaration: Informally, the Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie:, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Each cookie begins with a NAME=VALUE pair, followed by zero or more semi-colon-separated attribute-value pairs. The same applies to Set-Cookie2 as defined by RFC 2965 : Informally, the Set-Cookie2 response header comprises the token Set-Cookie2:, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Each cookie begins with a NAME=VALUE pair, followed by zero or more semi-colon-separated attribute-value pairs. But since most user agents still follow Netscapeâ€™s original specification, I would rather suggest to just declare each cookie with its own Set-Cookie header field. This is also what the latest RFC 6265 reflects: Origin servers SHOULD NOT fold multiple Set-Cookie header fields into a single header field. The usual mechanism for folding HTTP headers fields (i.e., as defined in [RFC2616]) might change the semantics of the Set-Cookie header field because the %x2C (",") character is used by Set-Cookie in a way that conflicts with such folding.
