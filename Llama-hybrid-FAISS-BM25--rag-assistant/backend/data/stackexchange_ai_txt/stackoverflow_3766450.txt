I feel, what you are thinking may not be that elegant solution. Because 1) You can use reflection but which can result in poor performance. So, better not to go for it until, it is badly needed. 2) Also, tomorrow, if the columns to deal with in the result set changes then anyway you need to go and tweak the code otherwise your code may fail. So, better could be you can go for some ORM Framework as suggested by Ani.
