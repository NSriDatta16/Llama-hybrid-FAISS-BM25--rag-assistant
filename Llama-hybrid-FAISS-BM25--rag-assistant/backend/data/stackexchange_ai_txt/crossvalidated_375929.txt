Can the Eigen faces be negative?

I have checked several sites and found that eigen faces are Eigen Vectors. PCA transforms the faces into a new space such that the hyper plane is in the direction of maximum variance. I have attached a link which shows green and red arrows and some holes: Could you explain Eigen Faces and the holes I think represent the Eigen faces. So red arrow represents the principal axis. So its possible to see that some of the holes which have negative values can project on to the principal axes. But when we say that Eigen faces are vectors then their direction can be negative but magnitude cannot. Please guide me whether Eigen faces can have negative values? Zulfi.
