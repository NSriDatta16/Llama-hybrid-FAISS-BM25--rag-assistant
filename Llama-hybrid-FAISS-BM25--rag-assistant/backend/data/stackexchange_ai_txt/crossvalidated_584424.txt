Should I specify priors to increase the effective sample size for multimembership MCMCglmm?

I am wanting to use a multimembership MCMCglmm with the following model nsamp Sexpair has the following levels M_M, M_F and F_F. TrioML.R is a continuous covariate that I have mean centred. ID1 and ID2 indicate the individual identities for each dyadic observation. I haven't specified any priors so that all info comes from the data. This produces the following output sols I am aware that an effective sample of 100-1000 is ideal. As you can see for some covariates the effective sample size is much larger or close to 1000, while for other covariates it is quite low. I have tried adjusting the NITT, THIN, and BURNIN but the results are very similar (some covariates have a high eff. samp while others have a very low eff. samp). For 'SexpairM_M' and 'SexpairM_M:scale(TrioML.R)' there's very poor mixing of the chain: However, for all other covariates this seems to be ok. I think this might be because there is a lot of zeros for one of the response variables ('count.tog') for SexpairM_M - could this cause poor mixing of the chains? and I get the following for autocorrelation of the chains ID1+ID2. units Lag 0 1.0000000 1.0000000 Lag 100 0.22808372 0.4594582 Lag 500 0.14334204 0.2974043 Lag 1000 0.09248625 0.2163000 Lag 5000 -0.01672504 0.0178789 My questions are: (1) Is it essential to specify priors for this type of model, and, if so, how would I go about specifying priors for this type of model? (2) Will refitting the model with priors specified increase the effective sample size for the covariates with a small effective sample? (3) Should I be concerned about the interpretation of this model with some covariates with a low effective sample? If I fit the model with just the interaction term and a second model without the interaction term I seem to get a better result with the 'SexpairM_M' and 'SexpairM_M:scale(TrioML.R)' having a higher effective sample and better mixing of the chain. Therefore, my last question is (4) Would it be better to fit multiple models to increase the effective sample/mixing of the chain? I haven't been able to find much help online with the multimembership type MCMCglmm and I am new to Bayesian analysis so any help would be greatly appreciated!
