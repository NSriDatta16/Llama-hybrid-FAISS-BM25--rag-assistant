The issue seems to be mentioned in your first paragraph: I'm using jQuery UI for skinning my buttons . Whatever you're doing to skin your buttons also needs to be done to the newly loaded content. i.e. if you are doing something like this on pageload: $(function() { ... $('#zoneDiv button.my-button').button(); ... }); Then when the new #zoneDiv loads, all of the DOM elements that previously had the button function applied to them won't anymore. So you'll have to do something like this, add a callback to the load() function. This fires immediately after the new content gets stuck into the DOM: $('#zoneDiv').load('notifications.php #zoneDiv', function(){ $('#zoneDiv button.my-button').button(); });
