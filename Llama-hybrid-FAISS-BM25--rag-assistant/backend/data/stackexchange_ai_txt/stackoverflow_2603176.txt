Drag and drop + custom drawing in Android

I am working on something that needed custom drag-and-drop functionality, so I have been subclassing View, doing a bunch of math in response to touch events, and then rendering everything manually through code on the canvas in onDraw. Now, the more functionality I add, the more the code is growing out of control and I find myself writing a ton more code than I would expect to write in a high level environment like Android. Is this how it's done, or am I missing something? If I'm not doing anything fancy in the UI, the framework handles the majority of my interactions. Built-in controls handle the touches and drags, and my code is pretty much limited to business logic and data. Is there a way to leverage the power of some of the UI controls and things like animations while also doing some of it manually in the onDraw canvas? Is there an accepted standard of when to use one or the other (if indeed the two approaches can be mixed)?
