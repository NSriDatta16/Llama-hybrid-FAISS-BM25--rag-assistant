Which of the following is NOT true regarding eigenvalues?

I am having a hard time trying to figure out the correct answer to this question. Any insight? I don't understand this at all. Which of the following is NOT true regarding eigenvalues? Option 1: An eigenvalue indicates the amount of variance in the input data a component accounts for Option 2: Any component with an eigenvalue greater than 1 is formally significant Option 3: Eigenvalues are ordered in decreasing size Option 4: There are a number of ways to decide how many are meaningful My thoughts: Option 1 is the definition (I think), but do eigenvalues indicate variance in INPUT data or in general? Option 2, in the lecture our professor was saying that SPSS will automatically assume that eigenvalues greater than 1 are significant in some way, but what does "FORMALLY" significant mean? Option 3, this is true when inputting data in SPSS. Option 4, this is also true, you can use Monte-Carlo analysis or scree plot. Any ideas? EDIT: Speaking in terms of PCA, using SPSS as the data analysis program.
