What's the preferred method to optimize the maximum of the mean of an objective function?

As in linear optimization, where you have an objective function and constraints, but the goal is to maximize the mean of this function, not the sum. (I am primarily interested in binary optimization of 0 or 1.) Quick conceptual example: You have a number of stocks in a portfolio, with their expected returns in the objective function and then constraints limiting the selection. If you just optimize the maximum, even a .001% expected return will increase the total sum of returns, so this stock would be included. However, it lowers the average.
