To give you a general answer to your question, let me parapharse one of my old general managers: the opportunities of research are found in the outliers of the model you are fitting. The situation is similar to the experiment performed my Robert Millikan in determining the charge of an electron. Decades after winning the Nobel prize for his experiment, his notes were examined and it was found that he threw out a large number of data points because they disagreed with the results he was looking for. Is that bad science? If you find a few outliers, then maybe they are due to "statistical abberations". However, if you find more than a few outliers, you need to explore your data more closely. If you cannot attribute a cause for the abberations, then you do not understand the process and a statistical model will not solve your problem. The purpose of a model is to summarize a process, the model will not magically summarize a process the experimenter does not understand.
