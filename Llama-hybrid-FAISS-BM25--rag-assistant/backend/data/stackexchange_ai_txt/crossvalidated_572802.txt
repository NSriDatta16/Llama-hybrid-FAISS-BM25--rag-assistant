Logistic regression predictions dont work

I have this problem with logit, that when I want to create confusion matrix, it simply displays the real values in the first row and in the second row, there are never any numbers. I created a lot of models (individually for each country where I analyse occurence of an event 1-it happens, 0-it does not happen), but each logit has this problem. I guess I am doing something wrong. So far, I checked for all the necessary assumptions, the only thing I didn't do, was k-fold cross validation and I did not divide model on training and testing set. Could that be a reason? Could someone explain why?
