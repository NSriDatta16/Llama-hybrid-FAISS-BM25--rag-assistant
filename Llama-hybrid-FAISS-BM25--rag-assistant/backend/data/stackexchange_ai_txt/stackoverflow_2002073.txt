Most likely the reason it's coming up undefined is because when you have separate ready calls, the scope of the code inside those calls is different. I would reorganize my code. Any shared functions can be attached to the jQuery object directly, using $.extend. This is what we do for our application and it works well. See this question . Hope it helps.
