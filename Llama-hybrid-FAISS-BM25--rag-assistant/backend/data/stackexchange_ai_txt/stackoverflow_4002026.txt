Today, I got a downtime as the primary database server was gone down without any notice. Well, that's the first thing you should fix (with proper monitoring). (...) Is there exists a way by which, I can leverage hibernate library to enable this functionality? To my knowledge, Hibernate doesn't really provide any facility for this. Personally, I would investigate the fail-over support of MySQL and its JDBC driver. I can't provide a very concrete answer because I haven't implemented this with MySQL but here are some pointers: MySQL Failover Strategy using State Management, introducing MPP - Part 1 21.3.4.1. Driver/Datasource Class Names, URL Syntax and Configuration Properties for Connector/J 21.3.4.6. Using Master/Slave Replication with ReplicationConnection And, as mentioned at the bottom of the latest link above (and also in this comment ): You may also want to investigate the Load Balancing JDBC Pool (lbpol) tool, which provides a wrapper around the standard JDBC driver and enables you to use DB connection pools that includes checks for system failures and uneven load distribution. For more information, see Load Balancing JDBC Pool (lbpool) .
