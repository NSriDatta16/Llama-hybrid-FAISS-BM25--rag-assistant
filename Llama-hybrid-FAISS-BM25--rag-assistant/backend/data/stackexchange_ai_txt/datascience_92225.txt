By default, GridSearchCV provides a score of nan when fitting the model fails. You can change that behavior and raise an error by setting the parameter error_score="raise" , or you can try fitting a single model to get the error. You can then use the traceback to help figure out where the problem is. For the LogisticRegression , I can identify the likely culprit: the default solver is lbfgs , which cannot handle L1 or ElasticNet penalty. Use saga . I don't immediately see an issue with the XGBoost model or parameters. Get the error traceback using the first paragraph, and search/ask that as a separate question if needed.
