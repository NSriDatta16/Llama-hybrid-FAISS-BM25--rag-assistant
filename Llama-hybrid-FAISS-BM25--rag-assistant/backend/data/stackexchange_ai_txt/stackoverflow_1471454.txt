StoreKit In App Purchase invalid product identifiers

I am getting an empty array of product identifiers from SKProductsRequest . I did the following steps: Created a In App Purchase Test User account under 'Manage Users' in iTunes Connect Created some in app purchase products under 'Manage Your In App Purchases'. Loaded the app onto the iPhone, went to Settings â†’ Store and logged out of the regular store Set a breakpoint in the (void)productsRequest:(SKProductsRequest *)request didReceiveResponse:(SKProductsResponse *)response callback All the submitted Product ID's are in the response's invalidProductIdentifiers property. When submitting the request I tried both the Product IDs created during step 2 as well as those IDs prefixed with the Bundle ID. Thanks in advance, Raghu
