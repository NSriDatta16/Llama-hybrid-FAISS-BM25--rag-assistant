Placing touch areas on an image that is drag, pinch zoom capable

I'm looking for a way to place touchable hotspots on an image. The image (picture a desk phone with keypad, speaker button, hold, etc) is in a Framelayout wrapped within a RelativeLayout, and has a few buttons along the bottom. I need the image to be dragable, pinch/zoom-able, and have implemented that successfully following this article: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/how-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-2/1747?tag=mantle_skin;content I've tried a few ways to embed hotspots including this technique (from ip332): http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/ffabb722efac62b2 that uses points to determine the hotspots. But with the drag & zoom feature, this obviously doesn't work because the points change whenever you drag or zoom. I could try to manually adjust all of my hotspot locations within the onTouch method whenever a motion is detected, but that seems a bit too hairy to me. In a dream world, I'd like to somehow embed ImageButtons within the image and have the image and ImageButtons scale and move with the drag & zoom. ImageButtons would also allow the ability to give feedback (e.g. color change, etc) when a hotspot is pressed. Any suggestions?
