Variable scope confusion in C#

I have two code samples. The first does not compile, but the second does. Code Sample 1 (does not compile) public void MyMethod(){ int i=10; for(int x=10; x I understand why the compiler reports an error at Point1 . But I don't understand why it reports an error at Point2 . And if you say it is because of the organization inside MSIL, then why does the second code example compile? Code sample 2 (compiles) public void MyMethod(){ for(int x=10; x If the simple rules of variable scope apply in Code Sample 2, then why don't those same rules apply to Code Sample 1?
