conditionally overriding/rewriting a class in magento

I know that I can override/rewrite a model class from my module using the following syntax in the config.xml for my module.: Mycompany_Mymodule_Model_Myfolder_Myclass But what if I want this to be conditional (e.g. based on some setting in my modules adminhtml configuration section?) Is there any syntax for this? Alternatively is there a way for my rewritten class to get to the class as it was before my rewrite? (to allow it to call its "predecessor".
