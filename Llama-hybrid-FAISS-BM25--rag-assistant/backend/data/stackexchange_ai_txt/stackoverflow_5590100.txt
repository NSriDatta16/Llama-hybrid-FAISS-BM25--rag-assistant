How to find images by similarity, inside a SQL query?

I want to process images to establish say, 9 areas inside each one, then find the average color of each area, and then save it to a char field like this: 255,255,255,255,255,255,107,195,305 Then to find all the images similar to a given image, I have to calculate the distance between each pair of colors (comparing against the same areas), eg: The difference between these images is 1: 255,255,255,255,255,255,107,195,305 255,255,255,255,255,255,107,195,304 The difference between these images is 3: 255,255,255,255,255,255,105,195,305 255,255,255,255,255,255,107,195,304 My problem is how do I perform such a query, and order it by similarity? The field is just a string, with values separated by commas. Is it possible that a query like this could be fast? Or should I look for a different approach? We are talking about thousands of images Edit: As @therealsix, one option could be to put each average color value into a separate column.
