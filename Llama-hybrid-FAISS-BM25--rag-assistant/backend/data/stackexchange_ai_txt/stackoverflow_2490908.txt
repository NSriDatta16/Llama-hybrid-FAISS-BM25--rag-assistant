Ignoring the fact your elements should have unique ID attributes , there's one thing to always keep in mind: when you bind a function to an event -- for example $(selector).bind('click', function) or $(selector).click(function) -- only the elements in the DOM that match the selector at that specific moment in time will behave as you expect. If you add more elements that match the selector at a later time , these won't magically get associated with the desired behavior. This is one of the reasons the live() jQuery function exists, and I encourage you to take a look. An alternative approach is to manually bind your desired function to the elements you add to the DOM (like Felix showed you).
