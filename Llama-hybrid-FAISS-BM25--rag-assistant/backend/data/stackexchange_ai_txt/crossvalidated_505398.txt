Failed to obtain p value using Svyolr () function in R

I wish to carry out an ordinal logistic regression taking into account the weightings. With the help of the function svyolr of the survey package, I manage to obtain the estimates and confidence intervals. However, I am not able to estimate the p-values. Would you have a solution, please? library(survey) reglog
