The first property (IsSomething) is a boolean. It will be false by default. The second property, since it's a reference type, will default to null without any effort on your part. You don't need to touch the constructor, since reference types (classes) will automatically start off as null in .NET. If you wanted to use a non-default value, you'd have two options - First, use a backing storage field: private bool isSomething = true; public bool IsSomething { get { return this.isSomething; } set { this.isSomething = value; } } Second option - add it to the constructor. Note that the first option has no extra overhead - it's basically what the compiler does when you use an automatic property.
