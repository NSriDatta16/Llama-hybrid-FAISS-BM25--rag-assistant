A non-keyboard shortcut trick is to use commit sets in your Team->Synchronise view to organise your changes before committing. Set a change set to be the default, and all changes you make on files will be put in that set, making it easy to see what you have changed while working on a specific defect/feature, and other changes you had while testing etc.
