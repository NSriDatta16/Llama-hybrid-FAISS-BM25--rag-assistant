If you really need table as a column, you should read http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175010.aspx for a solution. However, this is highly unlikely that you really need table column datatype, as it is primarily used for temporary storage. If you don't know primary-foreign keys relationships stuff, you should take some time learning relational databases or have someone design a database schema for you based on business entities and your application needs. Otherwise you will end up with a design which is completely unmaintainable and mid term it will backfire on you. If you need a quick reading on PK/FK topic, please read http://www.functionx.com/sqlserver2005/Lesson13.htm . It should give you a knowledge required to tackle with this particular issue.
