Here's a real life example: a do it yourself (DIY) spring scale from Scientific American, where they explain how to make a spring scale, and how the underlying model is linear (within the elastic limit): the relationship between weight and distance is linearâ€”if you double the weight, the amount the spring stretches will double. Furthermore, they explain how to estimate a spring constant: Using Hooke's law and your data, can you calculate the spring constant, k, for your spring? Hint: k is the slope of a graph of force versus distance. This is a basic setup for univariate OLS with length on y-axis and weight on x-axis. It'll beat any machine learning on every level. Additionally, you have an experimental design where the design matrix X is truly fixed, and there's undoubtly a causal relationship present. These are the ideal conditions for OLS.
