Do I have look-ahead bias?

I have a prediction task at hand, and I'm deciding on how to sample my data and train a model with no look-ahead bias. Given a time series $Z$ , my task is to build a simple predictor of size $m$ (think of a causal autoregression $AR(m)$ , or anything else), that predicts the immediate next value in the time series. I'd like to then build the data matrix $\textbf{X}$ and the ground truth output vector $\textbf {y}$ , and solve the system $\textbf{X} \textbf{w} = \textbf{y}$ , in which $\textbf w$ are my model parameters as a vector. Here are my questions: Is it OK to have a sample (x,y pair) whose input ( $x$ -part) overlaps with the label ( $y$ -part) of another one? For example, let's say $m=5$ and assume one of my training samples (i.e., one of $\textbf X$ 's rows) is $x_1 = Z[0:5]$ with the corresponding label $y_1 = Z[6]$ . Wouldn't it be a look-ahead bias in my model if I have another sample like $x_2 = Z[3:8]$ with $y_2 = Z[9]$ , whose input includes the true label of the first sample? Is it considered the look-ahead bias? How can I avoid this to ensure my model is not informed by the labels at all? As pointed out in the comments, this is a textbook classical problem and is likely discussed in many references. I appreciate it if you also share these texts with me and future readers.
