Visual Studio Drag and Drop Arrangement of Web Controls

Just curious, I remember way back in the ASP.Net 1.0 Visual Studio 2002? days you could just drag a web control onto your visual web form interface to where you wanted it and it would fill in all the CSS styling to make sure that control was in the right spot when viewing the app in a browser. Did that go away? I haven't used it in years as I have been hand coding stuff, but for some quick and dirty prototyping I thought it might be useful. Is that capability gone, or do I need to enable that somewhere? Thanks for your time.
