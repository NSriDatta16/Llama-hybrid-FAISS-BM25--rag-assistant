You have just stumbled upon an existing method known as kernel matching. Although a promising method, it hasn't seen a ton of use and hasn't made a very big impact on the matching literature. Imbens (2004) describes it and other matching methods in his review of effect estimation methods. The method itself was described by Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998). This presentation demonstrates its effectiveness compared to other forms of matching with and without propensity scores. I actually have not seen an R implementation of it, which is a shame. I believe it is available in Stata using the kmatch library. Heckman, J. J., Ichimura, H., & Todd, P. (1998). Matching As An Econometric Evaluation Estimator.
