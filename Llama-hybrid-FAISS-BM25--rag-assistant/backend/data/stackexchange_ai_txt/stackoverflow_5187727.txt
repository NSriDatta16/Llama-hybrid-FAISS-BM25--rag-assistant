Some claim that the pragmatic benefit is that programmers will find it easier to understand if you explicitly compare against NULL, FALSE, 0, etc., whereas the logical operator may be confusing to people who don't understand how implicit conversions and booleans work in C/C++. (Disclaimer: I don't share this view myself. if (p) ... and if (!p)... are the idiomatic ways to express this in C and C++, and programmers who have trouble understanding them have no business touching C or C++ code. Heath Hunnicutt's comment is dead on.)
