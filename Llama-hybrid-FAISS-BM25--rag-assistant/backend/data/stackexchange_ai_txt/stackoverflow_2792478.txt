[Full disclosure: I'm on the team that helps create the code coverage tools in VS] Try collecting code coverage against a release build instead of a debug build. The compiler can emit IL that is actually unreachable after certain optimizations/transformations have been applied. The easiest way to see if this is the case is to look at the IL with ildasm or Reflector. See here for an example.
