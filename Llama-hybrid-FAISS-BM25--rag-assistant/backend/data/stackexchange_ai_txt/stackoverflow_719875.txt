As the silence on the topic implies, I suppose what I want is a little bit over the top for the default VCL drag&drop utilities. Anyway, to get the desired effect - that is to have more control over dragging operation, here's a way that involves capturing the mouse and processing the messages manually: SetCapture(Handle); try while GetCapture = Handle do { Process messages like mouse move, click, etc.. ie. Change the drag image when the control under cursor changes.. } finally if Handle = GetCapture then ReleaseCapture; end;
