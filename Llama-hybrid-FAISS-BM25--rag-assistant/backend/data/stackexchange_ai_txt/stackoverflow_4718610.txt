how can i clear or reset the preferences for Adobe Flash Builder?

I am using Flash builder 4 to both build and manage (via cvs) projects. In recent days my designer has been having trouble committing to CVS, leaving a project blocked. I have troubleshooted troubleshot tested CVS and it is working fine (others can commit and retrieve without a hitch). in an effort to start from scratch - I have removed the flash builder application (dragging it to the trash, its a Mac) as well as using the uninstaller (which does not work as well as I would have thought), but on reinstall - all preferences are still there - CVS connection and all. is there a file or set of files I can delete to reset all of the prefs for Flash Builder (built on eclipse if that helps)?
