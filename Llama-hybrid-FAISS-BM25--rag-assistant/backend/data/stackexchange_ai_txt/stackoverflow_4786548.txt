The dataType attribute is one of json, xml, html, jsonp, text, or script. Boolean isn't one of the expected types. In this case, you don't want to pay attention to those expected types. jQuery makes an intelligent guess about the type if you pass nothing in based on the MIME type returned by your server. What you want to do is create a function that will be called by the success callback. $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "http://www.server/path/to/update.php", data: "increase", success: function(data, status, xhr) { functionToProcess(new Boolean(data)); } )}; The function that is given as an argument to success (an anonymous function, in this case) is called when the Ajax call is complete with a 200 value. Because Ajax is asynchronous (that's what the A is), returning things will do you no good. What you want to do is call another function that will process your boolean value. This I've called functionToProcess in my sample code. For more information, check out the jQuery docs on .ajax() . You can learn about what String values in Javascript produce true versus false boolean values here .
