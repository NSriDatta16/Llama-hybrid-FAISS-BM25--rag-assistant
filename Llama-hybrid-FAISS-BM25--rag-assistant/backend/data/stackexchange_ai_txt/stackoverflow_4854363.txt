There's a pool(3) facility: pool can be used to run a set of Erlang nodes as a pool of computational processors. It is organized as a master and a set of slave nodes.. pool:start/1,2 starts a new pool. The file .hosts.erlang is read to find host names where the pool nodes can be started. The slave nodes are started with slave:start/2,3 , passing along Name and, if provided, Args . Name is used as the first part of the node names, Args is used to specify command line arguments. With pool you get load distribution facility for free. Master node may be started this way: erl -sname poolmaster -rsh ssh Key -rsh here specifies an alternative to rsh for starting a slave node on a remote host. We used SSH here. Make sure your box have working SSH keys, and you can authenticate to the remote hosts using these keys. If there are no hosts in the file .hosts.erlang , then no slave nodes are started, and you can use slave:start/2,3 to start slave nodes manually passing arguments if needed. You could, for example start a remote node: Arg = "-mnesia_dir " ++ M, slave:start(H, Name, Arg). Ensure epmd(1) is up and running on the remote boxes in order to start Erlang nodes. Hope that helps.
