For what it's worth, here is the way Flash Catalyst CS5 (1.0.0) organizes its packages and assets when it generates a FXP: src (default package) assets graphics images com.adobe.flashcatalyst.components components skins Where graphics contains any .fxg files, and images holds all other image files. An auto-generated .css file (in my case, for embedding a font), was placed inside the (default package) . I would assume that this is how the Adobe team would expect things to be organized. However, you may also want to check out how they do it in Flash Catalyst "Panini", since the big thing with that release is the two-way workflow with Flash Builder "Burrito".
