There is no one right answer for this question, as one would need to know, for your specific organization or application, how many of those contact methods the business wants to collect, how current they want the information to be, and how much flexibility they are willing to invest in. Of course, many of here could make some good guesses as to what the average business would want to do, but the real answer is to find out what your project, what your users, are interested in. BTW, all architecture questions about "best"-ness require this sort of cost, benefit, and risk analysis.
