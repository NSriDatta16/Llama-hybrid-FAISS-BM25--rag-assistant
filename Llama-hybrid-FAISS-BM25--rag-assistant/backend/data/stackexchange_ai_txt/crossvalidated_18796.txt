How can we detect trend in a time series apart from visual observation of time plots?

I'm novice in time series analysis and completely lost through reading so.. I have an enormous dataset of discrete time series of aggregated events and I wish to fit each one of them into ARIMA models. Therefore I have to ensure that the time series are stationary, which I do through adf and kpss tests. However I wonder if these tests also ensure that time series do not need to be tested for trend and seasonality. Is there any statistical criterion that reveals that a time series is trending? Visual inspection of time plots is difficult in this case out of the question * since the dataset is way too big. Thanks in advance, btw I'm an R user ;) -A
