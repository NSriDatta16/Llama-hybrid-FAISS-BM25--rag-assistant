Simple approximation of joint posterior

Consider the (hierarchical) Bayesian inference problem with two unknowns $(x,\theta)$ and data $y$. I'm using a very simple ("independence"?) approximation $$ p(x,\theta|y) \approx p(x|\theta_\star,y) \, p(\theta|y) \, ,$$ where $\theta_\star$ is the mode of $p(\theta|y)$ -- using other point estimates for $\theta_\star$ is also an option. Question : does this type of approximation have a name? Note that Unlike "Laplace approximation", I do not want to integrate out $\theta$. Unlike "Variational Bayes" I'm not approximating $p(\theta|y)$ and $\theta_\star$ is obtained in a much simpler fashion. I'm asking so that I may look up some literature on it. For instance, how might it compare to mean-field approximations? Edit: I think it might be appropriate to call it "empirical Bayes without marginalization". Still, any insights/opinions would be welcome.
