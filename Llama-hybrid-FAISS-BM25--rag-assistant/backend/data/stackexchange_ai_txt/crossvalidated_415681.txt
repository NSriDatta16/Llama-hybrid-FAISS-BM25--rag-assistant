So it appears that the result of surgery has been over-simplified down to a 0/1 outcome, meaning that a much larger sample size will be required in order to build a reliable model, e.g., at least a few hundred surgical failures. The choice of a model for binary Y is the binary logistic regression model. Multinomial logistic regression would be used if Y were categorical with more than 2 unordered possible values. You can use the 5 predictors in the binary logistic model without assuming they are equally important, i.e., without just counting the number present. To do a credible job will require a large amount of background reading. I suggest you start by reading Ewout Steyerberg's Clinical Prediction Models book as well as introductory papers or books on logistic regression.
