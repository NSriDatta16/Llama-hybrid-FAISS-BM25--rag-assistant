jQuery has no API that exposes prototypal inheritance the way it exposes the DOM. Check out http://moo4q.com . Moo4q provides a download that includes jQuery, 14k of MooTools for inheritence, and a Class mutator to automatically extend the jQuery prototype with your MooTools class. In other words, structure and organize your code with MooTools, manipulate the DOM with jQuery.
