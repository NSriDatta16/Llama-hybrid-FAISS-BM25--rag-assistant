Does MCMC perform better than a random walk?

I have read about and implemented a MCMC sampling based optimization for one of the optimization problems that I'm facing. It seems the "magic" of MCMC, and the "inefficient" behavior comes in when, the jump to the next set of parameter based on the ratio of the current and the last sample's probabilties compared against a random function. Unlike hill climbing, this seems to sample the distribution randomly regardless of whether it improves the optimization or not. I feel this is very similar to a random walk without looking at any criteria that improves the optimization. What makes the jump to the next set of parameters better in MCMC than a random walk?
