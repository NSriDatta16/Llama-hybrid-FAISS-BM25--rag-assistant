Likelihood function of DSGE model using Kalman filter

In Frank Schorfheide's class notes on likelihood functions of DSGE models , he expresses the value of the likelihood function for a given vector of parameters $\theta$ , and time series $Y^T$ as: $$p(Y^{T}|\theta)=(2\pi)^{-nT/2}\left(\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left|F_{t|t-1}\right|\right)^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^{T}v_{t}F_{t|t-1}v_t\prime\right\}$$ where $v_t$ is the innovation in $y$ $$v_t=y_t-\hat{y}_{t|t-1}$$ and the marginal distribution of $y_t$ is $$y_t|Y^{t-1}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\hat{y}_{t|t-1}, F_{t|t-1}\right)$$ I've just got a few questions about what these terms look like. First, does anyone have an idea what $n$ is in the exponent of the first term in the first equation? I think it might be a misprint, but I'm not sure. Second, what does $F_{t|t-1}$ look like? For an $n\times 1$ vector $y$ I'm picturing an $n\times n$ matrix, but what would the values of $F_{j,k}$ be equal to? I'm picturing the covariance between $y_{t,j}$ and $\hat{y}_{t|t-1,k}$ - is that correct? Lastly, I'm assuming from the results of my code that the value the likelihood function returns is a scalar, but it doesn't look like the formula produces one -- for an $n\times 1$ vector $y$ , wouldn't the second term in the first equation be $n\times n$ ? Or do you think it's meant to be the determinant of $F$ ?
