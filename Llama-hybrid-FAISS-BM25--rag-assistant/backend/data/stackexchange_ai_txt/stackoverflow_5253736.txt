There is currently no easy/elegant way to do this. Customisable app-labelling has been a sore point for some time. You can override admin/index.html and inject some javascript code to change the labelling. Note that you could also change admin.site.index_template to something like "admin/my_index.html" , which can then use {% extends "admin/index.html" %} to keep things DRYer. Of course there are other areas in the admin that "Auth" will appear also, such in "admin/app_index.html" , the breadcrumbs, etc...
