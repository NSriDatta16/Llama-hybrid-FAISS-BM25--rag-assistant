First, I would suppose that (in most cases) first differencing the log of a price time series will be sufficient to reach (approximate) stationarity. However, a bit of experimenting will also show you whether a first or second difference model is more useful in terms of forecasting. Second, to assess the best model for forecasting purposes, I suggest that you fit a variety of different models and compare them using some model selection criterion. For instance, in this paper they use three different model criteria to choose an appropriate ARIMA structure to forecast inflation in Ireland. Another approach is to fit different models and compare their out-of-sample forecasting abilities (for instance by comparing RMSEs). If you are only interested in forecasting, the model with the best forecasting ability will be your model of choice. However, I want to add that I'm pretty confident that both approaches will roughly point into the direction of the same model.
