Correlation among the independent variables in logistic regression?

I am having a hard time to understand whether the independent variables in a logistic regression have to have some degrees of correlation. I came across a report that mentioned that in SEM the IVs are assumed to be correlated. Is it the case for logistic and linear regressions too? I am asking this because I see that some authors show the correlation matrix of the IVs before a logistic regression while others do not. I use logistic regression in most of my studies so just want to be sure if I have to do so.
