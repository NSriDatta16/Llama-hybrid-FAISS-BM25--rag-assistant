You can either use AJAX calls from your real visitors to run scheduled jobs in the background (google for "poor man's cron", there are a number of implementations out there) or use some external cron-like service (for example a cronjob on some other machine). In theory you could just run a PHP script with no timeout and make it loop forever and fire off requests at the appropriate time, but the only thing that would achieve is reinventing cron in a very ineffective and fragile way (if the script dies for some reason, it will never start again on its own, while cron would just call it again).
