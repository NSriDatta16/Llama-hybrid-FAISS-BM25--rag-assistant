Mysql Join A table with with two other tables based on a flag column

I have a table which contains messages from both users and organizations. The table contains a field called usertype which indicates whether the message was sent by a user or an organization. I have to join this table with two tables containing user details and organization details respectively. How can i write a join query with thes 2 tables? I think i can achieve this via a union, but can it be done using only joins? Table - USER fetch : user name Table - Organization fetch : organization name Table Messages - entries userid , usertype. have to get username by checking datatype
