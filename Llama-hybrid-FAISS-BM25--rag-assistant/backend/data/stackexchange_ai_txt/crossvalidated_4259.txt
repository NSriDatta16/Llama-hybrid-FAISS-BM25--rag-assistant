Tips and tricks to get started with statistical modeling?

I work in the field of data mining and have had very little formal schooling in statistics. Lately I have been reading a lot of work that focuses on Bayesian paradigms for learning and mining, which I find very interesting. My question is (in several parts), given a problem is there a general framework by which it is possible to construct a statistical model? What are the first things you do when given a dataset of which you'd like to model the underlying process? Are there good books/tutorials out there that explain this process or is it a matter of experience? Is inference in the forefront of your mind when constructing your model or do you first aim to describe the data before you worry about how to use it to compute? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
