I had this exact same problem but only when the hidden element was a . I tried everything on this page but the only thing that worked was using overflow:hidden; . But the problem with using overflow:hidden; is that the upper & lower spacing created by the paragraph element was suddenly removed thereby making the layout ugly. I changed my hidden element from a to a and removed the overflow:hidden; ... it worked without messing up the layout and the jumping problem did not return. EDIT: On a new site I was determined to use a hidden and I discovered some things about this issue... 1) When div contains p or ul or similar the jumping occurs. 2) When the div only contains text, a links and/or images, no jumping animation. 3) Removing all margins & padding from the elements within the hidden div clears up the issue. Other things like line-breaks can be added to compensate for the lack of padding & margins... not ideal but the animation is smooth again.
