PHP has \h for horizontal whitespace characters only: http://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php According to http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt : For compatibility with Perl, \s does not match the VT character (code 11). This makes it different from the the POSIX "space" class. The \s characters are HT (9), LF (10), FF (12), CR (13), and space (32). If "use locale;" is included in a Perl script, \s may match the VT charac- ter. In PCRE, it never does. So if "Vertical space" refers to vertical tab, the answer is no. The sequences \h, \H, \v, and \V are features that were added to Perl at release 5.10. In contrast to the other sequences, which match only ASCII characters by default, these always match certain high-valued codepoints in UTF-8 mode, whether or not PCRE_UCP is set. The horizontal space characters are: U+0009 Horizontal tab U+0020 Space U+00A0 Non-break space U+1680 Ogham space mark U+180E Mongolian vowel separator U+2000 En quad U+2001 Em quad U+2002 En space U+2003 Em space U+2004 Three-per-em space U+2005 Four-per-em space U+2006 Six-per-em space U+2007 Figure space U+2008 Punctuation space U+2009 Thin space U+200A Hair space U+202F Narrow no-break space U+205F Medium mathematical space U+3000 Ideographic space The vertical space characters are: U+000A Linefeed U+000B Vertical tab U+000C Formfeed U+000D Carriage return U+0085 Next line U+2028 Line separator U+2029 Paragraph separator
