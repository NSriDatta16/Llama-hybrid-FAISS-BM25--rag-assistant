The first question that needs to be asked is: have you been able to detect any impact from lockdowns before vaccines were ever even rolled out? I have come across ~30 odd published papers/journals that have concluded that lockdowns do not have any positive impact in delivering any reduction in number of deaths due to the virus, number of hospitalisations, number of infections etc. What I have observed in official government data (depending on which country we're referring to) is the strategic implementation of lockdowns whenever the curves were already naturally dropping down again and subsequently using those observed reductions in the numbers as a means of justifying the lockdowns. I am going to guess that we also won't be able to detect any major difference in the number of overall deaths due to the rollout of the vaccine. The vaccines might be effective, but since the people who are prone to dying from COVID are also very prone to dying from any other infection and/or natural causes, this claim can be backed up by looking at the QALYs lost for those who died from COVID. The average age of death for COVID deaths are in almost all instances approximately 1 year above that of the country's life expectancy.
