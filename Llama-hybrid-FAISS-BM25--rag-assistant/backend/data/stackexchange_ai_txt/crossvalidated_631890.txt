How to predict outcome with zeros, and both negative values and positive values in ML model?

My Outcome is quarterly sales, which is right_Skewed and the range of it is large b/c different groups purchased differently. For Example, there are lots of groups that made zero or less than 10 purchases, but also some made 10,000 purchases. The negative values means some people return more than purchases. I have tried random forests and linear regression, and both of them have a huge RMSE, which is more than 200. I have no idea about which models would apply my model and how to deal with these negative values.
