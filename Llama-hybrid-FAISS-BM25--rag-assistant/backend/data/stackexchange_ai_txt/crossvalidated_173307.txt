Example for MLE for linear regression

I am taking the course on Machine Learning and unable to grasp the concept of MLE for linear regression. Can anyone give some numerical example ? Most of the content I read on internet was theoretical. Following is my understanding : For estimating MLE I will need input variable vectors (say X ), Output variables (Y), and σ². If Model is Y = (A1) + (A2)X + e, then I have to maximize P(Y|X,σ²) and find out value for A1 and A2 is this correct? Thanks.
