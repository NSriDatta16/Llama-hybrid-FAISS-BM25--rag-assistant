If I understand your description correctly, I would say you are more likely to see a significant coefficient $\hat{\beta}$ by including a random effect. The reason is that with the introduction of $\gamma$, you now explicitly distinguish between-year variability and within-year variability. The overall variance in your data $V$ now has 2 parts The variability from $\gamma$: $V_\gamma$ The variability from $\epsilon$: $V_\epsilon$ Without a random effect, $V_\gamma =0$ and all variability is attributed to $V_\epsilon$. The variance of the fixed effect estimator $\hat{\beta}$ is actually proportional to $V_\epsilon$. If you introduce random effects, $V_\epsilon$ will be smaller meaning $\hat{\beta}$ will have a short confidence interval (recall the confidence interval is inverse proportional to the square root of variance), thus a smaller pvalue. Having said that, I am not sure why you want to include a random effect at the first place. My understanding is that the purpose of using random effect is to introduce correlation structure in your covariance matrix. In your case, $\gamma_j$ will make sure observations within a year are positively correlated. However, this is already achieved by using a time series model. If you extend the expression of $\log(\mu_{i,j})$ in term of $\epsilon_{i,1... j}$ (assuming no random effect) and calculate covariance between $\log(\mu_{i,j})$ and $\log(\mu_{i,k})$ for any $j \ne k$, you will find they are always positively correlated. That is the purpose of time series models. Random effect models are essentially doing the same thing, except for using some different techniques and being designed for a particular type of data (a few time points but multiple sequences).
