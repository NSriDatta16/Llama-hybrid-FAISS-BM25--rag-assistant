MsBuild Task: Register Com Component on remote/deployed-to machine?

I am currently still fiddling with our msbuild & deployment script and one of the steps is to register a (legacy) com component on the machine the code is deployed to. Is there any 'elegant' way to accomplish this or would I have to call the regsvr32.exe via wmi on the remote machine?
