How to share state between Azure instances?

I want to use a global data for MVC web application running on Windows Azure (e.g. something like a list of users having new messages). For a normal webapp, I could use some per-appdomain storage like AppDomain.SetData or just static variable. What should I use for Azure instead (cache? blob storage? queues?) and what solution would be the fastest one?
