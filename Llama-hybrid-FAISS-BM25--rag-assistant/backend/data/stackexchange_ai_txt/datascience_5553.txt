I teach a Business Analytics course that includes SQL and Excel. I teach in a business school so my students aren't the most technically capable, which is why I didn't use something like R, Pandas, or Weka. That being said, Excel is a powerful enough tool to use for some data analysis. It gets most of this power from its ability to act as a front end to SQL Server Analysis Services (a component in SQL Server for data analysis) using the Data Mining Add-In. SSAS lets you construct decision trees, perform linear and logistic regressions, and even make bayesian or neural networks. I've found that using Excel as a front-end is a less threatening approach to doing these kinds of analyses since they've all used Excel before. The way to use SSAS without Excel is through a specialized version of Visual Studio and that isn't the most user friendly tool out there. When you combine it with a few other Excel tools like Power Query and Power Pivot, you're able to do some fairly sophisticated analysis of data. Full Disclosure, I'm probably not going to use it again when I teach the new version of the course next year (we're splitting it into two courses so one can focus more heavily on data analysis). But that's just because the university was able to get enough licenses for Alteryx which is even easier to use and more powerful but is $4-85k/user/year if you can't get it free somehow. Say what you will about Excel, but it beats that price point.
