How many lists do you expect to need to merge? It looks like your algorithm will not be efficient if you have many different lists to merge. This line is the issue: var min = enumerators.OrderBy(t => orderBy(t.Value)).FirstOrDefault(); This will be run once for each element in all the lists, so your runtime will be O(n * m), where n is the TOTAL number of elements in all the lists, and n is the number of lists. Expressed in terms of the average length of a list in the list of lists, the runtime is O(a * m^2). If you are going to need to merge a lot of lists, I would suggest using a heap . Then each iteration you can remove the smallest value from the heap, and add the next element to the heap from the list that the smallest value came from.
