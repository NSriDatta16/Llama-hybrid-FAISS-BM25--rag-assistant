Standard deviations aren't "good" or "bad". They are indicators of how spread out your data is. Sometimes, in ratings scales, we want wide spread because it indicates that our questions/ratings cover the range of the group we are rating. Other times, we want a small sd because we want everyone to be "high". For example, if you were testing the math skills of students in a calculus course, you could get a very small sd by asking them questions of elementary arithmetic such as $3+2$. But suppose you gave a more serious placement test for calculus (that is, students who passed would go into Calculus I, those who did not would take lower level courses first). You might expect a lower sd (and a higher average) among freshman at MIT than at South Podunk State, given the same test. So. What is the purpose of your test? Who are in the sample?
