You should lock the db instead of using a Mutex since there is always a possibility that other applications might access the same resource. Even if you know it's only your dll and application that currently accesses the resource, someone could write an application to access the same resource and break the scheme. Have a look at SQLite PRAGMA (locking_mode and synchronous).
