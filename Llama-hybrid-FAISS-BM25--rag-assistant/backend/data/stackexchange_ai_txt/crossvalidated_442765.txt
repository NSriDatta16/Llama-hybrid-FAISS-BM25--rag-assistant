Putting the three time points as three times as many cases does not require assuming independence. Identically replicating three times the measurements obtained at a single time point would essentially produce the same factors as the factor analysis on that single time point. Therefore independence is not a problem. Presenting the three time points as three times as many cases will actually give more variance to those variables evolving across times, which will make the underlying evolving factors more salient. What the analysis of the pooled replicates will do is to work out common factors that inform the fifteen variables, causing them to be correlated. The contribution (weights) of the factors to the variables will be the same (i.e. common) across all measurement times. Once the factor scores are calculated for the 300 'cases', these scores may then be reorganised into three expression occasions for each of the 100 cases and submitted to repeated measure analysis (ANOVA or MANOVA, for instance). If you plan to use the Next Eigenvalue Sufficiency Test (NEST, Achim, 2017) to determine how many common factors are required for your analysis, I recommend applying NEST on the average of the three measurement times, since NEST needs to know the correct number of independent caases.
