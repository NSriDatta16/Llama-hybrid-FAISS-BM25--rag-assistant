Neural Network and H2O.ai: inputs that have multiple right answers (questions about a previously answered question)

I have two questions related to this previously answered question. Can someone explain how the NN's backproagation algorithm would not be able to function properly when inputs have multiple right answers? I have a similar problem where in a data set, there are times when the inputs result in a certain output, and other times when the inputs result in a completely different (but equally valid) output. I am trying to use H2O.ai to train a model on this data, but am new to the platform. Does anyone know how this can be done? Thanks :)
