Though there are lots of great resources for what you are asking, I really want to recommend Prof. Gilbert Strang's MIT 18.06 and matrix methods in machine learning to you if you are not aware of that. It's on Youtube. I watched his lectures at the beginning of my graduate study like watching movies, he is a great lecturer. A complementary resource I would recommend is 3Blue1Brown's youtube channel . Following that you'll have a solid understanding of system of linear equations geometrically.
