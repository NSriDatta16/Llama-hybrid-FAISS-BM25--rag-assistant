Every once in a while I run across code that is so elegantly partitioned, has such compellingly obvious method, field and variable names that everything I need to know is obvious from the code. In the general case, only really great code gurus write such code. The rest of us cobble together something that works. If you're a really great code guru, don't bother sullying your divine code with superfluous comments. If you barely know what you're doing, be careful to document your blundering attempts so others can try to salvage the mess. If you're average (and most of us are, sort of by definition) then leave some hints in comments for yourself and others to make things easier at maintenance time, but don't insult anyone's intelligence and waste space by documenting the REALLY obvious. Ideally, your comments should describe your code at a meta-level, indicating not what you're doing but why. Also how, if you're doing something unusual or tricky.
