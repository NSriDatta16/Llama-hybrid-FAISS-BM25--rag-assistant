In statistics, you generally distinguish between population and sample . The population is the set of all possible measurements, that can ever be taken. The population is therefore closely related to a random variable. A sample, on the other hand, refers to some actual measurements collected from the population. So for a 6 sided dice, the population would be the infinite number of rolls ever to be performed. A sample is when you roll the dice $N$ times. Standard deviation (as well as expected value) is a description of the population (or the random variable). How much can you expect the individual measurements from the population to be spread. True standard deviation can only be calculated if the underlying distribution of the population is known (it usually is not). From a sample, the standard deviation can only be estimated . Standard error is a measure describing all possible samples (so basically the population of samples). Assume the six sided dice again, and you do 10 rolls and get the mean. It should vary around three, but each different sample of 10 rolls will give you a different mean. So the mean here is an estimator of the expected value. How much it varies is the standard error of the mean. Basically, it is asking "what would be the error on average, if I use this estimator". Similarly, if you just add the 10 rolls instead of taking the mean, you get an estimator of the sum of 10 arbitrary rolls. The expected value would be around 30. However, each sample of 10 rolls will give you a different estimate. The error of the estimator (based on each sample) is the standard error of the sum. So standard deviation is a description of a population, standard error is a description of an estimator (which is actually a random variable, so it also has a population). Basically the standard error is the standard deviation of the estimator. Finally, since the standard error describes a random variable, it can only be estimated based on a sample, so the usual formulas to get the standard error from a sample are actually calculating another estimator for the true standard error.
