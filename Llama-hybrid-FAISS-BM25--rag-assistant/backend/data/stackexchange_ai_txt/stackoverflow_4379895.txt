Tree of grammar

I have a lab in the university. But I don't understand how I can do it. I have a grammar of some language(for example, arithmetic expressions grammar). I must build tree of this grammar(I don't know how). Then I must determine, whether input sentence is sentence of this language? How can I do it? P.S. I've read few chapters of Dragon Book, but I havn't found anything I need. P.P.S. I can't use lex/flex and yacc/bison. EDIT Sorry! I shuild be more attentive. Really I have a grammar and I must build tree using this grammar and input sentence(I understand how to do it) if it possible(in another case I must show message about it). Is there any simple for understanding algorithms for it? I can use grammar of any simple language like arithmetical expressions.
