I'll answer my own question: Turns out (obviously), that going through the django code itself is a lot of help. My SqlCTR call had: is_ordinal = True which the comments in the django code state: is_ordinal, a boolean indicating if the output of this aggregate is an integer (e.g., a count) while I needed is_computer=True is_computed, a boolean indicating if this output of this aggregate is a computed float (e.g., an average), regardless of the input type.
