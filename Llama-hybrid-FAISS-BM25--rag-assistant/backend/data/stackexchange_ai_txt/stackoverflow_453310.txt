ASP.NET Web application security in VDS hosting

We are designing asp.net web application in wcsf. Web application will be deployed to Windows Server 2003 shared VDS hosting. Web site will be used for b2b, monthly service fee and credit card transactions used in web application so it must be secure site. I want to consider what must be done before deployment and i need an answer to a few questions: 1) How can i copy protect my site & my code. Is code signing enough? What should i do for reflector protection? Obfuscation is enough? 2) What about Windows Server 2003 VDS hosting pros & cons? 3) MS SQL Server 2005 Express is suitable for that kind of business use? Limitation of mssql express (4GB storage and 1Gb ram) cause bottlenecks in website? 4) Can I transfer database from express edition to mssql 2005 workgroup edition in the future without problem?
