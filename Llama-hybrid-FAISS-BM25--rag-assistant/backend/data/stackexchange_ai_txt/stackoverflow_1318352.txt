The most straightforward model for this would be an associative table in your database. You'd thus have: paragraphs (paragraph_id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, paragraph_text TEXT, ...) ENGINE=InnoDB; paragraph_countries (paragraph_id INT UNSIGNED, country_code CHAR(2)) ENGINE=Innodb; When saving the paragraph settings, perform these steps: BEGIN WORK (to start a transaction) DELETE FROM paragraph_countries WHERE paragraph_id = ... (foreach checked country): INSERT INTO paragraph_countries (...) COMMIT (to commit the transaction) To select paragraphs relevant to the current country, simply JOIN to the associated table with the appropriate country code.
