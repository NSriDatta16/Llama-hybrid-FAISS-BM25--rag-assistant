First of all, you need some training data from the past. Meaning, a collection of old news and the state of the trend to analyze at different points in time. Then, you have to decide how to quantify this information. If the trend is something like "Sold mobile phones", you can just take the number of sold mobiles. The news are harder to quantify. For example, you could measure the word frequency in the training news and take the n least frequent words as features (similar to SPAM filters). After that, you train a classifier on these features and trend from the past. A good one is the "Random Forest" algorithm, since it is practically parameter-free. You will need a lot of background knowledge to actually implement this plan. "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedmann is a good book to learn from. It can be downloaded for free on the authors' homepage.
