C++ HTML template framework, templatizing library, HTML generator library

I am looking for template/generator libraries for C++ that are similar to eg. Ruby's Erb, Haml, PHP's Smarty, etc. It would be great if I it would sport some basic features like loops, if/else, int conversion to strings, etc. Parameter passing to template rendering engine is also important if I could pass all of them in a hash map instead of calling some function for each of parameters. Do you have any recommendations? I can see also the possibility of embedding languages like Lua, however I haven't found a templatizing library for that either.
