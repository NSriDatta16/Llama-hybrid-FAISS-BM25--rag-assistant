Detect exact position of a word or number in a sentence with machine learning

I'm trying to come up with an ML model/s to detect if a sentence has sensitive data(telephone number, IBAN, address, etc.) and also get the position of said sensitive data. For Example "My name is Peter and my telephone number is 0123456789. Have a nice day." The End result should look like this: "My name is Peter and my telephone number is XXXXXXXXXXX. Have a nice day." My first idea was to split this into different models. First I have a model which detects if a sentence contains a telephone number or IBAN or both. Then I want another model which can find me the specific position so I can redact the target with no other information loss. I managed to get the first model somewhat working with okay results but I'm out of ideas for the second one. At the moment I mainly use TensorFlow/sci-kit.
