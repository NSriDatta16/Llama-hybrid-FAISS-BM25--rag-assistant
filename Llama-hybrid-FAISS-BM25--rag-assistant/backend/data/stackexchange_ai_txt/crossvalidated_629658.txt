In logistic regression you model the log-odds of the probability that an observation belongs to one of two categories using a linear model. You can use this model to estimate the log-odds given a set of observations of your predictors and you can transform these estimated log odds to probabilities. But this does not imply that you can transform the coefficients of your linear regression of the log odds individually using the logit formula and get probabilities. Your transformed coefficients cannot be interpreted as probabilities as you suggest and the effects provided by the allEffects function aren't probabilities either. Effects often measure the marginal impact of an one unit increment of one predictor on the estimated log odds and hence on the probabilities while keepong all ither predictors fixed. The output from allEffects are not effects in the usual sense. For more information see Noah's answer. Thank you for clarifying this. I suggest that you revisit some resources on logistic regression. See for example https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/soga-r/Basics-of-statistics/Logistic-Regression/Logistic-Regression-in-R---An-Example/index.html
