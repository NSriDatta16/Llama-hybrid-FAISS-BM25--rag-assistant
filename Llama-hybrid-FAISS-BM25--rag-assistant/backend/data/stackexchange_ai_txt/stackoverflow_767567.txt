What to test in unit testing, a method or a scenario?

What to test in unit testing, a method or a scenario? If test each method then minimal test case setup is required. If test a method which calls other methods then setup required for the test case is huge. If unit-tests for the individual methods are already there then why to write for this method which is using them? But then it also have little bit of functionality which should be tested. Also the code coverge tool will complain about coverage percentage. Please provide your practical inputs.
