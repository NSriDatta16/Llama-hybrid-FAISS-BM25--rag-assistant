regexp-to-DFA algorithm

I'm writing a regexp-based lexical analyzer generator based on a regexp-to-DFA direct translation algorithm described in the Dragon Book. It calculates the nullable , firstpos , lastpos , and followpos functions for concatenation, alternation, and kleene-star nodes. I want to add quantifiers for + (one or more times) and ? (zero or one time). nullable , firstpos , and lastpos are easy to calculate, but I'm not sure about followpos . Is it better to not implement those quantifiers as part of the parsing stage, and instead rewrite it in the lexical analysis stage (I think this is only "syntactic sugar" to kleene-star and alternation)?
