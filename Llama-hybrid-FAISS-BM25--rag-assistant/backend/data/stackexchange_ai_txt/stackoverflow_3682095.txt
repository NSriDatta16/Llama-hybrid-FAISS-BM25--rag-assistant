Is obexpushd a program that you can change? If so, the easiest thing to do would probably be have obexpushd write to temporary file, then rename the file when it's done writing. That would be something you could monitor in your Qt program. A more robust and elegant way would be to have obexpushd communicate with your Qt program, maybe via dbus, to explicitly say when it's done. If obexpushd isn't under your control, then one of the strategies you've listed is probably your best bet.
