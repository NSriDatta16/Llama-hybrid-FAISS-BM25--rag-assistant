Next year forecasting with monthly data from many, correlated, non-monotonic trends

I have trend data from many health departments in a local territory (eg. cardiology, orthopedics, etc...). These trends represent health service (visits, diagnostic, admissions) production, service value (proxy of type of service), and ratio of such service consumed by patients in our territory versus those consumed in other health providers than us, per department (eg. how much our patients have hip surgery in our hospitals versus other hospitals). I would like to predict for each department or group of departments (all diagnostic or all surgery departments) those values for the next year. I have monthly data from the previous ten years. Since there are many unmeasured sources of variability I can't expect to make long term predictions, by just one year is enough. Also, these trends have many change points (change of organization, personnel, technology), so I can mostly hope to predict the next year value once a new trend has started, predict for how long it will grow, reach a tipping point or going down. I guess the model for each department could learn from previous growth and fall dynamics from his own past trend data and from the trends of other departments with similar dynamics and adjust for month related activity level, plus from information on where the service was provided. Which model should I use for such a problem? I thought about a multilevel model for time series, but I guess there are more raffinate solutions.
