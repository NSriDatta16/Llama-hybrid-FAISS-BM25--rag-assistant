Implications of Stationarity and Causality in AR model

From my understanding, an AR(p) process is causal implying that the process can be written as an infinite sum of linear combinations of previous White Noise. So, graphically, would expect the time series to hover around the mean of the process. However, I'm curious what does it mean when the AR(p) process is stationary but not causal? I.e, the roots lie within (but not on) the unit circle).
