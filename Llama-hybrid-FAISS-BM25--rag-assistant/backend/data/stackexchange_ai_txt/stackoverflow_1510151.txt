The sharing of declarations is considered bad practice as it's easy to miss a variable in a list; with one-declaration per line the eye scans down, without needing to stop and examine some lines more than others. The other reason is that it encourages people to declare all their variable at the top of the method / class, rather than declaring them late to assist the GC.
