MCMC and data augmentation

I have been looking at an MCMC data augmentation question; the general form of the question is as follows: Suppose data gathered on a process suggests $X_{i} \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)$ and a prior for the rate parameter is suggested as $\lambda \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_{0})$. The data is recorded and presented in a typical form (i.e. the number of occurrences of each value for $X_{i}$ from $0$ to $n$), however, the data gathered does not discriminate in instances where $X_{i} \leq 1$ (i.e. all occurrences where $X_{i} = 0$ and $X_{i} = 1$ are grouped into one category). Given the data, the likelihood and the prior described above, the question asks for: The posterior form of $\lambda$, The number of occurrences where $X_{i} = 0$. I'm not really sure how to answer this question, but I am aware that Gibbs Sampling can be used in data augmentation. Does anybody have any information on how this could be done? EDIT: I should specify that it's primarily the second part (the number of occurrences where $X_{i} = 0$) that I'm unsure about. For the first part (the posterior form of $\lambda$), given the likelihood and the prior suggested, I have reasoned (although I'm happy to be corrected): Given: $$ \pi(\lambda|\vec{x}) \propto p(\vec{x}|\lambda) \times p(\lambda) $$ So, for the model given above: $$ \pi(\lambda|\vec{x}) = \frac{\lambda^{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}!}e^{-n\lambda} \times \lambda_{0}e^{-\lambda \lambda_{0}} $$ Simplifying yields: $$ \pi(\lambda|\vec{x}) = \frac{\lambda^{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}!}e^{-\lambda(n+\lambda_{0})}\lambda_{0} $$ which is proportional to (and hence the posterior form is given by): $$ \pi(\lambda|\vec{x}) \propto \lambda^{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}e^{-\lambda(n+\lambda_{0})}\lambda_{0} $$
