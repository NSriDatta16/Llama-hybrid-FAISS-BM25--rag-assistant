I would like to suggest 2 more approaches. Store them in document storage (eg. mongoDB) - this method is recommended when your model files are less then 16Mb (or the joblib shards are), then you can store model as binary data. in addition, some ML libraries support model export and import in json (eg. LightGBM), which makes it a perfect candidate for storage in document storage. Advantages : easy tracking of model generation and easy access, Disadvantages : things will get messy if model object is too large. Store your model on object storage (eg. Amazon S3) - this method is good if your models are very large, in this case you get unlimited storage and fairly easy API, you pay more, that is for sure. Advantages : Unlimited space and ability to store arbitrary file formats. Disadvantages : cost, and the fact that to do it right you'll need to develop your own tracking system. good luck!
