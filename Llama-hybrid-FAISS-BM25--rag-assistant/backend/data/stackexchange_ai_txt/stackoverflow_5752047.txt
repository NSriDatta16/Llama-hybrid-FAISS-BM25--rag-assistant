we actually make a Magento extension which does exactly what you are looking for. For 3rd party access I would recommend setting up a new admin user account with only permissions set to view sales>orders, they can then log in, add the tracking number (if you want them to do that), and then print picklists for the relevant orders. They can print one where all items are combined by sku, and one where all orders are summarized by order. Give me a shout if you have any more questions. (our website is www.moogento.com)
