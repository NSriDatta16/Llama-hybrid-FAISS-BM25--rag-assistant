Jpeg 2000 and .net

I working in a activex control using .net for load it in a ie website. I need read a jpeg 2000 file but i don't want use a 3rd party dll because this will cause dependencies or embedding it make my dll very big. Anyone have idea where i can find a class .cs for embedded on my project, i need only read file, no write only read.
