The most important glaring correction is to the notion of having a desired precision of 10 within the actual mean. You cannot calculate that. You can set the desired precision of the statistic to within 10, but it may be more than 10 units from the actual mean more than 1% of the time (suppose the estimator or design is biased). Knowing the maximum may be irrelevant. For many distributions the average is the sufficient statistic for the mean, so the maximum $M$ is an ancillary statistic and gives no additional information. There are counter examples to this, but since you have not stated a specific distribution, we assume $M$ is ancillary as a base case. The other unknown(s) in this case are the standard error of the sample mean and the actual variance of the distribution. Assume they are $s^2$ and $\sigma^2$ . (the former can be used as a plug in estimate for the latter with degrees of freedom corrections). So with the current sample of $n$ the 99% confidence-interval-half-width (CIHW) of $\bar{x}$ is $\mathcal{Z}_{0.995} \sqrt{s^2}$ and by the addition of $q$ observations, that value is estimated to be $$\mathcal{Z}_{0.995} \sqrt{\frac{n s^2 + q \sigma^2}{n+q}}$$ . Set this value to 10 and solve for q.
