I'll go against some political winds here and say... If you don't need 16-bit Unicode capabilities, use varchar(MAX) instead of ntext . Using varchar(MAX) instead of nvarchar(MAX) will cut the storage and transfer time for the text field in half. If you are seriously network IO-bound (example: your "text field" is in the megabyte-range), you might consider using data compression: store a zipped version of the text in a varbinary(MAX) field rather than text. Thus, the shuffling of results over the network is all compressed. Compressing/uncompressing text is relatively straightforward in .NET and CPU cycles are usually cheap. (SQL Server 2008's new "compression" features really wouldn't help here... the traffic over the wire would be the same.)
