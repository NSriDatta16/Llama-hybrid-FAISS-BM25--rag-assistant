It's not completely clear exactly what you do want with your weighted standard deviation but I will presume you want the standard deviation of a single population from which you have drawn two samples, and for some reason (eg sampling method) you want to give more weight to one of the samples. The main point you go wrong is thinking that this can be created in some way from the standard deviations of the subsamples. Consider that the variance of the underlying population is a reflection of the average squared distance of each point from the pooled mean (not the two means of the two subsamples, which what sd(a) etc gets you). So you need an estimate of that pooled mean; and you need a weighted average of the square of the distances of each point from that pooled mean.
