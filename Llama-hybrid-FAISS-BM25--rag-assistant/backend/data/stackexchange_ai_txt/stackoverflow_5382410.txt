Gradle vs. Gant

I'm working on a Linux/Apache/MySQL/Grails application and have the choice of build tools. I'm looking at Gradle or Gant. They look very similar to me, so I'm not sure what differentiates them. What are the major differences between Gradle and Gant that would make me pick one over the other?
