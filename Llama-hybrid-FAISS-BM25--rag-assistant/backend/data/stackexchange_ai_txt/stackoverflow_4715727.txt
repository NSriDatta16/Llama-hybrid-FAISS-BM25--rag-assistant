This may not be the most elegant of solutions but I think it is a good start 1)Create a HttpModule. 2)handle the AuthenticateRequest event. 3)in the event handler check that the request is to the directory that you want to allow access to. 4)If it is then manually set the auth cookie: (or see if you can find another way now that you have control and authentication has not yet happened) FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie("Anonymous", false); 5) Oh almost forgot, you would want to make sure the auth cookie was cleared if the request was not to the directory that you wanted to grant access to.
