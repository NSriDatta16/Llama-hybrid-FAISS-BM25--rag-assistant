SQL Express Edition is still a server class database. It runs all the time as a service, and like any server-class database likes to a lot of resources. It's just not really a good choice for local desktop app. If you need a single user database use something like SQL Server Compact Edition, Sqlite, or even Access. I doubt you'd appreciate it if you installed a desktop app only to find it dragged a full sql server install along with it.
