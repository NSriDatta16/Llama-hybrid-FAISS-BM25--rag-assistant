Okay...in a nutshell you want to iterate over this loop once, figure out when you're "between 1's", and increment a counter. There's an additional trick or two, though...one "trick" is that you should pay special attention to keeping track of whether you've already incremented for a particular set or not. If your series is {1, 3, 5, 1}, you don't want to do something like: 1: don't increment 3: increment 5: increment // this is bad! 1: don't increment because you'll end up with 2, instead of 1. So keep track of whether you've already incremented with a boolean...call it something like "haveIncremented", and you'll end up with a line like: // if (haveIncremented is false) // increment my counter // set haveIncremented to true Then, of course, you'll need to make sure that you set haveIncremented set back to false again, when you start a new set. This will happen when you read in a new "1", and are now ready to start a new "set". I'm trying to walk a fine line between coding and explaining and helping. Hopefully this will help while not giving away the whole farm. Good luck.
