Generally speaking, there are two types of recommender systems. One is community-based , the other is content-based . In community-based , you are effectively telling a user, "you are a young female, here is content that other young females enjoyed". In content-based , you are effectively telling a user, "you liked content A, here is content B that was liked by people who also enjoyed content A". So, in your case, you would be looking to build a content-based system. That means that you will have to build a meta-data set based on user actions throughout your site. When someone watched content A, what did they watch after that? And then after that? What content made them leave? What content made them sign up for your site or buy something or do some other action on your site? What categories of content are likely to be watched together? When you can gather that type of metadata then you will be in a better position to create a model. Note that I believe that you can extract this from the sample data you posted, it's just a matter of how you organize it.
