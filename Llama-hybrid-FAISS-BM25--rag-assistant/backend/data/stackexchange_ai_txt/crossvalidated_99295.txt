@Tivie, you are into the realm of time series analysis. One of the pieces of baggage that comes with these kinds of data is a question about stationarity which is a property that time series may have, or may not have. To be a bit fast and loose with the concepts, stationarity implies that the (population) distributions underlying your time series data have (1) a defined mean (or a defined mean about some defined trend), and (2) a finite variance . If these two conditions obtain, then you can proceed with basic, possibly familiar, statistical approaches, such as a regression model of medical consultations as explained by time with user fee prices as an additional predictor. Unfortunately, if your data are not stationary, the basic statistical models break (usually with some form of spurious correlation ). You have not demonstrated that your data are stationary (using, for example a test for stationarity, such as the Dickey-Fuller test. There are many such, which one you need to use depends on the particulars of your data.) So the answer to your question is a provisional: No. You have not proved your theory. What happens if you data are not stationary? Such a condition is often referred to as 'non-stationary,' 'integrated' or even 'unit-root' (or 'nearly integrated' or 'nearly unit root') time series data. As mentioned above statistical approaches appropriate to stationary data don't work so well with non-stationary data. You will need to read up on appropriate time series models. There are many different approaches to modeling time series. I like De Boef and Keele's article because they show how many such time series models relate, and offer a decent general model to start with (the single equation generalized error correction model). There are also a number of time-series analysis textbooks, I have included a reference to one below. These tend to be a bit heavy on the level of required statistical chops. If you aren't quite comfortable, it might be time to call up an ally with time series analysis skills. References Banerjee, A., Dolado, J. J., Galbraith, J. W., and Hendry, D. F. (1993).
