I believe the minimum you need to have a WP show up in the "New" Part of the webPart Catalog, you need the dll in the "bin" folder (bin in the web dir, not the 12 hive :)) or in the GAC and a safe control entry. I would verify the Safe control entry: Assembly = name of dll NameSpace = well... The NameSpace where your WebPart class resides TypeName = the name of your webPart class You can wildcard the NameSpace and TypeName just to be sure you are getting there: ... Namespace="*" TypeName="*" ... I would also recommend signing the assembly and putting in a PublicKeyToken=... Also, try setting the trust level to WSS_Medium or Full. If this doesn't work, you can try adding a .webpart file to the wpCatalog folder in your web dir. Edit: Clarification
