Magento - custom Account/Registration Fields

I followed this tutorial: http://www.magento.cc/custom-accountregistration-fields.html to add fields in the registration form of a customer under Magento, I succeed to run the example with a checkbox in the frontend and the backend. I had at the backend a text field with 0 or 1 as value, but I would like to have also a checkbox as in the frontend. Anyone know what changes to do for this? Thank you.
