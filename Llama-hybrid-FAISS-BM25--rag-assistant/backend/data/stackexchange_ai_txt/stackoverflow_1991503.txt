I would not use C++ to teach OOP, because C++ is not exactly an elegant language and OOP is somewhat strange in C++. I'd prefer Java or Scala or maybe Python, which is a fine language for teaching. My first choice would be Scala, because of it strong concepts. There are no static members breaking oop, for example. Don't forget that teaching is more effective if programming is fun (C++ is not so funny). I would cover: What is the goal of OOP? polymorphism with inheritance and interfaces responsibility of an object encapsulation messages between objects
