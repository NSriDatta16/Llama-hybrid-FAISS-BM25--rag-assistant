In short, I wouldn't use either. If this model is to be used for loan origination purposes, I would exclude both variables ( grade and sub_grade ) since they won't be available at the time of assessment. This is because the grade (and subgrade) are assigned AFTER a loan has originated. In industry, the grade represents a mapping of the probability of default ( $PD$ ) to a 'rating band'. For example, if your $PD$ is in $(0.1\%, 0.2\%]$ , you'll be mapped to rating grade A2. This means grade is a proxy for the response. If this model is to be used for modelling expected losses or capital requirements, I also wouldn't use either predictor. This is because the grade will be a proxy for the response (since it's a mapping of $PD$ ). Ignoring what I said above, and assuming you did go ahead and try a build a model with these predictors then you should keep the following in mind. Assuming the grades are A to E, and within each grade you can have five subgrades, then this means the sub_grade column would have at least 25 different levels (A1, A2, ..., E5). If you just pump sub_grade through a logistic regression (for example), you would end up with 24 predictors straight away (since one grade would be absorbed into the intercept). In my opinion, you're just wasting degrees of freedom and producing an overly complex model for (probably) only a small amount of gain. If you just used only the grade column, you'd only have 4 predictors in the model. This model is much simpler and is much easier to interpret, which is extremely important when building models for credit scoring.
