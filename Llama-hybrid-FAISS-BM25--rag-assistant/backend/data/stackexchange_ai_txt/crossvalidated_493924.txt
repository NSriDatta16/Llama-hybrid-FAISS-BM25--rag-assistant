Each assumption has different ways of being addressed. Multicollinearity in real data is essentially a numerical issue : numbers become to small and your matrix inverse can't be computed - until you increase precision enough or take stock that two variables you are using are essentially the same and you either discard one or average between them. Heteroskedasticity is address with an appropriate estimator or a separate model for variance. Correlation in the residuals is usually the most problematic as it points to miss specification of your model - which means you'll have to go out there and get some more data or figure out an instrument to run IV.
