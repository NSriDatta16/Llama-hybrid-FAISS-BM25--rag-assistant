What is the correct regex (for PHP preg_replace) to remove empty paragraph ( ) tags?

I'm working in Wordpress and need to be able to remove images and empty paragraphs. So far, I've found out how to remove images without a problem. But, I then need to remove empty paragraph tags. I'm using PHP preg_replace to handle the regex functions. So, as an example, I have the string: Some text I run this regex on it: / )/ And I end up with this string: Some text I then need to be able to remove the empty paragraph. I tried this, but it removes all paragraphs and the contents of the paragraphs: / ]*> ]*>/ Any help/suggestions is greatly appreciated!
