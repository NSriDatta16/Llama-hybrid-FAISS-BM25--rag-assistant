If the spec says the order is "undefined", you can't depend on the order without explicitly ordering it. The underlying implementation may be changed at any time with a new release or service pack, just for starters. Your dictionary may be upcast from any number of concrete implementations as well. And underlying implementation may be sensitive to the order of operations applied. Adding keys 'a', 'b' and 'c', in that order may result in a different data structure than adding the same set of keys in a different order (say, 'b','c', and 'a'). Deletions may likewise affect the data structure. A straight binary tree, for instance, if used as the data structure behind a dictionary, if the keys are added in order, the net result is a highly unbalanced tree that is essentially a linked list. The tree will be more balance if nodes are inserted in random order. And some data structure morph as operations are performed. If, for instance, a dictionary is implemented with the underlying data structure being a red/black tree, tree nodes will be split/rotated in order to keep the tree balanced as inserts and deletes occur. So the actual data structure then is highly dependent on the order of operations, even if the final contents are the same.
