I am afraid I don't know any. For hard-disk storage I can only recommend a look to STXXL , which proposes STL containers and algorithms adapted to data that can only fit on disk. They have implemented many things to allow for a smoother manipulation, essentially by caching in memory as much as possible and delaying disk access when possible. Now that won't get you a multi index, but at least you'll have a STL :) Then, if you are determined, you can port multi-index to use the facilities provided by STXXL: they have decorrelated the IO access / memory caching from the containers themselves. Or you can simply write what you need based on their STL-compliant containers.
