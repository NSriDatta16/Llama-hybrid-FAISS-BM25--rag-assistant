RGB has a wider range of colors then CMYK. CMYK is the range of colors printed on a white paper. it stands for Cyan Magenta Yellow and blacK. (think of the 4 colors in your printer cardiges. CMY for colors and K for black.) when miking CMY you have a very very dark grey. It goes on a scale of 0-100% from each color. RGB are monitors colors. It's the way LCDs and CRTs process colors. With Red Green and Blue. It goes on a scale of 0-255. 255 of both 3 colors makes white. Now since monitors are backed with backlight, it can make bright color printers can't do. like shiny green or shiny pink. A CMYK picture will look fine on screen. A RGB will lose color on print (like those shiny greens will become matte). For the iPhone, work on RGB. reasons: - It process directly RGB values - You'll get precise color - RGB takes less memory then CMYK
