With the caveat from Federico Ramponi "You should use scapy as an interpreter by its own, not as a library", I want to answer the non-scapy-specific parts of the question. Q: when installing Python libraries, do I need to change my path or anything similar? A: I think you are talking about changing PYTHONPATH system-wide. This is usually not required or a good idea. Third party Python libraries should either be installed in system directories, such as /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages , or installed locally, in which case you might want to set PYTHONPATH in your Makefile or a in driver shell script. Q: Also, is there something I can run in the interpreter to tell me the contents of the scapy package? A: You can do something like this: >>> import scapy >>> dir(scapy) Or even better: >>> import scapy >>> help(scapy) Bonus question asked in a comment. Q: Is 'import scapy' the same as 'from scapy import *'? A: import scapy binds the scapy name in the local namespace to the scapy module object. OTOH, from scapy import * does not bind the module name, but all public names defined in the scapy module are bound in the local namespace. See paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Python Reference Manual, 6.12 The import statement .
