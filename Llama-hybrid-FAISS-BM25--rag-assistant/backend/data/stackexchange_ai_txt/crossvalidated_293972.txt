A nice background reading on microarray t-test is the limma Bioconductor package. It's a very popular package for what you're doing, and I personally take it like a bible. Give it a read when you have an opportunity. 1. Paired vs independent Let's take a look what a typical paired samples should be: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf Paired samples occur when we compare two treatments and each sample given one treatment is naturally paired with a particular sample given the other treatment. This is a special case of blocking with blocks of size two. The classical test associated with this situation is the paired t-test. Suppose an experiment is conducted to compare a new treatment (T) with a control (C). Six dogs are used from three sib-ships. For each sib-pair, one dog is given the treatment while the other dog is a control. What it really mean is that, if you apply both control and treatment to the same biology source, it's a repeated measurement and therefore you should use the paired t-test. There is no information on how you conducted your experiment in your question, so I assume your samples are independent and therefore you should use the independent t-test. But please double check. 2. Equal or unequal variance This is normally not a problem in my works because I just run the limma package and let it figure out the variance... (it uses a Bayesian denominator, but let's not get into that). There's no right or wrong answer on how you assume your variance. From what I see your data, the variance looks quite close in your control samples and treatment samples. You might want make box-plots for your samples and decide if the equal variance assumption is reasonable. There're some formal ways to do that, but a simple box-plot visualization should be sufficient.
