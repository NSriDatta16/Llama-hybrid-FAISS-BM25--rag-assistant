Embedding Powershell CTP 2 in C#

I have an application that has Powershell 1 embedded into it, but we need to be able to use Powershell STAThreaded which is available in Powershell 2 CTP. Currently, System.Management.Automation is at 1.0.0.0. Does anyone know how to get Visual Studio to use the newer dll?
