FO .net embed images (gif)

I am currently using FO.net for generating my PDF report coming out of a .net 3.5 application. I need to embed a GIF image into the PDF. I do not want to have a file reference, but actually have the content of the image as part of the PDF. I have previously done this using SVG using the Ecrion FO Engine, however the free FO.Net (which is a C# port of Java's fo) does not currently support SVG files. The codeplex page specifies that it can, although I don't think this is confirmed and there is no information I could find on how to do this. Any help in this dilemma would be much appreciated :) As a side-note I am well aware you get what you pay for. However embedding images into a PDF is a pretty important part of any PDF report.
