Which model to use when you have multiple proportion independent variables?

I want to do a regression analysis (as I have found out on What regression model to use when independent variables are percentages to predict % outcome? should probably be a logistic regression) but I am not sure if I want to do the right one. My dependent variable is a mark that could be anywhere between 1 and 10 (so no binary outcome like in the link), although the min and max are around 4 and 8. I do have different independent variables however, of which most are percentages. If it would have been a linear multiple regression analysis most of these variables would have been dummies. The simplest one to describe is gender; (% of male and % of female), but for instance I also have a variable which consists of 5 options (A 20% B 0% C 30% D 15% E 35%). So in my dataset i have 5 different columns all for this one variable. This all besides 'regular' variables, like population density and budget (/inhabitant). I hope I desribed this clear enough. Could anyone help this nitwit out? I am struggling for months now and I make no progress, the only progress is that I keep finding out that what I have been doing so far makes no sense. The program I am using is SPSS so I hope it is possible with this program. Thanks in advance! Edit: Hi, first of all, thanks for the reply. The DV is an average per municipality of around 200 questionnaires where citizens were asked to rate their satisfaction from a 1 to 5 scale, later transformed to a 1 to 10 scale. In practise all averages are between 7.1 and 8.1, so I guess it's an ordinal scale. Now concerning the relationships; I basically got 2 models. The first one I just look at the diversity of employees (age (3 categories), etnicity (3 categories) and gender (obviously 2 categories)) which I express in the % of the total population of employees locally. The second model I run looks at the proportion of these percentages from the local employees compared to the proportion of the local citizens, which could be as low as (1:)0,05 to around (1:2). In the first model I expect that the more diverse the organisation is, the better the satisfaction of the citizens; in the second model I expect that municipalities close to a 1:1 ratio have a higher satisfaction than municipalities which differ more from this 1:1.
