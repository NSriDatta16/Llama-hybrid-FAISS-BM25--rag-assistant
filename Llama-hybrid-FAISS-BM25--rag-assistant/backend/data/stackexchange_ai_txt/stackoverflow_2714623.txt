SSAS Cube reprocessing fails - then succeeds if I try again

So I'm basically brand new to the concept of BI, and I've inherited an existing ETL process that is a two step process: Loads the data into a database that is only used by the cube processing Starts off the SSAS cube processing against said database It seems pretty well isolated, but occasionally (once a week, sometimes twice) it will fail with the following exception: "Errors in the OLAP storage engine: The attribute key cannot be found" Now the interesting thing is that: The dimension having the issue is not usually the same one (i.e. there's no single dimension that consistently has this failure ) The source table , when I inspect it, does actually contain the attribute key that it says could not be found If I then immediately reprocess the dimensions and cubes manually through SSMS, they reprocess successfully and without incident. In both the aforementioned job and when I reprocess them through SSMS, I am using "ProcessFull", so it should be reprocessing them completely. Has anyone run into such an issue? I'm scratching my head about it... because if it was a genuine data integrity issue, reprocessing the cube again wouldn't fix it. What on earth could be happening? I've been tasked with finding out why this happens, but I can neither reproduce it consistently nor can I point to a data integrity problem as the root cause. Thanks for any input you can provide!
