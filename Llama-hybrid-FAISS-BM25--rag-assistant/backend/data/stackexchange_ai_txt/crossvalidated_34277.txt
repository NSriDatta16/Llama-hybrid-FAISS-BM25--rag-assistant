Effect of delivery mode of questionnaire (online/hardcopy) on results

I conducted a survey research where I have used two delivery modes for the questionnaire - online and offline (hardcopy mode). The survey questions measure perceptions of employees on certain organisational behavior variables such as - organisational commitment, organisational justice, perceived organisational support, job satisfaction etc. All items are measured with a likert scale (1-7) The research objective is to test for moderation hypotheses (a total of 15). I observe that different set of variables are emerging as moderators when I run moderation test separately for online and offline(hardcopy) data. How should I proceed? Should I just ignore these differences and focus on overall data or report data according to mode of delivery?
