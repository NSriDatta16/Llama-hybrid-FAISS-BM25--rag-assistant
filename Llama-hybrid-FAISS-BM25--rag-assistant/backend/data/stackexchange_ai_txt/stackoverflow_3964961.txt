Use jQuery.getJSON instead of .get. .get uses an XHR, which is not friendly across domains (even subdomains). getJSON uses a JSONP request which will work. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ You'll need to modify the JSON data for a JSONP response though. It takes a parameter that defines a callback. jQuery creates a random function to serve as the callback, so if your whole point is to use this as a CDN, you don't be able to dynamically change the callback name in the response. You can use a static callback by passing the right parameters to jQuery.ajax: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ dataType: 'json' //(.getJSON is just a shorthand for .ajax with this paraeter set) jsonpCallback: 'myStaticCallbackName' // Lets the client know what callback to expect from the server. Then your response should look like: myStaticCallbackName({"foo": "bar"});
