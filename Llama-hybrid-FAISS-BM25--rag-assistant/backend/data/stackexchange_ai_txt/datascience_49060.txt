Possible Challenges for a Data Science Escape Room

Dear Data Science Community, as my project for my bachelorthesis I am working on a concept for a physical Data Science Escape Room. The goal of the escape room is to create awareness for data science / the importance of data in general and motivate "escapees" to learn more about data science. The escape room is going to be a physical room, that needs to be escaped by completing different challenges related to data science. The target group are people who are already working with data in form of reports or similar, but have no or little to none background in data science. Possible challenges for this escape room could use simple machine learning algorithms that need to be trained, or easy statistical concepts. Players could also need to curate data, which then needs to be integrated to be usable afterwards. I am looking for ideas or further input for possible challenges for this escape room, and was hoping to have some data science experts give creative input! Thank you!
