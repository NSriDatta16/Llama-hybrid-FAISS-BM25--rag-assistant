Regarding communication between WPF and an application server, you can use all of .NET's messaging facilities, specifically including Windows Communication Foundation. However, WCF does not have out-of-the-box support for binary messaging to Java (see Does WCF play well with Java? for discouraging info) so you would need to use XML, a custom transport that could be supported on both ends (such as MQ) or a bridge. (Can't help with the comparison of WPF vs. Swing, as I have no experience of Swing.)
