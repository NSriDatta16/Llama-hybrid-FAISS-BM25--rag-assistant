Javascript is primarily for client-side ( browser ), Python is primarily used for server-side - so they serve different needs ( disregarding the Python to JS converters and all ). I would recommend learning Python though, as it influenced ECMAScript and the syntax is very similar, both are object oriented, both are great languages. 2018 Update: I would still recommend learning Python over Javascript as a first language because it's just that much of a more beautiful, elegant language... although Javascript can now be used for both server-side and client-side thanks to node.js thus making it more useful all-around. http://hg.toolness.com/python-for-js-programmers/raw-file/tip/PythonForJsProgrammers.html
