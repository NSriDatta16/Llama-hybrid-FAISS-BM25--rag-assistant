It is not correct to run hosts with different interface MTUs on the same subnet 1 . This is a host/network misconfiguration, and IP path MTU discovery is not expected to work correctly in this situation. If you wish to test your application's path MTU discovery, you will need to set up multiple subnets connected by a router 2 , with different MTUs. In this situation, the router is the device that will pick up the MTU mismatch, and send back an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" error. 1. Well, technically, same broadcast domain . 2. The devices sold as "home routers" are really router/switches - they route between the WAN and the LAN, but switch between the ethernet ports on the LAN. This isn't sufficient to separate networks with different MTUs.
