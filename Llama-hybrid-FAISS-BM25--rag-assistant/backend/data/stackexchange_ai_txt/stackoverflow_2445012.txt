I think the changes to your workflow (and thus the learning curve upfront) would not be so big as it initially appears: If you are using Eclipse (properly), you are already navigating using Open Type (by name), Open Call Hierarchy, Open Type Hierarchy, Open Declaration, and so on. Collapsed code blocks also seems to be somewhat of a precursor to code bubbles. I agree with Codeka that it would probably only work for "strictly organized" languages like Java, and not so well for things like Perl, which give more freedom to the programmer how he wants to arrange things (at the expense of the tool support he can expect).
