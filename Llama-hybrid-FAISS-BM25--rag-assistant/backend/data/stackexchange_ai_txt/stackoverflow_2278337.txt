Since I don't specifically know what you want to do, hopefully these JS snippets can get you started. You'll need to attach an event handler to your map probably in body.onload. The GMap2 "move" event fires any time the map view is changing, which may be a lot if the user is dragging or constantly zooming. function onBodyLoad() { //assumes you have a GMap2 object named 'map' already declared somewhere GEvent.addListener(map, "move", onMapMove); } function onMapMove() { //update right div content }
