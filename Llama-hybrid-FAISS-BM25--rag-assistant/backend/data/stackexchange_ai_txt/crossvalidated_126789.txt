If your data are ordinal ratings, then they cannot be normally distributed. The Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is more appropriate. If you have a true likert scale (that is, many likert items that measure the same thing and which are summed or averaged to give a single number for each person), and if the scores do not lie up against the limits of the scale, then the $t$-test may be used, but the WMW is likely to have greater power.
