Conditional logistic regression (I assume that this is what you refered to when talking about Chamberlain's estimator) is available through clogit() in the survival package. I also found this page which contains R code to estimate conditional logit parameters . The survey package also includes a lot of wrapper function for GLM and Survival model in the case of complex sampling, but I didn't look at. Try also to look at logit.mixed in the Zelig package, or directly use the lme4 package which provide methods for mixed-effects models with binomial link (see lmer or glmer ). Did you take a look at Econometrics in R , from Grant V. Farnsworth? It seems to provide a gentle overview of applied econometrics in R (with which I am not familiar).
