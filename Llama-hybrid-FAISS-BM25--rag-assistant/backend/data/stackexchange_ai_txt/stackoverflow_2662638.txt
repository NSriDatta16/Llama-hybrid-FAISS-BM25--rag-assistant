You have to allocate all the storage that scanf() is going to use before you call it; scanf() does not allocate storage. Your strings are empty; there is minimal storage allocated for the values. Entering any extra data is a disaster. Plus, scanf() expects a character pointer, not a string reference or value - because it is a variadic function, there is only a limited amount of warning that the compiler can do.
