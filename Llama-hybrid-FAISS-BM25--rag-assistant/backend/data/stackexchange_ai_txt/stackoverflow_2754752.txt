Is there a way to rotate an html table?

Is there a way to rotate an html table? So, say I had a table like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 and wanted to some sort of button that had javascript behind it that could rotate the table any which direction. For example, clicking the right button, results in: 6 5 4 3 2 1 I have a drag and drop plugin that uses a table, and I am trying to do a piece that allows for a user to add to a queue (that results in the table), and then they can also rotate it around as well. Thanks.
