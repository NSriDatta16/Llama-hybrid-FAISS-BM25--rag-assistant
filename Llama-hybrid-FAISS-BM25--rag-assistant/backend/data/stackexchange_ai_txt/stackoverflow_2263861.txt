I am having a similar problem. I made a custom modal view controller with its own delegate protocol. I can see nothing different from Apple example (adding a few tweaks to implement the delegate and its protocol, which are lacking form Apple code fragments). I can see that the code is executed, but nothing shows on the screen than the base view, which is the view of the calling view controller. In your case, what do you think was preventing the modal view from appearing? Thanks. - (void)viewDidLoad { // If this is the first time. DisclaimerViewController *disclaimerViewController = [[DisclaimerViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"DisclaimerViewController" bundle:nil]; disclaimerViewController.delegate = self; UINavigationController *myNavigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:disclaimerViewController]; [self presentModalViewController:myNavigationController animated:YES]; [myNavigationController release]; [disclaimerViewController release]; [super viewDidLoad]; } Could it be a problem the modal view is requested from the viewDidLoad? I moved the code to somewhere else but no change... Later in the code: (this should not affect why modal view does not appear) #pragma mark DisclaimerViewDelegate method - (void)disclaimerControllerFinished:(DisclaimerViewController *)disclaimerViewController { [disclaimerViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; } Below is a fix I needed to implement the delegate protocol. This info is lacking from Apple code, but I don't think that it has any influence as to why the modal view is not loaded. @protocol DisclaimerViewDelegate; @interface DisclaimerViewController : UIViewController { id delegate; } @property (assign) id delegate; @end @protocol DisclaimerViewDelegate - (void)disclaimerControllerFinished:(DisclaimerViewController *)disclaimerViewController;
