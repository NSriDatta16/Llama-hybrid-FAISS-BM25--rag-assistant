Metric for probability based classification

I am doing a system for classifiying documents. The project demands the use of probability based output. So a sample will have a probability for belonging to each class. For now I use logistic regression, but this could be subject to change. So I don't want to do an R^2 approximation. I also don't want to use standard metrics for classification like F-measure because it doesn't work with probabiliies. I have no idea what is the custom metric in this situation. Any ideas?
