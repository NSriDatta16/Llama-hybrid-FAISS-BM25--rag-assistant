If you are saying that the spending falls into different groups or categories (e.g. different seasons) then lumping them all together breaks the assumption of independence of observations. E.g. if the observations for spring constitute one group of observations, and the observations for Christmas constitute a different group, the relationship between spend and outcome might be quite different in the different groups. This doesn't necessarily just give you some kind of average between the groups. To see how badly this can go wrong, read up on Simpson's paradox, e.g. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/28/theorums_3_simpson/ .
