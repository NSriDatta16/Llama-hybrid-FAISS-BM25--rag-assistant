How to perform orthogonal regression (total least squares) via PCA?

I always use lm() in R to perform linear regression of $y$ on $x$. That function returns a coefficient $\beta$ such that $$y = \beta x.$$ Today I learned about total least squares and that princomp() function (principal component analysis, PCA) can be used to perform it. It should be good for me (more accurate). I have done some tests using princomp() , like: r My problem is: how to interpret its results? How can I get the regression coefficient? By "coefficient" I mean the number $\beta$ that I have to use to multiply the $x$ value to give a number close to $y$.
