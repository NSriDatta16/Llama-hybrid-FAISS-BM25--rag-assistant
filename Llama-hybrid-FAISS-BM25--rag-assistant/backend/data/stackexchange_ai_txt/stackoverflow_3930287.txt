Large development teams and SVN

A few questions regarding this topic: 1) What's the largest development team (doing actual commits, not counting read-only) you've had on a single SVN repository? Did you have any issues? 2) What's the largest size team you'd be comfortable with on a single SVN repository? Is a different version control tool better for very large teams? (Don't name IBM Rational, because it will get ignored and flamed, but others may be possible if a valid justification can be made. Solid Eclipse and Flex/Flash Builder IDE compatibility is a must.) 2a) Obviously this depends on the project, but are there any major shortcomings with reliance on splitting up 'large' dev teams into small, modular teams all of which utilize their own SVN repos ? 3) Does it make sense for an organization to have two standard versioning tools, one for large systems (if needed) and one for small (~5 devs or less) systems? For extra points: 4) What would you consider a "large" team (counting only developers since this is relating to SVN use, not QA, management, testers, etc)?
