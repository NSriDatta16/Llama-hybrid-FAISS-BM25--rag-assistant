Is OpenAtrium really slow?

I am a user of an OpenAtrium site, but not the admin. On average it takes anywhere from 7 - 11 seconds for the front page to load. Going from page-to-page takes about 7 seconds. I am not really a Drupal admin and I definitely do not have access to the host control panel or anything for this particular site. The admin has mentioned something about cache and has cleared the cache to make it faster, but it still is very slow (see above). This site is not on it's own dedicated server and probably won't be moved to one in the near future. That being said, is there anything that can be done (i.e. anything I can recommend to the admin) that would improve it's speed in the near future?
