The logit link function complicates things a bit a bit compared to OLS. For a continuous variable $x$ , the additive marginal effect of $x$ with a logit link function is $$\Lambda(\alpha + \beta x)\cdot \left[1-\Lambda(\alpha + \beta x)\right]\cdot\beta = p \cdot (1 - p) \cdot \beta,$$ where the inverse logit function $\Lambda$ is $$\Lambda(z)=\frac{\exp{z}}{1+\exp{z}}.$$ You can get the average marginal effect by taking the mean of that quantity in your sample. For dummies, you predict with the dummy set to 1, then with the dummy set to 0, and then average the difference. In R, you can use the margins package or marginaleffects to do this for you. Unlike the manual approach, this should get the SEs right as well. This is more accessible than the odds ratio multiplicative effects as I try avoiding odds outside gambling scenarios.
