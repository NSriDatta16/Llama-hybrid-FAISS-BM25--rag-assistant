Certain data have a natural period by the way it is measured. For example, labor statistics in the US are reported once a month, so the seasonal.periods in defining a msts object is 12. However, it may be less clear with other datasets. To estimate the dominant periodicity, the forecast package provides a function findfrequency which finds the peak in the spectral density of the time series.
