What is "Laplacian image space"?

I have been working through Beyond Face Rotation: Global and Local Perception GAN for Photorealistic and Identity Preserving Frontal View Synthesis where the authors make the following claim (subjection 2.2.1): ...the Laplacian space is more robust to illumination changes and more indicative for face structure. what is Laplacian space in this context? How is it robust to illumination changes?
