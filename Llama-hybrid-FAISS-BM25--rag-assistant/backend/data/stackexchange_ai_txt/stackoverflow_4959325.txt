Version 7.3 of MAT-files uses HDF5 format, this format has a significant storage overhead to describe the contents of the file, especially so for complex nested cellarrays and structures. Its main advantage over previous versions of MAT-files is that it allows storing data larger than 2GB on 64-bit systems. Note that both v7 and v7.3 are compressed and use Unicode encoding (unlike v6), yet they are two completely different formats... References: MAT-File Preferences MAT-File Versions
