How do I handle division by 0 in Kaggle?

I have written a RNN algorithm in Python/IDLE and ran it. It works and is successful. My dataset is large so I wanted to run it using Kaggle's computers, rather than my laptop. However, when I copied and pasted the code, the Kaggle console reported that there had been a division by 0. I'm guessing that IDLE has a built in method of handling division by 0's whereas Kaggle doesn't, hence why it was never reported in the IDLE console, and had been reported in the Kaggle console. How can I overcome this?
