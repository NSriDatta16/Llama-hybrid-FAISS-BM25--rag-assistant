Definition of obstacles in new OpenAI gym environment

I study a Reinforcement Learning algorithm that navigate an agent from one initial point to another in a complex environment where other agents and obstacles exists too. I want to make my own gym environment in OpenAI to train my model. I have read that το built your own environment requires the definition of a class and functions such as init,reset,step,render etc. Μy difficulty is in how I will design the environment that I will train my agent. I mean the plan of the room in which my agent has to navigate.How I will make the algorithm understand that my agent has found an obstacle(lets say a static obstacle). Don't this have to be done in the beginning somehow? I would appreciate if someone could help me!!! Thank you in advance!!!
