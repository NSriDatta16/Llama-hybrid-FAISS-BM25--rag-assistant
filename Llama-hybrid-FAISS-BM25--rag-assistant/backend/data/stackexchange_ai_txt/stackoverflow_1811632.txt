Take a look at the new Google Guava libraries , which will incorporate Google Collections once it passes from 1.0RC4 to 1.0. Guava and Collections give you quite a bit of power and elegance, and are already used extensively in Google production code. The Joiner class suits your example perfectly: String[] strings = { "Stack", "Overflow", ".com" }; String site = Joiner.on("").join(strings); Aleksander Stensby has a nice four part exploration of Guava/Collections. Like Apache Collections, it's not part of the JDK, though it builds very carefully on top of java.util.collection.
