The equation to transform a normal variate into a standard normal variate is \begin{equation} z_i - \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})}{s}, \end{equation} using sample-based estimate notation, where $\bar{x}$ is the average of $x$ and $s$ is the standard deviation. When using population-based parameter notation, the transform is given as \begin{equation} z_i - \frac{(x_i - \mu)}{\sigma}, \end{equation} where $\mu$ is the average of $x$ and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
