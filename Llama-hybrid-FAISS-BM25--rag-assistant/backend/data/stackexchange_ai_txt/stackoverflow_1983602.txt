Execution times for various RDBMS queries?

Is there some reliable (i.e. acknowledged) data on the execution times for various queries, such as different types of joins, scans, with different types and size of data? I am looking for the order of magnitude. This does not have to be vendor-specific data. It should be similar in terms of presentation for latency for various access times . (Click View Response.) The reason I am looking for it is to decide whether or not I should use a RDBMS at all for a project I'm working on. I do not need complex joins, and I may get away with local memcache or even disk access. As per request, the part of the project that may require a RMDBS is all local on a single node. The node may store any kind of data, and any kind of read/write is key-based, in that it treats its storage component as a huge dictionary. It may try to iterate through objects, and there could be a single object that provides a list to those objects. This kind of iteration may be something like "Find all objects that have this attribute" (i.e. find all rows for which a column matches this value). This is the part I am unsure about - how much advantage would an RDBMS offer me, if at all? I do not foresee the need for joins. Another reason I'd like this benchmark is so that I could decide how much to offload to individual nodes, given the difference between network latency and local execution times.
