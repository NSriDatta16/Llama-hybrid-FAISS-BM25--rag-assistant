Interpreting Results of Time Series Decomposition

Suppose, after ACF and PCF investigation, I see my data has strong seasonality. I do both additive and multiplicative time series decomposition, just to check it results. I am not interested in forecasting, but want to investigate seasonal nature of variable. My question is how does one interpret this result. For example, can I say January has 20% more 'x' as compared to what? [Multiplicative Decomposition] [] [additive Decomposition] 2
