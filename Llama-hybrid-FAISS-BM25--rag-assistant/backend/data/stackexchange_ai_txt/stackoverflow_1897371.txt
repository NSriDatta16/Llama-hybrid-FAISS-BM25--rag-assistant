If you are storing a lot of information in a StringBuilder, are you going to reference back to it at some point? If not then just write it to another medium (DB, File etc). The program has a finite amount of resources, it can't hold all of the state of an entire system at once. -Xmx will give you more space for storage in the memory, however it won't make your storage ability infinite.
