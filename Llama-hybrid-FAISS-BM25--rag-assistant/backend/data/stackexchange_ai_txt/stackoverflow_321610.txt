One approach that works for me - with Delphi - is to enable debugging, and run your program under the debugger. When a Delphi program is run under the debugger, the IDE shows in the margin which lines of code can be set as breakpoints. Code which is truly dead - i.e., has been stripped out by the linker/compiler is obvious as breakpoints can't be set there. Some additional notes, as commenters seem to misunderstand this: a: You don't need to try setting a breakpoint on each line. Just open up the source file in the IDE, and quickly scroll through it. Dead code is easily spotted. b: This is NOT a 'code coverage' check. You don't need to run the application to see if it reaches the lines. c: I'm not familiar enough VS2008 so can't say if this suggestion will work.
