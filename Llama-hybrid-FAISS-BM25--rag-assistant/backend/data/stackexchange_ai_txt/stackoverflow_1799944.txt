Xcode organising files and folders (core data model objects - iPhone)

I am developing for the iPhone and the prevailing advice on auto-generating files from entities, when using Core Data, is to select the *.xcdatamodel file and the create the new file(s) etc. This creates the *.m and *.h files in the Resources directory. These are then moved to the Classes directory or a subdirectory of Classes. However, when viewing my github repository I notice that all of the model files which have been auto-generated in the above mentioned way are present on the root of the project folder (as if they were a resource). The underlying file structure may or may not matter (I'm unsure on this point) but I would like to make my repository less disorganised. I can see entropy taking over as the project gets much bigger and there are more files to contend with. My question is therefore: is there a way to organise the underlying file structure without messing up the project settings or the way github sees the project? I hope the above isn't unclear and I look forward to your replies.
