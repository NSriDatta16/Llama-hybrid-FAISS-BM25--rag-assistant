The general layout organization should be: ... linear layout with your TextViews ... The layout_weight="1" attribute causes that view to fill the available space in the outer LinearLayout and will push your button to the bottom. Edit - if you want the buttons to scroll as well, then you should follow Romain Guy's article , using fillViewPort and setting a layout_weight on one of your LinearLayout children.
