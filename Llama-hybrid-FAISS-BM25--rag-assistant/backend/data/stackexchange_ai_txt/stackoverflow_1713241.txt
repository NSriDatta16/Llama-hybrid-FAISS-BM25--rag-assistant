dojo drag and drop and key handlers

I have a dojo.dnd.Source container with multiple dnd items. I'd like to give the user the option to select one of the dnd items in the source and then use their backwards/forwards keys to navigate to other items in the source. I've tried setting onkeyup/onkeydown handlers on the dnd items, but they don't seem to fire. I've also tried setting key handlers on the dnd source container, but no luck there either. Any ideas on whether this is possible - if so, on what dom node should I attach my keyup/keydown listeners? Thanks Sean PS - using dojo 1.3 in an Adobe AIR application.
