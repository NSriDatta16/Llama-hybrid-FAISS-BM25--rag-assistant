First, I would look at the Using Nested Repeaters article. This lays out the basic concepts you will need for setting up a dataset with the proper relations. You should be able to then modify this so that you're using a DataGrid with a TemplateColumn. Use the concepts for embedding a nested repeater, but instead, nest the DetailVliew in the ItemTemplate. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306154 I should point out that there is an easier method based on the effect you want. You don't need to nest the controls. See this article: http://www.asp.net/learn/data-access/tutorial-10-cs.aspx
