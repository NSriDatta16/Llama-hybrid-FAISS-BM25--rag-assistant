Forecasting unemployment rate with plm

Please see question for the background. Following the advice of @kwak and @Andy W, I have decided to use the package plm in R to fit my model. Here an excerpt of the data df (the numbers are made up, not real data!): reg year ur mur cl 1 1 2001 0.000698717 0.012483361 1 2 2 2001 0.008283762 0.011899896 1 3 3 2001 0.001863817 0.012393738 1 4 4 2001 0.005344206 0.012126016 1 5 5 2001 0.007475083 0.011962102 1 6 6 2001 0.002785111 0.012322869 1 where reg is the region indicator, year is the year of measurement, ur is the unemployment rate, mur is the average unemployment rate in the neighboring regions (given by cl ) excluding the current region (see @kwak suggestion). Below is the code that I used in R fm I have several question regarding this model: I guess I should choose effect="individual" to avoid having time dependent intercepts (?). But doing so the code is crashing (Error in names(coefficients) Which model should I choose, onestep or twosteps ? How do I decide on the numbers of instruments (40 is just a guess)? Assuming that I have fitted this model successfully, how do I simulate from it? Regards
