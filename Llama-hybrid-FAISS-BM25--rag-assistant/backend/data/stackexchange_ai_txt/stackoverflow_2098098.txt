How to create a SQL Server replication using DB backup?

I am trying to build a DB replication using MSSQL 2005. Both publisher and subscriber are SQL Server database. I know I can create subsriber database from the snapshop of publisher. However, snapshot agent will put the share lock on publisher DB, which is a production database. Is there any way I can build a replication and initialize subscriber db from restoring a DB backup instead of running snapshot agent? Thanks
