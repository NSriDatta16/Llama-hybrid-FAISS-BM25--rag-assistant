Random Forest fits a very large number of individual decision trees. These trees then "vote" to obtain a final output for the entire forest. Directly interpreting a decision trees can be easy or tricky (depending on the # of variables and correlations), but a large set of them at once is virtually impossible. So no, Random Forest is much less interpretable than methods like Lasso and Elastic Net. It's also not sparse, because it tends to utilize all variables. To make the reasons behind this more intuitive: personally I like to imagine Random Forest as trying to see the problem from all possible different perspectives offered by your data. The perspectives can be very different from each other, but when they agree on an answer you can be reasonably confident that the answer is correct. This perception of Random Forest also helps answer your question. You can see and understand the problem from one perspective but not from all possible ones at the same time, so you cannot easily understand what your Random Forest does. Also all possible perspectives include all the features, so it also cannot be sparse.
