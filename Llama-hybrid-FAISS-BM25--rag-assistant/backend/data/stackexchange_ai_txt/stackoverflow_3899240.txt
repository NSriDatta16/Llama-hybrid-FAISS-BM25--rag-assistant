I know it is too late to answer. But still, I would recommend reading the following books to gain an in depth knowledge of SOA. SOA by Thomas Erl actually clears confusion about how SOA is used as buzzword marketing agents. Also, He is founder of SOA systems. Also, SOA Design patterns is a good book to read. Specifically mentioned the SOA again. So that others could get a direct link to it. :) Cheers :)
