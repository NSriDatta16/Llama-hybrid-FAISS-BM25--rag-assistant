How to use function from other Colab file?

I’m coming from a math background and learning some data science. I am very new to some details of this stuff. Working with colab, I’m trying to organize my sample simulating functions in such a way that I can reach them even in different files/notebooks - and have not been able to find any working tutorials or explanations of how it works in colab. The only things I’ve found have suggested using options that don’t seem to exist anymore - finding filepaths in it doesn’t seem to work as it once did. Anyway, if anyone could guide me to a tutorial (or give some direct guidance), that would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks a ton all, Paul
