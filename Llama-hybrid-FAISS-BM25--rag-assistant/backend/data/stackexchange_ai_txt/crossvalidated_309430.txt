Is there any disadvantage of weighting variables in forecasting multivariate time using RNN?

I am doing time series prediction for Temperature based on time-series data of Temperature and Humidity. Since, I want prediction only for Temperature I have weighted Temperature ten-times so that in my loss function temperature should have more importance and temperature related weights train faster. Is there any flaw or disadvantage in using this technique?
