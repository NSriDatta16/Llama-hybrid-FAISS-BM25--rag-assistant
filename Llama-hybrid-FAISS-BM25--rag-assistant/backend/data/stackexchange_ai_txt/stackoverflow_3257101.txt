It's very possible that you hit an ID in the other case that didn't exist, and therefore it was attempting to split an undefined variable. If the fix works for you, stick with it, but you may want to consider upgrading your Magento installation. The series is onto 1.4 now, and there are huge numbers of fixes in every release. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
