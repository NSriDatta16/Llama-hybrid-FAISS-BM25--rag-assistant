I would recommend a hybrid approach: making a separate header for each component of the program which could conceivably be used independently, then making a project header that includes all of them. That way, each source file only needs to include one header (no need to go updating all your source files if you refactor components), but you keep a logical organization to your declarations and make it easy to reuse your code.
