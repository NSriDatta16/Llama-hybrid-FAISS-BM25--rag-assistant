There used to be a component named TGlobe , which I've never used. The website has not been up dated since 2009, and it is no longer available as of 2013. TGlobe 5 is a VCL component for Delphi 5, 6, 7, 2005 plus CBuilder 5 and 6. TGlobe displays a Globe of the Earth which can be rotated, panned and zoomed in realtime. The globe contains map data in the form of Point, Lines and Polygons. TGlobe organises map data into Layers. These layers can be nested together to build up a hierachy of related layers. TGlobe can switch between the 3D spherical view of the earth and Cartesian, Mercator or user defined projections.
