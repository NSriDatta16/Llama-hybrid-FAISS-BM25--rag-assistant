I would approach this problem from a robust filtering point of view, as is done for real time curve monitoring. There is a German team that has worked extensively on this and related problems such as filtering, shift detection etc. --see these papers here , here and here for example-- They also have an R package were most of these algorithm are implemented in C++ and in their "on-line" versions. Check the codes in the robfilter package . Fried R., Bernholt, T. Gather, U.
