The following will only change the cursor when the user has moved the mouse over your JList. You can change the cursor when you mouse over a component (i.e. your JList) by using a mouse listener and the setCursor method. Essentially just add the mouse listener to your JList and use setCursor to change the cursor when the user mouses over the component in your application (mouseEntered and mouseExit). You may also need to do a little inquiry on your drag and drop code to only change the cursor when something valid is being dragged into your JList. Hope this helps a bit.
