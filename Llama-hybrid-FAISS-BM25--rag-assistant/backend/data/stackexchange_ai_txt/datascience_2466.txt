Dimension reduction for logical arrays

I have measurements of 4 devices at two different points of time. A measurement basically consists of an array of ones and zeros corresponding to a bit value at the corresponding location: whos measurement1_dev1_time1 Name Size Bytes Class Attributes measurement1_dev1_time1 4096x8 32768 logical I assume that for a specific device the changes between time 1 and 2 of the measurements are unique. However, since I am dealing with 32768 bits at different locations, it is quite hard to visualize if there is some kind of dependency. As every bit at location x can be regarded as one dimension of an observation I thought to use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions. Thus, for every of the 5 devices: I randomly sample n measurements at point t1 and t2 seperatly I prepare an array as input for pca() with m *n columns ( m On this array A I calculate the pca: ``[coeff score latent] = pca(zscore(A))``` Then I try to visualize it using biplot : biplot(coeff(:,1:2), 'score', score(:,1:2)) However, this gives me really strange results. Maybe PCA is not the right approach for this problem? I also modified the input data to do the PCA not on the logical bit array itself. Instead, I created a vector, which holds the indices where there is a '1' in the original measurement array. Also this produces strange results. As I am completely new to PCA I want to ask you if you either see a flaw in the process or if PCA is just not the right approach for my goal and I better look for other dimension reduction approaches or clustering algorithms.
