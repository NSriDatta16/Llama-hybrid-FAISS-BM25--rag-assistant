Problem with converting string to dummy variables

I'm new in data science, I have data which want to work on it, I omitted extra columns and convert it to 4 columns ( Product, Date, Market, Demand ) . in this data Product and Market are string, I know for working on this data must convert them. I want to convert the string to dummy variables but this isn't logical because I have 64 fruits in the product column. I am confused and I don't know what can I do whit this strings.
