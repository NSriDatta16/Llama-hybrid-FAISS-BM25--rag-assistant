It fails when you don't impose the right structure on the problem. Convolutional neural networks work because they assume pixels which are close to each other are related, so it makes sense to apply spatial convolutions to your features. And in so doing, you've reduced the hypothesis search space dramatically, which means deep learning is more likely to arrive at an optimal solution. If you apply deep learning to a problem where the features aren't amenable to spatial/temporal convolutions, then deep learning will fail, because it doesn't make sense to be summing up certain features and applying functions to the summation, which is what neural networks do. If someone can think of an example of where deep learning has been successfully applied to data which is not images or audio (or spatial/temporal data), I would be delighted to retract this answer.
