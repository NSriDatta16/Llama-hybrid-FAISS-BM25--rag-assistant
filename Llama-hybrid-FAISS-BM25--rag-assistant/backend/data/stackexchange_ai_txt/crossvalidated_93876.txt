My comments are so long, I am putting them in as an answer. I think the question is more philosophical than mathematical at this point. Namely, what do you mean by a space, and in this case, a manifold? The typical definition of a manifold does not involve an embedding into an affine space. This is the 'modern' (150 year old?) approach. For example, to Gauss, a manifold was a manifold with a specific embedding into a specific affine space ($R^n$). If one has a manifold with an embedding in a specific $R^n$, then the tangent space (at any point of the manifold) is isomorphic to a specific subspace of the tangent space to $R^n$ at that point. Note that the tangent space to $R^n$ at any point is identified with the 'same' $R^n$. I think the point is that in the Amari article, the space he refers to as $S^n$ comes with some 'natural' embedding in an affine space with coordinates the $\theta_{i}$ for which the $p_{\theta}$ can be considered as coordinates on the tangent space of $S^n$. I might add that it is only clear if the function $p$ is 'general' in some sense- for degenerate $p$, this will fail. For example if the function didn't involve all the variables $\theta_{i}$ . The main point is that this embedding of the manifold in a specific $R^n$, gives rise to a specific identification of the tangent space with the $p_{\theta}$. His next point is that because of the properties of $p$, he can map his manifold using the log function to another affine space in which the tangent space has a different identification in terms of the new coordinates (the logs and their derivatives). He then says that because of properties of his situation, the two manifolds are isomorphic and the map induces an isomorphism on the tangent spaces. That leads to an identification (i.e., isomorphism) of the two tangent spaces. The key idea is that the two tangent spaces are not the same sets, but are isomorphic (which is basically Greek for 'same') after the correct identification. For example, is the group of all permutations of $\{1,2,3\}$ the 'same' group as the group of all permutations of $\{a,b,c\}$? As a simple thought experiment, consider $R^{+}$, the positive reals mapping to $R$, all the reals under the map log. Pick your favorite real number $>0$ and consider what the map is on tangent spaces. Am I finally understanding your question? A caveat is in order, namely that differential geometry is not my main area of expertise. I think I've got it right, but feel free to criticize or still question this answer.
