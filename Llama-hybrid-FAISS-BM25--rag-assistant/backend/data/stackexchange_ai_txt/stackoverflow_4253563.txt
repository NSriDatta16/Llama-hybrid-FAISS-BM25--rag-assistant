The numbers generated by each Random instance will be uniformly distributed, so if you combine the sequences of random numbers generated by both Random instances, they should be uniformly distributed too. Note that even if the resulting distribution is uniform, you might want to pay attention to the seeds to avoid correlation between the output of the two generators. If you use the default no-arg constructor, the seeds should already be different. From the source code of java.util.Random : private static volatile long seedUniquifier = 8682522807148012L; public Random() { this(++seedUniquifier + System.nanoTime()); } If you are setting the seed explicitly (by using the Random(long seed) constructor, or calling setSeed(long seed) ), you'll need to take care of this yourself. One possible approach is to use a random number generator to produce the seeds for all other generators.
