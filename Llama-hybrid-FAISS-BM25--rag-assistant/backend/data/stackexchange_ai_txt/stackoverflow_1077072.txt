My Profiler List includes ANTS, dotTrace, and AQtime. However, looking more closely at your question, it seems to me that you should do some unit testing at the same time you're doing profiling. Maybe start by doing a quick overall performance scan, just to see which areas need most attention. Then start writing some unit tests for those areas. You can then run the profiler while running those unit tests, so that you'll get consistent results.
