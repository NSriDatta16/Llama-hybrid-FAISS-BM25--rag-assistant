Some observations are that your code for AMOC is overwriting the three different methods as the names are the same. The final method you fit is change in mean and variance of a Normal distribution, which you plot. There are no plots of the PELT output which is fitting multiple changepoints More importantly, all the models you fit are for (flat) mean or variance shifts. There is clearly a trend in your data. AMOC places a changepoint almost at the centre because when you fit a flat mean before and a flat mean after the change, this is the best place to put a single change. If you look at the corresponding PELT plot, you will likely have a step function where every few observations a changepoint will be there to capture the increasing trend. See the following two papers for descriptions of common pitfalls and a worked-through data example for constructing changepoint methods.
