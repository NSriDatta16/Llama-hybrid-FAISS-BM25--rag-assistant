Oracle functions with long decodes/cases

I have another simple one. How to make a long decode inside a function in oracle? My select looks like this: select something, sum(ofsomethingelse) from a_table where code in ('390','391','392','393','394','395','396','397','398','400','402','406', '407','408','409','410','411','412','413','414','416','418','471','473', '1734','1742','1735','1736','1737','1738','1739','1740','1741','1745', '1748','1752','1760','1753','1754','1755','1756','1757','1758','1759', '1763','1766','1902','1904','1003','1011','1004','1005','106','1007', '1008','1009','1010','1159','1161','1015','1023','1016','1017','1018', '1019','1020','1021','1022','1164','1166','1189','1191','1201','1209', '1202','1203','1204','205','1206','1207','1208','1356','1358','1213', '1221','1214','1215','1216','1217','1218','1219','1220','1361','1363', '1386','1388','1401','1409','1402','1403','1404','1405','1406','1407', '1408','1557','1559','1413','1421','1414','1415','1416','1417','1418', '1419','1420','1562','1564','1587','1589','9033','9034','9035','9036', '9037','9038','909','9040','9049','9050','9051','9052') group by something order by 1 And I have a couple more of large code lists like that which I want to turn into one neat query. Something like: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION grouping_func (id_in IN varchar2) RETURN varchar2 AS res varchar(255); BEGIN res := CASE id_in WHEN id_in in ([long list of ids from query1]) THEN 'Group1' WHEN id_in in ([long list of ids from query2]) THEN 'Group2' WHEN id_in in ([long list of ids from query3]) THEN 'Group3' ELSE id_in END; RETURN res; END; so I can have a clear query that just uses this function into the group by and everything the way I like :) The problem is I cant use that id_in in ([long list of ids from query3]) in the switch cases and I'm quite a n00b in plsql... May I get suggestions of elegant ways of doing it? thanks! f.
