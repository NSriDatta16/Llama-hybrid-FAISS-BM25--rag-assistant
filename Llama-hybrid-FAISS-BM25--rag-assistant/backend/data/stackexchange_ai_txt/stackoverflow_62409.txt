A liquid layout is a method of CSS layout that defines all widths in percentages, so the areas of the page will grow/shrink when the viewport (browser window) is resized. They're very useful if trying to create a site that will fit both large and small screens. They're a little more difficult to work it than fixed layouts, because you're relinquishing some level control over how everything fits in the page, and you have to pay very close attention to your content, to make sure it doesn't fall apart aesthetically on resize. I would say liquid layouts are most useful for text heavy sites with a fairly basic column layout. You might also find a happy medium with an 'elastic' layout -- one that has both liquid and fixed areas.
