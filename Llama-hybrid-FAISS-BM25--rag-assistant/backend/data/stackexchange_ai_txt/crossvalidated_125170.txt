You can look at the up and downs as a random sequence, which is generated by some random process. For instance, let's assume that you're dealing with a stationary series $x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n \in f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a probability distribution such as Gaussian, Poisson or anything else. This is stationary series. Now, you can create new variable $y_t$ such that $y_t=1:x_t V Khil, Elena. "Markov properties of gaps between local maxima in a sequence of independent random variables." (2013). For instance, look at ACF and PACF of your series. There's nothing here. This doesn't seem like ARIMA model. It looks like uncorrelated sequence of $x_t$. This means that we could try applying known results for $y_t$, e.g. it's known that the average distance between two (up-down) pairs (or U-turns as some call them) is 3. In your data set the first peak (up-down) is 1957 and the last one is 2012, with 16 peaks in total. So, the average distance between peaks is 15/55=3.67. We know that the $\sigma=1.108$, and with 15 observations $\sigma_{15}=\sigma/\sqrt{15}=0.29$. So the mean distance between peaks is within $1.2\sigma_n$ from the theoretical mean. UPDATE: on cycles The graph in OP's question appears to suggest that there's some kind of long running cycle. There are several issues with this. If you generate a random sequence, sometimes something like a cycle may appear just randomly. So, with 58 data points which are purely observational data, it's impossible to declare a cycle without some kind of economic theory behind it. Nobody's going to take it seriously without the economic reasoning. For that you definitely need exogenous variables, I'm afraid. Check out this wonderful paper: The Summation of Random Causes as the Source of Cyclic Processes , Eugen Slutzky, Econometrica, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Apr., 1937), pp. 105-146. Basically, sometimes cycles are caused by some sort of MA process. This could be an illusion. I use this trick quite often in presentations. I show the actual data, then draw lines, circles or arrows to mess with my audience's brains :) The extra lines trick the brain into seeing trends which may not be there at all, or to make them look much stronger than they actually are.
