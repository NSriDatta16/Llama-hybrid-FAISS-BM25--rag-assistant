Has anyone worked with TestCocoon?

I was trying out TestCocoon the other day, and everything seemed great. I compiled my code using cscl , cslib and cslink and I was expecting this to take care of all the instrumentation. I get some .csmes files and .exe.csmes files, but when I load them into the CoverageBrowser I cannot see anything relevant. No covered/uncovered lines. All the lines are grey. Is anything else needed in order for TestCocoon to report coverage? Do I need to modify my source files? I also posted on their forums here, but no result: http://www.testcocoon.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=44
