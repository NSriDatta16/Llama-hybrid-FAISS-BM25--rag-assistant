how much time does grid.py take to run?

I am using libsvm for binary classification.. I wanted to try grid.py , as it is said to improve results.. I ran this script for five files in separate terminals , and the script has been running for more than 12 hours.. this is the state of my 5 terminals now : [root@localhost tools]# python grid.py sarts_nonarts_feat.txt>grid_arts.txt Warning: empty z range [61.3997:61.3997], adjusting to [60.7857:62.0137] line 2: warning: Cannot contour non grid data. Please use "set dgrid3d". Warning: empty z range [61.3997:61.3997], adjusting to [60.7857:62.0137] line 4: warning: Cannot contour non grid data. Please use "set dgrid3d".

[root@localhost tools]# python grid.py snews_nonnews_feat.txt>grid_news.txt Wrong input format at line 494 Traceback (most recent call last): File "grid.py", line 223, in run if rate is None: raise "get no rate" TypeError: exceptions must be classes or instances, not str I had redirected the outputs to files , but those files for now contain nothing.. And , the following files were created : sbiz_nonbiz_feat.txt.out sbiz_nonbiz_feat.txt.png sarts_nonarts_feat.txt.out sarts_nonarts_feat.txt.png sgames_nongames_feat.txt.out sgames_nongames_feat.txt.png sref_nonref_feat.txt.out sref_nonref_feat.txt.png snews_nonnews_feat.txt.out (--> is empty ) There's just one line of information in .out files.. the ".png" files are some GNU PLOTS . But i dont understand what the above GNUplots / warnings convey .. Should i re-run them ? Can anyone please tell me on how much time this script might take if each input file contains about 144000 lines.. Thanks and regards
