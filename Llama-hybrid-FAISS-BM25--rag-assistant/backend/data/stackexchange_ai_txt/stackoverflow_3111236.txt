Is it possible to change the permission on files in an Android app's internal storage?

I downloaded a file with an app and stored it inside of its internal storage, but the file is set with -rw------- and I want to change those permissions so is it possible? I know that using external storage is an option but I want to know if I can do it with internal storage too. Thanks for the help. Edit: If it turns out that I can't change the permission is there some shared region of internal storage that I could use? I would like to not force the Android device user to have an SD card.
