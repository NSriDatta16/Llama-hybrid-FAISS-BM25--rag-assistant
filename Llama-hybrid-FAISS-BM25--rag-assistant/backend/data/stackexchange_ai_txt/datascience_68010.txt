Using a CNN in an autoencoder (mentioned by S van Balen), is the most established way of doing anomaly detection. You can possibly use a pre-trained network as a base for this. And it should be possible to train only the decoder, keeping the encoder frozen. There are some works that show using regularization constraints to make the decoder layers the inverse of the encoder, which could maybe make this more efficient. Another approach would be to use the last feature layer of the CNN, and pass that to an anomaly detection model. Like classic methods clustering approaches, or even an autoencoder. Effectively using the CNN as a feature extractor only. Both approaches require access to (some of) the training data to work, but can leverage the pretraining of the CNN.
