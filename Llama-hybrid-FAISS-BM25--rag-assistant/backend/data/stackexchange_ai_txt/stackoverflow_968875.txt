"Official" Way to deploy Assemblies into the GAC?

I just wonder - if I need to deploy an assembly into the GAC, what is the "official" way of doing it? Currently we either manually drag/drop into the c:\windows\assembly folder or we use gacutil.exe. The first way is obviously not the good one (it's manual process after all), and gacutil is part of the SDK and not available per default on production servers. Are there any Microsoft deployment Guidelines?
