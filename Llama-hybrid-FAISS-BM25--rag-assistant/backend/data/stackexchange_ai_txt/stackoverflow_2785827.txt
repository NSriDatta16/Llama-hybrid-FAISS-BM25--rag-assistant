Disclaimer: I've got no particular experience with this. However, I do note that the the Javadoc for createDrawingPatriarch() notes that it will destroy any previous graphics (including, I guess comments, since it appears that comments are stored as part of the drawing patriarch). Have you tried first checking to see whether the document has a drawing patriarch and only creating it if it doesn't, e.g., HSSFPatriarch drawing = document.getDrawingPatriarch() if (drawing == null) drawing = document.createDrawingPatriarch() It still seems that this may be somewhat fragile given the comments in the documentation for getDrawingPatriarch() , but I suspect it may work for your use-case.
