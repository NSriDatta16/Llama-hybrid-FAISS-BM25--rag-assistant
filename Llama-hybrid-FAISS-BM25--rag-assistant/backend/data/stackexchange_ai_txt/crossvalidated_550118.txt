Periods of High Activity Detection

So I have some sensor data (time series) of heart rate of some users. I want to detect the times they start and finish exercising. The data is sensor readings of heart rate every second, it's fluctuating a lot. My goal is to "locate" exercise durations and report the start and end of an exercise. Could someone guide me to the right direction?, Should this be solved via a Fourier transformation for example ? Any reading material or guidance would be much appreciated
