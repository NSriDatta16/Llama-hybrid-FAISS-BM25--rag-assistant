Could you please enlighten us why don't you want to use a database engine for it? If it is just for learning then.... give us please an estimated size of stored data in that file and the access pattern (how many users, how often they do it etc.)? The challenge will be to create an efficient search and modification code. For the search, it's about data structures and organization. For the modification, it's how would you write updates to the file without reading it completely into memory, updating it there and then writing it again completely back to the file.
