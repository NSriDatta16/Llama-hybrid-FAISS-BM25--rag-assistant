How to get a global location from MouseDown?

I'm working on a WinForms app and need to record the location of MouseDown and MouseUp events. My problem is that the events happen on different controls so their coordinate systems don't match (all I need is the amount of drag). I tried adding in the location of the sending control but it still doesn't work right. Is there a simple solution to this?
