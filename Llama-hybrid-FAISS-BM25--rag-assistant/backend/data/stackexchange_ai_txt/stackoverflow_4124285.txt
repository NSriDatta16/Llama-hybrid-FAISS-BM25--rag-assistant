For future reference you need to supply the names of the libraries you want to link with at the linker stage. In visual studio for example you'll find this under Project Properties->Linker->Input Just add them ';' delimited in the "Additional Dependencies" field. Personally I like the #pragma comment solution though as you don't need to remember to add the .libs under additional dependencies you just need those #pragma statements somewhere.
