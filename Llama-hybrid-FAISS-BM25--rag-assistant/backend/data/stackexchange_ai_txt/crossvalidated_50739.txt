TelephoneSurvey, when to call?

I conduce a prestudy to understand when is the best time to call bakers for a telephone survey. Here is my preliminatory study design: I have a table of all 15000 baker firms in a country I select randomly 20 for each hour of day, all but from 19:00 to 23:00 (7pm- 11pm) where I do not expect them to work. 20h * 20 = 400 calls I call them asking them politely if they would answer my survey. For each call I record start and end time The longer the call the better. Also, I record if the baker accepted the survey, and if he answered the phone at all How would you optimize this design so that I require fewer calls? I think about using bayesian theorem to establish gutt feeling priors. Like, at 03:00 they have to work so the probability is low or at 13:00 the major work is over so they will respond more frequently. Then I intend to update the bayesian priors with measuremed response rates Any ideas how to improve my study design? Particularly that I require fewer samples to come to a good judgment when to call?
