Resizing gtk widgets by user

I am working on a project in python using gtk and in it the is a gtk notebook on top of a vte console. I am having trouble getting it to be resizable by the user (i.e. I want the user to be able to drag the border of the 2 up and down and resize both accordingly). Could anyone point me in the right direction on how to do this?
