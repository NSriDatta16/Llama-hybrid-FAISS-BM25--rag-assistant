re: binary random-eff meta-analysis: Why is my heterogeneity estimate so much higher using GLMM compared to other methods? (metabin function)

I am trying to conduct a random effects meta-analysis for binary outcome data using the GLMM method in the meta package (metabin function / meta package). meta package citation: Balduzzi S, Rücker G, Schwarzer G (2019). “How to perform a meta-analysis with R: a practical tutorial.” Evidence-Based Mental Health, 153–160.https://doi.org/10.1136/ebmental-2019-300117 metafor package citation (rma.glmm called internally): Viechtbauer, W. (2010). Conducting meta-analyses in R with the metafor package.Journal of Statistical Software, 36(3), 1-48. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i03 I am perplexed about why the heterogeneity estimate is so much higher for GLMM than what I get using other methods (Mantel-Haenszel or Inverse variance). Does anyone know why this might be? I am not sure if it is a coding error on my part or whether there's another explanation for this. I created a dummy dataset that replicates the pattern of findings from my data ("Data1" below). I also attached my output. The OR estimates were similar across models, but the heterogeneity for GLMM is much larger (albeit, with a very large confidence interval) OR estimates: GLMM: 1.13 MH: 1.12 Inverse-variance: 1.12 I^2 estimates: GLMM: 53.6% [95% CI: 5.3%; 77.3%] MH: 0.0% [95% CI: 0.0%; 62.4%] Inverse-variance: 0.0% [95% CI: 0.0%; 62.4%] dummy data: ID GLMM code and output: m.bin.glmm 1 with glmer(). nAGQ automatically set to 1. > summary(m.bin.glmm) Review: test OR 95%-CI 1 0.6429 [0.0995; 4.1530] 2 0.2222 [0.0297; 1.6646] 3 2.0000 [0.1608; 24.8709] 4 1.6864 [0.7778; 3.6561] 5 0.4444 [0.0528; 3.7383] 6 6.1765 [0.2599; 146.7771] 7 0.7059 [0.0978; 5.0957] 8 1.7143 [0.3510; 8.3725] 9 1.0877 [0.4958; 2.3861] 10 0.8796 [0.2772; 2.7911] Number of studies combined: k = 10 Number of observations: o = 542 Number of events: e = 126 OR 95%-CI t p-value Random effects model 1.1340 [0.7041; 1.8262] 0.60 0.5653 Quantifying heterogeneity: tau^2 = 0; tau = 0; I^2 = 53.6% [5.3%; 77.3%]; H = 1.47 [1.03; 2.10] Test of heterogeneity: Q d.f. p-value Test 19.41 9 0.0219 Wald-type 10.16 9 0.3381 Likelihood-Ratio Details on meta-analytical method: - Mixed-effects logistic regression model (random study effects) - Maximum-likelihood estimator for tau^2 - Random effects confidence interval based on t-distribution (df = 9) - Continuity correction of 0.5 in studies with zero cell frequencies (only used to calculate individual study results) Mantel-Haenszel code and output: m.bin_MH Inverse-variance code and output: m.bin_Inv
