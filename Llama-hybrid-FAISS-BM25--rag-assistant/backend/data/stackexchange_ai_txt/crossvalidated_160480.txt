I use time series forecasting to make sure your supermarket, drugstore etc. has enough product on the shelf when you come shopping. More generally, forecasting is big in the supply chain. And in all other kinds of planning for manufacturing, from planning promotions to sourcing raw materials etc. I just had a call about a travel agency who needs to forecast how many hotel rooms and seats on planes they need to book in advance. Energy companies need to forecast electricity loads and prices to plan production and hedge prices. Demographers need time series forecasting to tell you that we in Europe have a bleak long-range future. You could look through the conference program of the annual International Symposium on Forecasting to get an idea of interesting applications.
