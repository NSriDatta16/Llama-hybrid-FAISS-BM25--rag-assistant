Density estimation for time series data

Suppose I have a collection of time series for a number of subjects, say $y_{ij}$ are measurements for subject $i$ at time $t_{ij}$ . The times are not uniformly sampled and each subject may have a different number of measurements. I'm interested in ways to estimate the time-varying probability density on $y$ , call it $p(y,t)$ . Are there are relatively straightforward ways to estimate this from my scattered data? Would consider both parametric and nonparametric methods (time dependent KDE...?). Can I get a density from a mixed effects model on the data (NLME) or is that heading down the wrong path? Images below give an example. The scatter plot has a LOWESS line to show the average over time. The second plot shows the individual time series for each subject ( $N\approx 1200$ )
