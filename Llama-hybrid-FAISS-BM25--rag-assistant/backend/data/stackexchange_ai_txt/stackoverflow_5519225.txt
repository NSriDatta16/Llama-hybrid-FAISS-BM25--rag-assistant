How to echo the number of reviews of the product on the product page in Magento?

I am unable to echo the number of my products reviews on one of my tabs. Now the title of my reviews tab is Productâ€™s Reviews and I would like to change it to Reviews(0) I need to have a number of reviews in the brackets. How to echo the nuber of reviews from this product? FYI this is NOT working for me: __(\'%d Review(s)\', $this->getReviewsCount()) ?>
