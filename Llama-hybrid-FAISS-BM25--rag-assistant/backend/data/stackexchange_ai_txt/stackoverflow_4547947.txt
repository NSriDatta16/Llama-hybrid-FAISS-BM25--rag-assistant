GLGE has shader based collision detection. See this demo . (WASD,spacebar and mouse to move around. Notice how you collide with walls, etc.) If you look at the source code, collision detection is handled with the code var ray=gameScene.ray(origin,[0,0,1]); If you follow this into glge.js you'll see how this is implemented with a special render mode GLGE.RENDER_PICK (which in turn uses a picking fragment shader in pkfragStr ).
