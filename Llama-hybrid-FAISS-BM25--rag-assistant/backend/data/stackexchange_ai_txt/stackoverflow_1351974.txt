It's more important to be pragmatic than to worry about maintaining "Rails purity." I love named scopes, associations, and all of the magic that goes with them. Of course, I prefer those to running a raw SQL query. However, if a complicated query calls for find_by_sql, then I'll use it without losing any sleep. If you need to support multiple databases, then you might want to shoehorn this into a pure Rails approach, but that requirement is quite rare.
