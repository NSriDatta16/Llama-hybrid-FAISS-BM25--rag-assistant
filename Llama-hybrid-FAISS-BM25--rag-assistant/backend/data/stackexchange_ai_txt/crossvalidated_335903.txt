mef has given a really great answer but with a colleague's help I have managed to adapt the model in the literature example to my specific problem, so I wanted to post the code in case it might help others. So before I was worrying about tmp, but really it was d1 that I needed to plug in to my logistic regression. The code for imperfect detection of a covariate should look like this; model { for(i in 1:N){ # These lines describe the response distribution and linear model terms: PregStatus[i] ~ dbin(regression_prob[i], 1) logit(regression_prob[i]) So hopefully that framework helps others that might want to model imperfect detection in their covariate, rather than their response variable. Kudos to Valle et al., 2015 for the basis for this code. There are more sophisticated models that estimate SN and SP based on the particulars of the validation of the diagnostic test (sample sizes etc. from the comparison with a 'gold standard' test), which could also be adapted to fit in this model.
