Fisher's exact test when a category has a 0

I've been doing the univariate analysis for a retrospective cohorts study. In this variable in particular, none of the no-cured patients had a growth of grampositive bacteria in their culture. Since there's a 0 in one of the boxes, I thought the best test was Fisher-Freeman-Halton's exact test (since the table is larger than 2x2). However, when I try to do it in SPSS, it says that 0 boxes expected a count less than 5 and that the minimum expected count is 6.62 (which is not what I observe). The chi-square p-value for this variable is 0.005, and the Fisher-Freeman-Halton's exact test p-value is 0.001. I would like to do a multivariate analysis including all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis performing a binary logistic regression analysis, but since there's a 0, I wouldn't be able to obtain the adjusted OR for the Grampositives. Any ideas of what would be the best approach? Thanks in advance!
