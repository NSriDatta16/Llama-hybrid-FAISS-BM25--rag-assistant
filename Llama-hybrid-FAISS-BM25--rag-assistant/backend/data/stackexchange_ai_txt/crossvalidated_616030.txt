Okay, maybe I'm misunderstanding how your data are arranged but here's my attempt at an answer. This is based on the understanding that your data are arranged something like: Survey 1 will have a set of likert responses and within that there's 4 questions for each of 2 categories (knowledge and attitude). This survey is administered before the intervention and then you provide the same survey afterwards. Survey 2 asks the same questions afterwards, and you're interested in the individual's change in response, and you can control for this because you have individual identity as one of your variables? In this case rather than attempt to run everything at once in one analysis I would break this out into individual questions that I was trying to address and use a specific test to answer each question. e.g.: (1) Does knowledge improve after the intervention? Use a paired t-test of the average response to the knowledge questions before and after the intervention. Same idea applies for attitude. (2) Does knowledge show a greater improvement than attitude? For each student calculate the difference between their knowledge scores between survey 1 and survey 2, then calculate the difference between their attitude scores between survey 1 and survey 2. Then perform a paired t-test to determine whether knowledge or attitude showed the greatest gains while controlling for individual identity. (3) Is an increase in knowledge correlated with an increase in attitude? Same test as above but you're running a spearman rank correlation instead (or Wilcoxon), where delta knowledge is on the y-axis, and delta attitude is on the x-axis, and each point is an individual's average score. This is just my opinion, but that's because I don't see the utility of lumping all of these analyses together into one assessment that's more difficult to understand. Also, don't commit yourself to a non-parametric test just because it's "safer". Run the tests for normality so that you meet the assumptions of whatever test you're doing and choose the appropriate (parametric/non-parametric) on that basis.
