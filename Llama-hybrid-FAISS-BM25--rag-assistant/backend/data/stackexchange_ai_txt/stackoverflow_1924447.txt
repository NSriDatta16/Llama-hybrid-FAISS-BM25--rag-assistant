Walking a Linux/Unix filesystem with Java?

I need to create a Java util that will recurse its way through a Unix (and/or Linux) filesystem and build an object model of the directory structure, retrieve file info - size, created date, last accessed date etc - plus I need to retrieve info on the physical storage device the files are sitting on. Ideally, this util will be portable. I have no experience of the Java standard libraries and only limited experience of Unix OS. Are there Java standard libraries that will handle working with the Unix filesystem? Or am I going to have to make native calls through some API and then worry about portability? What options do I have?
