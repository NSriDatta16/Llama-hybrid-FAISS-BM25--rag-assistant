What is a manifold for Unsupervised Learning?

I've been watching Dr. G. Hinton lectures on Neural Networks in Machine Learning, and in one of the lectures he explains what the goals of Unsupervised Learning are. I am having trouble understanding the part where high-dimensional inputs such as images live on or near a low-dimensional manifold (or several such manifolds). What is a manifold exactly, and why is this the case? Thanks!
