The best method for setting a socket as non-blocking in C is to use ioctl. An example where an accepted socket is set to non-blocking is following: long on = 1L; unsigned int len; struct sockaddr_storage remoteAddress; len = sizeof(remoteAddress); int socket = accept(listenSocket, (struct sockaddr *)&remoteAddress, &len) if (ioctl(socket, (int)FIONBIO, (char *)&on)) { printf("ioctl FIONBIO call failed\n"); }
