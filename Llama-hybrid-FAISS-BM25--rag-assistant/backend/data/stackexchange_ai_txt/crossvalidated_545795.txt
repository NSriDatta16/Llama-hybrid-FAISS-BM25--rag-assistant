In general, when you don't get an answer on this site, it is mainly because people are struggling to understand the question... while you might have a valid point, which, I think, is the case here. Most of the time, providing data sample contributes a lot to understand better your challenge. In your comment, you indicated that the data looks like this: year # of pregnant teenagers # of pregnancies due to sexual assaults 2020 500 400 2019 450 250 ... ... ... You indicated that you want to make inference, so I assume that you have only a random sample that represents the population that you want to study. In that case, you might be interested in defining a confidence interval to make inference on the true population proportion. You might also want to test your sample against an assumption you have about the true population parameter. If the data looks like the above, then the factor contributing to pregnancies is already identified since we are talking about "# of pregnancies due to sexual assaults", but you also mentioned "factor contributing to", which might indicate that you are looking for some type of correlation. Since you answered my comment, I understand this is not an orphan question and therefore I encourage you to edit it and update it with clarifications. You can learn more about how this site works on the help center . I hope it helps!
