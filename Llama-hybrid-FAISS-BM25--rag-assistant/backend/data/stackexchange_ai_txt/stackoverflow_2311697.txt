Is there a robust java.util.logging handler implementation of syslog?

I'm looking into hooking up a 3rd party Java application to our log aggregation/analysis solution (probably Splunk, we haven't finalized our selection yet though). It seems to be easiest to hook the Splunk agent to syslog, so I'm looking for a way to redirect the application logs to a local syslog daemon on the server. The Java application uses java.util.logging, which unfortunately does not feature a syslog handler out of the box (I believe log4j does, though). Are there any proven libraries to do this? The log load isn't huge (probably 10-20 messages per minute from each process, up to 6 processes per host) but I'm concerned with reliability and durability (e.g. what happens when the daemon is down?...). Any help would be appreciated...
