Finally I made it, I have to clear that first of all I made all my reports using another web page, according to the responses I received I realized that my apprroach to call a report within the same page using a href was not correct. So, I analized Robert Wagner suggestion and I tried this approach; protected void btnPrint_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ... string url = GetUrlWithParameters(); string reportscript = " " + "window.open('" + url + "', 'CustomPopUp', " + "'width=400, height=400, resizable=yes, scrollbars=yes')" + " "; Page.RegisterStartupScript("reportscript", reportscript); ... In GetUrlWithParameters() I construct and url calling an ashx where I produce my report, the ashx receives different parameters according to some issues and it worked very nice. It executes the script and shows the pdf in another windows exactly as I needed. Thanx.
