Without having seen the data, I don't think machine learning is the appropriate choice here because your data is not IID. It is reasonable to believe that users may have different login habits, and we should allow for that in our model by modelling time between logins as a hierarchical model. Posit that each user's time between logins has some distribution (maybe it is exponential), which is parameterized by $\lambda_i$ . Then, maybe you say that the $\lambda_i$ come from some distribution. So your model posits the following: $$ (\Delta_{t})_{i} \sim \operatorname{Exponential}(\lambda _i) \quad i = 1 \dots N $$ $$ \lambda_i \sim P(\lambda)$$ Here $P$ is the distribution for the $\lambda_i$ . Maybe the $\lambda$ are gamma distributed or something. I'm not saying that this is the model, but I think an approach like this is reasonable. If you have a lot of data, you could even do an Empirical Bayes approach and construct "priors" from the data.
