You could adjust for the expected activity. One way to do it would be to find the average number of posts/likes/whatevs and, instead of predicting based on the number of them, predict based on the number/avg. number. So, for instance, if in 2005, the average likes for everyone was 100, and someone got 130 - your feature is $130/100 = 1.3$ , pretty good. But in 2008, it was 1000, so $130/1000 = 0.13$ , not so great. A subtler approach would be to adjust on probabilities directly, which would let you account for the asymmetry inherent in that kind of thing, and for the fact your data is discrete, but that's a little bit more complicated, so I won't go into it unprompted.
