Precision is often used in Bayesian software by convention. It gained popularity because gamma distribution can be used as a conjugate prior for precision . Some say that precision is more "intuitive" than variance because it says how concentrated are the values around the mean rather than how spread they are. It is said that we are more interested in how precise is some measurement rather than how imprecise it is (but honestly I do not see how it would be more intuitive). The more spread are the values around the mean (high variance), the less precise they are (small precision). The smaller the variance, the greater the precision. Precision is just an inverted variance $\tau = 1/\sigma^2$ . There is really nothing more than this.
