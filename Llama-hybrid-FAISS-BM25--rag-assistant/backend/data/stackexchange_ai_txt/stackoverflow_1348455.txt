Either you don't allow references to local variables of the containing function in the contained one, and the nesting is just a scoping feature without much use, or you do. If you do, it is not a so simple feature: you have to be able to call a nested function from another one while accessing the correct data, and you also have to take into account recursive calls. That's not impossible -- techniques are well known for that and where well mastered when C was designed (Algol 60 had already the feature). But it complicates the run-time organization and the compiler and prevent a simple mapping to assembly language (a function pointer must carry on information about that; well there are alternatives such as the one gcc use). It was out of scope for the system implementation language C was designed to be.
