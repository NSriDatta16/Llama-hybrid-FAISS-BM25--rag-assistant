adjusting batch effect by multiple linear regression

I am analyzing rna-seq data in the format of counts. There is batch effect revealed by PCA. One method I tried called RUVseq , it estimated the variation basing on control genes, and then added it to design matrix. I don't know why simply adding a continuous variable will work. Here is an example, the experiment setting is: samples groups A 1 B 1 C 1 D 2 E 2 F 2 G 3 H 3 I 3 Then RUVseq methods could estimate the unwanted variation, for example, B Then combine them together: samples groups B A 1 -0.37670272 B 1 2.44136463 C 1 -0.79533912 D 2 -0.05487747 E 2 0.25014132 F 2 0.61824329 G 3 -0.17262350 H 3 -2.22390027 I 3 -1.26361438 Make a design matrix to fit glm, an example of design is model.matrix( ~ 0 + groups + B) My question is why this works? The coefficient of continuous variable means how many the read counts of genes will change of one unit of B changed, right? Then why B could be used for correcting the batch effect?
