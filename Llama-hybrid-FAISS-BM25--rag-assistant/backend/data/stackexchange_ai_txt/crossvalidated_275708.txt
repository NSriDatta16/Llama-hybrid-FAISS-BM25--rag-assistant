How to combine the output states of two LSTM encoders?

I use two LSTM encoders to encode two inputs from two different sources(with different time steps or length) and I get a pair of outputs and a pair of output states from each encoder . I concatenate the two outputs for the attention mechanism of the decoder, but I don't know how to combine the two output states to input it to the decoder. Should I concatenate them(to scale up the dimension to be twice as before) or keep the dimension by doing the simple element-wise addition? Or any other methods? But what is the mathematics underpinning the choice? Or is it totally empirical?
