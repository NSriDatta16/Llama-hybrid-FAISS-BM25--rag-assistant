Separate date and time form fields in Rails

I have an ActiveRecord model Event with a datetime column starts_at . I would like to present a form, where date and time for starts_at are chosen separately (e.g. "23-10-2010" for date and "18:00" for time). These fields should be backed by the single column starts_at , and validations should preferably be against starts_at , too. I can of course muck around with virtual attributes and hooks, but I would like a more elegant solution. I have experimented with both composed_of ( rdoc ), and attribute-decorator ( lighthouse discussion , github ) without success. Below is a rough outline of what I would like.. class Event Any help appreciated.
