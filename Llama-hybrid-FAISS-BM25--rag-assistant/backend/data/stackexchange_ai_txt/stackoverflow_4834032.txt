Does the local storage already have entries in it which have a different model 'schema'? Just a thought: try a different proxy id. But also I think you are better registering a store than instantiating it directly. Try: Ext.regStore('store', { proxy: {...} ... ); Then store:'store' in the lists or whatever that bind to it.
