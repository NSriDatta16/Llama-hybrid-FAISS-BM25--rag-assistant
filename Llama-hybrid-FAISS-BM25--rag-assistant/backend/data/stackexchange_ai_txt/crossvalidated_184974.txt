How to handle non- linear predictors in Decision Trees

I have a data set of just 1800 rows. I am not sure about how to provide inputs for certain variables. For eg., I have a column called number of previous jobs, and the values lie between 1 and 10, with values greater than 5 together having a frequency of each of the values 1 , 2, 3 and 4. Also, the dependent variable has a staggered relationship with these values. These are the questions I have: Do i send this column as continuous data? If yes, do I cap the values? Or do i create categories like 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ as the relationship is staggered and this balances out the frequency of levels? This is the first time I am working on Machine learning algorithms and would appreciate your guidance. If you need any clarifications, please do put it in comments.
