the difference in performance, if a difference exists, will be absolutely minimal. basically, the , -syntax is nothing else than a shorter form of writing a join, so the only difference will be the time used to "parse" the statements. there are a lot of much more important things to do to get a better performance on the database like using indexes don't select unused fields choose the best storage engine for your needs personally, i would use the second syntax because it's more readable for me (and readable code is important - much more important than such tiny performance-differences) - but thats just my subjective opinion, others may like the first syntax because it's shorter...
