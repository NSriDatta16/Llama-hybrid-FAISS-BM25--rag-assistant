Choosing among PDFs

This is a pretty broad question. I just learned that two random variables can have the same moments but different PDFs. Take $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\mathbb{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2$. Since there are many PDFs which could have these same moments (and even higher order moments), what factors should one consider when choosing among PDFs to model $X_i$? I know that in Bayesian analysis, conjugacy is important for computational reasons, but what are some more theoretical reasons to choose one PDF over another? What properties of the data might an experimenter consider when choosing a model?
