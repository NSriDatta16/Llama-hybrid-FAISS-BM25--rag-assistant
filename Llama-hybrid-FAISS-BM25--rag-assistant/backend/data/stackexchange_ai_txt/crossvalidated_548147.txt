MCMC: potential causes of poor mixing within small parameter space

I am currently running into a peculiar issue where after running a Bayesian state-space model, independent MCMC chains all end up within a small parameter space (say within +/-.01 region), but there is poor mixing between chains. Chains for slope parameters on standardized variables are initiated using a random number of mean zero and sd=1. To me, this indicates that the MCMC sampler is finding the correct parameter space, but I do not understand why the chains themselves remain separated. The plot below is an example, although this is happening for all parameters. The plot shows 20k iterations after a 100k burn-in phase. Increasing the number of iterations does not solve the problem. I wish to know if this points to any general issues with MCMC sampling before looking towards the details of my actual model. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
