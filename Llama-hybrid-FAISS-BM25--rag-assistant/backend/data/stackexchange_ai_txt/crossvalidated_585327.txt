linear regression and logistic regression global p values aren't associated to the same test? How to interpret them?

I'm using the package statsmodels in Python 3.9.10 . When I carry out a linear regression model, I get this: Am I right when I say: The F-statistic checks how likely the sample if all coefficients are 0. In this particular case, it's the same as the p value associated to the categorical variable VHD. This is because when there's only one variable, the F-statistic (testing if the coefficients are 0) is the same as the t-statistic associated to VHD (testing if the coefficient VHD is 0). Now I want to have the same p values when carrying out a logistic regression. However, I have this: And I can't find Prob (F-statistic) anymore. I have however LLR p-value. Why is that? Should I interpret it the same way as the F-statistic p-value when doing a linear regression?
