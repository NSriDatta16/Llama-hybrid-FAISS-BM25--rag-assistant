Is it reasonable to view $P(Y|X_1, X_2, X_3)$ as 3 coin flips?

This CMU Machine Learning Course gives a formula to compute the number of params in an estimation. $2^n$ for the distribution $P(Y|X_1, X_2, ... X_n)$ consider 3 boolean RVs, is it reasonable to viewed $P(Y|X_1, X_2, X_3)$ as 3 coin flips? if yes, what does each param do?
