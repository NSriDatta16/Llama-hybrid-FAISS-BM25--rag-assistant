It would really help if you posted some example data. It shouldn't make any difference whether the input for metaMDS is a dissimilarity matrix you've pre-calculated (bray_dist), or your raw OTU table (OTU). Are you sure you're really getting different results? When you call beta_nmds_bray do you not see the same 'stress' score? You will see a slight difference if you try plotting the outputs (beta_nmds_bray) - this is just because the species scores are missing if you use a dissimilarity matrix as your input to metaMDS. If you plot just the 'site' points, the plots should like very similar - identical except for perhaps being on a different scale. You can calculate a range of beta diversity measures using the betadivers() function, and the betadispers() function can be used to analyse beta diversities with respect to classes or factors.
