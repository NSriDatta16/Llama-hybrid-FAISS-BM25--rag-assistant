The total pot over all 100 games is \$100,000. With a 58% chance of winning, you would therefore expect an average gain of \$58,000 if the winner of a round gets the whole pot. In some sense, you might consider this to be fair. On the other hand, if you get half of the pot whether you win or not, you'd have an average gain of $50,000. You might consider this to be fair instead, and your friend would be more likely to agree with you. Your proposed payout is 58% to the round winner, which is between 100% (winner takes all) and 50%. You'd therefore expect an average gain somewhere between \$58,000 and \$50,000, so the expected gain you calculated is not surprising. This is obviously unfavourable to you compared to your expected winnings under winner-takes-all. If by "fair" you want your expected winnings to be half of the total money involved, then you need $58 \times p + 42 \times q = 50,000$ , where $p$ is the amount you get when you win, and $p$ is the amount you get when you lose. If these payouts are the same for both players, you're under the constraint $q = 1000 - p$ , so the only solution is $p = 500$ , i.e. winner and loser get the same amount. This is rather dull, so to make a fair-but-interesting game you need the payout to depend on who won the round. To do this, you can simply make the payout to the winner depend on who the winner is: if you get \$500 + \$x when you win, you get \$500 - \$ $\frac{58}{42}$ x when you lose, so you losses are more punishing than your friend's, to make up for you winning more often. Alternatively, you can look at more complex payout schemes, where, e.g., the stronger player needs to win several times in a row to get decent payouts.
