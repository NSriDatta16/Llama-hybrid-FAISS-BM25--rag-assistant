I posted a comment, but thought I'd elaborate a bit more. What I do is create a Common library with namespaces: [Organisation].[Product].Common as the root and a sub namespace Helpers. A few people on here mention things like creating a class and shoving some stuff they don't know where else to put in there. Wrong. I'd say, even if you need one helper method, it is related to something, so create a properly named (IoHelper, StringHelper, etc.) static helper class and put it in the Helpers namespace. That way, you get some structure and you get some sort of separation of concerns. In the root namespace, you can use instance utility classes that do require state (they exist!). And needless to say also use an appropriate class name, but don't suffix with Helper.
