The optimal $\lambda$ is picked as "the one that minimizes the average cross validated mean squared error" (quote from the linked paper). In addition to that, through the CV partitioning we can still pick a "candidate" $\lambda$ (and the associated $\beta^{(-i)}$ ) such that it minimises the MSE within the particular $i$ -th fold. The author could be a bit more specific as to the fact that multiple candidate $\lambda$ 's are used sequentially and/or that $\beta^{(-i)}$ minimizes the error against $y^{(-1)}$ but the overall paragraph is not wrong. :)
