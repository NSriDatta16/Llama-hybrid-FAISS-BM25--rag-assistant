How to develop a prediction model based on correlation in R?

I have two sets of data, say sales and profit, and I have calculated the correlation between these two data over different months using R . So currently I have somethings like this: Month | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | .... sales | X | Y | Z | P | .... profit | A | B | C | D | .... correlation | .1 | .35 | .28 | -.47| .... This correlation calculation has been done over period of years and now I want to develop a prediction model which can provide me prediction for coming months of coming years,say what will be the profit for month of Aug 2014? How can I develop such a prediction model and what else, apart from what I have as of now, will I need to develop the prediction model? I am new to statistics and predictive analysis and thus if anyone could provide me a guide of required steps and some info about how can I do those steps then it would be very helpful for me to get the understanding also. Thanks in advance. NOTE: If I could get help in respect to some non parametric bayesian method then it will be great.
