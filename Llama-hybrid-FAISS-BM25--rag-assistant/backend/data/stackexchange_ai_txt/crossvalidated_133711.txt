Can improper priors be implemented in some way?

I'm new to bayesian inference. I've just discovered that improper priors can't be specified in WinBUGS/OpenBUGS. I was wondering if this is common or not in bayesian inference. Are there same cases in which it's possible to implement a improper prior? Suppose you have a improper uniform prior: $U(0,\infty )$. Do I always have to approximate this by a proper uniform $U(0,A)$ with $A$ large?
