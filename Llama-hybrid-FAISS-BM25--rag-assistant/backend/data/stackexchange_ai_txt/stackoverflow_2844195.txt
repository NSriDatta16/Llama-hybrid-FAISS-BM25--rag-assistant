If you are retrieving data from a pure relational database, you should look to see if you can retrieve multiple result sets in a single query. Alternately, if you can fetch ragged results, retrieve these in a tree structure with the corresponding shape. If your connection to the database is not smart enough for this, you could use a universal join of the results and then return a union query tagged in some form to identify which result is from which table. You don't state the reason for the reduced round-tripping, but you may also be able to use something like a stored procedure to collect the required data at the server and then return it in one result set.
