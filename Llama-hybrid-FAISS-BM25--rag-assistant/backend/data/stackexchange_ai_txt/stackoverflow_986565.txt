I come from an scientific visualisation background and have used Open Inventor for years. I started my own business last year and my first consulting job was to a large mining company to build a 3D visualisation system based on Open Inventor (using the .Net bindings from Mercury). While 3D visualisation might be somewhat specialised, there is a growing need for these skills - many industries are "going 3D". With this comes opportunities, so you can definitely make a living off 3D visualisation. I would encourage you to follow your heart a little here; if you love 3D graphics, then skill up and make it part of your career. In my opinion you should focus on the required mathematics, building a depth of knowledge in this area, and have some experience with a selection of technologies like OpenGL, DirectX, Open Inventor, Java 3D or some other scenegraph. You could also write your own scenegraph to build your skills. A good understanding of current hardware capabilities and hardware trends is essential.
