How to use a custom view correctly?

I have been trying to make a simple drawing program. Recently, I have figured out to draw shapes in a custom view for this purpose. My problem is that I have to draw everything at a single point in time. I don't know if that actually makes sense, but it seems to me that it calls the drawRect method only once, at that "once" is on startup. Here is my code so far: Header file. NSBezierPath *thePath; NSColor *theColor; NSTimer *updateTimer; NSPoint *mousePoint; int x = 0; int y = 0; @interface test : NSView { IBOutlet NSView *myView; } @property (readwrite) NSPoint mousePoint; @end Then, implementation in the .m file. @implementation test @synthesize mousePoint; - (void) mouseDown:(NSEvent*)someEvent { CGEventRef ourEvent = CGEventCreate(NULL); mousePoint = CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent); NSLog(@"Location: x= %f, y = %f", (float)mousePoint.x, (float)mousePoint.y); thePath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:NSMakeRect(mousePoint.x, mousePoint.y, 10, 10)]; theColor = [NSColor blackColor]; } - (void) mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)someEvent { mousePoint = [someEvent locationInWindow]; NSLog(@"Location: x= %f, y = %f", (float)mousePoint.x, (float)mousePoint.y); x = mousePoint.x; y = mousePoint.y; [myView setNeedsDisplay:YES]; } - (void) drawRect:(NSRect)rect; { NSLog(@"oisudfghio"); thePath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:NSMakeRect(x, y, 10, 10)]; theColor = [NSColor blackColor]; [theColor set]; [thePath fill]; } @end On startup, it draws a rectangle in the bottom left corner, like it should. The problem is, the drawRect method is only called on startup. It just won't fire no matter what I do. EDIT: I have just updated the code. I hope it helps. SECOND EDIT: I have really simplified the code. I hope this helps a bit more.
