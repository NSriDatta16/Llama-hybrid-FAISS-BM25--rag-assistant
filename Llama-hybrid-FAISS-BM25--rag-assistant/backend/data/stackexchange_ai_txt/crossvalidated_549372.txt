PR estimation of a cross sectional study with a continuous variable possibly by Cox proportional hazard regression

I have a table of a simple cross sectional data: Outcome Predictor 1: 1 1.9571444 2: 1 6.2957907 3: 1 0.5125633 4: 1 3.9978328 5: 1 1.2885436 --- 158: 2 3.0989126 159: 2 0.8838995 160: 2 3.9801100 161: 2 -1.3533320 162: 2 5.5115921 and summary of the data: Characteristic N = 1621 Outcome 1 119 (73%) 2 43 (27%) Predictor 3.15 (1.49, 5.33) 1 n (%); Median (IQR) I've read the following article: Aluísio JD Barroscorresponding author1 and Vânia N Hirakata1, "Alternatives for logistic regression in cross-sectional studies: an empirical comparison of models that directly estimate the prevalence ratio" doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-3-21 https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2F1471-2288-3-21 These authors used "Cox regression with constant time at risk" to estimate prevalence ratio of the cross sectional data in question. My question is if it is possible to use their strategy for the cross-sectional data with the continuous variable to obtain the correct PR estimate? I would also appreciate an example of a R code to do this. My Ultimate goal is to be able to generate a graph with PR vs predictor.
