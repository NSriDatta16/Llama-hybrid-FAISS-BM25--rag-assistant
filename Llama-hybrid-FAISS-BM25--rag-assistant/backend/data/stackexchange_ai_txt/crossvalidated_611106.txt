Do models differ for prediction and inference for same training data?

Here's my idea and doubt There are two purposes of machine learning, inference, and prediction. In prediction, we are interested in finding a model to give us the best accuracy when we try to find the forecast for a new data point. In inference, the idea is to understand the relationship between input variables and output variables. However, for a particular problem, we assume to have a single underlying data-generating process. In that case, won't fitting different models for inference and prediction be a violation of this assumption? For example, we can fit linear regression for inference and a normal distribution-based model for prediction but underlying DGP can be only one (in the best possible scenario). In that case, does it make sense to do so?
