You can do most things in ASP.net using fairly pure C#. Early on I relied heavily on the ASP.net controls, dragging and dropping most of my pages with little snippets of code here and there to make controls do what I wanted. I really didn't like it, and it make me think of coding ASP.net as a completely distinct thing from C# programming(Ok it was vb at the time- Don't Judge me!). Now almost all of my code- and html generation is handled by various custom classes. My code-behind pages simply connect the page specific inputs and event to my utillity classes. Likewise i use inline code for output- I simply invoke a function on my code behind that gathers the necessary variable and lets my classes do the heavy lifting. I definitely find that some of the ASP.net specific controls are useful and I do use them from time to time. I did, however, find that changing the way I put my code together gave me a whole different idea of the language.
