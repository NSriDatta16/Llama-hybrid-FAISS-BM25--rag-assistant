Repository organization for Hadoop project

I am starting on a new Hadoop project that will have multiple hadoop jobs(and hence multiple jar files). Using mercurial for source control, I was wondering what would be optimal way of organizing the repository structure? Should each job live in separate repo or would it be more efficient to keep them in the same, but break down into folders?
