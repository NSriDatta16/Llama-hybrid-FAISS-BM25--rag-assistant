textile - how do I add a class to a definition list?

I'm using RedCloth to convert some textile text into html. One particular scenario seems particularly apt for using definition lists . With RedCloth, definition lists have this syntax ( source ): - coffee := Hot and black - tea := Also hot, but a little less black - milk := Nourishing beverage for baby cows. Cold drink that goes great with cookies. =: I want to add the class "beverages" to that list (so that the generated code looks like ... ). I've tried this: (beverages)- coffee := Hot and black ... I also tried: -(beverage) coffee := Hot and black -(beverage) tea := Also hot, but a little less black ... This is the way you style the other lists ( ul s and ol s) in textile, but it didn't work for dl s. The text was rendered as a literal paragraph ( -(beverage) coffee := Hot and black ) Is there a syntax for adding classes to definition lists in textile, or must I use raw html instead?
