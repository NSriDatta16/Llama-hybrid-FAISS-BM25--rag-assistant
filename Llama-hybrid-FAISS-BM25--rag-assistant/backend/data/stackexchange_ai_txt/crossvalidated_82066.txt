Perhaps the safest thing to do would be to estimate ALL sensible specifications. If the results all tell the same basic story, then you can just pick your preferred specificaiton, using some logical argument as to why you think that that one best answers the question you choose to ask. If different regression specifications lead to different conclusions, you need to dig a bit deeper and think of why that might be so. Re: your specific questions: x1: I'd probably model this as a continuous variable, or as a factor variable for prices in different bands - x11 = below(Y/N), x12 = average(Y/N), x13(Y/N). the drawback of discretizing a continuous variable is that your selected bands are essentially arbitrary. My concern about a binary above/below is that, if many people are clustered near the mean, your estimated effects will be attenuated artificially. Again, different specifications will hopefully have consistent interpretations. x3: I'd model this as a factor. Treating it as a continuous variable involves imposing linearity, and you might not have a good justification for doing so.
