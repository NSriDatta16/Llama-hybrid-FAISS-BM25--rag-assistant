Russ Cam is missing an edge case -- you can drag and drop text into and within input fields by highlighting and dragging, which his code does not account for. Below code that covers this case: $(function() { var areaText = $('#area').val(); $('#text').bind('keyup keypress drop', dropfunction() { $('#area')[0].value = areaText + $(this)[0].value; }); }); That said, there is still another edge case, which is deleting and manipulating via context menu. As of right now I can't see a way to detect the selection of context menu interaction... You could disable it if that is important using the following code $('#text').bind('contextmenu', function() { return false });
