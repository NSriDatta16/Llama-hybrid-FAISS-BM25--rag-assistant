Why not use the same statistics to denormalize the results? If the test data is good enough to train a neural network then why would its statistics not be good enough to denormalize the results? However, I would suggest not using min and max as the scale factors. The min and max can be very sensitive. I suggest using robust estimates of the mean and standard deviation to normalize.
