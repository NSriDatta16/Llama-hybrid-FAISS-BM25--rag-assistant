Looking over your code I don't see any particular reason you would be getting that value unless it reflected the actual values being sensed. Can you run the program and output each of the 32 values before averaging for the number that has the problem, the number before it, and the number after it? Alternately, write out the new sample each time you get a sample and give us that data. -Adam
