Linear Regression + KFold cross validation

I have a prepossessed data set ready and the corresponding labels (8 classes). I've already done KFold cross validation with K=10 with some classifiers such as DT,KNN,NB and SVM and now I want to do a linear regression model, but not sure how it goes with the KFold , is it even possible or for the regression I should just divide the set on my own to a training and testing sets ? The 8 classes are ages (for NLP problem) , so I want to check both options of classification and regression.
