It's quite embarrassing but... the only problem with my code that uses urllib and urllib2 is... that this code do a GET and not a POST !!! Here my scan using Wireshark: 1- using urllib and urllib2 Hypertext Transfer Protocol GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n [Expert Info (Chat/Sequence): GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n] [Message: GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n] [Severity level: Chat] [Group: Sequence] Request Method: GET Request URI: / Request Version: HTTP/1.1 Accept-Encoding: identity\r\n Host: api.apptrackr.org\r\n Connection: close\r\n User-Agent: Python-urllib/2.6\r\n \r\n 2- using PyCurl Hypertext Transfer Protocol POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n [Expert Info (Chat/Sequence): POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n] [Message: POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n] [Severity level: Chat] [Group: Sequence] Request Method: POST Request URI: / Request Version: HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: PycURL/7.19.5\r\n Host: api.website.com\r\n Accept: */*\r\n Content-Length: 365\r\n [Content length: 365] Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n \r\n Line-based text data: application/x-www-form-urlencoded [truncated] request=%7B%22enc_key%22%3A%22o37vOsNetKgprRE0VsBYefYViP4%2ByB3pjxfkfCYtpgiQ%2ByxONgkhhsxtqAwaXwCrrgx%2BPDuDtMRZNI1ez//4Zw%3D%3D%22%2C%22format%22%3A%22RSA_RC4_Sealed%22%2C%22profile%22%3A%22Ldn%22%2C%22request%22%3A%22bQ%2BHm/ so the code works, but it's not right for me because i need a POST, but i will prefer to use NOT PyCurl. Any idea? Thank you very much!!
