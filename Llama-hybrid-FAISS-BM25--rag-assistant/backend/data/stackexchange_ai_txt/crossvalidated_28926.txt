Sample size determination and power analysis are intimately related to the null hypothesis statistical testing framework whereby we seek to determine if some research findings are statistically interesting, based on results of a statistical test alongside effect size measures that may strengthen our claims. The probability of correctly detecting the difference between the true and hypothesized parameter values is called the power of the test (see power ), and power analysis aims to find the optimal sample size that maximizes the expected value of the information produced minus the total cost of the study (1, 2), using frequentist, Bayesian or Monte Carlo techniques.
