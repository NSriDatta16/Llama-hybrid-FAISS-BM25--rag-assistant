Making an app with xcode with a map showing a route

Hello I need to make an app that shows you your current position on a defined route. As I am new to xCode, I'm just playing around a little bit. I am organizing a walk with an already chosen route. And I want my app to show this route on a map, with the current position of the walker, so that they can see how far it is to the finish line. A little display showing your already walked distance and the distance to go would be nice to. Could you please give me some tips? Thanks
