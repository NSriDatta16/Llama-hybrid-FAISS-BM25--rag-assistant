Perhaps someone can post a more enlightening answer as to why, but judging from the last two US elections, I'm forced to conclude exactly what I had suspected prior to the 2016 elections: It appears our polling methodologies in fact do not work for elections. There isn't yet a consensus on why this appears to be the case, but some hypotheses I've found have been the following: Supporters of some candidates may be more likely to respond due to enthusiasm. [1, 2] Supporters of some candidates may be less likely to respond due to distrust. [1, 2, 4] We poll too often and compromise on sample size/quality, mistaking noise for signal. [1, 2] Weightings that we do to correct for demographics biases may be inadequate. [3] Links with more discussions on the topic: (NYMag) Should We Stop Paying Attention to Election Polls?
