Parametric is used in (at least) two meanings: A - To declare you are assuming the family of the noise distribution up to it's parameters. B - To declare you are assuming the specific functional relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome. Some examples: A quantile regression with a linear link would qualify as B-parametric and A-non-parametric. Spline smoothing of a time series with Gaussian noise can quality as A-non-parametric and B-parametric. The term "semi-parametric" usually refers to case B and means you are not assuming the whole functional relation, but rather you have milder assumptions such as "additive in some smooth transformation of the predictors". You could also have milder assumptions on the distribution of the noise- such as "all moments are finite", without specifically specifying the shape of the distribution. To the best of my knowledge, there is no term for this type of assumption. Note that the answer relates to the underlying assumptions behind the data generating process. When saying "a-parametric test", one usually refers to non-parametric in sense A. In this is what you meant, then I would answer "no". It would be impossible to be parametric and non-parametric in the same sense at the same time.
