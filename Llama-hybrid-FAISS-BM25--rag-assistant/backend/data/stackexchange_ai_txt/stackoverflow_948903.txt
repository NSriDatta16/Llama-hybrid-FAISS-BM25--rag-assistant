File naming convention for layers

I have split my .NET project into three different layers Facade Layer, Business Layer and Data Access Layer. I am looking for the correct naming convention for the file names for these layers. For example if I have accounts related function in my project, I am currently having 'AccountsFAC.cs' and class name AccountsFAC in facade layer, AccountsBL.cs and class name AccountsBL in business layer, AccountsDAL.cs and AccountsDAL class name in DAL Layer. I want to know whether this is the correct way of namign the files in different layers. Added later Suggestion #1 One of the suggestions given by Robert Koritnik below is to use descriptive names like 'AccountStore' and 'AccountService'
