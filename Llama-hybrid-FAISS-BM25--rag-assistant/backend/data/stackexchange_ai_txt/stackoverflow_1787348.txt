Hm. I write a lot of HTML and CSS every day and I am not excited. The paragraph you mention I write in five seconds, and six times Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Granted, there may be scenarios when a meta language will save more time but I have never felt the need for one. When there are really massive amounts of HTML - or SQL, or arrays - to produce, I will write a small PHP or VB script for the task. I wouldn't want another meta-language to produce something in another language. Maybe useful for others but not for me. If discussion about the general usefulness was what you were looking for. Reading your post a second time, I'm not that sure any more. Anyway. :)
