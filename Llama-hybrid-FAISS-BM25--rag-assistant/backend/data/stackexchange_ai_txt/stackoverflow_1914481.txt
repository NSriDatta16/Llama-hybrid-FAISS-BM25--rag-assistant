Seeing as it is homework, and depending on the inclinations of your tutor/professor/teacher, you are probably better to go down the route of writing a separate classes for the engine, wheels and so on. Even though it may be completely over-engineered, and your application may not care about them, it is possible that your homework will be marked by standards such as: "Did they identify an engine class" "Does it have sensible methods like Start()" "Mark them down for lumping everything in one big class that is actually simpler, because they clearly don't understand composition" Or whatever, and not the kinds of standards that the more pragmatic people in this thread apply to their own designs.
