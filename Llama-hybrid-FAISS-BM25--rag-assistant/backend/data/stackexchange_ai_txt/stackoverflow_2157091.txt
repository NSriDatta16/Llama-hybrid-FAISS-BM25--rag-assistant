When you search the entire RedCloth source for def to , besides finding a couple of methods that start with to , you'll also find the exact method to in ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth_scan.rb.rl . There's two things that happen here. First, this file is preprocessed by Ragel . But for this question, you may safely ignore this fact and read past the weird syntax in that file. Focus on the Ruby bits. Second, the class RedCloth::TextileDoc is reopend here. That means the class in this file and in lib/redcloth/textile_doc.rb are the same. So the to instance method will be available to the piece of code you quoted.
