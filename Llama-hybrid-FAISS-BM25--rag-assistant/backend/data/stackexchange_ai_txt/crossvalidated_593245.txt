Need to scale environmental variables when correlating to NMDS axes?

I've created a Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination from a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. (Starting data were basal areas of various tree species across multiple research plots). I'd like to determine correlations of various plot-level environmental variables (e.g., soil chemistry, topography, elevation ,etc.) with my two NMDS ordination axes. Correlations between the ordination axes and environmental variables will be calculated with Pearsonâ€™s r 2 . For reference, I've chosen to do this using the cor2m() and vf() functions available in the Ecodist package (vs vegan) in R. My question: Do I have to scale/standardize my environmental variables before calculating correlations with my NMDS ordination axes? I ask because my variable cover multiple orders of magnitudes: some of my variables have values in the 1000s while others have values in the hundre dths . If the answer is yes , what is the appropriate method? If the answer is no , why not?
