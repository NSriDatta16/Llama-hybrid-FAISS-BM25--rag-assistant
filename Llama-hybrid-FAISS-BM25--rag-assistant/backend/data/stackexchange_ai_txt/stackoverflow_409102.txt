I usually refer cmcrossroads.com for such information. The site is not organized well but has lots of info. Another very useful resource is nasa.gov (I know). Rather than me listing out the index of a CM plan, I would recommend you to check this link out: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/pdf/170879main_T2401.pdf Some quick pointers for setting up CM process: You absolutely need the management's/corporation's backing. Without them pushing, no one will adhere to the process. SCM is like police/postal service. No one remembers them until something goes wrong. In your case, it is a good sign if no one talks (complains) about your implemented SCM process. Open source SCM systems are at par with the other kind. Depending on the intensity of your project, you may have to do several POCs to determine which system suits your needs. This is a vast topic; I would recommend Alexis Leon's book if you are stuck.
