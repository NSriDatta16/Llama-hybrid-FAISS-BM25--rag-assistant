Refactoring is nothing but reworking code without changing what it does. This typically means renaming variables so they make more sense, re-organizing the source, breaking large methods into smaller ones, and other (internal) changes. This simplifies the code, makes it easier to understand and test. The end result, if done properly, is "better" code that's easier to maintain and understand. Visual Studio provides tools to make this easier - but you are free to use them or not.
