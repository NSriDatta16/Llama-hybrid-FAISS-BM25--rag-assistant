Generate prediction intervals for a simple moving average model

I'm using a simple moving average to generate a forecast. Say I have $t$ observations. Then the forecast for time $t+1$ is given by \begin{equation} \hat{Y}_{t+1}= \frac{Y_t+Y_{t-1}+\dots Y_{t-m+1}}{m} \end{equation} If the forecasting horizon is longer than one period, then the forecasts are given by $\hat{Y}_{t+h} = \hat{Y}_{t+1}$ . This obviously means that the forecasts are flat. How can I generate a prediction interval for these forecasts? (say 95%). I've seen that Hyndman et al. (2021) give a formula for some simple methods, and I've been wondering if there is something like that for the simple moving average.
