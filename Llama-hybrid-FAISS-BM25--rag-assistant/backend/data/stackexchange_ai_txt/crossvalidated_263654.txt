Since your data has an upward trend to it, it is good that your model has an upward trend. The data looks exponential, so using a log transform is a good idea. However, it looks like your model's variance is lower than your data's variance. I would try more auto-regressive values. e.g. ARIMA(7,1,0), ARIMA(9,1,0), etc. This might help. You could also average every 2 data points before analyzing. This would produce one data point per week and eliminate that short, regular fluctuation which is really not that interesting. (If possible...) This should produce a better forecast. Also, check that you reversed your log transform on the model results before plotting it against the actual data. This might be the cause of the variance mis-match. I like your idea of looking for other predictors. This would probably help with those outlier points that don't follow the underlying patterns.
