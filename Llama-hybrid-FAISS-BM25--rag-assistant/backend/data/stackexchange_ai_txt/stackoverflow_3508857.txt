jQuery causing 'missing' text in IE?

Really weird issue I've come across now. I'm using jQuery to make some 'widget' windows (drag & resize). They work beautifully in everything but IE (big surprise, right?). They also do everything they're supposed to in IE (drag, resize, dim on moving, return to proper opacity on release). However, in IE, when you 'let go' of the window the text 'disappears'. This isn't the traditional 'click drag over it and it's visible' bugs. Text goes completely transparent, taking on whatever colour is behind the 'window' at the time. It's more like 'cut out text shapes'. Has anyone ever experienced this? Are there any fixes?
