Caching issue in frameset frame

I have a web application and it is done in VS 2003[C#]. There is a frameset which is divided into 3. TopFrame LeftFrame ContentFrame LeftFrame loads contents related to each logged in user. The contents are loaded from SQL Server 2000 database. But there occurs a strange problem when one user logs out and another logs in. The leftframe for the first user is shown to the new user logged in. The code executes normally but the content is not shown properly. I think this is a caching issue. Right now we have disabled the caching of each page by setting HttpCacheability.NoCache But this makes the page loading slower. Is there any alternative way to solve this issue? Thanks
