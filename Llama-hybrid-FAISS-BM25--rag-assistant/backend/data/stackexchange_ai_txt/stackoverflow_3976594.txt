I got the same error today without changing anything (no updates etc.) ... blank page when trying to access Magento Connect from backend. With the help of the answer above I was able to get it to work again. So in Magento base directory go to /includes/src/Varien/ and make the change in Pear.php (include ../ before download) in line 12. It still would be nice to know what really caused this problem.
