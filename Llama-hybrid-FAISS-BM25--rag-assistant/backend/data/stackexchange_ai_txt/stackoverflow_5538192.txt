How to implement a queue with three stacks?

I came across this question in an algorithms book ( Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne). Queue with three stacks. Implement a queue with three stacks so that each queue operation takes a constant (worst-case) number of stack operations. Warning : high degree of difficulty. I know how to make a queue with 2 stacks but I can't find the solution with 3 stacks. Any idea ? (oh and, this is not homework :) )
