The distribution of proteins classes like carnitines, acyl carnitines, saturated & unsaturated fats for patients seem to sit right on top of those for controls, meaning that their mode and/or median looks very close between the two groups. During class prediction (classification analysis), some classifiers require different central tendencies between feature values in classes in order to be informative with greater performance. A groupwise difference (pattern) of the LPE protein class is commonly what classifiers need in order to pickup good separation between values among the classes. Log-transforms probably won't help with e.g. carnitines, acyl carnitines, saturated & unsaturated fats. Most likely any classifier would perform reasonably well for LPE proteins. Overall, for your data, I only see C24-Bile acids, Hode, O-PE, LPE, and PE with different modes (location of major "hump") between groups. Everything else presents a less drastic difference between the location (expression value) where the major hump lies. In this case, "hump" is the mode, the most frequently occurring expression value. Sometimes it also helps to look at the patterns or clusters in data using unsupervised methods before performing supervised class prediction. For example, the panel below shows the major cluster groupings of 178 wines in 3 classes from the Wine dataset UCI (U-Cal, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository, based on inputting all 13 features into each unsupervide method. The actual X-Y values in a particular plot that shows good separation between objects in the different classes (colors) can then be input into a classifier. Doing this would merely be called "transforming protein expression values using linear/non-linear manifold learning methods", where you would input values of all 15 of your proteins into the unsupervised method and return a new set of 2 or 3 variables (reduced dimensions), which would be used for 2D or 3D plots.
