How to feed data to Machine Learning Model?

I'm working on an SVM model as my college project. And the goal is to identify whether a tumor is benign or malignant. I'm implementing the model in Python. I found the data set from Gene Expression Omnibus . Link to data set . The data set is related to Thyroid cancer. As you scroll down you can see a table. My problem is how can I feed that data to my model. I don't have much idea on dealing with the data set. Could you tell me more about the data set from the mentioned website? I didn't understand it properly. I'd be happy if you help me out with this. I'm open to all kinds of suggestions and ideas. If you know about any another data set repos, let me know. Have a great day.
