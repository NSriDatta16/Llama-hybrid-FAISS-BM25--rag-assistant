I'm not sure if I understand your question, but it sounds like you want Java Web Start. http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/index.html You would create a jnlp file, and put a link to it on your website. Java will take care of downloading the file and starting it. The .jar file would be stored in a cache, and it shouldn't need to be redownloaded unless the cache is cleared or you replace your old .jar file with a new one.
