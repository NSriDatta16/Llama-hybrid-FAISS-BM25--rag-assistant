Any Elegant Ideas on how to parse this Dataset?

I'm using PHP 5.3 to receive a Dataset from a web service call that brings back information on one or many transactions. Each transaction's return values are delimited by a pipe ( | ), and beginning/ending of a transaction is delimited by a space. 2109695|49658|25446|4|NSF|2010-11-24 13:34:00Z 2110314|45276|26311|4|NSF|2010-11-24 13:34:00Z 2110311|52117|26308|4|NSF|2010-11-24 13:34:00Z (etc) Doing a simple split on space doesn't work because of the space in the datetime stamp. I know regex well enough to know that there are always different ways to break this down, so I thought getting a few expert opinions would help me come up with the most airtight regex.
