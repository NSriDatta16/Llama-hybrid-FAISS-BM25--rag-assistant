If all you need is store time spent on the site in localStorage then you don't need to solve this http/https problem. Extensions have their own isolated localStorage that you can access anytime anywhere, so just store your data there. You can access this localStorage only from a background page, so from a content script you will need to send a request to a background page first and then work with localStorage there: content_script.js: chrome.extension.sendRequest({do: "save", value: "some_value"}); background.html: chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener(function(request) { if(request.do == "save") { localStorage["param"] = request.value; } });
