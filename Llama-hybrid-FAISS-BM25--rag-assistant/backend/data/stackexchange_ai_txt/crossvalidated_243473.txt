More on buses... Sorry to butt into the conversation so late in the discussion, but I have been looking at Poisson processes lately... So before it slips out of my mind, here is a pictorial representation of the inspection paradox : The fallacy stems from the assumption that since buses follow a certain pattern of arrival with a given inter-arrival average time (the inverse of the Poisson rate parameter $\lambda$, let's call it $\small \theta=1/\lambda=15$ min.), by showing up at the bus station at any random time, you are in effect picking up a bus. So if you show up at the bus station at random times, keeping up a log-book of the waiting times over, say, one month, will actually give you the average inter-arrival time between buses. But this is not what you'd be doing. If we were at a dispatch center, and could see all the buses on a screen, it would be true that randomly picking up multiple buses, and averaging the distance to the bus following behind, would produce the average inter-arrival time: But, if what we instead do is just show up at the bus station (instead of selecting a bus), we are doing a random cross-section of time, say, along the timeline of the bus schedule in a typical morning. The time we decide to show up at the bus station may very well be uniformly distributed along the "arrow" of time. However, since there are longer time gaps between buses spread more farther apart, we are more likely to end up oversampling these "stragglers": ... and hence, our waiting time log book will not reflect the inter-arrival time. This is the inspection paradox. As for the actual question on the OP regarding the expected waiting time of $15'$, minutes the mind-boggling explanation resides in the memoryless-ness of the Poisson process that makes the time-gap elapsed from the time the last bus we missed left the station to the time we show up irrelevant, and the expected time to the arrival of the next bus continues to be, stubbornly, $\theta=15$ minutes. This is best seen in discrete time (geometric distribution) with the dice example in Glen_b's answer. In fact, if we could know how long ago the preceding bus left, the $\small \mathbb E[\text{time waiting (future) + time to last bus departure (past)}]=30$ min! As explaine in this MIT video by John Tsitsiklis , we just would have to view what precedes the point of arrival as a Poisson process backwards in time: Still unclear? - try it with Legos .
