XML Serialisation - When To Use DataContractSerializer / Binary / XMLSerialiser

I ve been looking at this for a while now It seems that binary serialisation is discouraged as any change to field names breaks serialisation =? Not Good XMLSerializer is problematic because you have to provide a no arg constructor and public fields although you do have more control over elements being attributes or elements and their naming DataContractSerializer is good but all suclassses need to be explicitly added which is a shame However I stumbled across NetDataContractSerializer which does not have this limitation. If your goal is C# serialisation and no big constraints on size of xml is NetDataContractSerializer always the way to go here??
