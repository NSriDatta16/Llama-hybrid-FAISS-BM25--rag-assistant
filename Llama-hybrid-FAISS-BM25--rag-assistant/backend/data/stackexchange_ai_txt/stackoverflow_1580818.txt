Coverity is the first thing coming to mind. It currently offers (on one of their products ) Software DNA Map™ analysis system: Generates a comprehensive representation of the entire build system including a semantically correct parsing of every line of code. Defect Manager: Intuitive interface makes it easy to establish ownership of defects and resolve them via a customized workflow that mirrors your existing development process. Local Analysis: Enables code to be analyzed locally on developers’ desktops to ensure quality before sharing with other developers. Boolean Satisfiability: Translates the code into questions based on Boolean values, then applies SAT solvers for the most accurate defect detection and the lowest false positive rate available. Only Prevent offers the added precision of this proprietary method. Race Conditions Checker: Features an industry-first race conditions checker built specifically for today’s complex multi-threaded applications. Path Simulation: Simulates 100% of all values and data paths, enabling detection of the most critical defects. Statistical & Interprocedural Analysis: Ensures a comprehensive analysis of your entire build system by inferring correct behavior based on previously observed behavior and performing whole-program analysis similar to the executing Bin. False Path Pruning: Efficiently removes false positives to give Prevent an average FP rate of about 15%, with some users reporting FP rates of as low as 5%. Incremental Analysis: Analyzes source code wholly or incrementally, allowing you to save time by checking only those components that are affected by a change. Reporting: Measures software quality trends over time via customizable reporting so you can show defects grouped by checker, classification, component, and other defect information.
