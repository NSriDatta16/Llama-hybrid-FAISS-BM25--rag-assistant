Fitting your data to a polynomial, as you described it, is called "polynomial regression". It is equivalent to a linear regression where you introduce new features for $x^2, x^3, ...$ . There is a closed-form solution to find the optimal constants. Here you can find details on the algebra to implement it. Nevertheless, it is also possible to find the values for the constants by means of gradient descent methods. Here you can find a discussion on why using one method or the other. The gradient descent approach can be easily implemented with any deep learning framework, like Pytorch or Tensorflow. For instance, here you have an example of a Pytorch implementation.
