What is the conclusion from cross validation scores?

I am training a model, and I'm using an xgboost model. I used the following piece of code to find the cross-validation score score=cross_val_score(final_classifier, X, y, cv=5, scoring="f1") and I get the following result score=array([0.51165018, 0.97186588, 0.97350451, 0.9742288 , 0.85236734]) On the training data, I get the results as follows. precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 0.98 0.99 44959 1 0.98 1.00 0.99 44959 accuracy 0.99 89918 macro avg 0.99 0.99 0.99 89918 weighted avg 0.99 0.99 0.99 89918 What is the conclusion from these results? One of my cross-val score is very low (0.51) compared to others, and in the entire training data, I have 99% accuracy. What hyperparameter should I tune to improve the results?
