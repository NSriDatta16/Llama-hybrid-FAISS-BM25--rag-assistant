The calculations were right, I cross-checked with the well-known package boot . Additionally I added the BCa-interval (by Efron), a bias-corrected version of the percentile bootstrap interval: for (i in 1:1000) { samp min(tCI) && true.mean min(percCI) && true.mean min(bcaCI) && true.mean I assume the intervals would be far better if the original sample size is larger then 10, say 20 or 50. Furthermore the bootstrap-t method usually leads to better results for skewed statistics. However it needs a nested loop and therefore 20+ times more computational time. For hypothesis testing it is also very important that the 1-sided coverages are good. So looking only at the 2-sided coverages can often be misleading.
