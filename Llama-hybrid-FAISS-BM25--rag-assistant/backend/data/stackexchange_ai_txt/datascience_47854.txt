What skills do I need to become a data scientist? And how to show them?

I have fimiliarized myself with the recommended most important concepts (Linear Algebra, Analysis, Phython, Numpy, Pandas, a bit of Statistics, Linear regression). For the last two, I don't know how deep it should go. I know what things mean and how to get them working in python. But the question is what now? I guess I could argue that this is a starting point and I can apply to a bad data analysis or visualisation position if I learn tableau and present myself well. But what would I do to even prove what I can do before an interview? Putting a notebook on github where I imported a dataset, cleaned it a bit, did a .desribe(), .plot() and a linear regression isn't very impressive nor interesting to anyone. So what would I do instead? Also, this clearly isn't data science area yet. If I look at kaggle challenges, I either don't know what to do or think to myself "Clean data, LinRegression". So what should I take a look at next? Note that I'm taking classes, but not in Data Science but in Chemistry right now.
