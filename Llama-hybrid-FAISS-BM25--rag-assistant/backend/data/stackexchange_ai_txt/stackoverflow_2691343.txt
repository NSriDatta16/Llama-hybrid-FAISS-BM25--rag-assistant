"This has to be as fast as possible." If you don't have a performance problem, you don't need to worry about optimizing performance (beyond just paying attention to using good algorithms). This misconception also manifests in attempts to optimize performance for every single aspect of your program. I see this most often with people trying to shave every last millisecond off of a low-volume web application's execution time while failing to take into account that network latency will take orders of magnitude longer than their code's execution time, making any reduction in execution time irrelevant anyhow.
