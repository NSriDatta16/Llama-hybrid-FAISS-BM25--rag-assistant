you should use self.results = md so md is retained. You access a property with the dot syntax. By assigning something to a property with the dot syntax you call the setter which retains the value in your case. Without the dot you just assign the mutable dictionary to results, no setter is called. You can read about properties in Apple's Objective-C Programming Language , look at General Use a bit further below the Dot Syntax paragraph.
