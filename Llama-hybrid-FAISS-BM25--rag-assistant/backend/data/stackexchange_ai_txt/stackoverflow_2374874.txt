Database Design - Application Integration with Other Systems

I'm currently integrating external applications in my app ex SalesForce.com. My question pertains to properly designing tables for data capturing custom fields. So for SalesForce all companies have an Organization ID but then they can also have custom fields for capturing data. I've looked at two options for handling this. Let them create their fields serialize the names as keys in an array. Then connect the values into that array and re serialize. Create 10+ columns in the db that allow for custom values(field names) and then map the users data to those fields. Which one of these approaches is more efficient and maintainable for the long run?
