How to code a categorical variable for logistic regression with overlap in the categories/subgroups?

Suppose I have a categorical variable consisting of four levels: a, b, c, and d. When these levels are mutual exclusive, I would use dummy coding - so three dummies with for example level a as reference. Is this dummy coding scheme still valid if two or more categories can overlap for a certain observation? For example, a person who has both level a and level c. Or does this mean I need to make four dummies instead?
