Delphi 5.0 Open Interbase/FireBird connection via code

This is old stuff! Is related to delphi 5.0 and interbase 1.6. I'm trying to open a DB connection via code. But this code is related to enabling the connection, all the components were added using delphi drag-drop User Interface: DataSource1, TForm1, DBGrid, DBNavigator etc.. procedure TDataModule2.DataModuleCreate(Sender: TObject); begin database.DatabaseName:='C:\MyDatabase.GDB'; database.Connected := true; database.Open; IBTransaction.Active := true; myTable.Open; end; I have a TForm with DBGrid and DBNavigator component. I also have a TIBQuery (that DataSource1 is associated to) with this code on the SQLStrings: SELECT * FROM NEW_TABLE On the Form I have this code to enable DBNavigator and DBGrid to show the DB Values. The DB is very simple is just a table: NEW_TABLE with a NEW_VALUE of VARCHAR type procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject); begin DataSource1.DataSet.Open; // This will call the query associated to this DataSource1 the tibQuery1 to call // SELECT * FROM NEW_TABLE, but the message below appears: IBClientError... end; The message appears: IBClientError with message 'Database not assigned' OBS1: If I connect the components by hand on delphi user interface, the connection with the DB is established.
