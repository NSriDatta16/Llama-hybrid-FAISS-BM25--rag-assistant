Panel data classification and regression?

I am very new to time series/panel/longituginal data. From my understanding Panel data = multi-object time series and I have some panel data in long format (objects have multiple rows corresponding to different time steps). The objective is to predict/classify if a person is going to leave the job due to factors of the job (hrs worked etc). The data looks something like this: person month # of hrs worked Quit Other Feats Mary 2 30 0 Mary 3 20 0 Mary 4 80 0 John 1 100 1 John 2 10 1 John 3 60 1 John 4 40 1 John 5 100 1 Cate 3 11 0 Cate 4 19 0 Cate 5 29 0 Cate 6 14 0 ... ... ... Where "Quit" is the y or target variable. I am curious how I can predict using this data if an existing person will quit and if a new person will quit. Can I just feed this into a random forest and expect it to do well? (similar to this ) Do I need to transform it to wide format and keep 1 row per person where all the longitudinal aspects are in the columns? I have tried feeding this into a random forest and it gave a good accuracy and AUC but I am not sure if this is the correct way to solve this problem? I have seen people use RNNs to solve this. Similarly, what about regressing/forecasting on this data? Say instead of a binary outcome I have dates of when a person quit, what techniques exist to regress on this kind of data? Can I just run a linear regression model on this data? What about pooled OLS or GEEs? One last question is how is this different from classifying on time-series data instead? They both have a time component but panel data has multiple objects.
