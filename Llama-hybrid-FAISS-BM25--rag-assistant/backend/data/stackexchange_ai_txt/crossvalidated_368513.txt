What is the difference between lsmeans in R and margins in Stata?

Context: I am using Stata to recreate someone else's analysis which was done in R. In Stata I have used the margins command to calculate the average adjusted predictions for a logistic model. I thought the other analyst used the lsmeans package to do the same thing however when I run margins in Stata I get a different output than R provides with lsmeans, even though the datasets and coefficients from the regressions are identical. My understanding was that margins is the Stata equivalent of lsmeans (or can be used as such) but that does not appear to be the case. So I have a two questions: 1. What is the difference between lsmeans and margins (besides language)? 2. How can I replicate R's lsmeans in Stata?
