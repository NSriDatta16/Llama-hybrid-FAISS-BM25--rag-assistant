Catalyst is an elegant web application framework written in the Perl programming language, extremely flexible yet extremely simple. It's similar to Ruby on Rails, Spring (Java), and Maypole, upon which it was originally based. Its most important design philosphy is to provide easy access to all the tools you need to develop web applications, with few restrictions on how you need to use these tools. http://www.catalystframework.org/ Resources to learn Catalyst: Catalyst tutorial on CPAN Catalyst Runtime and documentation on CPAN Several years of Catalyst Advent Calendar tips and methods Useful Links: Catalyst Repository on GitHub Catalyst Mailing List Registration Mailing List Archives IRC irc://irc.perl.org/catalyst
