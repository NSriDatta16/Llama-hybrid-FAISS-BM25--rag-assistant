after nothing came from anyone, I like to summarize my own research on the topic. Question number 1: Is it ok to use a Generated sample for extracting data from an actual sample? There will be some "changed" values in the generated sample but a practical view can help us understand why we might use it. in many applications, the "changed values" are not important as much as they can change the output of a process so it's ok to use a generated sample for these kinds of applications. Questions Number 2 and 3: What is the role of noise and noise sampling? Noise can role like a balancer! we can for sure change the way we sample from it or even create it(not a pure noise but something else!) but it will lead to a biased Generator to the "noise input". So it might be a good idea to keep it as random as possible. Question Number 4: Can we have a Deeper GAN? Well, again Practicality is what we must focus on. it is possible to make a "Deeper GAN" but it's only when we need extra processes to be done on a data. in fact, when we input a generated sample from a GAN to another one, we are basically feeding it in instead of the "Noise" so that the G part can do "Something" on it. How many stages do we need? it depends on our design. What are the downsides? for sure it would take a lot to train! but also it can increase some "weird representations" in the final output. cause we are using some Generated Sample as Noise. it might perform well on Some cases but there is no guaranty for others. so. this was my interpretation from what I read and also what I spoke with my professors. please feel free to correct me in comments or post a new Answer. thanks
