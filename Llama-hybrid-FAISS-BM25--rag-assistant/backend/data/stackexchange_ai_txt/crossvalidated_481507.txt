Are feature axes non-orthogonal to one another if their correlations are non-zero?

I'm using PCA in R for dimensionality reduction and the correlations between principal components are zero as they are orthogonal to one another. This made me wonder whether features that have non-zero correlation coefficients are non-orthogonal? Does this not always hold true that axes representing features are orthogonal to one another?
