Create an empty string resource data that is embedded and is at the end of the code/data segment, work out the offset where to write in the value into that empty spot where the resource location is. But then again, what's the point in protecting your programs by yourself...? I wouldn't go down that route, instead employ a commercial protection scheme for PE files (Native C/C++ code/libraries and .NET)...for instance, .NET executables which are a PE file also, and they are easily reversed engineered (think of reflector)...Look at a lot of these so called warez where the protection schemes were cracked and serial numbers used...What do you think? If you still insist on doing it yourself, then the first paragraph above in my answer should help you. My 2 cents thought here... Best regards and Good luck in your protection scheme, Tom.
