If the series is uncorrelated, unnecessarily taking differences injects auto-correlation . Even if the series is autocorrelated unwarranted differencing is inappropriate. Simple ideas and simple approaches often have unwanted side effects. The model identification process (ARIMA) starts with the original series and may result in differencing BUT it should never starts with unwarranted differencing unless there is a theoretical justification. If you wish you can post your short time series and I will use it to explain to you how to identify a model for this series. After receipt of data: The ACF of your data does not initially (or finally) indicate any ARIMA process here BOTH ACF and PACF and here just ACF: However there appears to be two level shifts in your data ... one at 1972 and the other at 1992 .. they appear to be nearly cancelling level shifts. A useful model might also include the incorporation of three unusual values at periods 1989,1959 and 1983. The equation then is and here with model statistics here: The Actual/Fit and Forecast is here with the residual plot here suggesting model sufficiency . This is confirmed by the acf of the residuals . Finally the fit and the forecast summarizes the findings . In summary the series ( probably a ratio) is without significant auto-regressive memory but does have some evidented deterministic structure (statistically significant). All models are wrong but some are useful (G.E.P. Box) . After some discussion .. If one were to model differences then one would get the following model ... with ACTUAL/FIT and FORECAST . Forecasts look eerily similar ... the MA coefficient effectively cancels the differencing operator.
