As Antti pointed out, you probably want to leverage REMOVE-DUPLICATES and SORT, though I'd probably use a keyword (or optional argument) for the test function: (defun merge-lists (list-1 list-2 sort-fn &key (test #'eql)) ...) or (defun merge-lists (list-1 list-2 sort-fn &optional (test #'eql) ...) This way, you won't have to specify the test function (used by REMOVE-DUPLICATES to test for "is these considered duplicates"), unless EQL is not good enough.
