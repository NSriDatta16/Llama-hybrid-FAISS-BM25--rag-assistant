Visual C++ doesn't see operator<< overload

I have a vector class that I want to be able to input/output from a QTextStream object. The forward declaration of my vector class is: namespace util { template class Vector; } I define the operator as: namespace util { template QTextStream& operator & vec) { ... } template QTextStream& operator>>(QTextStream& in,util::Vector & vec) { .. } } However, if I ty to use these operators, Visual C++ returns this error: error C2678: binary ' A few things I tried: Originaly, the methods were defined as friends of the template, and it is working fine this way with g++. The methods have been moved outside the namespace util I changed the definition of the templates to fit what I found on various Visual C++ websites. The original friend declaration is: friend QTextStream& operator>>(QTextStream& ss, Vector& in) { ... } The "Visual C++ adapted" version is: friend QTextStream& operator>> (QTextStream& ss, Vector & in); with the function pre-declared before the class and implemented after. I checked the file is correctly included using: #pragma message ("Including vector header") And everything seems fine. Doesn anyone has any idea what might be wrong? Note: the definition of the operator doesn't even appears in the list of operator
