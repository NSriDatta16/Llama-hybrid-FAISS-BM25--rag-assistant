Hashes are simple pairing of key and values. Here's how the state of your code would look before and after the renaming in pseudo-code: Before: personSet => { SOME_NUM1 => Person(name=>"raghu", 12), SOME_NUM2 => Person(name=>"rimmu", 21) } p1.setName("raghus"); #p1.hashcode() = SOME_NEW_NUM p1.setAge(13);#p1.hashcode() = SOME_OTHER_NEW_NUM After: personSet => { SOME_NUM1 => Person(name=>"raghu", 13), SOME_NUM2 => Person(name=>"rimmu", 21) } Since you have direct access to the p1 the object within the HashSet is updated correctly, but HashSet does not pay attention to contained objects hashcodes being updated. When a call to personSet.contains(p1) is called, the HashSet looks for an entry with the new value of p1.hashcode() . The p1 object is associated with its previous hashcode at the time when it was added to the HashSet.
