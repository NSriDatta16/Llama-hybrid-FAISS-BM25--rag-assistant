As other answers have said, PCA and Linear Regression (in general) are different tools. PCA is an unsupervised method (only takes in data, no dependent variables) and Linear regression (in general) is a supervised learning method. If you have a dependent variable, a supervised method would be suited to your goals. If you're trying to find out which variables in your data capture most of the variation in the data, PCA is a useful tool.
