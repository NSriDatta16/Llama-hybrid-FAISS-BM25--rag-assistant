setting up an NSMutableDictionary

In my app delegate I look for a plist to import and turn it into an NSMutableDictionary. NSLog(@"Reading session file from main bundle"); NSString *plistPath = [Utilities localPathForFileName:kSessionFile]; NSData *plistXML = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsAtPath:plistPath]; temp = (NSMutableDictionary *)[NSPropertyListSerialization propertyListFromData:plistXML mutabilityOption:NSPropertyListMutableContainersAndLeaves format:&format errorDescription:&errorDesc]; My NSMutableDictionary is then saved into a singleton for access throughout the app [[self model] setStorage:temp]; That all works fine and allows me to add objects to the dictionary at will because of the mutabilityOption. I also write it out to a plist. Second time the app opens it finds the saved plist and reads from there. My question is, how can I initially create the NSMutableDictionary with the same mutabilityOptions WITHOUT reading it in from a pList? If I could do that, then I could also erase the data in the dictionary at will. Thanks in advance for your help.
