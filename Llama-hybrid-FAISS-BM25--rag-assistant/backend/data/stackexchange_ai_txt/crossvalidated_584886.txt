Bayesian Inference for Binomial Distribution with changing mean

Say I have a long time series of values in the form of 0 or 1 which I believe to be outcomes of a binomial distribution, but where the probability of success $p$ can change (but is expected to change gradually) over time. For example we might have 10,000 outcomes where at the start $p$ was equal to 0.3, and at the end it had shifted to 0.4 (along some path). How would I best go about estimating $p$ at each trial given the data available and what assumptions would I need to make? Intuitively I would want to use some sort of weights for the outcomes estimating the mean, like Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, to reflect the fact that it's changing over time. I think with a frequentist approach this might already be sufficient, but I'm not sure how to cast this in a Bayesian framework. In particular the updating of the posterior seems like it would be problematic. I also had the idea of assigning some dynamic to the evolution of $p$ , e.g. at each step it is allowed to remain the same, or increase/decrease slightly, and then using some maximum likelihood method of finding the most likely path that $p$ took given the data. I believe this might be doable with some Sequential Importance Sampling procedures, but I'm not sure how sound the idea itself is. Would appreciate any suggestions regarding this.
