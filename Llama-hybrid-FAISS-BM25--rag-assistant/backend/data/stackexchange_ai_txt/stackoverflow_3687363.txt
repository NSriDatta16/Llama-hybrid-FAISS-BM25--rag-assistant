The reason this doesn't work is because -Xmx1024 and -agentlib: are two different arguments. When calling execlp they need to be passed in as two different arguments. When I called execlp like: execlp(myJavaPath, myJavaPath, myDebugOptions, "-Xmx1024m", "-DFBLog4j=true", "-jar", "/usr/mprint/bin/QDirectJServer.jar", NULL); it worked as expected with no errors. Even those myDebugOptions contained a space it was still considering it as one argument.
