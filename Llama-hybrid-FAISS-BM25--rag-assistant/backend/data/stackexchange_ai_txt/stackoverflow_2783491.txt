You do not need to copy Machine.Specifications.TDNetRunner.dll anywhere, just place it in your project's tools or lib directory, i.e. where you keep your project's dependencies. The project containing the MSpec tests will reference the Machine.Specifications.dll from this directory. TestDriven.Net >=2.24 will be able to pick up the TD.Net runner as long as Machine.Specifications.dll.tdnet is located in the same directory. An example how I like to organize my tools directory can be found here . Your ReSharper 5.0 plugin directory looks good to me. However, I've had users reporting that when you unzip the MSpec zip file (that you likely downloaded from http://teamcity.codebetter.com ) using Explorer, Windows marks the extracted DLLs as being downloaded from the Internet. Can you please make sure that Windows does not block the DLLs in \bin\plugins by opening each DLL's properties and clicking "Unblock" on the first property page. In case the "Unblock" button is not displayed, your files are okay. In that case, please post here and we'll see how we can your MSpec plugin working.
