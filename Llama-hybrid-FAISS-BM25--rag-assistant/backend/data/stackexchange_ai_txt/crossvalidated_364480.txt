Partially answered in comments: Well, no, at least not for an ordinary Bayesian linear regression. A random effects model has a "different" parameter or parameters (say, a different intercept) for each subject, drawn from a population distribution of parameters. An ordinary Bayesian linear regression has a 'random' parameter in the sense that the parameter has a distribution, but it is common to all the subjects. On the other hand, a particular kind of Bayesian hierarchical regression model is very similar to a random effects model and is often treated as the 'Bayesian' version of it. â€“ Glen_b See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model#Simple_example
