This is the best comparison I've seen , of multiple Java mocking frameworks, including EasyMock and mockito. [The original page is offline; this link is to an archived copy.] It includes EasyMock, Mockito, jMock, SevenMock, JMockit, rMock, Unitils. I used EasyMock first, but have moved to Mockito. Unit tests created with EasyMock were sometimes fragile and hard to debug. Mockito is easy, partly because it distinguishes between stubbing and verification. Here's a Mockito-oriented comparison of it and EasyMock: http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/MockitoVSEasyMock .
