Comparing input to echo specific output

I'm trying to write a function quality Points that inputs a student’s average and returns 4 if the student's average is 90–100, 3 if the average is 80–89, 2 if the average is 70–79, 1 if the average is 60–69 and 0 if the average is lower than 60. Incorporate the function into a script that reads a value from the user. The code I have so far is: function output() { if (condition) { document.myform.txtImput } } Enter Grade Quality Points I can do the If..Then statements, but I cannot figure out how to change the values of the text area I have named txtOutput.
