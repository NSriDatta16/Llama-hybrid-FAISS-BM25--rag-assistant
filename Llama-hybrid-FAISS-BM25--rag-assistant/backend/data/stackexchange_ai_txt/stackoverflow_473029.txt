How can I get the full backtrace in SpiderMonkey (JSAPI) from my reportError function?

I'm embedding javascript in my app using spidermonkey and I have a function called reportError that receives a JSErrorReport . It seems simple to grab the current line of the error, but is it possible to get the entire call path to display a full backtrace?
