How to be productive in Access VBA + SQL development?

I'm a 80% ruby on rails developer, but still need to do some Access VBA work. Some of them are very shit systems, been build ages ago , used by the big enterprise globally , so that most of the works are just enhance the old system. The techniques are basically MS Access as front-end, linked-table which link to SQL server via ODBC as back end. Now, I really think I need help , just want to know is there anybody can build the elegant VBA application follow the object-oriented patten? Even better if you can show me a snippet of code to demonstrate how good it can be, thanks.
