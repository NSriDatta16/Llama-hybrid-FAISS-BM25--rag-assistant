First look M >> N is not a hint I think, it simply discourages creating a bitmap that would directly tell you in O(1) time if a number exists. I think that sane assumption with N spanning multiple hard disks is that you can expect that you would not have order of magnitutde more disks at your disposal. As you would need 2 M space for O(1) performance, and if N spans multiple disks then M spans >> multiple disks and 2 M spans >> disks than available. Also, it tells you that approach to store the missing numbers would not be efficient since then you would have to store X numbers where X = M - N => X ~ M (since M >> N) which is then a worse case. So at first look it seems that you can prove that there is no known better answer. EDIT: I still stand at the above reasoning, which is also even better proven by Moron's answer. However the conclusion, after looking at Bloom Filter from Patrick's answer I believe that the interviewer might have been looking at this and other probabilistic algorithms (which should have been noted in the interview question).
