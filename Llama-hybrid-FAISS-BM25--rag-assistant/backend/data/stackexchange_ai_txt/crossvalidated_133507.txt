Unfortunately, auto.arima does not seem to pay any attention to leap years. Thus if your data spans more than a few years, the 52-week frequency starts being a problem. You are getting out of sync at a pace of approximately one week every 5-6 years. As regards seasonality, the first time "week 53" is encountered in your data, it will be treated as week 1 (because your specified frequency is 52), then the subsequent "week 1" will be treated as week 2 etc. The discrepancy will persist and even grow with every new "week 53". Here is a useful treatment of weekly data by the author of the forecast package and the auto.arima function. It might help you solve the underlying problem.
