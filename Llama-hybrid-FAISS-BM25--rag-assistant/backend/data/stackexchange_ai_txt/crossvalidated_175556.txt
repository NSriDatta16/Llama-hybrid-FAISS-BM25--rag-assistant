Let me add an interesting factor, lot . In the above example, instead of making six tests with the same lot of paint (which, per above definitions means six repetitions per combination of conditions) she tests with six different paint lots per combination of conditions, which means also 24 total experiments; does this mean she is doing six replications per combination of conditions? Another example: A liquid pigment is measured for color intensity I . The lab method of analysis has two factors: suspension clarification time "T" and sample size W . Each factor has two levels, i.e, short and long T, and small and large W. That makes a 2x2 design. Testing the same lot sample under the four different conditions means there are 4 experiments in total, no repetitions. Testing the same lot twice each time means there would be two repetitions per condition, 8 experiments in total. But what if we test samples from six different lots per condition? Does this mean there are six replications per combination or conditions? The number of experiments would be 24. Now, we may want to make the method more precise and ask the lab technician to repeat the test twice (from the same sample) every time he makes a measurement, and report only the average per lot sample. I assume we could use the averages as a single result per lot sample, and for DoE, say a 2-way layout ANOVA with replications, each lot sample result is a replication . Please comment.
