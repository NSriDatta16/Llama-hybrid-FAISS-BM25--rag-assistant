You almost answered your own question: Haskell or Erlang will force you to learn functional style all at once before you can actually do anything of interest in them. Actually, depending on what you mean by 'of interest', you can be productive in Haskell in a week. The main reason for anyone to learn Haskell (language theorists already know it, and other kinds of theorists are too busy proving theorems to be bothered with programming) is that learning Haskell will change the way you think about programming . Especially the type system, list comprehensions (stolen for Pythonâ€”the highest form of praise), and programming with pattern matching. You will be able to use many of your new thoughts in all the programming you do. And Haskell will force you to think new thoughts in a way that other langauges won't. Erlang is an honorable language but has nothing comparable to Haskell's type system. If you like Paul Graham you can read more about this line of reasoning in his essay Beating the Averages , especially the part about the "Blub Paradox". Just substitute Haskell for Lisp :-)
