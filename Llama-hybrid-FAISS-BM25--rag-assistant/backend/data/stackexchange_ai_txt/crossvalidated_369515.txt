It is very important to look beyond simply ranking the strength of correlations. Indeed, the correlation between the features is also important, and you could use various way of factor analysis to quantify/explore this (for instance by using principal component analysis, PCA, but possibly more specific to discriminating the target 'quality' by using linear discriminant analysis, LDA). You may in fact have a very tiny correlation for single variables and the target while two or more variables together make a strong predictor of the target. Example: If for a certain region good high quality wines come from sugary grapes, ie strong heavy bodied wines that are high in sugar and/or alcohol (but lot's of variation for those parameters individually, yet not together, depending on the vinification process). Then you could have a picture like the following: The correlation here is "only" 0.10 for sugar and 0.16 for alcohol, but the sum of the two has a much stronger 0.87 correlation. code: set.seed(1) quality
