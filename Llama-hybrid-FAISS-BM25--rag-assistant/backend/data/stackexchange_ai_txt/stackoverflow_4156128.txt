How to install a certificate in Xcode (preparing for app store submission)

I wan't to select my distribution profile in Code Signing Identity in the build tab of targets. But all my certificates (developer, ad hoc, ...) are grayed out. So it seems that the new profile XXX.mobileprovision is not installed. The guidelines say Download the distribution profile and install it in the Xcode Organizer. Drag the .mobileprovision file to the Provisioning Profiles list under IPHONE DEVELOPMENT in the Organizer. But nothing happens. No green plus icon appears. If I double click the profile Xcode shows me an empty file ... Can someone help me out? Additional information: First I created an Ad-Hoc profile (with another bundle identifier), which works (now). The certificate owner and the user name on the Mac are not the same (but the private key was created under this username). In Xcode I can only see the old developer certificate (from the Ad-Hoc profile). I set the app to Release .
