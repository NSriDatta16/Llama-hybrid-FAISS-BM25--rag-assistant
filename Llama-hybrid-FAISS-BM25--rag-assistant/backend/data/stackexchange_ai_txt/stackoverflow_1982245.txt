SnmpExtensionTrap has a size limit?

I am working on a problem in SNMP extension agent in windows, which is passing traps to snmp.exe via SnmpExtensionTrap callback. We added a couple of fields to the agent recently, and I am starting to see that some traps are getting lost. When I intercept the call in debugger and reduce the length of some strings, the same traps, that would have been lost, will go through. I cannot seem to find any references to size limit or anything on the data passed via SnmpExtensionTrap. Does anyone know of one?
