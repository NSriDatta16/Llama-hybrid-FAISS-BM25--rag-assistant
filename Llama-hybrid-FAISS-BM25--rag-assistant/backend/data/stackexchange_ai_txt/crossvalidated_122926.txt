Try clustering your data first, build Finite Mixture Model, that can help Detailed Answer To begin with author is actually doing Binomial Logistic Regression to predict fraud 0 or 1. The names can be confusing its not Linear Regression. Lots depends on subjective knowledge on categorical variables. Statistics cannot compete with domain knowledge. Increased number of levels increases chances of over-fitting. One can try reducing that. We cannot use Factor Analysis or PCA as number of independent variables / Predictor are 4. Assuming author may already been tried this already, it didnt help. He must have already tried calculating Variance Inflation Factors on this data but that would have not helped either. P-Value must be coming below 0.1. Now lets looks at this data from data engineer perspective (not data scientist). When we apply logistic regression then categorical variables are getting factored. Now if you cannot reduce data Vertically then try reducing Horizontally meaning put data in several different clusters. The run regression separately on each cluster either apply FMM mode or some ensemble the cluster output. I dont know if this is the right approach without looking at the data (infact sometimes after looking at data also).
