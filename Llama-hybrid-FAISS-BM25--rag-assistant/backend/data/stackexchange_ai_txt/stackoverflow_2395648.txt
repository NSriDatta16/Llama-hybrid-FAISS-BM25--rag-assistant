Martins answer is pretty close, but it has a few small errors. Try this: NSMutableParagraphStyle* style = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init]; [style setAlignment:NSCenterTextAlignment]; NSDictionary *attr = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:style forKey:NSParagraphStyleAttributeName]; [myString drawInRect:someRect withAttributes:attr]; [style release]; You'll have to create a new NSMutableParagraphStyle (instead of using the default paragraph style as Martin suggested) because [NSMutableParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] returns an NSParagraphStyle , which doesn't have the setAlignment method. Also, you don't need the string @"NSParagraphStyleAttributeName" â€”just NSParagraphStyleAttributeName .
