Is it ever a good idea to use results of multiple algorithms as features?

Let's say that I have a vector of features that I use to get a single result back using some machine learning algorithm. I thought about using multiple variations of that algorithm to get multiple results back and then simply concatenating them together into one big features vector for a new algorithm to give me that one result back. Would that enhance accuracy or make it worse?
