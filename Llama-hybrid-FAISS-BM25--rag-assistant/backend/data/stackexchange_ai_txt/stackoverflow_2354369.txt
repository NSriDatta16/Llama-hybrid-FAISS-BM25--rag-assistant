Jquery bbq php implementation

I just finished implementing the history plugin for URL back button functionality and now find out that it doesnt work with IE (great!?#) I wrote this post to explain the problems i was having post So, next up is to try and implement the BBQ jquery plugin which does the same thing, but I cannot find any simple examples of how to implement this in PHP. Here is the history plugin example i was following, its v simple history plugin example The history plugin is shown in my last post and I would like to do the same thing for bbq, but the examples of bbq given are just basic html and incredibly difficult to adapt to the history method ie using $_POST to get the different page fragments. If anyone has any ideas on how I might get started on this, experience to share, or has any v simple tutorials I would really appreciate the help. Cheers Ke
