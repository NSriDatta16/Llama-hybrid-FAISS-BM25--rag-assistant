Using triples could lead to wrong results because some headlines could contain double negations or other complex structures that are difficult to classify with triples. However, you can apply directly on the headlines Bert sentiment analysis instead, which can process complex semantics correctly. Here is an example using Bert's twitter roberta sentiment analysis : Note: in this specific case neutral and positive have almost the same value, and you will want to set some threshold to consider a headline as positive, like positive > 0.4. It could also require some fine tuning because tweets are a bit different from headlines. You can even apply sentiment analysis levels (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) to get even better predictions.
