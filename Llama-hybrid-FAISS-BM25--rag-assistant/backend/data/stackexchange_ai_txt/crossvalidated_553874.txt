The standard deviation is strictly a symmetric distribution construct. Outlier is an arbitrary construct. If you really think that a normal distribution has some beautiful property for your particular situation, the only elegant way to deal with this situation is to model a mixture of distributions, say a normal and a $t$ distribution with low degrees of freedom. Here you have specified the mixing proportion of 0.5. If you fit the model using Bayesian methods you can get a posterior mixing probability as a result. But again everything is tied to the normal distribution being special, which it may not be for your situation.
