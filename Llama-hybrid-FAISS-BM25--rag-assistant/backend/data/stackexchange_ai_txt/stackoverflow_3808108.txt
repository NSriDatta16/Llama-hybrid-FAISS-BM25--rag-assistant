Add text at the end of document fragments on a Mac

On a Mac, I have a directory of html files that are all document fragments. Using the TexFinderX app, I was easily able to do a find/replace and add everything at the top of the documents that I wanted (i.e. etc.) . Now I need to find a way to add the closing tags to all of the documents (i.e. ). TexFinderX does not have a way to do this since the documents do not have anything in common at the end of the files. Is there a Terminal command that can do this for all html files in a directory and it's subdirectories? Thanks, Linda
