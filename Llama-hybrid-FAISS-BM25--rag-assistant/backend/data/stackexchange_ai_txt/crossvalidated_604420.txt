On the one hand, I would still answer as in the linked thread , and indeed believe that a transformation, followed by a standard forecasting method, would indeed by "a well established standard way." So on the other hand, I would be interested in what exactly about it looks "hacky" to you. On the third hand, as long as your target variable is well within the unit interval, whether you transform or not may not make all that much of a difference. Yes, if you take a trended method (whether it's linear regression, or ARIMA, or ETS), your predictions (and especially the prediction intervals) will eventually go outside the unit interval, but I would honestly just try it and see whether this is a problem that really comes up within a reasonable forecast horizon. After all, your target proportion is just 0.5. This free online textbook is an excellent introduction to time series forecasting. On the fourth hand, you can certainly try some more fancy ways of forecasting. For instance, rather than forecasting the proportion directly, you could try forecasting the numerator and the denominator of your proportion separately and divide the forecasts. This will give a slight bias, but I think this is the least of your worries for this kind of forecast. If you then have multiple forecasts (e.g., a direct forecast of the proportion and a ratio of separate forecasts), you can take the average - this very often improves forecast accuracy. On the fifth hand, a simple time series forecast is likely only a zero-th order approximation. This is absolutely not bad, because in forecasting, one should always include very simple methods as benchmarks - these can be very hard to beat by more "sophisticated" approaches . As Glen_b writes , there is no simple clear trend in female participation in particular fields of study, especially MINT, and that the female participation tends to be lower in countries with greater gender equality has been called the "gender equality paradox", and people write papers about it (e.g., Stoet & Geary, 2018 , and that's just the first one I came across in my literature database). So you should ideally use some theoretical underpinning of the process you are forecasting. Unfortunately, although there are lots of people doing demographical forecasting, there is nothing I could point you to immediately ( nothing, e.g., in the Forecasting Encyclopedia , a pity).
