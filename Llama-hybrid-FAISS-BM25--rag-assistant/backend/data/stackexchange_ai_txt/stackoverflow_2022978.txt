How to instrument a multiproject Maven 2 with Cobertura?

My Maven 2 project consists of several sub-modules. It s structured containing and EJB, WAR and Jar sub modules.. Now i want to instrument the packaged EAR that contains all submodules as mentioned. Example: Interface Maven Project consists of several modules: - InterfacePOM --> parent pom - InterfaceEAR --> EAR module which does not actual code but is the packaging for Domain, EJB and WAR - InterfaceEJB --> EJB module - interfaceWAR --> WAR module - interfaceDomain --> JAR module When using Cobertura i can succesfully instrument all various independent modules but that generated a .ser file per module. Is there a way to instrument an enitre EAR file at once? So that the result will be a single .ser file which i can use??
