Scapegoat trees. A classic problem with plain binary trees is that they become unbalanced (e.g. when keys are inserted in ascending order.) Balanced binary trees (AKA AVL trees) waste a lot of time balancing after each insertion. Red-Black trees stay balanced, but require a extra bit of storage for each node. Scapegoat trees stay balanced like red-black trees, but don't require ANY additional storage. They do this by analyzing the tree after each insertion, and making minor adjustments.
