How to pass input to deep learning models for Multiple choice question answering problem?

I'm currently working on a multiple-choice question answering system. The training set consists of a question, answer and 4 options and I need to predict the correct answer among 4 options. Sometimes there is one paragraph too, For example : 1.Which among the following is measured using a Vernier Caliper? [A] Dimensions [B] Time [C] Sound [D] Temperature Answer : A [Dimensions] Chapter text: [Book chapter related to Dimension, time, sound and temperature ] How to feed this input to any of deep learning models? I thought two approaches : Using tokens and correct and as one hot encoding => [1, 0, 0, 0 ] Using concatenation Generating fix sized word embedding for each text : - Chapter text = [1,1024] - Text = [1,1024] - option_a = [1,1024] - option_b = [1,1024] - option_c = [1,1024] - option_d = [1,1024] final_input = concat( [ Chapter text, Text, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d] ) ==> [1,6144] and correct and as one hot encoding => [1, 0, 0, 0 ] Is it good representation for understanding and reasoning over text for mcqa task?
