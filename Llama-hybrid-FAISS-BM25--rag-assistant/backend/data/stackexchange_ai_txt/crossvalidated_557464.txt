When setting a treshold to use Logistic Regression for a classification task isn't it the same thing as using Linear Regression?

In a classification task if we don't care about the exact value of the propabality of the a data point belonging to a class or not, but instead just compare it to a treshold (e.g 0.5) to get a discrete classsification, we just need to check if the input $z = b_{0}+∑(b_{i}X_{i})$ of the sigmoid fucntion $g(z)$ of the Logistic Regression is greater than or equal to zero, that is: $$ g(z) ≥ 0.5, \text{if z ≥ 0} $$ But, to me this seems to be the exact same thing as training a Linear Regression model and simply checking if the output $Y$ of the model is greater than or equal to zero, if that's the case, why do we need the sigmoid function at all?
