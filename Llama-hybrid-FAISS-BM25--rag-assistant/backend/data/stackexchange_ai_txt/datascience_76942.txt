Is that intuition correct Yes There is no improvement in Cluster quality. All the 3 are the same and should be that way . We can easily observe that all the 3 clusters are forming the elbow at 2.5. Even all other aspects of the 3 plots are exactly the same. Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) measures the squared average distance of all the points within a cluster to the center of the cluster.It is the mean distance of each point within the Cluster from the Centroid. No ratio is involved in this metric( i.e. to cancel the impact of scale ), hence it will definitely depend on the space size and also on the number of clusters. Imaging your space is of the size of Earth, then you standardized it to make it as a size of a football, then you make it even smaller i.e. golf ball with Normalization. I just wasn't expecting the reduction to be this drastic between standardizing and normalizing. Obviously, the mean distance will reduce in the proportion of Standard deviation in the case of Standardization and "Max value" in the case of Normalization. Having big outliers can have a bigger impact. Using the same logic, we can see that the metric decreases with the number of clusters too. More cluster means each cluster is closer to its Centrod and hence smaller SSE. That's why it's not a great metric. You may try to calculate silhouette score , which combines both the Cohesion and Separation for 3 cases from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_) Ref
