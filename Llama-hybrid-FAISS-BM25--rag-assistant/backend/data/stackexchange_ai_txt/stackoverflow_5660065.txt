There is a test case at jsPerf which comes close: http://jsperf.com/localstorage-overhead As far as I am concerned, I wouldn't bother moving my JS object to localStorage to free up memory. This seems like a overkill to me. Ideally, most of the stuff should be scoped inside functions and there should be as little stuff as possible in the global namespace(something that will live in memory for your app's entire lifetime). Hope this helps.
