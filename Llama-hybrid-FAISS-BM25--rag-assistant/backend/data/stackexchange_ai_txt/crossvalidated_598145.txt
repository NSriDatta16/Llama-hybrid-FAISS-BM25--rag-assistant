Can I use logistic regression when all of the regressors sum to 1?

Let's say I want to perform a logistic regression (binomial) as : X ~ P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 where X is binary variable (0 or 1) and P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 are proportion of cell type ( e.g. P1 = proportion of T-cells ; P2 = proportion of B-Cells, etc..). The sum of P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 is 1 for each observation. Can I perform a univariate regression for each Px variable e.g X ~ P1 and a multivariate regression with all Px variables knowing that the sum of all Px is always 1 ?
