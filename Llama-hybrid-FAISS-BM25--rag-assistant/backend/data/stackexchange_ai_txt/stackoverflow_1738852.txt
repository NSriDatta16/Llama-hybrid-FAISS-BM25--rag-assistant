Accents on numbers in HTML (like a ^ over 1)

I'm trying to find the best way to put circumflex accents ( ˆ = &circ; ) on top of numbers (a musical notation) without resorting to images. Certain letters have equivalent HTML entities: ê = &ecirc; , Ô = &Ocirc; , etc., but numbers don't. Here is what I'm currently using on my website : 1 &circ; It looks pretty good, but not perfect---because of slight differences in number shapes and browser rendering, something is bound to be a little off. Does anyone have a more elegant solution for this? Update: The Combining Circumflex Accent &#770; or &#x302; produces different results on different browsers/platforms, most of which are not right (on my Mac, only Safari does it right). According to this , proper display of a combining accent is dependent on both the font and the renderer. I'm using Times New Roman, Times , so it doesn't appear to be a workable option. I can't afford the hassle and inevitable ignoring of requiring a user to have a particular font. I guess I'll have to stick with manually positioning the accent atop the note as above unless there's any other new answers. Thanks. Update 2: Embedding a free font with better diacritic support (especially Doulos SIL ) seemed promising, but as of now (Nov 2009), Chrome does not support @font-face in CSS by default. Once it does, though, it will be great, since the other browsers are already on board. webfonts.info is the place for info on this.
