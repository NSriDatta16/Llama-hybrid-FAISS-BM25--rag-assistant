Hidden layers in neural network

I am extremely new to neural networks. I would just like to ask if there is a need to have hidden layers in a neural network. I read off Quora that a neural network with 10 input nodes and 10 output nodes will have 100 parameters and 10 bias units. If thats the case it means there are no hidden layers?
