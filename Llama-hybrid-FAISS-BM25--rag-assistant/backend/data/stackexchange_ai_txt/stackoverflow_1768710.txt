multi-staged form using spring

please forgive me for this stupid questions. I just started developing web application using spring yesterday. The project that i worked on, have a multi staged form, that require users to complete them before the data can be persisted on the database. Is there any way to keep those input in a temporary storage eg: session scoped bean, before the user finish all the stages? or any suggestion what is the best way to implement this using spring mvc? thanks a lot, please pardon my grammar
