What's the best tool to automatically organize or alphabetize your CSS properties?

I'm looking for a way to automatically organize (alphabetically, or by any other accepted "standard") all of my CSS properties. I would prefer a method in Dreamweaver, but I'll take anything at this point! Example: .div-name { padding: 5px; width: 300px; margin: 10px; color: #000; } would be converted to: .div-name { color: #000; margin: 10px; padding: 5px; width: 300px; }
