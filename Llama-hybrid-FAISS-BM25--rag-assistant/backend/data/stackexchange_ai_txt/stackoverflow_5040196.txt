Applet using JNLP: messages in Java console

I am displaying applet using JNLP. I have written all the necessary files. The jars are signed. Even applet is loading fine. I am getting lots of messages in Java console which are contributing to delay in applet loading. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLDropDown$1: try again .. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLDropDown$2: try again .. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLDropDown$3: try again .. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLDropDown$4: try again .. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLComboBoxModel: try again .. basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: pack.XMLToolTipManager: try .. ...so on. Lots of messages in Java console. PS. Applet is working fine. Just wanted to know the cause for try again messages.
