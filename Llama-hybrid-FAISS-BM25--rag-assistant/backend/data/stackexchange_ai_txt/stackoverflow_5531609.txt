CSS :first-letter gets cut off at the border of the paragraph

I have a problem with my drop caps. Please take a look at this page http://www.madebypaz.com/portfolio/interaction/user-centred-design The :first-letter gets cut off at the top in webkit, Firefox pushes it down a line. Can you give some advice how to fix this so it only spans across two lines and doesn't get cut off at the top? Any pointers greatly appreciated.
