Year dummies versus Macro-specific factors

My sample is balanced panel data and includes 6,071 firm-year observations for the period 2002-2014. I test the book leverage ( total debt/total asset ) by using lagged factors as follows: 9 firm-specific factors , 2 industry-specific factors , 3 macro-specific factors (inflation, interest rate, and GDP growth), and 3 dummies . At the same time I use 12 year dummies for 13 year analysis. Can I use only time dummies instead of macro-specific dummies or opposite? I cannot find any empirical evidence about this usage.
