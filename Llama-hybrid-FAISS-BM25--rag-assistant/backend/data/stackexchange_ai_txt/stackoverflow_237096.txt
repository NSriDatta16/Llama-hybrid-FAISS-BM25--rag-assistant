Send administrative commands to my C# Windows Service using own PowerShell CmdLets

I have a C# Windows application which runs a service. I would like to leverage PowerShell in order to offer a command line management interface for administering my running service. From my point of view, I am trying to offer the same administrative interface a la Exchange 2007. Do you have any suggestion or sample code on how to start/design the management cmdlets in order "connect" to the running service to query or send administrative commands? How can I access service's internal runtime state from powershell command line? For example I would like to implement a cmdlet called Get-ConnectionsInfo to find out how many outbound connections my Windows service is using when the cmdlet is executed. A practical example or web link to an example would be more than welcomed. Thanks, Robert
