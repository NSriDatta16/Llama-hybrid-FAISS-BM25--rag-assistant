One legitimate reason that I've seen in the workplace is due to the fact that a vendor provides hotfix jars that need to precede the original version in the classpath. However, this application is launched via java webstart (jnlp) and as of java version 6, the order of the jar file dependencies is no longer guaranteed. Therefore the only way to ensure that the duplicated class files are in the correct sequence is to re-package them into an uber jar, retaining the latest patched class files and discarding older duplicates.
