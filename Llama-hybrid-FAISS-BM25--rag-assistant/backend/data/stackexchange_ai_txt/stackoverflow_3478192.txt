The value of test code coverage tools

We've started using Part Cover to track test code coverage of our application. IMO its a great tool for getting an overall score for your tests and for highlighting test areas where you might have been a bit lazy with tests, but today I wrote a test and realised that it didn't really test anything useful, it just increased my coverage! If you are TDD, then you only write code to pass a test, and the tests are richly describing all the functionality required by the application. So in this scenario is it still very valuable to have coverage analysis? For those of you that have coverage tools, how religiously do you adhere to keeping the coverage at 100% and do you ever find yourself writing tests that don't really test anything, but just to keep your coverage up? Isn't this a bad thing ?
