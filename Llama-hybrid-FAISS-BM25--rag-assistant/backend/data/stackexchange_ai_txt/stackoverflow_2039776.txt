iPhone ad hoc distribution as a team admin with team agent's certificate?

I'm a team admin (but not team agent) for our company's iPhone program on ADC. Can the Team Agent, who is a separate person, provide me a copy of the distribution provision profile file that I can use with XCode to create an ad-hoc build? This is because the team agent person is not a technical person but they're the one who signed up for the program. When I add the distribution profile to my XCode organize, I see an error for the profile: A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain I have my own development certificate installed (developer_identity.cer) as well as AppleWWDRCA.cer installed onto my KeyChain manager. Would we have to change the person who is the Team Agent so it's my certificate that's used with the distribution provision file to make the ad-hoc build happen?
