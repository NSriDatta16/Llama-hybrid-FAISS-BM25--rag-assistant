User Agent list appropriate for jQuery Mobile

I want to implement jQuery Mobile, but only for mobile browsers. Is there a simple User Agent detection function that takes a User Agent string and returns true/false based on whether the browser should get a normal website or a mobile website? This would basically be regular expression matching and programming language agnostic. But I would be using this in Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Cold Fusion on the server-side and in JavaScript on the client-side.
