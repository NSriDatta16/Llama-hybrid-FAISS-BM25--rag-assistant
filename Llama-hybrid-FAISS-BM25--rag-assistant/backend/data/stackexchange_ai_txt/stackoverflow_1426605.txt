Class selectors .className This is to be used when you have more than one element on the page that you would like to apply the same style to. It can be to any tag element. So in the following all will use the same style as set out by the .className . But you can also restrict it like so: img.className By placing the tag along with the style definition, you're saying that this style is only to be used when it's the class used by that particular tag, in this case, an image. HTML code will look like this: If you have other elements on the page using the same class style, but are not of the same tag, then the styles set out in this will not be applied and they will take on the more generic version as mentioned in the first example. So repeating the example above: Only the image will take on the style as set out by img.className whereas all the rest will take on the style rules set in .className . ID selectors #idName This is to be used when there is only one instance of a particular element that you wish to apply the style to. You can also force it to apply only in certain tag conditions as you have earlier with the class definitions. p#idName This example will only apply to the paragraph block marked with the ID: If you were to put that id on another element, like this: Then it will not take on the style set out and be ignored.
