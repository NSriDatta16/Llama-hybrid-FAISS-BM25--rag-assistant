Using jQuery to store the state of a complicated form

I have a rather complicated form with many "steps" in it that are filled in by the user. Some steps (think of them as form segments) have default options, but on clicking a "enter custom values," they display a hereto hidden set of fields that the user can enter info in. Here is an example Mode A Mode B Choose one of the above for applying average coefficient values of "a" or "b" to 100% of your product or enter custom values %a: coeff. a %b: coeff. b Enter custom values above or choose average values There are several such segments, for example, #s1 .. #s7. Here is my task. I want to enable the user to save the state of a form. So, once a user has filled out the entire form, choosing average defaults for some segments, and entering custom values for other, the user is able to click a button and have the entire state saved for thawing later. I am thinking, if I can save the state in an object that I can serialize, I can save it in a db table or some other persistent storage. The user can come back at a later time and re-construct the entire previous session. How do I do this? There is the getAttributes plugin http://plugins.jquery.com/project/getAttributes , and there is the jQuery serialize method, but I can't for the life of me get started. Please nudge me in the right direction.
