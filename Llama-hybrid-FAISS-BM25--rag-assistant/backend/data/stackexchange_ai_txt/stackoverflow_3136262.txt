What are some alternatives to RedirectToAction?

On my HomeController I have an index action which redirects to the index action of the CustomerController via the RedirectToAction method. In this instance I don't like how RedirectToAction modifies the URL showing mysite.com/Customer . Are there some alternative mechanisms to performing a redirection that will allow me to still leverage the index action from the CustomerController ? public RedirectToRouteResult Index() { return RedirectToAction("Index", "Customer"); }
