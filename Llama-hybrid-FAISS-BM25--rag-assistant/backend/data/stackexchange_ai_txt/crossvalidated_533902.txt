Yes, as long as the input for the outcome is failure (0,1) where 0-No 1-Yes (default), then the predicted probability from your logistic regression model will be the probability of defaulting. For your use case of 0.8 or 80% that person does have a default prediction of 80%, so probably not approved. I would think a cutoff of 50% (0.5) is used, but this would depend on the model, the credit agency, and the input predictors. Please do consider that a lot of times in finance several models could be used. It may work out that a model for predicting default with outcome coded 0-no default, 1-default will sometimes employ features which are different from optimal features used for a model for predicting no default with outcome coded 0-default, 1-no default. Reason I am raising this is because a lot of people try to front-load everything into one model, when in fact if you "divide and conquer" to break up a complex problem into multiple smaller problems your prediction may be better. In fact, I would never approach a bank or credit agency with results of one model!
