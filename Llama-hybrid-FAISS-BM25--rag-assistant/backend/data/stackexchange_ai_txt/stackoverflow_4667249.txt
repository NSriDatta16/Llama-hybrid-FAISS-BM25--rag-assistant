If all of your memory including the stack is fragmented like this, you either have a compiler (or runtime system) that supports non-contiguous stacks—in which case it might also be smart enough to support non-contiguous arrays—or basically everything you do (like calling subroutines) will result in a stack overflow and crash your program.
