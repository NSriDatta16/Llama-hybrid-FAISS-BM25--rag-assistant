One thing that affects system performance, even though the code is unchanged, is data. An example might be performance of a database query. As data is added to a table the cost of maintaining indexes goes up. Page splits in the index can degrade performance. As indexes grow, the number of 'levels' in the index will every so often have to be increased. When that happens you see a sudden, apparently inexplicable change in performance. Running stress tests in a production environment is not always possible - it affects your day-to-day business. More often systems are instrumented to provide on-going feedback about performance. Maybe using something like ganglia . The data are used to detect issues and for capacity planning.
