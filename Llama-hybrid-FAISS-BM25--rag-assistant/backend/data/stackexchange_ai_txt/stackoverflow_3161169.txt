Moving my nhibernate initialization code from Application_Start() to Init() still did not run late enough to fix the error. So I stumbled upon this . The solution I used was not from the original post , but the from first comment by jbland. Basically it moves initialization of nhibernate to occur on the first request. One thing to note is his code does not give you the context of where webSessionStorage comes from. It is a member variable and must be instantiated in Init().
