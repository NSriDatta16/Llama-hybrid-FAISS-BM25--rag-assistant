In the below code I reflect the advice in the 2nd paragraph of EdM's answer, "to generate simulations to illustrate the vagaries of fitting a parametric Weibull model" by removing the intermediate Cox model shown in the OP. The code below takes into account the joint distribution of shape and scale values from the parametric Weibull fit by using the mvrnorm() function from the MASS package to simulate from a bivariate normal distribution with mean and covariance matrix equal to the estimates obtained from fitting the Weibull distribution. I use the vcov() function to extract the covariance matrix from the Weibull fit. The code generates new survival times using the simulated shape and scale parameters. Code: library(survival) library(MASS) # Simulate survival data n $estimate[1] scale estimate[2] # Generate new survival times based on estimated parameters mean_est $time), max(sfit$ time), length = 100) surv $surv))/diff(surv$ time) # Plot survival and hazard curves, and histogram of simulated survival times par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(surv, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = "Survival Function") plot(surv$time[-1], haz, type = "l",xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard Function", main = "Hazard Function") hist(new_t, breaks = 20, xlab = "Survival Time", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Simulated Survival Times")
