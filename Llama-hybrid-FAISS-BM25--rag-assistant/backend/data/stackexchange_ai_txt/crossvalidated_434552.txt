The tutorial uses "TRANSFER LEARNING" this is based on using a pre-trained neural network. The people who developed the model used those parameters when they trained their model. In this particular tutorial, the resnet18 model was used. If you read the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition the developers of the model they provide the following information : "Our implementation for ImageNet follows the practice in [21, 41]. The image is resized with its shorter side randomly sampled in [256, 480] for scale augmentation [41]. A 224Ã—224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its horizontal flip, with the per-pixel mean mean subtracted [21].
