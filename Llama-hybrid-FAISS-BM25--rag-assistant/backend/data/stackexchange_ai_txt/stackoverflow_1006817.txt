Drupal Ajaxifying Everything

Is there any way of ajaxifying Drupal so that page reloads are not reloads but just content modifications? So menus would be updated, content would be updated and any blocks etc. would be appropriately modified but without the overhead of spitting out the whole page to the the user for client-side fixing up and without losing the nice javascript UI that Drupal has (like collapsible fieldsets, draggable table items and other ajaxified modules etc.).
