Where can I find Azure storage cmdlets for PowerShell?

David Aitken's blog post and another post I cannot find anymore talk about PowerShell cmdlets within a CloudDrive example that let you manipulate Azure storage blobs and queues. Where are these now? He refers (presumably based on Azure SDK 1.0) to a samples.zip file, but my SDK just contains a Windows Azure SDK Samples link. I cannot find CloudDrive there, although it is mentioned in this archive . Unfortunately the associated downloads omit CloudDrive. I feel this must be somewhere really obvious, but I am too stupid to find it.
