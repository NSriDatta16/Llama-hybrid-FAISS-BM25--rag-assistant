Why is branching in SVN not good enough?

I've heard so much about how Git has redesigned how branching works, and how SVN's branching model is screwed up. I've not used much SVN, so I have no preconceptions about what a branch should look like. I first looked at git branches, and I "get" it. What are the practical drawbacks of SVN branches? Answers from the POV of workflow, branching strategy and branch performance (in terms of commit/checkout/switch times) encouraged. Thanks, jrh
