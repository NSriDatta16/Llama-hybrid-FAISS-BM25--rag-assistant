To access data using LINQ to SQL , you need to create a DataContext. Visual Studio has a designer for Data context classes in which you can simply drag and drop tables from the server explorer, or use SQLMetal to reverse engineer your database. But this only works for SQL Server databases. For a generic database, you will need to use Entity Framework , for which you can generate the Entity class design using EDM Generator . If you want to continue using your current approach, you can just call AsEnumerable method on a DataTable in the DataSet, and it will give you an IEnumerable , on which you can use LINQ operators to your heart's content.
