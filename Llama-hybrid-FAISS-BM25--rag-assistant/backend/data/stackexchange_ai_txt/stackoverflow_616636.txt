My normal use of the "data source" bits is to more quickly set up my grids and forms. Once done, I will bind using other methods, as I do not want two artifacts that are common to the drag and drop UI: Munging of all layers into one control Reliance on extra FUD to keep the app working But, using the data source to set up UI? Yeah, that is pretty cool. Outside of the box? Certainly. :-) I am a big fan of drag and drop to do the mundane, but I am not fond of something that holds me inside a box.
