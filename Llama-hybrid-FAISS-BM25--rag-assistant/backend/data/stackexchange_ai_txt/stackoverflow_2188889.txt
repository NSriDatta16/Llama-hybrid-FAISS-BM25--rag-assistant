As far as detecting agent problems, you want to know when the logreader and distributor are stopped. Mine is also continuous replication like chadhoc, but I find it easier to use an Alert to tell me if the agents are stopped. USE [msdb] GO EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_add_alert @name=N'Distribution agent stopped', @message_id=0, @severity=0, @enabled=1, @delay_between_responses=2160, @include_event_description_in=1, @category_name=N'[Uncategorized]', @performance_condition=N'MSSQL$MYDATABASE:Replication Agents|Running|Distribution|=|0', @job_id=N'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' GO EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_update_notification @alert_name=N'Distribution agent stopped', @operator_name=N'Amit', @notification_method = 1 Validation/sync errors are not so simple to detect. You can set up a nightly job to run sp_publication_validation and setup another alert on "Validation Failed".
