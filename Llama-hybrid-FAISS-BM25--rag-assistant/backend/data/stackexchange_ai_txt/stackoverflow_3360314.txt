with the help of a colleague of mine I've found the answer. He told me it's not possible to have an ownerdrawn CStatic. So when I now inherit PictureView from CButton and make it BS_OWNERDRAW my image is rendered. Personally I think this is an ugly solution but I'm so tired of this problem now that I don't really care that much. These are the changes I've made to make it work: Constructor call: CWnd* GenericChildWidget::addImage(std::string path, int horizontalPos, int width, int verticalPos, int height, int childId) { PictureView* image = new PictureView(path); image->Create("", BS_OWNERDRAW | WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, CRect(horizontalPos, verticalPos, width + horizontalPos, height + verticalPos), this, childId); return image; } PictureView.h: #pragma once #include #include class Picture; class PictureView : public CButton { public: PictureView(std::string path); protected: virtual void DrawItem(LPDRAWITEMSTRUCT lpDrawItemStruct); private: Picture* m_picture; }; Thank's everybody for all the help.
