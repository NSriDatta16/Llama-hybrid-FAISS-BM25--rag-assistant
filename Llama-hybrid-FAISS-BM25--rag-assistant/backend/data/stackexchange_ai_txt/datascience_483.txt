You could try Neural Network. You can find 2 great explanations on how to apply NN on time series here and here . Note that it is best practice to : Deseasonalize/detrend the input data (so that the NN will not learn the seasonality). Rescale/Normalize the input data. Because what you are looking for is a regression problem, the activation functions should be linear and not sigmoid or tanh and you aim to minimize the sum-of-squares error (as opposition to the maximization of the negative log-likelihood in a classification problem).
