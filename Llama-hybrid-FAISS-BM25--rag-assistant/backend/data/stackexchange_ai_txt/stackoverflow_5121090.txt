Google Search API

The Google Web Search (SOAP) API was deprecated in November of last year, having been discouraged for a long time previously. I noticed there exists the new Google Custom Search API , but this seems only for creating site-specific custom searches. So, is there currently any API solution for searching the entire web? Either using Google Custom Search or some other API?
