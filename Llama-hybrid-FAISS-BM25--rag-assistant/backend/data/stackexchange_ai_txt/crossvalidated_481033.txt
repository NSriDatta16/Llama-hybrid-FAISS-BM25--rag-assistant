Help me understand how to apply a beta-binomial model in order to estimate a parameter when there are several Bernoulli trials?

So, I have been presented with this question: A sample of 100 people were asked how many days they drove their car during the last week (inc. the weekend). The resulting frequency of response is shown below: Days, frequency 0, 1 1, 5 2, 3 3, 15 4, 20 5, 25 6, 31 7, 0 I need to use a beta-binomial model in order to estimate the average number of 'car driven' days a week for a uniform prior. There are a total of 7 Bernoulli trials, each with success probability p . I'm incredibly confused at what the outcome will be. I know that for a uniform prior that alpha = 1, and beta = 1, but I don't know how to apply this all to get the average? Thank you.
