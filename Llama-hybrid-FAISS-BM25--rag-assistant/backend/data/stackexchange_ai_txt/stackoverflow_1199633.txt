Am I oversimplifying this? $location = "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories"; print file_get_contents($location); Some places (like digg.com) won't allow you to access their site without having a user-agent, in which case you would need to set that with ini_set() prior to running the file_get_contents().
