Mysql - display multiple rows under one field header

Okay, been thrashing around with this for longer than I care to think about! I am trying to drag event data from mysql so that it displays the Event Name once and several products under that Event Name For Example: Event Name product 1 product 2 product 3 What is currently happening is that the Event Name is displayed above each product, like this Event Name product 1 Event Name product 2 Event Name product 3 The PHP Code is: Please enter a search... "; exit; } // check for a search parameter if (!isset($var)) { echo " We dont seem to have a search parameter! "; exit; } //connect to your database ** EDIT REQUIRED HERE ** mysql_connect("xxxxxxxx","xxxxxxxx","xxxxx"); //(host, username, password) //specify database ** EDIT REQUIRED HERE ** mysql_select_db("event_db") or die("Unable to select database"); //select which database we're using // Build SQL Query $query = "select * from event where event_name like \"%$trimmed%\" order by event_name"; // EDIT HERE and specify your table and field names for the SQL query $numresults=mysql_query($query); $numrows=mysql_num_rows($numresults); // If we have no results, offer a google search as an alternative if ($numrows == 0) { echo " Results "; echo " Sorry, your search: &quot;" . $trimmed . "&quot; returned zero results "; // google echo " Click here to try the search on google "; } // next determine if s has been passed to script, if not use 0 if (empty($s)) { $s=0; } // get results $query .= " limit $s,$limit"; $result = mysql_query($query) or die("Couldn't execute query"); // display what the person searched for echo " You searched for: &quot;" . $var . "&quot; "; // begin to show results set echo "Results "; // now you can display the results returned while ($row= mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $title = $row["event_name"] . " "; $title2 = $row["location"] . " - " . $row["style_name"] . " "; echo " $title "; echo "$count&nbsp;$title2"; } $currPage = (($s/$limit) + 1); //break before paging echo " "; // next we need to do the links to other results if ($s>=1) { // bypass PREV link if s is 0 $prevs=($s-$limit); print "&nbsp; &lt;&lt; Prev 10 &nbsp&nbsp;"; } // calculate number of pages needing links $pages=intval($numrows/$limit); // $pages now contains int of pages needed unless there is a remainder from division if ($numrows%$limit) { // has remainder so add one page $pages++; } // check to see if last page if (!((($s+$limit)/$limit)==$pages) && $pages!=1) { // not last page so give NEXT link $news=$s+$limit; echo "&nbsp; Next 10 &gt;&gt; "; } $a = $s + ($limit) ; if ($a > $numrows) { $a = $numrows ; } $b = $s + 1 ; echo " Showing results $b to $a of $numrows "; ?> Any thoughts would be greatly received.
