XML - Help removing nodes being published

Any help much appreciated on this. I'd like to remove certain nodes from being published in a feed from an external xml file, which I've styled with xslt. Here is the feed: http://www.wcwg.info/feeds/localevents.aspx?a=00392&p=CM159EH&m=20 . The nodes I would like to remove are: Local Events posted to WhereCanWeGo.com.00392CM15 9EH31/10/1007/11/1010001111111111111111111031 October 2010http://www.wherecanwego.com/events/signin.aspxww.wherecanwego.com/events/signin.aspx Could anybody be kind enough to direct me how to remove these initial nodes (parameters)? They are the postcode, account number, feed URL etc. I'm desperate to get this finished, but it's the final hurdle! Many thanks in advance for anyone who responds...
