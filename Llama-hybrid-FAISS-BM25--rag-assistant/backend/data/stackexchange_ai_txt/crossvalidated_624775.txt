Summarising the autocorrelation of multiple time series

The fluorescence signal of a molecule in multiple cells is described by multiple time series. The number of time series is in the hundreds and observations were taken every ten minutes. Apart from other methods, I'm looking into using autocorrelation to determine the presence of oscillations. For now, I have calculated the autocorrelation per time series as well as the confidence intervals ( Hanke & Wichern ). A similar question has been raised here already. I believe, however, that this question concerns one time series but sampled differently multiple times. Furthermore, I think that the accepted solution is no applicable to my question for similar reasons. Now, I'm wondering whether there is a way to summarise the autocorrelation coefficients and confidence intervals across all time series? For instance, averaging (mean?) the observations per equal time points across time series and then calculating the confidence intervals on the averaged data? Preferably, there's a way to cite the possible solution. It can be assumed that the observations within a time series are not independent. The observations of different time series, however, are. Edit: For the determination of the periods, I took the time difference between first and second positive ACC peaks outside the confidence interval. Is this correct?
