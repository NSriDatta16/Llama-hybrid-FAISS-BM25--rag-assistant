Let's say we have 25 portfolios $i=1, \ldots, 25$ . Consider the time-series regressions for each portfolio $i$ . $$R_{it} - R^f_t = \alpha_i + \beta_i \left( R^m_t - R^f_t \right) + \epsilon_{it}$$ If all the right hand side variables in your time-series regression are tradeable[1], then the $\alpha_i$ in your time series regression are equivalent to the residuals in your cross-sectional regression of expected returns on market betas. $$ \mathrm{E}[R_i - R^f] = \gamma \beta_i + \alpha_i $$ Recall that the CAPM theory implies that expected excess returns $\mathrm{E}[R_i - R^f] $ are linear in their market betas $\beta_i$ . To test the CAPM, you want to test whether all the $\alpha_i$ are jointly zero. In statistics, this is called an F-test, and in finance, its fancy name is the Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (GRS) test. You could also run the cross-sectional regression (estimating $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ ) $$ \mathrm{E}[R_i - R^f] = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \beta_i + \alpha_i $$ and see if $\gamma_1$ even has a positive slope. Basically, the CAPM doesn't work. Checkout Fama-French CAPM Theory and Evidence if you want to go deep. You can download the 25 Fama-French size, book to market portfolios and test the CAPM on them. It will do horribly in predicting the cross-sectional variation of average returns. Basic summary: You want to run the time series regressions $R_{it} - R^f_t = \alpha_i + \beta_i \left( R^m_t - R^f_t \right) + \epsilon_{it}$ on portfolio/security $i$ and then jointly test whether all the $\alpha_i$ are zero. There's the classic quote of Box that all models are wrong but some are useful. In some sense, the question is whether the $\alpha$ s are large, not whether they can be statistically distinguished from zero. If you're running this on monthly data (which is standard), $\alpha_i$ will be in units of abnormal monthly returns. 1 percent per month would be absolutely huge. 0.05 percent per month is rather meh. [1] The market portfolio of all stocks etc... is tradeable. GDP growth would be an example of something that is not tradeable.
