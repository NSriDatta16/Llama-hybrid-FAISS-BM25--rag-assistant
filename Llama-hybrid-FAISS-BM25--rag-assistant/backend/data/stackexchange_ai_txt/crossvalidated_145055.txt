How are sample size and confidence related when calculating Sample mean?

Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself and I should just keep reading my textbook, but I'm getting confused about something. Let's say a friend gives me 10,000 integers that he claims are normally distributed. My goal is to estimate the parameter $\mu$ of that initial distribution. I do the following: Divide the 10,000 into 100 groups of size 100, and compute the average of each group, to give me 100 averages $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{100}$. These numbers should also be normally distributed with the same mean $u$, by the Central Limit Theorem? Do I then tell me friend that my guess for $u$ is simply $A = (a_1+\cdots+a_{100})/100$ ? If so, then the size of the groups I picked (groups of size 100) has no impact on the returned value. Am I way off? Can I say anything like "With P % confidence, the original $\mu$ was $A$"?
