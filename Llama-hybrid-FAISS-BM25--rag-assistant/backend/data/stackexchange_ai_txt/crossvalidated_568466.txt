I believe this is a standard case for a simple t-test (i.e. asymptotic z-test) on the difference between the 2 average CPU speeds (times). The logic is as follows: Let $t_1 = [t_{1,1} \dots t_{1,n}]'$ and $t_2 = [t_{2,1} \dots t_{2,n}]'$ be the vectors of CPU time duration (or speed) for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. We assume that both $t_{1,i}$ and $t_{2,i}$ come from the same distribution and are independently drawn, hence iid. Let $\bar t_1$ and $\bar t_2$ be the respective averages. By the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): $$ \sqrt{n}(\bar t_1-\mu_1) \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_1) $$ for $\sigma^2_1$ being the variance of $t_{1,i}$ . Analogously for $t_2$ . Now if indeed $t_1$ and $t_2$ were generated by the same distribution then the difference between the average should be zero, and the two averages have the same distribution, hence our null hypothesis is: $$ H_0: \bar t_1 - \bar t_2 = \bar{\Delta t_{i}} = \Delta t =0. $$ and $\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu$ and $\sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2=\sigma^2$ . By the CLT it holds that: $$ \sqrt{n}(\Delta t) \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{\Delta}) $$ with $\sigma^2_{\Delta} = Var[t_{1,i} - t_{2,i}]=Var[t_{i,1}]+Var[t_{i,2}]=2\sigma^2$ , due to independence. Hence $H_0$ can be tested with a 2-sided test via the test statistic: $$ t_{H_0}=\frac{\sqrt{n}\Delta t}{\sqrt{\hat \sigma^2_{\Delta}}}\overset{a}{\sim}\mathcal{N}(0,1) $$ where $\sqrt{\hat \sigma^2_{\Delta}}$ is the sample standard deviation of the differences. (Note that there are may be a few other possible variations on this model, like choosing unequal sample sizes. Keyword: t-test.)
