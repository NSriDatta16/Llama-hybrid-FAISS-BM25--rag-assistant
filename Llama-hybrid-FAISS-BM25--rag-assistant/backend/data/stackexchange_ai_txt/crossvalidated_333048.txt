Kendall's W for a series of answers about the same phenomenon in different entities

I have a question about the proper usage of Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W ). Suppose a series of questions were asked how democratic certain organisations are. Each question was the same for each organisation. There were five possible answers ranging from the most democratic to the most non-democratic. Can I in this case compute Kendall's W ? If not, is there a technique that will measure the reliability of consensus that suits the case presented? In every handbook I've checked there was no mention about such a case. Wikipedia's entry on Kendall's W is no different.
