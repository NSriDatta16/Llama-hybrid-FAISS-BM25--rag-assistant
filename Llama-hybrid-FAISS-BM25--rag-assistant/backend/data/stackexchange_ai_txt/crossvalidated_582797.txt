Yes, SVM is NOT a probabilistic estimator, BUT see docs: it has param probability bool , that is by default =False . Just put it True to enable probability estimates. This must be enabled prior to calling fit, will slow down that method as it internally uses 5-fold cross-validation, and predict_proba may be inconsistent with predict P.S. BTW, in ML it is even possible to refuse to make a decision - important when improper decision can lead to harmful consequencies (e.g. for the health of the patient). -- high recall is necessary here, because you need to be sure of false negatives as well - here - as you already know. But I'm not sure it is possible when using SVM
