Convolutional neural networks work because it's a good extension from the standard deep-learning algorithm. Given unlimited resources and money, there is no need for convolutional because the standard algorithm will also work. However, convolutional is more efficient because it reduces the number of parameters . The reduction is possible because it takes advantage of feature locality, exactly what @ncasas writes.
