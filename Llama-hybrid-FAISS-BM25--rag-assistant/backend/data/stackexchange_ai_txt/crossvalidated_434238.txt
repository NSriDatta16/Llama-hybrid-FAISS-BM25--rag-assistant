Normal data, t procedures. For $X_1, \dots, X_n$ from a normal population, it is straightforward to say that $Var(\bar X) =\sigma^2/n$ and hence that $SD(\bar X) = \sigma/\sqrt{n}$ is the standard error of the mean. Then, because $\sigma^2$ is estimated by $S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2,$ we can say that $S/\sqrt{n}$ is the (estimated) standard error of the mean. Also, the t test for $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$ uses the test statistic $$T = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathsf{T}(\nu = n-1),$$ rejecting at the 5% level of significance for $|T| > t^*,$ where $t^*$ cuts 2.5% of the probability from each tail of that t distribution. Furthermore, 'inverting the test', $\bar X \pm t^*\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$ is a 95% confidence interval for $\mu.$ Givwn observed data, one might say that the confidence interval is a collection of $\mu_0$ 's for which $H_0$ is not rejected. Normal approximations for binomial data. However, if $\hat p = X/n,$ where $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n,p).$ an approximate normal test of $H_0: p = p_0$ vs $H_0: p \ne p_0,$ uses the statistic $$Z = \frac{\hat p - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}},$$ rejecting $H_0$ at the 5% level when $|Z| \ge 1.96.$ [As a rough rule, this approximate test works well for moderately large $n$ and $p_0$ not far from $1/2;$ in particular, $\min(np_0, n(1-p_0))>10$ and $0.2 By contrast with the t interval above, the approximate Wald "95%" confidence interval $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$ is not an inversion of the test above. Speaking very loosely, one might say that $\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$ is an estimated standard error of $\hat p,$ but this involves a second approximation beyond the normal approximation of the test. So you are correct to question its use. The result is that the Wald interval does not reliably give the promised 95% coverage probability when $n$ is of small or moderate size, and its use for such $n$ has been deprecated. [The Wald interval was derived as an asymptotic approximation, and is OK for large $n.]$ The Agresti-Coull CI $\tilde p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\tilde p(1-\tilde p)}{n+4}},$ in which $p$ is estimated by $\tilde p = \frac{X+2}{n+4},$ is a more accurate CI for $p$ because it very nearly inverts the test.
