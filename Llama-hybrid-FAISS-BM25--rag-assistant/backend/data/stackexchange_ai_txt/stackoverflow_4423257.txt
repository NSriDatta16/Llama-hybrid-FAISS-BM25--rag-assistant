Go for MySQL. I'd say the only time you should think about using the file system is when you are storing files (BLOBS) of several megabytes, databases (at least the ones you typically use with a php website) are generally less performant when storing that kind of data. For the rest I'd say: always use a relational database. (Assuming you are dealing with data dat has relations of course, if it is random data there is not much benefit in using a relational database ;-) Addition: If you define your own file-structure, and even your own way of cross referencing files you've already started building a 'database' yourself, that is not bad in itself -- it might be loads of fun! -- but you probably will not get the performance benefits you're looking for unless your situation is radically different than the other 80% of 'standard' websites on the web (a couple of pages with text and images on them). (If you are building google/youtube/flickr/facebook ... you've got a different situation and developing your own unique storage solution starts making sense)
