Ruby Loops with Grandma

Okay, I'm trying to write a ruby simulation of my grandmother. I can't quite get the loop to work the way I'd like though. I want granny to respond with "OH, THAT REMINDS ME OF BACK IN (random year) ..." when you answer her in all caps but I also want her to respond with "WHAT'D YOU SAY????" when you don't use all caps. I can get each one to work separately but I can't seem to make a continuous loop of granny with her crazy responses. Here's the code: puts 'HELLO SONNY! WHAT\'S NEW IN THE WHO\'S IT WHAT\'S IT?' response = gets.chomp while response == response.upcase puts 'OH, THAT REMINDS ME OF BACK IN ' + (rand(50) + 1905).to_s + '...' response = gets.chomp end while response != response.upcase puts 'WHAT\'D YOU SAY????' response = gets.chomp end Any ideas?
