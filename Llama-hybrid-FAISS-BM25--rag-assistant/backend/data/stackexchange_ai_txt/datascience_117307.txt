Is there any datset which has human judgement scores between 2 english senctences only?

I am trying to propose an evaluation metric in NLP and I need to compare it with other baseline metric such as Bleu scores. I need a dataset which has 2 english sentences (say same image being described by 2 different persons) and along with that a human judgement score on the quality of those sentences. Ay inputs will be very much appreciated. I'm willing to calculate pearson correlation coeff between blue score and human judgement score; and between proposed metric and human judgement score to see which is giving a higher correlation coeff. Could you specify the direct link to download such txt/ csv file if there exists one. I found wmt metrics dataset that is a translation between different langauges. I am looking for 2 english sentences only along with a human judgement score
