In gerneral it is a smart move to partition your date into 3 subsets: Training : Part of the data you train your network on. Validation : Part of the data used for fine tuning hyperparameters and early stopping if you use it. Test : Part of the data you hold out during the whole training and fine tuning process. This data should not be analyzed until your algorithm is finalized. Predicting and measuring the accuracy on this data will give you the best hint regarding how your algorithm performs on unseen data. Generally I would start with more basic machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression to learn those basics and then move to more complicated ones like CNNs and LSTMs. Try searching for 'data partitioning for machine learning' and you'll get many explanations regarding this topic.
