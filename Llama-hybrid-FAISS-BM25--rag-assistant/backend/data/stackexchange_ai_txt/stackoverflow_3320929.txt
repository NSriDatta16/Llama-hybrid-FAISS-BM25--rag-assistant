You have a lovely set of answers focused on flipping a YES to a NO or vice-versa, but no answers that touched on what would appear to be an architectural issue in the code. Well, some answers. I'm blind. Namely, you have this: objectWithLongishName.memberWithLongishName.submember.myBOOL = !(objectWithLongishName.memberWithLongishName.submember.myBOOL); That smells like a potential encapsulation violation. In particular (and assuming this is a model layer), it means that the connectivity of the sub-graph of objects is being overtly exposed -- flattened into, effectively -- the entry point of that path; whatever objectWithLongishName is must now have rather intimate knowledge of the innards of the objects along the rest of the path. Typically, you don't reach deeply into the model layer along key paths to edit state outside of the Cocoa Bindings layer (and even that is a bit fragile). Sometimes such long-ish paths do make sense. In such a case, I would leave the Ã¼ber-verbose form you have above as a visual indication that encapsulation is being purposefully shred.
