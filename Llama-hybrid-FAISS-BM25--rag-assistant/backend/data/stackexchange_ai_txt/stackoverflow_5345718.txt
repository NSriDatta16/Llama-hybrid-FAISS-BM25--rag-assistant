When a browser is trying to determine which styles to use, it takes into account something called specificity . Check that link before you read on. So what's happening here is that those extra styles which contain ID's are getting a higher specificity than the styles defined in your extjs CSS file (if the selectors are as ChrisR mentions in his answer). You can fix this in two ways: Change the ExtJS selectors to be MORE specific than the ones in your other style file. You can do this by adding an ID to them (hopefully this is possible). The other option is to make the styles in your other style file LESS specific. Meaning that you'll probably have to take out the ID references. If two styles have the same specificity, the one defined last takes precedence (assuming there are no user or user agent stylesheets, which I don't think is the case here). So, you may want to switch the order you load the styles in to be like this: Just in case you get some same specificity level issues.
