Although Steve has a good recommendation, I think that answer is probably a bit beyond where you are at. The "simplified" version of how to go beyond what you've been doing is: gather requirements from the users. Write them down in terms of required functionality. Do simple screen layouts. The main part here is just to get functionality grouped into the right areas. Build a data model Build the actual screens and tie them to the data model. Iterate with more features. At each point stop and do a reality check. For example, do the screens make sense? Is the information organized in a good way? What areas might you have a problem in? etc. Above all, stay in communication with the people that will actually use this product. Also, their are two keys to a successful project. The first is to break it down into manageable portions. In other words break it up so that you can deliver each piece quickly, call that piece done, and move to the next. This will help you to stay focused and not get in over your head. Second, work with what you know. When moving up, refrain from taking this as an opportunity to expand your coding skills. Instead, your focus here is going to be on learning project management. After you've done one or two iterations of this, then look into the various software development methodologies such as scrum, waterfall, etc and see what they have to offer you. Good luck!
