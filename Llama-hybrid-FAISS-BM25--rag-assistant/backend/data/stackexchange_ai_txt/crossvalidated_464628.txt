How to update weights in Bayesian neural network

If I understand correctly, in BNN, we compute posterior and this becomes our new prior(new updated weights). But the problem I don't understand is, how do you update new weights, since unlike in deterministic neural network, you don't update point estimate. If I understand correctly, you need to apply new mu and sigma parameters on weights (if gaussian is the case). I would appreciate your reply
