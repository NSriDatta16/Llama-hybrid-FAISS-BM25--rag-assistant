Not sure it can be... You could try CGSizeZero http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIScrollView/contentSize contentSize The size of the content view. @property(nonatomic) CGSize contentSize Discussion The unit of size is points. The default size is CGSizeZero. The real question is do you truely want "infinate" or do you want mostly infinate and just make the view ungodly large? Or do you want auto-resizing. Also a continuous bar for an infinite scrollview? The bar would never move as it wouldn't get any closer to the beginning or the end... You could make a bar that dragging to the right would go into the future and dragging it to the left would go back and then just always reposition it in the center.... Other then that I dunno what would make sense here.
