If JavaScript is executed by a browser, the user can get to that JavaScript to view it. End of story. You can open up Gmail right now and view every single bit of JS they use. JavaScript runs uncompilled on the user's machine and is right there. Hell, if you View Source in Firefox, script tags are CLICKABLE like hyperlinks. They'll load up the script in the View Source window! Only workaround to discourage non-savy users from getting to the pass phrase is to put all the login logic in a separate JS file ("login.js" or something), and then your template has a JS statement like: document.write(" ") At least that way, the user won't see the login code if they do "View Source", they'll just see the above line. A developer would know to put "login.js" in the address bar and see what comes down, but a noob just looking to f*** around will probably miss it.
