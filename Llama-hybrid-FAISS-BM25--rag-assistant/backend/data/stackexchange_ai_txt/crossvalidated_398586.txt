The issue here is what is being modeled in cancer survival studies. You cannot correctly define censoring, truncation, or whatever without specifying the nature of the study. Cancer survival studies have to do with determining what a clinician can tell a patient about prognosis or can best provide for therapy once a tumor has been detected clinically . In that case what you are modeling is the survival after the time of tumor detection , with the date of pathologic confirmation of a tumor typically set as the time=0 origin for each individual. The event of interest is something related to subsequent outcome (e.g., recurrence after therapy, death from cancer, death from any cause). In this type of study there is no left censoring or truncation of event times: if such an event does happen, it by definition cannot have happened before the time=0 origin as defined for that individual in the study. As the OP rightly points out, that time of tumor detection can be long after--even decades after--the initiation of the tumor. The origins and evolution of a tumor from a single initiating cell into a clinically detectable tumor with about $10^9$ cells is a fascinating object of study. If you were trying to model survival from the time of cancer initiation to death, then some of the concerns in the OP would have to be dealt with.* But that is not what clinical cancer studies are about. They are about survival after cancer detection . Neither the patient, family, friends, or clinicians at that point care explicitly about how long the cancer previously grew undetected. A cancer biomarker available at time=0 might in principle contain information about pre-detection tumor evolution and potentially inform prognostication. Even then, the prognosis being modeled is the clinically relevant survival after someone is known to have cancer, not from the time decades past when the tumor began. *You would also have to deal with just what is meant as "cancer initiation": for a carcinoma do you mean the first dysplastic event, the development of carcinoma in situ , production of the first cell capable of invasiveness, or first invasion through a basement membrane?
