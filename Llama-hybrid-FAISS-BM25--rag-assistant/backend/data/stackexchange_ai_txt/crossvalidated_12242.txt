It makes no sense to slap the 7 points/day together in a contiguous fashion as your answer suggests, unless you're continuing to track the $\delta t$ between the points and treating the time series as irregularly sampled. You can compute things like (where evening = 12-6am): Mean head count per 'evening' Max head count per 'evening' Min head count per 'evening' and then analyze the time series consisting of one of the daily statistics. These would be spaced evenly in time and you might be able to come to some conclusions about them. Do you have a specific objective in mind for this data, i.e. are you trying to demonstrate decreased usage of these 'all-night' time slots at the end of the exam period?
