The answer can be traced from the warning I was getting in XCode: warning: no rule to process file '$(PROJECT_DIR)/html/orientation.js' of type sourcecode.javascript for architecture i386 XCode setup *.js javascript as some type of source code needed to be compiled in the application when I wanted to include it as a resource so I solved it by doing 2 things. Select .js file and in the "Detail" view unselect the bullseye column indicating it is compiled code In the "Groups & files" view expand the "Targets" tree and expand the application then go to "Copy Bundle Resources" and drag the *.js files into it The Apple dev forums has a posted solution: UIWebView and JavaScript It appears that you are getting bit by the "Xcode thinks that .js are things to be compiled" feature. Basically, Xcode thinks that the script should somehow be run or compiles, so marks it as part of the source code. Source code, of course, is not copied into the resources. So you need to do two things - select the .js file in your project, and turn off the checkbox that indicates that it is compiled (the "bullseye" column). If you don't do this, you'll get a warning in your build log about being unable to compile the file (which should be your first warning - always try to figure out and and correct any and all warning that appear in your build). Then drag it and drop it in the target's "Copy Bundle Resources".
