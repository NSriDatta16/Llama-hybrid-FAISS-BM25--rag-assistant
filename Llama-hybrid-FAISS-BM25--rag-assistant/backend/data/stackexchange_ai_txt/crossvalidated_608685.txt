This calls for a multinomial logistic regression, possibly with polynomial contrasts to account for the fact that the predictor is ordinal (it may or may not be better to simply treat the 3 levels as categorical). To account for the non-independence (repeated measures), you would probably need to add a random effect (intercept and perhaps slope).
