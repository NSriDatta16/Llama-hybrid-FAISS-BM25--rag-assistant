Finding peaks and valleys of a curve is all about looking at the slope of the line. At such a location the slope is 0. As i am guessing a voice curve is very irregular, it must first be smoothed, until only significant peaks exist. So as i see it the curve should be taken as a set of points. Groups of points should be averaged to produce a simple smooth curve. Then the difference of each point should be compared, and points not very different from each other found and those areas identified as a peak, valleys or plateau.
