You can trivially modify DBSCAN (see GDBSCAN) to take time into account rather than dropping the precious time information. I.e. neighbors are those points that are within a time difference of dt, and that have a minimum similarity. Apart from that, classic "change in mean" analysis techniques for time series come to my mind. Maybe also changepoint detection.
