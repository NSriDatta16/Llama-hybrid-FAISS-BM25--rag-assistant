There is no 'best' way to represent a tree in XML. It all depends what you want to optimize your storage for - do you want to be able to track down a specific node quickly? Then a flat(er) representation might be better. If you want to keep the description non-verbose, then the method you outlined will be pretty good (though I would probably turn the 'root' child into an attribute (root/value), that way every node in the xml is actually a tree node).
