Is there any better alternative to Linear Probability Model?

I read here , here , here , and elsewhere that linear probability model (LPM) might be used to get risk differences when the outcome variable is binomial. LPM has some advantages such as ease of interpretation by simplifying the estimation of risk differences, which in certain fields might be preferable than odds ratio that is usually provided by logistic regression. My concerns are however that "[u]sing the LPM one has to live with the following three drawbacks: The effect ΔP(y=1∣X=x0+Δx) is always constant The error term is by definition heteroscedastic OLS does not bound the predicted probability in the unit interval" Therefore, I would appreciate any idea on a better regression model for binomial data to get robust risk difference in R while avoiding these drawbacks of LPM.
