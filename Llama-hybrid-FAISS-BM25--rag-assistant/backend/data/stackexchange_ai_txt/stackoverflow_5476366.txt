Alternatives to SQL Server CE?

What good alternatives are there to SQL Server CE? I was also thinking of writing something of my own. But I don't know about performance with 40,000 - 100,000 rows. All data will be only in string format and it will be only one column. So is it actually worth writing my own data storage? I will not need to order or sort data in any way, just to add and remove.
