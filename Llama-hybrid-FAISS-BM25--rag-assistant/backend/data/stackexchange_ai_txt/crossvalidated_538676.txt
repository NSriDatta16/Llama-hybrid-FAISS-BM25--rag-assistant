What is no information rate in confusionMatrix in r?

I wrote a logistic regression and used confusionMatrix function of caret library to check the accuracy of this model. Here is my code. library(caret) fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Weekly,family=binomial) predicted NIR] : 0.369 Kappa : 0.035 Mcnemar's Test P-Value : There are many information in confusionMatrix function. I can't understand the meaning of No Information Rage and P-Value [Acc > NIR] : 0.369 . Can anyone help me ,please?
