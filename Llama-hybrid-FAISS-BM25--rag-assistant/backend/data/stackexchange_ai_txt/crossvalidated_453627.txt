A solution to de-seasonalizing data? Admission rate to emergency room

I am trying to fit a model for the admission rate to our emergency department by using time series in STATA, which is fairly new to me and I would like to take your input about deseasonalizing. data: datafile The data consists of 2 years of univariate data with weekly seasonality, where Saturdays and Sundays show more admission as seen in the image below. To overcome this 7 day seasonality, first I differenced by 7 and built the model with d=7 . But the residuals failed to show white noise with portmanteau test. SARIMA model with 7 days differencing resulted in the same behavior but I modeled with regression analysis with seasonal dummy variables: d1-d7 for 7 days of week (thanks to Prof Hansen and his lecture ): regress totalhasta d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 L(1/7).VAR_NAME, noconstant The residuals show white noise and model shows better fit with lower AIC and BIC tests compared to other 2 models. So is it a good practice to use dummy variables instead of differencing with the seasonality length, SARIMA models to overcome seasonality?
