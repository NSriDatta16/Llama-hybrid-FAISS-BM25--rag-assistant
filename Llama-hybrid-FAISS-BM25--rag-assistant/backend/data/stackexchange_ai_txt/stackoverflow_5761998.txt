But you need to keep in mind that if you for some reasons want to take this solution to cloud and make it multi tenant then the above configuration might become more challenging. Think about this - you logged into the system and the DB gets selected (DB swap) based on the user- organization table This would be the new Master table that you are talking to now with it's own slaves But the point 2 above also needs sharding now since you want to make sure that your scale out does not become a bottleneck. So now the question is that you will probably need to think how can you do this sharding in a mster-slave kind of env where slaves are typically for reading and masters for writing. cheers ! Gary
