While it may not be appropriate from pure statistical theory, I think there is a pragmatic use for p-values to be employed in such a way. If we are honest, this is how many readers would naturally interpret such p-values anyway as they do describe a magnitude of some description. I have read a number of articles where p-values for a range of analysis have been ranked in some order (often from the most significant to the least). The bigger question is whether p-values are an effective assessment of similarity. This maybe interpreted (or inferred/assumed) as such but in my reading similarity is better assessed using a distance measure and, strictly speaking, p-values are a probability not a distance.
