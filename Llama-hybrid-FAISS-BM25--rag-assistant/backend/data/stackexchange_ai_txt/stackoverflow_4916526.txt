LC-3 .BLKW How it works

Solved! I am writing a program in assembly for LC-3 that is supposed to wait for the user to type all the characters he wants, then print them on the monitor only after he hits enter. I got so far to solve the issue if the user only hits the enter button. Examples: I press enter ---> program behaves as it should. (goes to new line and halts) I press "ABCDEF" ---> program displays "F" instead of going to new line and displaying ABCDEF. Solved .BLKW is supposed to save a block of memory. SO to solve this issue I was supposed to load a .blkw to a register, then store the new letter value into that register and each time update the storage location to move to the next location.
