But the linear trends do not fit the data well. Is that Ok? Yes, that is absolutely fine. No one would seriously expect a simple linear model to fit these time series' well. In other words, the linear trends did not follow the fluctuation in the data. Is that because the focus here is to show the overall trend, which is the increasing one? The lines you fitted show an overall increasing trend, but you can't say much more than that. There is some limited utility in explaining the data within these time ranges. Extrapolation outside the time range would be not be a good idea. If you want better fitting modeld you may need to look at autoregressive models, moving average models and conditional heteroskedasticity models.
