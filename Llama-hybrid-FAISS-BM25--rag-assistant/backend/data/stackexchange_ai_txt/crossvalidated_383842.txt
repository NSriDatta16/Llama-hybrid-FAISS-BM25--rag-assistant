How to perform prediction on a mixed type label (i.e. continuous but optional)

I have a set of simulations in which an event may or may not happen. I recorded the time the event occurs and whether it does. I would like to perform regression on the time variable, including whether the event happens at all. I suppose the easiest approach is to encode the missing value as NaN, but that opens a can of worms. I imagine Linear Regression is out of the question, because there is no way it could generate a NaN. I suppose a Decision Tree would also not work, because when establishing the value of a leaf it would calculate the average, which would be NaN if even one of the values is a NaN. Similar deal with Random Forests. Question: are there techniques to deal with this situation? In particular, I am using Python. Thanks in advance!
