I didn't quite understand your original question, but from your comment above to the answer provided byu @IrishStat ("I am trying to select a 'very independent' subset of my time series variables") I have a feeling that you might want to look at dynamic factor analysis (see this or google "dynamic factor analysis" for many other references. This will not give you a subset of time series, but a reduced dimension set of latent variables that you can then relate to individual time series in a more or less ad-hoc way.
