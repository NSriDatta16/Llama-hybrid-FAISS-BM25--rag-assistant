You want to make sure you're matching the necessary headers. Make the request that you want to emulate with cURL and post the headers here. Use a plugin like HTTPFox on firefox, or similar tools. Then we can see if your query matches the header ANSWER : I looked at the site myself and found that it uses cookies to make sure you're not a simple robot before generating reports. This can be evaded by updating your cURL script to generate the right cookies. There may also be other simple checks that you'd have to bypass (e.g. Referer, User-Agent, etc.), you can do it all with cURL though. However, they probably use this kind of cookie protection because they don't want people scraping their data. If you're going to hack past that restriction you should go through the courtesy of asking the admin permission to download his site. While you're not at legal risk (they have no ToS), it'd be a nice thing to do.
