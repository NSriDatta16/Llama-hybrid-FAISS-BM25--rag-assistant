How do I open links from a TCppWebBrowser component in the systems default browser

We are using a TCppWebBrowser Component in our program as a kind of chatwindow, but since the TCppwebrowser is using the IExplorerengine all links that are clicked is opening in IExplorer. One idea I have is to cancel the navigation in Onbeforenavigate2 an do a Shell.execute, but where hoping for a more elegant solution like a windowsmessage i could handle or an event or something.
