When using “more exact” methods, I.e., methods that form a full likelihood function (generalized least squares, mixed effects models, Markov models, Bayesian models, etc.) the method properly treats varying number of measurements per subject so the only problem you usually have is that there is loss of efficiency when many subjects have few observations. Approximate methods such as GEE (generalized estimating equations) and the cluster bootstrap do not have this advantage since they don’t have a full likelihood that respects the interconnections between observations within subject. They tend to fail with wildly varying cluster sizes, and also with a small number of subjects. They work best with a large number of subjects with not many records per subject.
