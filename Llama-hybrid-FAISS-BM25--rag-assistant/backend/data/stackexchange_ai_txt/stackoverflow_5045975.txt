Maybe Google's coding standard s for Java will be considered authoritative enough: Exceptions All methods must declare the non-runtime-exceptions that they may throw in their throws clause. If they may throw several, all must be listed, though shortening the list by listing base classes instead of all their children is encouraged, provided information is not lost. In particular, 'throws Exception' should never appear on any method, except in extreme cases, such as methods that are so generic that they may in fact throw any exception. Similarly, 'catch (Exception e)' should not be used anywhere, since it may catch exceptions that should not be caught and thus hide problems. The exact exceptions that are being caught should be spelled out instead. For similar reasons, empty catch blocks should be shunned (except in testing code where exceptions are expected), since they may also hide problems and make debugging difficult. If you know that the exception can never happen always raise an OntopiaRuntimeException with a message like '"(IMPOSSIBLE) " + e', and pass in the caught exception to preserve the stack trace.
