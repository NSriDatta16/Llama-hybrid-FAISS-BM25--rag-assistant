How do I insert an element in a .docx file at a specific location using the OpenXML SDK in .NET

Hey guys I am trying to manipulate a word .docx file using the openXML sdk and C#. I can open the file fine and insert paragraphs but I need to insert a paragraph at a specific location in my document(after a certain paragraph in my body). I have not been able to find anything useful online about how to accomplish this. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
