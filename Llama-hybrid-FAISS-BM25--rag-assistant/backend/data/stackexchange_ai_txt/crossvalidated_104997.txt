My advice is first to try at least to search on Internet. The wikipedia page for Multiclass classification explains in clear terms what it means, and it is not hard to find it after a search for "multiclass classification". A multi-class classifier is able to classify into more 2 outcomes (classes). It is a synonym with multinomial classification. Thus, multinomial logistic regression is a multi-class classification. However, multi-label classification it is not. Multi-label classification assumes that one observation can be labeled with (classified as) more than one category/label/class, while multi-class does not (only one class allowed for an instance).
