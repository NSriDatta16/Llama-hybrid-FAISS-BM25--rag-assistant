I can understand your headache (I posted a bug about gwt cookie documentation a while ago: http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=387&can=1 ) Which version of GWT are you using? Which browser did you test in? I just looked at the code for 1.6.4 (they ship the source), and I'd encourage you to file this as a bug. See issue 2994 for something close, but I think this is different enough to warrent its own bug filing. It looks like GWT handles hashmaps in a different manner (for performance reasons?) than regular hashmaps; see java.util.AbstractHashMap in the com/google/gwt/emul directory when you unpack the gwt-user.jar file. Here's the get() impelementation. return (key == null) ? nullSlot : (!(key instanceof String) ? getHashValue( key, getHashCode(key)) : getStringValue((String) key)); And maybe this is the issue. Hope this helps. Dan
