I agree with @rolando2 that the background variable should be included in the model. I'm actually not convinced that the interaction terms need to be. You want to be wary of most attempts to "reduce the number of terms" (see here ), but it is acceptable to conduct an a-priori nested model test. I would test the model with the first-order terms (including fan participation) against the full model with all the first-order terms plus all the two-way interactions you are interested in. You would then stick with the model that's better. It is also true, as you state, that having many predictors (relative to the size of the total data set) increases out of sample error. However, I think you are using the wrong type of model; you actually have more data to fit your parameters than you think. Instead of using the win/loss ratio as your predicted variable, you should use each game (a Bernoulli trial--either a win or a loss) as your response variable. That is, you should be doing logistic regression . Moreover, you need to use a multilevel model , because the games are nested within teams. You will want to explore the generalized estimating equations to fit such a model. My main point here, however, is that you have many more observations to estimate your parameters than you assume, and thus, you are at less risk of overfitting than you fear.
