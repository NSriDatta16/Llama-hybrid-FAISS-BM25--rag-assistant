How can I create a custom tag in JPMML?

I'm trying to create a logistic regression model in jpmml, then write the PMML to a file. The problem I'm having, is that I can't find any way to create a custom tag, such as "shortForm" and "longForm" in the following example: m male f female Here's what I have so far: MapValues mv = new MapValues("output") .withFieldColumnPairs( new FieldColumnPair( new FieldName("gender"), "shortForm" ) ).withInlineTable( new InlineTable().withRows( new Row().with???( new ??? ) ))) In short, I am asking for an API call I can use to instantiate the "shortForm" element in the example, and attach it to the "row" object. I've been all through the API, examples, and Google/SO, and can't find a thing. Thanks for your help!
