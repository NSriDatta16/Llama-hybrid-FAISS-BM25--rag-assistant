Your description is correct. The proper name of the function is logistic function , as "sigmoid" is ambiguous and may be applied to different S-shaped functions. It takes as input some value $x$ on real line $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$ and transforms it to the value in the unit interval $S(x) \in (0, 1)$ . It is commonly used to transform the outputs of the models (logistic regression, neural networks) to probabilities, because probabilities are also bounded to unit interval. It is not the only function that does this, there are many others like probit, or cloglog , but logistic function is the most popular one.
