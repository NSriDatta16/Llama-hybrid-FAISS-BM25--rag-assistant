You should use Quartz . In the quart scheduling xml file you can specify it to build your project. In your project you should have junit test cases execute whenever a build happens. This way you can achieve a daily build process. If your project already utilizes Spring framework then you can use the spring job scheduler helper library too (it's a wrapper around quartz). Ideally you should use hudson to manage the daily builds but I am not sure if your organization utilizes it or not. Hope this helps.
