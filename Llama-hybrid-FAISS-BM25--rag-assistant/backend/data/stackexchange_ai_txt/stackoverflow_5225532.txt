This is quite simple to solve using sfc or a hilbert curve or gray code. Actually a hilbert curve is hamiltonian traversal of a graph and such generate a gray code. U can search the net about gray code and how its used in properly defining sectors on a harddisk. If use the hilbert curve to solve the problem its constraints is that the circle has to cover a plane of power of 2. The othet problem is that it is only an approximaation but a very good one.
