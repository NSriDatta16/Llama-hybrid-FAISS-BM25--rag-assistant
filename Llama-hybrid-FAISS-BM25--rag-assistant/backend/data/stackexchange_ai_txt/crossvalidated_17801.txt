I'm interested in the width of the distribution of $Y_m$. How does its variance scale with the sample size $N$? $\text{var}(X_i^m) = E[X_i^{2m}] - (E[X_i^m])^2$ is easily evaluated from the moment-generating function $\exp(\sigma^2t^2/2 + \mu t)$ of the $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ random variable $X_i$ (or from the characteristic function as suggested in the comment by mpiktas). Since this variance does not depend on $i$, let us denote it by $\text{var}(X^m)$. Then, since the $X_i^m$'s are independent random variables (they are functions of independent random variables), we have $$\text{var}(Y_m) = \text{var}\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i^m\right) = \frac{1}{N^2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \text{var}(X_i^m)\right) = \frac{1}{N}\text{var}(X^m)$$ Note that the displayed equation above does not require that the $X_i$ be normal random variables. For i.i.d. random variables $Z_i$ (with finite second moment), the variance of $N^{-1}\sum_i Z_i$, the average of $N$ variables, is always $N^{-1}\text{var}(Z)$, that is the variance always scales as $1/N$. For general distributions, the Chebyshev inequality can be used to obtain a weak bound on the width of the distribution. See here for a related discussion.
