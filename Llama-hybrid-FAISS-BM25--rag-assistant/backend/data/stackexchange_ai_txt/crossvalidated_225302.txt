You could consider Cook's distance as an aid for your decision. It is a measure for the effect that removing this observation would have on your analysis. Values with a large Cook's distance merit further attention, those that have a small Cook's distance despite being far outside the range of your other observations shouldn't do much harm. As you do not say which statistical software you use, I cannot tell you exactly how to do that. I use R myself, I would look at the fourth graph of the plot of an lm -object: plot(lm.fit, which=4, cook.levels=cutoff) (where lm.fit is an lm -object) My apologies, this suggestion would probably have been better suited for a comment, but I lack the reputation to comment.
