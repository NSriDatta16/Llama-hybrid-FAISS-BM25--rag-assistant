How to cope with missing values in sequential data before applying moving averages (and in general)?

I have a set datasets with sequential measurements. Since the size of these sets is quite big (>80000 measurements) I decided to simplify them by applying a Simple Moving Average (SMA) and selecting the data every n measurements. Each set belongs to a patient and we want to see the effect of a certain lifestyle on the parameter we are measuring, as described in this question . But I have missing values in the sets, therefore SMA cannot be applied. How should I treat the missing values? I thought of two solutions: eliminating the missing values or substitute them with the previous one, based on the assumption that, being biologically linked, a value is not exceptionally different from the precedent. Another solution is to get the missing value by averaging the one before and the one after. So, which solution is better? Do you suggest other solutions?
