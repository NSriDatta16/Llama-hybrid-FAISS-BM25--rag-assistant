How to choose the right variables for the logistic regression in an observational study?

I have read answers to the similar questions here and read other resources but I could not find a solid answer to this point. Sorry for my simple terminology. While analyzing the data from an obervational study that investigates the effect of an independent variable (categorical) on an outcome (categorical), I look at: factors that are different in cases that have independent variable present and not. I start with a table that compares cases for this variable. factors that are different in regard to outcome. For example, my outcome is "mortality" and my independent variable of interest is "diabetes". I also have data on 10 other variables from the study patients. From the 1st analysis above, I get information on how patients with and without diabetes differ: Variables A,B,C,D are different in patients with and without diabetes. From the 2nd analysis on mortality, I find Diabetes and variables, A,C,E,G to differ. Now to remove the effect of confounders and to measure the association of diabetes with mortality, I build a regression model. In this model, should I: include diabetes, variables A, B, C, D, E, G because they have an effect on mortality or having diabetes? include diabetes, A, and C only because A, C are the only common confounders? include diabetes, and A,B,C,D because these are the only variables that effect having diabetes? Thanks for any help.
