Imho, writing python /path/to/script.py Is quite wrong, especially in these days. Which python? python2.6? 2.7? 3.0? 3.1? Most of times you need to specify the python version in shebang tag of python file. I encourage to use #!/usr/bin/env python2 #or python2.6 or python3 or even python3.1 for compatibility. In such case, is much better to have the script executable and invoke it directly: #!/bin/bash /path/to/script.py This way the version of python you need is only written in one file. Most of system these days are having python2 and python3 in the meantime, and it happens that the symlink python points to python3 , while most people expect it pointing to python2 .
