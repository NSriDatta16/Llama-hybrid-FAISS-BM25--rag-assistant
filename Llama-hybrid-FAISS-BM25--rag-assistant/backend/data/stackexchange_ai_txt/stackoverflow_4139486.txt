This SCEA Study Notes explains the JEE differences between tiered and layered architecture Tiers of a Java EE System * Client (GUI and Web): GUI directly interacts with web tier. Web uses browser, applets to interact with web server through HTTP. Responsible for direct presentation and interaction with user. * Web components: processes web requests. Acts as mediator between clients and business components. * Business: (solves domain-specific) business problems. The abstract business logic processing happens in this tier. * Integration and Resource: handles connectivity with data stores and other (legacy) systems. Layers of a Java EE System * Virtual platform (component APIs): used to implement/support business logic. API Components include: JavaBeans, Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages/Faces, Java Message Service API, Java Transaction API, etc. * Application infrastructure (container): responsible for executing the application. Also provides services like: security, transactions, JNDI, and other connectivities. * Enterprise services (OS): responsible for the execution environment of the application infrastructure. Provides computing time and access to (abstract) hardware. * Compute and storage: the hardware or physical server. Provides computing power for the OS. * Networking infrastructure: responsible for networking services.
