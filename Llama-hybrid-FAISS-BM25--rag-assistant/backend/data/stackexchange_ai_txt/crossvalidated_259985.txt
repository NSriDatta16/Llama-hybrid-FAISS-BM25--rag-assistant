A typical machine learning task can be visualized as the following nested loop: while (error in validation set > X) { tune hyper-parameters while (error in training set > Y) { tune parameters } } Typically the outer loop is performed by human , on the validation set , and the inner loop by machine , on the training set . You then need a 3rd test set to assess the final performance of the model. In other words, validation set is the training set for human.
