First, I'm a bit worried about a frailty term having 17000 distinct categorical values when you only have 27860 individuals and 6791 events. At first glance at least, that would seem to make it impossible to get unique estimates for frailties for most of the levels of Area , those that lack an event. It's not clear how much that type of frailty term can help here. A frailty term can help to take unmodeled outcome-associated predictors into account, but with fewer than 2 individuals per Area on average (and less than 1 event per Area ) it's not clear how well that will work with your data. Second, to answer your question, so far as I know the pool() function in the mice package does not pool random effects across the multiple models. Some other packages do that for the Gaussian random effects used in typical mixed models. Those include the merTools and mitml packages; I don't know whether they can handle Cox mixed models directly. It's also not clear that those methods would apply to your default choice of a (skewed) gamma-distributed frailty term. If you used a Gaussian frailty term instead, you might consider using the code in those packages to help you get corresponding random-effect estimates for your coxph() models. Finally, if you're mainly interested in the fixed effects, it might be adequate just to display the list of Variance of random effect values for the models.
