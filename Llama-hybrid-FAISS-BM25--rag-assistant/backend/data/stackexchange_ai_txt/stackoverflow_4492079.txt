How to query a bag with Nhibernate

I need to get publications which the country list doesn't contain a country (research on IsoCode2) The sql query is : select * from pub_head ph where not exists (select 1 from pub_head_forbidden_country phfc , country c where phfc.pub_head_id = ph.pub_head_id and phfc.country_id = c.country_id and c.iso_code2 = 'CA'); And the model : SEQ_PUB_HEAD SEQ_PUB_HEAD_COUNTRY I began with SubQueries, but I didn't success to do it. Thanks
