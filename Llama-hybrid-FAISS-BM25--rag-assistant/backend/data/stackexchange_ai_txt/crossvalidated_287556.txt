MCMC - bayesian analysis for mixed effects 101

I have a dataset for which I need to study both fixed and random effects. And I would love doing it with a LMM or a GLMM, but my data is not normal at all and I cannot transform by any means. So... my only option left is Bayesian statistics (which I know they rock but I don't really understand) My data looks like this d.Treatment d.Meters d.Plot d.percentageLoss 1 Control -5.00 18 77.14286 2 Control 9.55 18 76.30058 3 Control 4.70 18 76.04790 4 Control -5.00 27 81.06509 5 Control 20.00 27 80.58824 6 Control -0.10 18 78.23529 7 Control 20.00 18 77.77778 8 Control 100.00 31 77.57576 9 ControlNM 20.00 37 84.07643 10 ControlNM 0.00 37 84.66258 11 ControlNM 50.00 38 85.23490 12 ControlNM 50.00 37 83.13953 13 ControlNM 20.00 40 83.13953 14 ControlNM -5.00 39 84.21053 15 ControlNM 0.00 39 90.41916 16 ControlNM 20.00 39 84.93976 17 ControlNM 0.00 40 85.54217 18 ControlNM 5.00 38 82.69231 19 ControlNM -5.00 38 85.29412 20 ControlNM 1.00 38 82.68156 21 ControlNM 1.00 40 81.33333 22 ControlNM 1.00 37 83.88889 23 ControlNM 5.00 37 82.60870 24 ControlNM 20.00 38 85.71429 25 ControlNM 1.00 39 80.66667 26 ControlNM -5.00 37 83.33333 27 Mu 3.55 25 76.81159 28 Mu 5.90 20 75.14793 29 Mu -0.10 25 77.71429 30 Mu 9.55 29 76.51007 31 Mu 4.70 25 82.60870 32 Mu 2.90 20 76.92308 33 Mu 3.55 24 77.30496 34 Mu 3.55 20 80.35714 35 Mu 0.55 24 68.15287 36 Mu 8.90 29 78.53107 37 Mu 8.90 25 77.05882 38 Mu 1.70 24 74.85714 39 Mu -5.00 29 82.87293 40 Mu 1.70 29 77.10843... So I want to know how much percentageLoss is affected by treatment + distance (fixed effects) with plot as a random effect. For a GLMM it looks as follows percentageLoss ~ Meters + Treatment + (1 | Plot) I would run this on R and of course I'm not asking you to do it for me, but I have read two extensive tutorials so far and it feels like they're in chinese. Could you please explain me how the bayesian MCMC works in this case, which priors I need to assume and why (how do I pick my priors if I have no information on similar data) and also what would the posterior mean. I know it's a lot to ask for but there is not a single "guide for dummies" (statistiscally challenged students) on the topic... Any literature or similar R codes would already be of great help.
