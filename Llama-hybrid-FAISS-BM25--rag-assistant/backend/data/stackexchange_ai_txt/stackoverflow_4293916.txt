The error message you are getting is caused by you confusing an NSData instance for an UIImage instance. Like NSString, NSArray and similar core classes, NSData is a class cluster instead of single class. NSConcreteMutableData is one of the classes in the cluster. Your problem arises because you are trying to send the message CGImage to an NSData instance which of course does not have a CGImage method. Since you have to use a value transformer to store an image in a Core Data attribute, I would suggest looking at you value transformer and/or the method where you assign the image. Looking at your code, I suspect you have the Person.originalImage set as a transformable attribute but you attempt to assign an NSData object to it. When the value transformer attempts to transform the NSData instance while thinking it is UIImage, it generates the error.
