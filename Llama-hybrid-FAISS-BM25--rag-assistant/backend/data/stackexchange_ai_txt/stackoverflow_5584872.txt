Complex conditions check in Makefile

In my Makefile I would like to check the following complex condition: ifdef VAR1 || VAR2 || VAR3 action endif however the documentation says the syntax like that is not supported. So the only simple workaround that came to my mind is to use the concatenation: ifneq ($(VAR1)$(VAR2)$(VAR3),) action endif Are there any other more correct solutions? For the following case: ifdef VAR1 && VAR2 && VAR3 action endif one need to write ifdef VAR1 ifdef VAR2 ifdef VAR3 action endif endif endif which is also ugly. Are there more elegant alternatives?
