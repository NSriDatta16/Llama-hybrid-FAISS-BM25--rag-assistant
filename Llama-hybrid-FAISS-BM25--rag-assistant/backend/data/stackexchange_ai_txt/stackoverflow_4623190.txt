red5 mac osx installation

I want to install red5 on my mac osx, but after draggning the red5 dmg file to Apllications, it doesnt create any folders there, like installation guide implies, only copies the red5 application. I look on the internet for any more detailed guides, but I could not find anything. Can you refer me to some documentation on this or tell me how to correct install it on mac?
