Processing files with C# in folders whose names contain spaces

There are plenty of C# samples that show how to manipulate files and directories but they inevitably use folder paths that contain no spaces. In the real world I need to be able to process files in folders with names that contain spaces. I have written the code below which shows how I have solved the problem. However it doesn't seem to be very elegant and I wonder if anyone has a better way. class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var dirPath = @args[0] + "\\"; string[] myFiles = Directory.GetFiles(dirPath, "*txt"); foreach (var oldFile in myFiles) { string newFile = dirPath + "New " + Path.GetFileName(oldFile); File.Move(oldFile, newFile); } Console.ReadKey(); } } Regards, Nigel Ainscoe
