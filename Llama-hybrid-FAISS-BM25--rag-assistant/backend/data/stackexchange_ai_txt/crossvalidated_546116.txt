R Caret - Random Forest with repeated CV

I am currently struggling to explain the combination of bagging and cross-validation. I am aware of what each does separately but I have difficulties to explain how they are combined (if at all). For example, if you train a model: myTrainingControl If you specify a model this way are the trees build based on the bootstrapped samples (In-bag part)? Or a combination of bootstrapping and cross-validation or are they just used at different stages? I am a little bit lost here and could not find any explanation in the caret documentation.
