Change height of GridSplitter preview

I have a WPF GridSplitter with a controltemplate being applied to add grips and buttons. The height is set to 20px. When I drag the splitter to resize my grid the preview is also 20px. I'd like to change the height of the preview while it's being dragged. Is there a simple way to accomplish this?
