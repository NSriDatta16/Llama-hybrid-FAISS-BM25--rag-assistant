Another great idea is to embed a scripting language. Then your program can be controlled by a script, and you get all the logic, branching, etc from the scripting language "for free." There are many choices of what you can embed. Lua is one of the most popular and intended for just that purpose and is an excellent choice. However, for a general purpose app, I'd take a hard look at embedding Python. Python is so popular, you'd have a larger group of people willing to take the effort to write a script for your app.
