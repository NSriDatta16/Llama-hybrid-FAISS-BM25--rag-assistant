Meta-learning , also known as "learning to learn", is a subset of machine learning It is used to improve the results and performance of a learning algorithm by changing some aspects of the learning algorithm based on experiment results. Meta-learning helps researchers understand which algorithm(s) generate the best/better predictions from datasets. Meta-learning algorithms use metadata of learning algorithms as input. Then, they make predictions and provide information about the performance of these learning algorithms as output. From What Is Meta-Learning in Machine Learning? More generally, meta-models for supervised learning are almost always ensemble learning algorithms , and any ensemble learning algorithm that uses another model to combine the predictions from ensemble members may be referred to as a meta-learning algorithm .
