R - show movement of points

Suppose I have data of the following form t1 = data.frame(a=c(2,3,3,1,5),b=c(6,4,5,2,1)) t2 = data.frame(a=c(3,4,4,1,8),b=c(5,5,5,3,3)) If you consider plot(t1$a,t1$b) and plot(t2$a,t2$b) , you can imagine that the second plot is produced by taking every point on the first plot and moving it to its new location in the second plot. I'd like some nice way of visualizing this. One way I thought of was to represent each t1 (a,b) as a vector reaching to its corresponding t2 (a,b) point, and then plotting a bunch of vectors, sort of like what I used to do in differential equations (I'm forgetting the technical name for this type of plot). Basically, it would be a plot of a bunch of little arrows that originate from each t1 (a,b) and point to each t2 (a,b) , respectively. Any ideas of how to do this in R , or any other ideas for visualizing and looking at how each dot moves. NOTE: in the real version of what I hope to accomplish, I have lots of data, maybe 200 points, and I'm trying to show that in general, points are moving towards smaller a values and smaller b values from t1 to t2 . But I really want to show this some other way besides something like a histogram of the difference between t2 and t1 average of a and b .
