What is a good read model for an ASP.NET MVC app using CQRS?

I am looking to develop an ASP.NET MVC app, which should have the capability to be run on Azure in the future. The app will be using the CQRS design pattern, which I am rather new to. The write model will use NHibernate with mappings. I am not sure what kind of database to use for the read model. The read model should have the following properties: It doesn't need to be SQL based, but could be. NHibernate could be used there as well to create simple view model -> table type of mappings, with no foreign keys. SQL CE or SQLite in memory database could be used as the data provider. This also gives a little bit more flexibility when it comes to querying the data. It could simply be an object serialized / deserializer which stores the view model objects as they are. It should make this easy to use and could utilize things like Azure Blob storage in the future. Are there any good frameworks that handle this in a good way? I would love to get some feedback from some people who have built this kind of applications before.
