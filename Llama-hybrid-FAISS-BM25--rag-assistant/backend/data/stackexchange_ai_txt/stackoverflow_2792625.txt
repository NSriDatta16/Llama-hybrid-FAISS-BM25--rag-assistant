The simplest answer is probably going to be building it against winelib . The best solution, although much more work, is to put #ifdef WIN32 blocks around all the windows specific stuff, and similarly #ifdef LINUX around the linux implementations of the same functionality. That might require a great deal of reorganisation and refactoring.
