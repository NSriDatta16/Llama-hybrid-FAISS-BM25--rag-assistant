Proper way to structure classes in Xcode framework

I'm building a custom Xcode framework, and I have a class called AXController that has a class method called showActivationWindow . showActivationWindow initializes and shows a window using AXWindowController which is a subclass of NSWindowController . Then, AXWindowController calls activate which is a class method in AXController on a button press in the window it displays. I included AXWindowController.h in AXController.h and included AXController.h in AXWindowController.h so each could access the other's methods, but this is throwing a lot of Xcode warnings. It also seems like a very inelegant solution. What is the correct way to solve this problem?
