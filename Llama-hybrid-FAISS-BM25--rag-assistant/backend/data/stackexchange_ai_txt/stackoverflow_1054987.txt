How do automated recommendation algorithms usually work?

I just read how team BellKorâ€™s Pragmatic Chaos is winning the Netflix Challenge on Wired, and I'm curious about how this kind of algorithms usually work. I know team Bellkor's solution must be an innovative one on the field.. but how does the field usually work? Is it just a really detailed database with Markov chains being run over again and again or what?
