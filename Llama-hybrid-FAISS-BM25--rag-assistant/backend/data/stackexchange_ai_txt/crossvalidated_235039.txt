statsmodels: clarification on VAR(p) results attribute, results.forecast_interval()

I am trying to look for the upper and lower limits of my time series data, and follow the instructions from statsmodels to use the VAR(p) Below is my code model = tsa.VAR(data) results = model.fit(maxlags=13, ic='aic') results.forecast_interval(results.y, steps=2) Below is results from the third line of code above (I used 3 features hence the 3 columns) (array([[ 0.38247778, 0.85441826, 0.09361418], [ 0.35598097, 0.93346637, 0.09222475]]), array([[ 0.25124841, -0.1505907 , 0.0761289 ], [ 0.21548388, -0.0815039 , 0.07375073]]), array([[ 0.51370715, 1.85942722, 0.11109945], [ 0.49647805, 1.94843664, 0.11069876]])) There's not much explanation on what those numbers mean other than what the website says VARResults.forecast_interval(y, steps, alpha=0.05) Construct forecast interval estimates assuming the y are Gaussian Returns: (lower, mid, upper) : (ndarray, ndarray, ndarray) Do the lower , mid , upper mean lower limit, mean and upper limit respectively? If not, does anyone know if there's an attribute to find the upper and lower limit or the standard deviation?
