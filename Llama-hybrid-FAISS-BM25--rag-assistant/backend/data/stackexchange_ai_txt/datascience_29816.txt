What are the practical applications of inverse reinforcement learning?

Inverse reinforcement learning is about using expert trajectories to learn a reward function. Now the most successful method is Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning . But in that, you need a model-based reinforcement learning. But most of the practical world problems are model-free which is hard to calculate the state transition probabilities. So how can we use this inverse reinforcement learning in real-world problems?
