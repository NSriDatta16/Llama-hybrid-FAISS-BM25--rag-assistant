I actually fixed my own problem here's the solution. stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, fl_Drag); function fl_Drag(event:MouseEvent):void { if(isDraging == true) { if(SearchBarSlider.x - (SearchBar.x + 3) = 20 && SearchBarSlider.x - SearchBar.x + 3 The problem was that when the gotoAndStop event accured at frame 1 the whole program restarted because at frame 1 the actions layer reinitiates the code. So the drag that was busy got ended. With the new piece of code the searchbar won't execute gotoAndStop(1);
