Is storing config variables in an XML file on a PHP site under the site root too risky?

I've noticed that Magento stores MySQL connection details in an XML file which isn't secured above the docroot. This seems.... well dangerous. XML seems like a handy way to store config data, except for one thing, typing in http://www.domain.com.au/library/config.xml will show the world your private details! I went ahead and used an XMl file and added this to my .htaccess file. // regex files that end with xml extension Order allow,deny Deny from all // don't show them Now I was happy with this, now I'm not too sure. What if the .htaccess file is accidentally deleted/corrupted (does that happen besides human error) and what if one day I want to place the app on a non apache server... does every server have the equivalent to block XML files, and if they do, can they be altered on a folder level like the .htaccess can (and not just a httpd.conf file). My question is... does the convenience of XML (easy to update, designers who need to tinker won't feel so intimidated) outweigh the potential problems (exposing private data)?
