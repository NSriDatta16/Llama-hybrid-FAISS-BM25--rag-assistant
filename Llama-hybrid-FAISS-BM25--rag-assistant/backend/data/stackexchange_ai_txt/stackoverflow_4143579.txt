Easy way to change value of boolean

I often have inverse logic between my forms and data. I am looking for the easiest (most elegant) way to change some boolean from true to false and vice versa. I know that a lot of people will get angry if they see code like this: if (c) { return false; } else { return true; } Or something like this: EDIT: I am sorry, my code sample is not good. How do I find the inverse value of a boolean in a more elegant way? myMethod(!op.checkBoxSamoSaKol.Checked) // Is this possibile
