Retain Arraylist values when form closed and reload

I have a List and I want to keep all the list values when the form closed and reload the list when the form is open the next time? Where can I save my List<> ? It's a mobile phone app. UPDATE 1: Using XMLSerializer XmlSerializer myXmlSerial = new XmlSerializer(typeof(List )); StreamWriter myWrite = new StreamWriter("/Storage Card/mydefault.xml"); myXmlSerial.Serialize(myWrite, ItemArr); Exception "Error when generating XML file" happen at line myXmlSerial.Serialize(myWrite, ItemArr)
