Employers most likely stick to hiring people who are knowledgeable of agile, rather than not, because agile methodologies require that almost every team member know about the processes required by each agile methodology (SCRUM, Crystal, XP). For example, SCRUM requires that all team members, including management, understand and follow the concept of self-organization. They’ll need to understand that they won’t be dictated on their current performance: They need to instead address their issues openly (or what typically happens at the daily SCRUM). If you put someone on the team who does not know agile, they may immediately assume that since this methodology has low documentation, they can run in and code-and-fix to build a project. However, agile methodologies are process-heavy, rather than documentation-heavy.
