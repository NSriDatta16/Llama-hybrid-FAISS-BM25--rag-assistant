Focusing on Phase 3 studies only: SAPs are submitted to regulatory authorities along with the the protocol, informed consent documents, letters of intent, etc. etc. etc. for approval prior to the first patient initiated. The regulatory authorities may reject the submission if the SAP is not clearly aligned with the objectives. SAPs may be made publicly available after the database lock or publication of top-line results. There are many examples on clinicaltrials.gov. When submitting the CSR for regulatory approval by the respective agencies in accord with the ICH E9 guidance, the SAP is a controlled document meaning the cumulative revision history and the timeline are kept, and should match with the protocol. You cannot modify the SAP after database lock (OK you can but it's 99.9% likely to result in a rejection). If any aspect of the CSR is not in alignment with the SAP it is a major finding. It makes sense that the number of examples are relatively few. The authorities are hesitant to mandate that SAPs (or protocols even) are made publicly available. This is because the authorities are perceived as an immense hurdle in the drug approval process - a necessary one at that. I believe the authorities feel that if "successful" (meaning led to approval) study examples were too widely circulated, others would so closely copy the template they would fail to ever present or challenge new ideas, even when necessary. Indeed, you often hear that the FDA "won't approve a drug without a blinded controlled study" or "hates R and loves SAS" or "doesn't approve Bayesian trial designs but only frequentist". The opposite is true. But these new ideas need to be defensible to a number of highly experienced, cross-functional, and educated agents.
