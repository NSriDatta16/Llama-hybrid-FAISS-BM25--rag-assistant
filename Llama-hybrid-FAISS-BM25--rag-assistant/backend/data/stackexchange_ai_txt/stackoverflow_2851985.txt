There's a number of things you could do. Picking up a good winforms book isn't a terribly bad idea (an amazon.com search for winforms brings up a plethora). For online info, the Getting Started page of windowsclient.net is a good launchpad to get you started. It's also common that companies will use specific toolsets (ie. DevExpress, Infragistics, etc.) so poking through their docs if you're using any of those is a must. Otherwise, practice. Re-implement UI functionality that you've done in an ASP.NET project as a winforms app and maybe try to extend it. Or mimic the UI of a program you use already. As to the last part of your question: Pretty much any windows program that has a UI can be implemented in winforms (unless it uses WPF specific functionality) so you've likely already used many winforms apps.
