I'm not really sure what you're trying to achieve here. The forecast at h=144 is just a point estimate whereas the MAPE is a measure of average accuracy over a selection of point forecasts. As in your case, the sequence of point forcasts from h=1 to h=576*3 is used to calculate the MAPE in your current example. If you want to evaluate the accuracy of your 6-hour ahead forecast, why not just look at the forecast error? I.e. $\hat{e}_{T+h}=\hat{y}_{T+h | T}-y_{T+h}$ EDIT: Added a rough outline to a solution of what I think is your problem. You mention calculating the "average" for h=144 but the average is equal to the point estimate because you only have one forecast at this particular horizon. library(forecast) pv_data = read.csv("data.csv", header=FALSE) pv_ts
