When you train a CNN on rural area #1 dataset, I am assuming you have a fully connected(FC) layer towards the end. When you transfer the weights to the new network the best way to do would be to assign all the weights except for that of dense layer. The FC layer of the previously trained network with n fully connected nodes would have a weight matrix of size [m X n] . This layer will expect the input to it to be of size m . However due to the change in image size you will end up with a different value for m when you feed the image from the new dataset(convolution fiter convolving on a different image size). So you have a couple of options here: As Sid mentioned, you can resize the new image into the same dimension as the other dataset provided you do not have any scale relevant features in the data. Remove the fully connected layers of the trained model and keep the conv-pooling layers. Add a new dense layer, keeping the conv-pooling layer weights fixed, learn the weights for the FC layer on the new data. If you do not have an FC layer, it should be invariant of the input image dimension. b) To answer your second question, in a way you are doing transfer learning as you are transferring the model trained for a different classification problem. You would do fine tuning by training the last few layers of this loaded model.
