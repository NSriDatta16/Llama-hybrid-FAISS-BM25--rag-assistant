Note that at each observation position ($i=1, 2, ..., n$) we can choose any of the $n$ observations, so there are $n^n$ possible resamples (keeping the order in which they are drawn) of which $n!$ are the "same sample" (i.e. contain all $n$ original observations with no repeats; this accounts for all the ways of ordering the sample we started with). For example, with three observations, a,b and c, you have 27 possible samples: aaa aab aac aba abb abc aca acb acc baa bab bac bba bbb bbc bca bcb bcc caa cab cac cba cbb cbc cca ccb ccc Six of those contain one each of a, b and c. So $n!/n^n$ is the probability of getting the original sample back. Aside - a quick approximation of the probability: Consider that : $${\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\pi }}\ n^{n+{\frac {1}{2}}}e^{-n}\leq n!\leq e\ n^{n+{\frac {1}{2}}}e^{-n}}$$ so $${\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\pi }}\ n^{{\frac {1}{2}}}e^{-n}\leq n!/n^n \leq e\ n^{{\frac {1}{2}}}e^{-n}}$$ With the lower bound being the usual one given for the Stirling approximation (which has low relative error for large $n$). [Gosper has suggested using $n! \approx \sqrt{(2n+\frac13)\,\pi}n^ne^{-n}$ which would yield the approximation $\sqrt{(2n+\frac13)\pi}\,e^{-n}$ for this probability, which works reasonably well down to $n=3$, or even down to $n=1$ depending on how stringent your criteria are.] (Response to comment:) The probability of not getting a particular observation in a given resample is $(1-\frac{1}{n})^n$ which for large $n$ is approximately $e^{-1}$. For details see Why on average does each bootstrap sample contain roughly two thirds of observations?
