Help with SQL Grouping

A partial fragment of my output looks as follows: CNEP P000000025 1 CNEP P000000029 1 NONMAT P000000029 1 CNEP P000000030 1 CWHCNP P000000030 1 MSN P000000030 1 Each row represents a term that a student is in a particular curriculum. Right now I am grouping the information to make sure that each UserID correlates to a partcular curriculum only once. Notice how " P000000029 " and " P000000030 " have multiple entries. I would like to be able to show only those students who have multiple curriculum types within the system.
