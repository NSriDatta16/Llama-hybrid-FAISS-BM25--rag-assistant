It is difficult to see what the problem is when we can't compile your example. Looking through the code you provided, a table may not actually be appropriate in this situation. Instead, you might try something like the following: \documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article} \begin{document} \subsection{Administrator Starts Server} \paragraph{Description:} This describes the process of the adminsitrator starting the server. \paragraph{Actors:} Administrator \paragraph{Preconditions:} Server is not running. \paragraph{Sequence:} \begin{enumerate} \item Administrator boots up hardware \item Administrator starts Administrator console \item Administrator logins into Administrator account with the corresponding password \item Administrator clicks start \end{enumerate} \end{document} In the example you provided, I don't see that you ever put any text in the "Traceability" column. To mimic this column, you could either use \marginpar{my text} to put text in the margin, or you could use blahblah\hfill{}my text to right-align text on the same line as "blahblah". If you want the traceability text to be right-aligned and on its own line, use \begin{flushright} my text \end{flushright} . If this doesn't help solve your problem, please provide us with a minimal example that compiles and demonstrates the problem.
