What are weights in a binary glm and how to calculate them?

I have a dataset that includes four variables. Three of them are factors and one is constant. My response variable contains (0,1) so my glm is about logistic regression. My question is, how do I know whether I should include weights as a parameter in my glm() function call in R and if so, then how do I calculate them? I'm a bit confused.
