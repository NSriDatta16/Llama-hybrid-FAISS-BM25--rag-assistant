Your database doesn't appear to be normalized correctly. Your AB table should have a single A_id and a single B_id in each of its rows. If that were the case, your OR -version should work (although I would use IN myself). Ignore the preceding paragraph. From your edit, you really wanted to know all the B 's that have all of a subset of A 's in the many-to-many table - see below for the query. Please tell us the actual schema details, it's a little hard to figure out what you want without that. I'd expect to see something like: table a: a_id integer a_payload varchar(20) table b: b_id integer b_payload varchar(20) table ab: a_id integer b_id integer Based on your description, the only thing I can think of is that you want a list of all the B 's that have all of a set of A 's in the AB table. In which case, you're looking at something like (to get the list of B 's that have A 's of 1, 3 and 4): select distinct b_id from ab n1 where exists (select b_id from ab where a_id = 1 and b_id = n1.b_id) and exists (select b_id from ab where a_id = 3 and b_id = n1.b_id) and exists (select b_id from ab where a_id = 4 and b_id = n1.b_id); This works in DB2 but I'm not sure how much of SQL your chosen server implements.
