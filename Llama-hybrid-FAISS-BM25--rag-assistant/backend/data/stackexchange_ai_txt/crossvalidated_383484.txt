Often one needs to incorporate seasonal dummies as suggested by If I am convinced that a series is mostly trend+season, what is it I should check about the residuals? http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey.tsay/teaching/uts/lec10-08.pdf Forecasting weekly demand: based on ACF and PACF, is ARIMA appropriate? If you post your data or load it to dropbox , I will try and help further. AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: You sent 384 monthly values for two time series. Here is the plot of the dependent series NVDI . The general approach is called ARMAX modelling There are a number of issues to be identified via analytics: Is there seasonality (annual repetitive feaures) and if so is the seasonal structure autoregressive (SARIMA)or seasonally deterministic ( i.e the need for seasonal dummies ) What differencing or de-meaning is necessary 3.) what is the form of the ARIMA structure 4) Are there unuusal values that need to be dealt with ( THE I'S) 5) Is there evidence of non-constant error variance or non-constant parameters over time in the residuals ( THE A'S ) 6) What is the form of the relationship ( THE X'S ) Using AUTOBOX (a time series package that I have helped to develop ) I obtained answers to these questions in the form of a model that only contained statistically significant parameters and generated a plausible model. The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here and a less busy Actual and Forecast graph here The residuals appear to be quite free of structure with ACF here ( suggesting a possible need for a slight MA(12) modification to the noise process) . The forecasts for the next 36 period are presented here The final model is developed through a sequence of interim models much like peeling an onion where model diagnostics ( tests of sufficiency and necessity ) are used to ultimately separate signal and noise . The Actual and Cleansed graph is informative about the identified anomalies In summary your attempt to limit your seasonal component to memory is at the root cause of your modelling worries.
