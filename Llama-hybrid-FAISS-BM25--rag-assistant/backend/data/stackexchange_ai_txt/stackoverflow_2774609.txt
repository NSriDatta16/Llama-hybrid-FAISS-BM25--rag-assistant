Visual Studio (2005 & 2008) Compile Completed Alert?

Does anyone know of any kind of plugin or alert system which will let me know when my compiles are completed? Some of the solutions I work with are gigantic and sometimes the compiles can take 5-20 minutes (depending on the PC). Thus I would like to do something else in the meantime, but I don't want to keep checking back to see if the compile is done. Is there any way to have a windows alert, or flash the screen when the compile is done? It would let me browse the internet whilst waiting for the compile to finish without worrying that its been complete and I'm just wasting time.
