Approaches for matching leads to salesmen

I'm starting to tackle a new problem where we are trying to optimally match new leads (perspective customers) for our product to our sales representatives in the hopes of improving bottom-line metrics like conversion rate, average sale price, etc. We have a bunch of data from the leads when they fill out their info on web forms and from 3rd party data providers we use to enrich the core web form data (we try and pull their soft credit score, income, etc. based on the info they provide, this is all automated). On the salesman side, we don't have nearly as much data on them (mainly just who they are and their sales performance history). I suppose we could actually run them through our data enrichment service to pull additional info on them though. My question is simply: from an ML perspective what, would be the best way to structure this problem? I was thinking of just building models for each salesman and assigning the lead to the salesman with the highest predicted score (e.g. for conversion) but this seems a bit crude. I was also considering recommender systems given the matching nature of the problem but my background is more in traditional ML so not sure what subtype would be best to start with (content-based, collaborative, etc.). Any input is greatly appreciated.
