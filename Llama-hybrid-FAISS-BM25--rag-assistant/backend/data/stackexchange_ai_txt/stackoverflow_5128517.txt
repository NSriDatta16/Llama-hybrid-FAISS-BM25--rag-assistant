Adding to what ilcavero suggested, in our organization we have created a few smaller, standalone apps focused on specific functionality. These are built in .NET and consume Maximo web services. Typically we have built 'query' type web services for populating drop down lists and form validation, then we have 'Notify' services to update the system. You could probably also use some .NET to Java bridge and make RMI calls which may make it easier to access more of the native Maximo functionality.
