Is it possible to compare continuous vs. dichotomous decisions in a meaningful way, that doesn't come down to different kinds of analyses?

I'm interested in finding out how the factors that contribute to a person's decision change when they are making a continuous vs. a dichotomous choice. However, I'm concerned that these two types of decisions produce different types of data. Thus, would it be possible to make any conclusions about different decision processes taking place, without the concern that observed differences are just a product of linear vs. logistic regression? To provide a bit more info, people would be making decisions about stimuli. I would be interested in how properties of the stimuli affect ratings differently than binary choices.
