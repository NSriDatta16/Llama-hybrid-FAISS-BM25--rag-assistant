I'd say that it's extremely unlikely that it makes any real-world difference. In theory, yes, there's one fewer check required (because div#foo really does need to be a div to match the selector, according to the spec ). But the odds of it making any real difference in a real-world browser app? Near zero. That said, I always cringe when I see things like div#foo in HTML applications. HTML has only one ID-type attribute ( id ), so there's no need for the further qualification. You make the CSS selector engine (either the browser's or jQuery's) work harder to figure out what you mean, you make the selector fragile (if the div becomes a footer , for instance), etc., and of course you do leave yourself open to a stoopid selector implementation that fails to recognize that it can look something up by ID and then check to see if it's a div and so goes looking through all the div s. (Does such an implementation exist? Possibly, you never know.) Barring some edge cases, it always makes me think someone doesn't quite know what they're doing. So for me, speed isn't the main argument. Pointlessness is. ;-)
