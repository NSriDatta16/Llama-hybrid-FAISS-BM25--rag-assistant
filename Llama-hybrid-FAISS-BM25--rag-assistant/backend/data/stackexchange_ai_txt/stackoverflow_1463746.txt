I've been able to get it to work, by way of adding ActionController::Base.expire_page(app.link_path(:md5 => @link.md5)) to the method in the Model itself that's updating the database. This feels somewhat hacky, though, and I'd love to know if anyone can explain why it's not working with the normal sweeper setup, and if there's a more elegant way to handle this. That snippet of code (apart from customizations I put in for my own app) came from this post on ruby-forum.com .
