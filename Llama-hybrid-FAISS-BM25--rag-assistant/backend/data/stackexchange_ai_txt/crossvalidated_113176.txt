Difference between imputation and forecast

what is the difference between imputation and forecasting? All i know, forecasting is the term used in time series analysis, which means predicting the future value by considering the trend of the historical data. Imputation is a strategy for completing data. I've thought some answers to my own question. But so far, these are what i got: forecasting is done by considering the trend of the historical data, while imputation sees the data (each of the observation) as random variable, so we should consider the distribution of the history. The term forecasting used for predicting the future value, while imputation used for predicting the missing value. forecasting procedure will never be related to unknown data (in this case, any value that hasn't been observed) , while imputation procedure might depends on the unknown data (in this case, unobserved data) (informative drop out).
