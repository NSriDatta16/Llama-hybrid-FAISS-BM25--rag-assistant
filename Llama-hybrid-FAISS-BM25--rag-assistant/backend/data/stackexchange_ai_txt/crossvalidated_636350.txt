What are the implications on prediction if a regression model with heteoscedastic errors is considered for analysis?

I have a simple linear regression model, and I tried validating if the model fit for purposes. One of the tests is Bruesch Pagan test on the residuals but the result of the test shows that the error term is heteroscedastic, if I continue using this model, what would be the implication to my prediction?
