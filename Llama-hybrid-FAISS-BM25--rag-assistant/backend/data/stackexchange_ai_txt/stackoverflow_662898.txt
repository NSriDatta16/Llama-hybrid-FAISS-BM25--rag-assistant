What to do with multiple projects depending on the same source?

This is something I've come across twice in the past month and I'm not even certain how to phrase this as a Google query. I'm actually using SVN for all of this, but it seems like this should be a general versioning problem. We have two projects and one of them is dependent on some of the other's code. Due to API issues, it is not pragmatic to have some form of linkage between the products (and I don't want to have to configure all of the non-coders' machines to make this work). I would imagine that if I put a copy of the shared code into the directory structure, I will end up overwriting all of the config files that SVN uses. This would mean that the version in the dependent project's directories would no longer be able to update. Ex: Project #1 needs to use the class MyExampleClass, however, MyExampleClass is something which is defined as a part of and needed by Project #2.
