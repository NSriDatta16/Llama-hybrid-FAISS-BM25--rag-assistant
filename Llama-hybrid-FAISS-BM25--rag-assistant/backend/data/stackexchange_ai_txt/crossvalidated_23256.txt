If you know nothing about director N (ie whether they make similar movies to director G) it would seem to me that your best chance would be to substitute for factor(director) in your linear predictor the "average" value of the director coefficients. This would require estimating who the average director is and using them instead of DN. Alternatively, you could fit the model without the factor(director) as an explanatory variable at all. If the purpose is to predict a value based on a certain set of explanatory variables, there's not good including in the model something that isn't going to be available to the predictor. A final comment, not really part of the "answer" to your question - it seems likely that the variables liked_by_user_2 ... liked_by_user_k will be highly collinear. Collinearity can play havoc with predictive models; one reason why parsimonious models are generally preferred for predictve purposes. Whether this is a problem for you (and what should be done about it) depends on how big k is compared to your sample size.
