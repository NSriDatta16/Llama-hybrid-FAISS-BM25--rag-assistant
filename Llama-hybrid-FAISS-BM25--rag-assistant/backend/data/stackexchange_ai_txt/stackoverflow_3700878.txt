If you are allocating very large arrays repeatedly, you may be running into Large Object Heap Fragmentation . If this is the case, you may need to consider whether you can reuse work arrays to prevent the re-allocations and subsequent fragmentation. I definitely recommend running a memory profiler, however, as it's more likely that you have something lingering in memory past what you assumed was its expiration date.
