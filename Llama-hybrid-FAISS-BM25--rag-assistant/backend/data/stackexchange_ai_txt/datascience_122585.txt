ML regression for skewed data

I'm trying to build a simple regression model to start with but my Y variable is very skewed to the right. My Y represents the number of views per day for a webpage and all the values are above 0. I have 4 big outliers with values over 1000 but there are still many with values over 50 that are skewing the distribution. I'm not quite sure how to approach this, should I remove all the outliers (a lot of data), do some normalization and use linear regression to start with? Should I not normalize but use some other kind of regression like Tobit for skewed data (I haven't seen it much used in machine learning but I'm a novice). I'm a bit reluctatnt to remove data with many views per day because it may carry some useful information... Any guidance will be appreciated, I'm attaching a histogram where I already removed a lot of data on the right sight because otherwise you can't really see the distribution. My predictor variable will be text (probably treated with BERT embeddings). EDIT: I'm also attaching a histogram I got after removing a big chunk of data on the right and using the squaring transformation. It's still pretty skewed so I guess one of the non-linear models is the way to go : no_outliers_df = data[data['views_per_day']
