For this situation, I'd recommend you separate your Model from your ViewModel. The ViewModel is a data representation (including bindable properties) specifically designed for your UI. The Model is the "pure" data representation, specifically designed for modelling your domain and for persistance (either directly to IsolatedStorage or perhaps persisted via a web service) So, my recommendation is that you build some ViewModel classes for your UI to bind to - and then work out how these ViewModels interact with the Model. As an aside, I'd also be cautious about using the XSD generated classes within Windows Phone 7 - WP7 seems to prefer the XDocument Linq XML classes, rather than the XmlDocument XML classes (but I may have this wrong!)
