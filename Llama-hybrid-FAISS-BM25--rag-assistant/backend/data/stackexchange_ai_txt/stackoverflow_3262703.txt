Maby this is a little off topic but you can try using PCA http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset. There should be plenty of PCA modules designed for numPy ( for example: http://folk.uio.no/henninri/pca_module/ ). The method is rather simple and with a ready to use modules it will be a snap. Basicly what it does is reduce the number of dimensions ( you should be able to specify desired number) by maximizing variance within the given number of dimensions.
