Does a time series start at $t=0$?

I am a beginner in Time Series Analysis and I am reading something about the most simple processes like AR and MA. So far I understood that one wants to have the following result: The MA($\infty$)-process is weakly stable if the absolute sum of the coefficients is convergent. The definition for the MA($\infty$) process is $$X_t = p(L)Z_t$$ where $p(z) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i z^i$ is a (formal) power series in $L$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^\infty |a_i| Now people make a great mystery out of the fact whether or not their time series starts at $t=0$ (i.e. the index set is $\mathbb{N}_0$) or whether the index set is $\mathbb{Z}$. Let us assume that the index set is $\mathbb{Z}$ then I understand (up to questions of convergence but this seems ok as $\sum|a_i| $$\text{Var}(X_t) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i^2 \text{Var}(Z_{t-i}) = \sigma \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i^2$$ However, if the process starts at $t=0$ (i.e. $Z_t = 0$ for $t $$\text{Var}(X_t) = \sum_{i=0}^t a_i^2 \text{Var}(Z_{t-i}) = \sigma \sum_{i=0}^t a_i^2$$ depends strongly on $t$! So the question is: Is it true that for all time series we assume the index set to be $\mathbb{Z}$? This is hardly true for any real data we observe because we start to observe the data at some point (so we do not have $x_{-1}, x_{-2}, ...$). We could overcome this by saying that we could have collected data before $t=0$ and the process that produced the data would produce it by the same rules. Then one could argue that the mere process itself that produces the data does start at some point (so we could definitely not collect more data). Again, we can overcome this by stating something like 'well, if the process was active then it would have behaved in the same way'... Is that somewhat reasonable?
