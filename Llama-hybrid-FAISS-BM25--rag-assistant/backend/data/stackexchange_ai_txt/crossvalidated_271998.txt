It's clearly incorrect. Observing 1 heads and 1 tails means that $p(\theta=0)=0$ (it's impossible to have an all-heads coin) and $p(\theta=1)=0$ (it's impossible to have an all-tails coin). The uniform distribution isn't consistent with this. What is consistent is a Beta(2,2). From the Bayesian solution to the coin-flip problem with a Laplace (i.e. uniform) prior on the $\theta$, the posterior probability is $p(\theta)={\rm Beta}(h+1,(N-h)+1)$.
