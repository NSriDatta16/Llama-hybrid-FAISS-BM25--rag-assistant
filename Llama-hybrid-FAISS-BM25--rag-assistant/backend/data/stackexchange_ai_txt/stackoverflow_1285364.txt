While Neil's and Norman's answers are technically correct, some compilers, like MSVC, actually allow a pure #include to magically link to the correct library. This is accomplished using a special directive inside the included .h file which looks like this: #pragma comment(lib, "library.lib") or #pragma comment(linker, "/DELAYLOAD:library.dll") The compiler then embeds the comment into the generated object files (.o or .obj) and the linker extracts it and appends it to it's options.
