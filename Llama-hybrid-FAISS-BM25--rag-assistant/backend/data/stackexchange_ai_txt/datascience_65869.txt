You mentioned: My understanding is that standard NLP techniques may not fit here, because the relationship between sub-fields and fields are linked by its meanings but not word-frequency or word-embedding etc. However, your understanding is not totally correct, because word embeddings do convey meaning in them and could be used in your case. Here is an example, given a list of countries, you can figure out their capitals in the vector space. Even though they are linked by the geographical location. You would for example be able to do the following: Rome - Italy + France and you would get Paris . So, you could create your own word-embeddings where Physics - Quantum Mechanics + Abstract Algebra = Mathematics . The only things you would need is a seed relationship (e.g. Quantum Mechanics - Physics ), then all the other relationships would be a simple displacement in the vector space, which you can figure out by subtracting and adding the words.
