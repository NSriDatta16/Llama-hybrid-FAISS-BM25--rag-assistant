Logistic Regression Using Zelig [R]

I'm running a logit model using the zelig package in R: z.out The dependent variable, trade961a, is a dichotomous factor variable. All other variables are numeric. I am interested in personal962, which is: > str(personal962) num [1:1714] 3 3 1 1 1 2 3 2 2 1 ... so I run the following to simulate the probability of supporting international trade when personal962 is 1 (better): x.out I get the following error message: #Error in dta[complete.cases(mf), names(dta) %in% vars, drop = FALSE] : # incorrect number of dimensions Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
