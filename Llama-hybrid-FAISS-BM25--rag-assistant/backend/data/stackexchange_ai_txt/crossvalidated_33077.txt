Michael and Fraijo suggested that simply checking whether the parameter value of interested was contained in some credible region was the Bayesian equivalent of inverting confidence intervals. I was a bit skeptical about this at first, since it wasn't obvious to me that this procedure really resulted in a Bayesian test (in the usual sense). As it turns out, it does - at least if you're willing to accept a certain type of loss functions. Many thanks to Zen , who provided references to two papers that establish a connection between HPD regions and hypothesis testing: Pereira & Stern (1999), Evidence and credibility: full Bayesian significance test for precise hypotheses , Entropy Madruga, Esteves & Wechsler (2001), On the Bayesianity of Pereira-Stern tests , Test I'll try to summarize them here, for future reference. In analogue with the example in the original question, I'll treat the special case where the hypotheses are $$H_0: \theta\in\Theta_0=\{\theta_0\}\qquad \mbox{and}\qquad H_1: \theta\in\Theta_1=\Theta\backslash \Theta_0,$$ where $\Theta$ is the parameter space. Pereira & Stern proposed a method for testing said hypotheses without having to put prior probabilities on $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_1$ . Let $\pi(\cdot)$ denote the density function of $\theta$ and define $$T(x)=\{ \theta:\pi(\theta|x)>\pi(\theta_0|x)\}.$$ This means that $T(x)$ is a HPD region , with credibility $P(\theta\in T(x)|x)$. The Pereira-Stern test rejects $\Theta_0$ when $P(\theta\notin T(x)|x)$ is "small" ($ $\Theta_0$ is rejected at the $5~\%$ level if and only if it is not contained the in $95~\%$ HPD region. Let the test function $\varphi$ be $1$ if $\Theta_0$ is accepted and $0$ if $\Theta_0$ is rejected. Madruga et al. proposed the loss function $$ L(\theta,\varphi,x) = \begin{cases} a(1-\mathbb{I}(\theta\in T(x)), & \mbox{if } \varphi(x)=0 \\ b+c\mathbb{I}(\theta\in(T(x)), & \mbox{if } \varphi(x)=1, \end{cases} $$ with $a,b,c>0$. Minimization of the expected loss leads to the Pereira-Stern test where $\Theta_0$ is rejected if $P(\theta\notin T(x)|x) So far, all is well. The Pereira-Stern test is equivalent to checking whether $\theta_0$ is in an HPD region and there is a loss function that generates this test, meaning that it is founded in decision theory. The controversial part though is that the loss function depends on $x$ . While such loss functions have appeared in the literature a few times, they don't seem to be generally accepted as being very reasonable. For further reading on this topic, see a list of papers that cite the Madruga et al. article . Update October 2012: I wasn't completely satisfied with the above loss function, as its dependence on $x$ makes the decision-making more subjective than I would like. I spent some more time thinking about this problem and ended up writing a short note about it, posted on arXiv earlier today . Let $q_{\alpha}(\theta|x)$ denote the posterior quantile function of $\theta$, such that $P(\theta\leq q_{\alpha}(\theta|x))=\alpha$. Instead of HPD sets we consider the central (equal-tailed) interval $(q_{\alpha/2}(\theta|x),q_{1-\alpha/2}(\theta|x))$. To test $\Theta_0$ using this interval can be justified in the decision-theoretic framework without a loss function that depends on $x$. The trick is to reformulate the problem of testing the point-null hypothesis $\Theta_0=\{\theta_0\}$ as a three-decision problem with directional conclusions. $\Theta_0$ is then tested against both $\Theta_{-1}=\{\theta:\theta \theta_0\}$. Let the test function $\varphi=i$ if we accept $\Theta_i$ (note that this notation is the opposite of that used above!). It turns out that under the weighted $0-1$ loss function $$L_2(\theta,\varphi) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if } \theta\in\Theta_i\mbox{ and }\varphi=i, \quad i\in \{-1,0,1\}, \\ \alpha/2, & \mbox{if } \theta\notin\Theta_0 \mbox{ and }\varphi=0,\\ 1, & \mbox{if } \theta\in\Theta_{i}\cup\Theta_0 \mbox{ and }\varphi=-i,\quad i\in\{-1,1\},\end{cases}$$ the Bayes test is to reject $\Theta_0$ if $\theta_0$ is not in the central interval. This seems like a quite reasonable loss function to me. I discuss this loss, the Madruga-Esteves-Wechsler loss and testing using credible sets further in the manuscript on arXiv.
