What is exact way to do k-fold validation?

What is exact way to do k-fold cross validation? A) Way 1 : 1. Split data into train set, test set 2. Apply k-fold validation on train set 3. Find best estimator from average of each validation score 3. Calculate final score on test set with best estimator B) Way 2 1. Apply k-fold validation on entire data 2. Calculate average of each validation score 3. Using it as a final score So far I have known that Way 1 is exact way. I'm confused there many articles using the term 'test set/split/fold' instead of 'validation set/split/fold'. And they are using the average score on each validation score as final score. What is exact way?
