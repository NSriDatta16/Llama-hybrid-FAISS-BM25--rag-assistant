Have you looked into tourr package in R. This package does hyperplane reduction. In addition it has an optimizer that tries to find the best reduction. There is a very nice video in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSXNfZESR5I That shows what R is capable even beyound tourr package. Also I refer you to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8017427/plotting-data-from-an-svm-fit-hyperplane
