can relative risk be calculated from a 2 by 3 table

I have a question regarding relative risk. I have a table like this: outcome -1 0 1 group 1 25 52 6 group 2 21 69 9 So the outcome is some category of changes (i.e they are they category of -1,0,and 1). And the factor is group. I ran a multinomial logistic regression (using the code from here: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/ ) with the reference level being "-1". I got the relative risk from the program in R to be: case 1: 1.5796 (the relative risk of having a change of "0" vs change of "-1" for being in group 2 compared to being in group 1) and case 2: 1.7854 (the relative risk of having a change of "1" vs change of "-1" for being in group 2 compared to being in group 1). My question is, is the value of 1.5796, and 1.7854 correct based on the table above? Because I thought relative risk can be calculated from the table (at least I know I can do that when I have a 2 by 2 table). So in this case, can I calculate the relative risk to be (69/(21+69+9)) / (52/(25+52+6)) for the first case, and (9/(21+69+9)) / (6/(25+52+6)) for the second case by hand-calculation like this? because it seems these two values are quite different from the values given by the multinomial logistic regression. Thank you
