Python's NLTK vs. related Java Libraries?

I've used LingPipe, Stanford's NER, RiTa and various sentence similarity libraries for my previous Java projects that focused on text (pre)processing (indexing, xml tagging, topic detection, etc.) of large amounts of English text (around 10,000 documents summing to > 1gb of text). Maybe I'm a bad Java programmer, but I find myself typing a lot of code and using a lot of libraries when I switch to a different corpus. Overall, I feel like there might be a better tool for the job. I guess my question is, will I benefit from switching to Python and NLTK for information retrieval / language processing? Or are there enough pros and cons to make it very subjective? Is NLTK intuitive enough to be learned quickly? I'd get my hands dirty, but I won't have access to a personal machine for the next few days.
