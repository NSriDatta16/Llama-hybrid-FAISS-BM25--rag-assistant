How to compare accuracy with k-fold cross-validation with different 'k'

How to compare accuracy with k-fold cross-validation with different k I need to compare the accuracy and F1 measures of my machine learning classifier (C1) with the state-of-the-art classifier (C2). However, the paper which proposed C2 had tested the classifier with 3-fold cross-validation test. Is it possible to compare 10-fold CV on C1 with 3-fold CV on C2? If yes, could you teach me how? I am not sure about this since the larger k means more training set to be leaned and which might be unfair.
