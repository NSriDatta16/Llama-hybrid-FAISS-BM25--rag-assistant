Calculating File size before download

What I want to do is explained as follows. I have an url of MP3 file. ( for example Sound File ) When user starts application, download should start & for that I have implemented following methods: -(void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; NSURL *url=[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://xyz.pqr.com/abc.mp3"]; NSURLRequest *req=[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url cachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageNotAllowed timeoutInterval:120]; NSURLConnection *con=[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:req delegate:self startImmediately:YES]; if(con){ myWebData=[[NSMutableData data] retain]; } else { // [MainHandler performSelector:@selector(targetSelector:) withObject:nil]; } } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response{ NSLog(@"%@",@"connection established"); [myWebData setLength: 0]; } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data { NSLog(@"%@",@"connection receiving data"); [myWebData appendData:data]; } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError *)error { NSLog(@"%@",@"connection failed"); [connection release]; // [AlertViewHandler showAlertWithErrorMessage:@"Sorry, there is no network connection. Please check your network and try again."]; // [self parserDidEndDocument:nil]; } -(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection { [connection release]; } Above methods work perfectly for downloading. But I can not get the exact size which is going to be downloaded. I want to know what is the size of file - which is going to be download.
