To your question: is it possible for a person working in Android Development to work on Core Java or J2EE or J2SE ever? If you mean without learning JavaSE or JavaEE: no, you can't unless you want to work on trivial Hello World! programs. Since Android was introduced way after Java SE and EE, the general case is the opposite - Java programmers are learning Android to write for it. But if you started your programming on Android, you still need to learn what is Java SE and EE, and how to program for it.
