How does XGBoost implement MAE loss?

As we all know, XGBoost constructs trees based on gradient. I wonder how does XGBoost define gradient of MAE loss, as MAE itself is not differentiable. After some digging of the source code, I found the implementation of MSE loss here . But I can't find any implementation of MAE loss. The original paper didn't discuss MAE loss either.
