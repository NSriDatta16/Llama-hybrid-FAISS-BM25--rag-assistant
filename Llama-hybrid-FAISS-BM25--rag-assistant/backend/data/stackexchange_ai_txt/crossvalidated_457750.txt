It is possible that the data is already stationary by nature - which is why OLS works on the lagged values of y without any transformations. Also, for the case of ARIMA models, ML is used only if moving average terms are used. If only auto-regressive terms are used that OLS works. From what you describe they don't have any moving average terms in the explanatory variables. Note: The above argument seems realistic. What happens the application of lagged dependent variable in OLS or the ML in ARIMA actually cancels out the most of the effects of the higher orders say the trend effects or cyclical effects in the terms of moving average. That's why, even if both processes are non-stationary processes, but they remain cancelled out and do not become visible in the residual error component even if individual Tests of UNIT roots will show I(1) characteristics.
