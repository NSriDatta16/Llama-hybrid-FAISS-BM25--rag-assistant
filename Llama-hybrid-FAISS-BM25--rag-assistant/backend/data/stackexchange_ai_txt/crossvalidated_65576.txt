How to measure the distance between two Bayesian networks?

Given a set of random variables $\{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_M \}$ and a (complete) dataset $D$, I have used some standard (greedy) algorithms to find good candidates to be the "true" bayesian network modeling/behind the joint probability distribution of these variables. At the end, I have a set of different bayesian networks with a "high score" (given $D$). I would like to compute some kind of distance between these networks before choosing one. I read about the Kullback-Leibler divergence, but of course I don't know the real network. Is there any useful metric to compare two probability distributions?
