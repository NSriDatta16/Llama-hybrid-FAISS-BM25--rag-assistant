Soren - If you haven't already, you should probably regenerate your storage account access key. It is listed in your original post with your configuration details. Another option to help diagnose your problem is Intellitrace. If you are using Visual Studio 2010 Utimate, you can enable Intellitrace with your deployment. This will let you download the Intellitrace log files, and from those you can see some pretty detailed information pertaining to the deployment and startup of your application. There might be some exceptions or other errors being generated that could be causing the prolonged "Busy" state.
