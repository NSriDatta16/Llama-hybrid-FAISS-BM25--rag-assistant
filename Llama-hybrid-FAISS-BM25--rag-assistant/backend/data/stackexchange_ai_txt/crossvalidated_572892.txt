The death rate can't be negative (the pandemic was bad but it wasn't zombie apocalypse bad), so a natural way to enforce that is to fit an additive/linear model on the log scale (hence why the model has offset $\log p$ and not simply $p$ ), and then map back to the interval $[0, \infty]$ via the inverse of the log, the exponential function. This is the common formulation for GLMs, where the $\log$ would be the link function and $\exp$ its inverse. The authors don't really explain what they mean by a Bayesian spline ; typically in this kind of framework we choose a spline basis of a given size and then use a penalized fit to shrink the coefficients of the spline to minimise a penalized fit criterion with penalty on the wiggliness of the estimated spline. In a Bayesian context this penalty can be thought of as a prior on the wiggliness of the spline, which can also be thought of as gaussian priors on the coefficients (IIRC).
