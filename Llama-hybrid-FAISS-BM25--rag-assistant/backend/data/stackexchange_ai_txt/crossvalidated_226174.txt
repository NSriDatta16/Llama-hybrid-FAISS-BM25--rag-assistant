Authors frequently mention the convergence of their reinforcement learning algorithms. Do they imply a local or a global convergence?

I frequently come across authors in reinforcement learning papers mentioning that some or the other algorithm converges . Do they mean a local convergence or a global convergence? What do they specifically refer to, when they just mention convergence ? Take the example of this paper 'Convergence of a Q-learning Variant for Continuous States and Actions' ( https://www.jair.org/media/4271/live-4271-7865-jair.pdf ).
