facelet composition control (custom tag) with binding

I'm having problems with creating a Facelet Composition Control (= custom tag). That's the component's template (numberinput.jspx). I declared the in my custom-taglib.xml. So far the inclusion works using this code: That's the template: #{label } My problems arise when I have multiple of these tags on my page. I seems like Facelets gets confused and displays only a set of these, it's really very odd. Is there anything wrong with my code or is Facelets just as buggy as it seems? Thanks a lot. From my current experience I only can discourage anyone to use Facelets custom tags (at least when component binding is used). Environment info: I'm using ICEFaces 1.8.2 and Tomcat 6
