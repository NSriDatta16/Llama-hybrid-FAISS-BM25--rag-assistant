Not only does this practice make the code look cleaner, it also has many long term and short term benefits. You can never go wrong with organizing code. First off it makes it much easier to maintain and easier to read if someone else has to pick up after you. I have worked with Smarty before and it is nice, it keeps the designers work from interfering with the program code. Using template systems and frameworks would make it much easier to accomplish tasks. There is a rule of thumb you can follow which is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Frameworks help you achieve this goal. You may want to look into MVC , this is the model that these frameworks are based off of. But you could implement this design structure without necessarily using framework. Avoiding the learning curve. For frameworks like Zend , the learning curve is much greater than some other ones. I have found that Code Igniter is fairly easy to use and they have some VERY helpful video tutorials on their website. Best of Luck!!
