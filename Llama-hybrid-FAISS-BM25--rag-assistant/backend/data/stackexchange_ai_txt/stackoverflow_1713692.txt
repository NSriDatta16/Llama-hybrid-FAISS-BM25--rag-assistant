You're not going to be able to do that. Magento product descriptions are stored in the database, and then PHP fetches them out and displays them Server side includes are processed before Apache ever worries about outputing any content. Magento doesn't have a feature that's similar to SSI. You could probably write an override to the Product class in Magento to acheive this effect, but it would be non-trival and beyond the scope of a simple StackOverflow answer. Good luck.
