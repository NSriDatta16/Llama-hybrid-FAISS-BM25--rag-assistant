Ok let's say you have an LSTM() layer with return_sequences = True set. That means each LSTM cell in it is outputting its value. The output of the layer is therefore a sequence of outputs, not just the final one. That means the output is a processed time series, with sequential information in it. You want Dense() layers to take this information and use it to process the signal further. In particular, you want some Dense architecture to process each of these sequential outputs one by one. By using the TimeDistributed() wrapper it's like if you're iterating the same Dense() architecture on this sequential output. I typically use TimeDistributed(Dense()) at the bottom of a seq2seq Decoder, in order produce the final output sequence.
