What you want is: tblCustomerInfo.Info LIKE '%' + @SEARCH + '%' (or edit the parameter value to include the % in the first place). Otherwise, you are either (first sample) searching for the literal "@SEARCH" (not the arg-value), or you are embedding some extra quotes into the query (second sample). In some ways, it might be easier to have the TSQL just use LIKE @SEARCH , and handle it at the caller: command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SEARCH","%" + searchString + "%"); Either approach should work.
