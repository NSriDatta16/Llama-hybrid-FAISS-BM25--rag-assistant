There's nothing in the Socket class to do this - though it uses an underlying handle, there's no API to manipulate it and the Handle property is read-only. You would probably be best off by just P/Invoking recv and calling it directly with your IntPtr handle. A quick browse of the Rotor code looks like you could get away with creating a Socket, closing it's handle , and then setting it's m_handle field to your own. But that requires Reflection, and if your socket is already connected (which it sounds like it is - since you just asked about calling recv) then you'd also have to manipulate the private state of Socket - which makes this idea even less palatable and more fragile.
