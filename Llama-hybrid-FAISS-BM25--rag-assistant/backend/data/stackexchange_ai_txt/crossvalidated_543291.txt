Disclaimer: I am myself somewhat confused regarding time series, but in your case I don't think time-seriesness is a relevant feature. If you plot your data not as two curves over time, but as a scatter plot, with values of one series on the $x$ -axis and the corresponding (in time) values of the other on the $y$ -axis, the points should lie more-or-less on a straight line: Where series 1 has a high value, series 2 is also high, and vice versa. You are actually asking whether the two series measure the same "thing" (the same sentiment about the business situation). You can test that with Intraclass correlation .
