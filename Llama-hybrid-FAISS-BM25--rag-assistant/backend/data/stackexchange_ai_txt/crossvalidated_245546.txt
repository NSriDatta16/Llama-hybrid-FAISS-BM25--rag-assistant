Repeated Measures ANOVA post hoc test (bayesian)

I am trying to understand the procedure of carrying out a Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVA. In a conventional repeated measures ANOVA, I calculate the effect of a certain parameter (e.g., study condition) on a measured variable (e.g., test score). Then, I follow up my test with a post hoc test if the p value is lower than a certain value. This post hoc test will tell me the effect of each individual study condition. Therefore, I do not only know that the study condition had an effect on the measured results - I am also able to infer which condition had the most effect. For Bayesian Repeated Measures ANOVA, it is not clear to me how to follow up the initial test. I can do a 'model comparison', which gives me a Bayesian Factor to indicate the effect of that specific model. Lets say study condition is found to have a high BF - now I am of course interested which study condition performed better / worse than the others. How do I approach this question? Additional information about the study: This concerns a within-subjects, full repeated measures design. The study consisted of a total of three conditions - with participants completing the different conditions in different orders (i.e., balanced latin square). (I used JASP software for my analysis, whereas the regular repeated measures ANOVA offers the possibility for post hoc testing, this is not available in the Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA.)
