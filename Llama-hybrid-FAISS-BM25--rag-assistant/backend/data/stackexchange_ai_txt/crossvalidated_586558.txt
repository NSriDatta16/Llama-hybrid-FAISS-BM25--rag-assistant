If you don't have to correct for covariates and you just want to compare two groups at 6 months after randomization, then with an 8-point ordinal outcome you could use the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (WMW) to evaluate the stochastic ordering between treatment groups, that is, whether a randomly chosen member of one group is likely to have a greater value than a randomly chosen member of the other. If you do need to adjust for covariates like the IMPACT score at presentation, then an ordinal logistic regression model is the direct extension of the WMW test. This web post from Frank Harrell summarizes the issues nicely, and demonstrates that you can get useful results even if the proportional-odds (PO) assumption is relaxed. In particular, with respect to your suggestion to dichotomize outcomes: a unified PO model analysis is decidedly better than turning to inefficient and arbitrary analyses of dichotomized values of Y. This page outlines approaches to power/sample-size calculations for the WMW test. It's probably most reliable to make the estimate based on multiple sampling from simulated data. You start with the known distribution of Glasgow scores under control conditions, and you make specific assumptions about how you expect the new treatment will change the distribution of scores. Simulate large numbers of both groups under those assumptions, and take repeated samples of different sizes to determine the sample size needed to detect your assumed difference at the desired power and significance criteria. Simulation has a particular advantage if you will be controlling for covariates, as it allows you to consider the distributions of covariate values and their associations with outcomes and treatment effects. Then you can evaluate multiple scenarios about the effect of treatment to better ensure that your study will be large enough to provide clean results.
