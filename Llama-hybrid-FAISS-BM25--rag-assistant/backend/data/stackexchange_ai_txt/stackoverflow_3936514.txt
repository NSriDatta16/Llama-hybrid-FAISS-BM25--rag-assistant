The Java Language Specification defines a package naming convention that says that package names should include a domain name, as it provides a globally-rooted namespace. The source files need to be in subfolders that match the package name, because the Sun Java compiler, javac , enforces strongly encourages it. Additionally, many other build tools and IDEs also either strongly encourage or require that the source .java files are stored in paths that match the package.
