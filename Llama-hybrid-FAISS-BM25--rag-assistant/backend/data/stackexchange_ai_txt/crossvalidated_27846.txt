Comparing questionnaires with actual observations: is it worth it?

First of 2 part query: I have observed a 100 Drs and recorded the number of times they touch surfaces while in a room: $$ \begin{array}{l|c|c|c|c} Dr\text{ number}&Bed&Table&Chair&Door\\ Dr 1&3&2&2&1\\ Dr 2&4&1&0&1\\ \vdots&\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots\\ Dr 100& 2&3&1&1 \end{array} $$ I would like to calculate the probability of him touching the Table for example. Would it be:? $$ \begin{array}{l|c|c|c|c|c} &Bed&Table&Chair&Door&\text{Total}\\ \text{Average contacts}&3&2&1&1&\text{7}\\ P(surface)&3/7&2/7&1/7&1/7&1 \end{array} $$ This is confusing me but I think a fresh pair of eyes will spot it instantly. 2nd Part: I gave questionnaires out to some doctors who ticked boxes instead of giving contact numbers ie: $$ \begin{array}{l|c|c|c|c} Dr\text{ number}&Bed&Table&Chair&Door\\ Dr &\checkmark&\checkmark&\checkmark&\checkmark\\ Dr&\checkmark&\checkmark&\times&\checkmark\\ \vdots&\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots\\ Dr 100& \checkmark&\checkmark&\checkmark&\checkmark \end{array} $$ What can I deduce from this table of ticks to compare with the table of exact values? Or is it not worth anything? Please ask for any clarification needed, Regards
