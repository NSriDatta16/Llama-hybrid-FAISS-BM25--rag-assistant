Automatically detect a new computer connected to the network

Is there an elegant way to make a program detect a new computer that is connected to the network? I would like my program to "auto-sense" a new computer being connected on the network (they're on the same network). Like a USB device being connected to the computer. What I'm doing now is to save a list of all computers in the network from time to time. Another approach is to PING all available IPs on the subnet. Are there any other elegant approaches? Thanks!
