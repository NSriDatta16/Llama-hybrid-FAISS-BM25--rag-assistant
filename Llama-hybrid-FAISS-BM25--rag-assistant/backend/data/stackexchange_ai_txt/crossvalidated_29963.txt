Can I use time series analysis on short time scales (e.g., with 5 to 30 measurements?

I am studying a complex system. My goal is to understand the impact of a spreading accident (which saturates the filter (sand and plant) and creates puddles). Puddles decrease the efficiency of the system (depollution of effluent, and moisture content). The impact on the efficiency will decrease with time (more or less depending on the season and meteorological situation). I want to develop a model of how long the incident will impact on the pilote. For that I think I should use time series analysis. My question is: Can I use time series analysis on short time scales (e.g., with 5 to 30 measurements? or can I compare the effluent volume with the parameter that I want to study, with a decalage which should not be regular because of its depending with the effluent volume injected?
