One solution is to use a Singleton, and have one, or both, of the Application and Facade register with that Singleton. However, I really don't like the idea of throwing a global variable at this problem. It doesn't seem to make sense -- this must be a common problem, so I'm assuming there is an elegant solution and I just don't know how to search for it.
