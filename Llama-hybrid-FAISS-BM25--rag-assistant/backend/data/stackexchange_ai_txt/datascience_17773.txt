How to improve an existing machine learning classifier in python?

I have a big dataset (1million x 50) to which I want to predict a particular class. I have thought of segregating the dataset in batches of 20k. And then train a classifier (lets say random forest or a basic SVM). How do I then improve that classifier by providing it with additional dataset. In other words, how do I preserve the random forests created in iteration i and use as starting model in interation i+1 to improve the model in python?
