You may be having trouble finding info on this because you're looking for it under 'nonparametric tests'. This wouldn't usually be included under the (rather confusing) 'nonparametric' heading. Logistic regression is sensible, but you'll need one of its extensions to deal with correlated outcomes, such as conditional (fixed-effects) logistic regression, random-effects logistic regression, or mixed-effects logistic regression. It's hard to say which is appropriate without knowing more about your data and the question(s) you wish to address.
