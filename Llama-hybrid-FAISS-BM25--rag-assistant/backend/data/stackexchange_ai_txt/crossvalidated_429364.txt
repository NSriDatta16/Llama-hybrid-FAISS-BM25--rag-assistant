there are two viable ways: just sample rows from the dataset, this should go well for most applications. assume some model for the joint distribution, then draw from it. this is way more complicate than the first choice, so do it only if you really need to. I'm talking about any kind of model, also non-parametric ones like kernel distribution estimation. Point is, whatever the model, you have to make some assumption about it, for instance you have to chose the bandwidth and the kernel for kernel density, and if your data has bounduaries like you said in your comment to your own question, you have to consider it when estimating the model, by default kernel won't respect any bounduary. So there is no one only way to do it, you have to chose the model depending on data. Also notice that using kernel density and drawing from it is the same as sampling from data and adding noise (gaussian noise if you used gaussian kernel, with st. deviation proportional to kernel bandwidth). ps: a quite safe choice that is somehow in the middle of these two could be drawing from your data after augmenting it, with some technique based on nearest neighbours like the ones used for inbalanced classes problems in machine learning.
