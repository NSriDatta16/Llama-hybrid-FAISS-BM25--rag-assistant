Error message in diagnostic plots of GLM in R

I created a generalised linear model in R: mod10 I used the function: plot(mod10) To show the diagnostic plots for the model and it came up with the following error in the console window: Warning messages: 1: In sqrt(crit * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced 2: In sqrt(crit * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced Any suggestions? For readers who are not R users, typically the diagnostic plots include these options: Deviance Residuals vs. Predicted Values, Response vs. Fitted Values, Normal QQ Plot of Modified Pearson Residuals, Normal QQ Plot of Modified Deviance Residuals, Modified Pearson Residuals vs. Leverage, Scale-Location.
