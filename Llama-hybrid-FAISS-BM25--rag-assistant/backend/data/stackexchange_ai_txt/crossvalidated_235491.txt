Your idea is good, but in your example, you forgot to model different intercept and different random variances for each trait, so your output is not interpretable as is. A correct model would be: m1 In that case, you would get the estimates of fixed effects on each variable (for example, variabledrat:gear is the effect of predictor gear on response drat ), but you would also get the intercepts for each variable (for example variabledrat for the intercept of response drat ) and the random variance of each variable and the correlations between variables: Groups Name Std.Dev. Corr factor(carb) variabledrat 23.80 variablempg 24.27 0.20 variablehp 23.80 0.00 0.00 Residual 23.80 A more detailed description of these methods has been written down by Ben Bolker , as well as the use of MCMCglmm in a Bayesian framework. Another new package, mcglm can also handle multivariate models, even with non-normal responses, but you have to code your random design matrices. A tutorial should be available soon (see the R help page).
