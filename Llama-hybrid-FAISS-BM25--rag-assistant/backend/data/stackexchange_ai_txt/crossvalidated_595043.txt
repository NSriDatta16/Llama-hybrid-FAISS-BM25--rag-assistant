Predict the prevalence of a characteristic in a group

I've got sample data of the prevalence of a certain characteristic in two different groups, with prevalence in group 1 being 65% and prevalence in group 2 40%: # Generate data where the presence of the characteristic is higher in group 1 compared to group 2. group_1 I'm trying to find a way to do the following: 'if you have a sample with a prevalence of x% of group 1 persons, then thís would be the predicted prevalence if they were in group 2'. I thought I should do this with logistic regression, but I don't think I'm finding what I need: # Logistic regression model: how is presence in group 1 related to the presence in group 2. model % glm(formula=presence ~ group, family=binomial, data=.) summary(model) # The regression formula is log(p/1-p) = -0.4895 + 0.9791 * Group 1 # The probability being present/prevalent in group 2 that follow from this model would then be: exp(-0.4895 + 0.9791) / (exp(-0.4895*1 + 0.9791) + 1) # 0.62 I'm pretty sure the 0.62 is not something I'm looking for, but I'm also not sure what number I ám looking for.
