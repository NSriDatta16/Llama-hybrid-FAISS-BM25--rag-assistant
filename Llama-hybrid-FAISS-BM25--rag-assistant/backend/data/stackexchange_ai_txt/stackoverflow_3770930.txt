You might want to consider using a meta-make such as CMake that can generate both Visual Studio and Xcode project files. It's probably not as ideal for you since you'll need to write the CMake file and then fix up both the Xcode and Visual Studio projects to your liking (though I believe CMake has some support for project organisation in Visual Studioâ€”not sure about Xcode) rather than doing a straight conversion, but it would allow you to work in Xcode and submit as a Visual Studio project.
