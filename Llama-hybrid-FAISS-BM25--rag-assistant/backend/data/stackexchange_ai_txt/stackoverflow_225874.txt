Check out Demi Sauce . From the Google Code description: Demi Sauce is an application that offers web services to other applications. It operates as a server in your environment that other applications use like a software component using either Javascript embeds, or xml web services. Rather than building on top of a framework to get additional capability above your native app, Demi Sauce is all web service based to keep it separated but easily integrated with your software application. You would use it within your existing application by calling simple web services or embedding javascript into your app (like google analytics, but for comments, feedback/help etc. This allows the same content and services provided by DemiSauce server to be consumed within multiple applications within your environment.
