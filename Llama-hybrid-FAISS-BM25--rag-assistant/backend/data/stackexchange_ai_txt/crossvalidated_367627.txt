Differencing causes negative predictions

I have a non - stationary time series sequence which is based on counts. To convert the sequence into stationary I applied differencing, which converted the sequence into stationary but the sequence now has negative values. ts_seq_shifted = ts_seq - ts_seq.shift(1) Now when I use the AR model to predict, I get negative predictions. Ideally my predictions are count which logically cannot be negative. mod = AR(df["ts_seq_shifted"]) res = mod.fit(maxlag= 15, ic= 'bic') pred = res.predict(start="2001-01-01", end="2001-01-02") op: The predictions for the next 2 days are: 2001-01-01 -3.958415 2001-01-02 -0.391196 Freq: D, dtype: float64 In my understanding I did not do over differencing and since I have 0 in the sequence I cannot apply log transformations hence I chose differencing. Any suggestions to tackle this problem could be really helpful?
