Ruby/Rails test practices

While I still considered myself somewhat of a noob in the ruby/rails space, I'm interested in forming an opinion on how I'd like to test rails apps - which technologies and levels of coverage to use and when. My current policy is to go with the flow of whatever project I'm on, but that has yielded inconsistent results in both technology and level of coverage. The only consistency has been in the test first development style. Rspec for controllers, models, and helpers, cucumber for functionals (to ease the test first development) and backfill with Test::Unit for tricky bits of code? All functionals with cucumber? Abandon Test::Unit? Test::Unit for models and helpers, and cucumber for everything else? Please share your opinions.
