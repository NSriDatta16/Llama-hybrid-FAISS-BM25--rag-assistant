What is best way to implement fine grained access control in struts2 view?

Basically, In any application for UI we have access control for various element. Say, I have a button to be visible to PM TheButton TheButton=disabled Now say there is one more condition say developer has different access. Since there is no AND in tags...We do as TheButton TheButton=disabled TheButton TheButton=disabled So here code keeps increasing and access control is all fragmented. In struts2, for each method inside Action class, I can create Custom Annotation and check access control. Like @Role=pm,developer How to do it in jsp ? such that i can write. Or something like that.
