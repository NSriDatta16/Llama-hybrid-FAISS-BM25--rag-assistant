Possible to change SIP message via proxy?

I have been doing a bit of research on this and think it's possible, but just wanted some confirmation from those in the know :-) My requirement is to change the XML string in a SIP message body which is coming from a PBX server (closed source) and going to a particular type of handset. Problem is that the handset doesn't like the format of the XML, so I need to change it between the PBX and the phone. I started out looking at changing things at the network layer, but quickly came to the conclusion that this would be extremely difficult (and my C/C++ is not that up to date), so I then turned my attention to SIP proxies, of which there are several really good open source ones. But, before I head down this track, which may benefit others if possible, I wanted to ask, is this type of SIP message body manipulation even possible? Thanks in advance for any responses :-)
