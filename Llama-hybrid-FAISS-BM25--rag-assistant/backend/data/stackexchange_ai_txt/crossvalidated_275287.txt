There are some statistics for this, such as Hopkins statistic of clustering tendency . But as far as I can tell, this is rather a test against uniformity. Unfortunately, data can be non-uniform, but not suitable for clustering. Because this test does not ensure there is more than one cluster. Similar, in above example of randomizing a graph, what you test is how much the graph looks like it was randomized, but does this really capture "clusters"? Can there be non-clustered data that nevertheless looks very different than the simulation? Because of this, these tests tend to massively overestimate the "evidence", because they use a too random baseline. As a control, you should generate various "non-clustered" data. On networks, you may want to consider various graph generation approaches, Barabasi-Albert etc. What you'd really want to look for in vector data would be a test for multimodality , because a single Gaussian distribution is not what you'd call "clustered data" (in fact, a single Gaussian is the archetype of random data, isn't it?). I'm not sure how that would work on a graph... but clearly, simply randomly rewiring the network is too extreme to evaluate clustering evidence.
