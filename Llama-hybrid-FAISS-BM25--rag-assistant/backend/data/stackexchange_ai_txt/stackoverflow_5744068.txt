Drag div by handle that is not nested

In the JQueryUI draggable demo , I can see you can attach a handle to a DIV but if the handle is not nested within the parent DIV that is draggable, it doesn't work e.g. #hBlack { width:55px; height:55px; background-color: black; top:0px; } #hGreen { width:25px; height:25px; background-color: green; } $(function() { $("#hBlack").draggable({handle:"#hGreen"}); }); The above doesn't make #hGreen the handle - but the following does: Essentially, I am trying to make one DIV move when another moves - I guess you can do it with the new Position utility but for a newbie like me I find it poorly documented
