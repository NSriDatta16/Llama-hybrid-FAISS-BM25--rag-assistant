Think about storage too. I was thinking about this same curiosity. Perhaps IsoStore is a place where you can keep them. A user has a plugin for your app (that conforms to an interface) and you can have them locate it (OpenFileDialog) and load it into your app (save in IsoStore). It isn't a durable solution of course, but an interesting one.
