The most important application is even cross-domain usable. It's known as CLD. You buy some expensive hardware, or rent some external expertise. And while you are waiting for the company administration to make a move and allow you to install and operate the hardware (which cannot not centrally administered, because the GPUs fall out of their usual active directory policy admin pattern) you have to make sure you have something fancy to show off. So you get a number of images from your corporate intranet, mostly with company logos. Lots of pictures. And then you feed all of them into a neural network using the inception pattern, and train this on your home gaming PC. Do not use the pretrained puppy-snail model! So after you have pretrained the network, you can now "make Google dream your company logo" in arbitrary images. so you generate a few of them to hang on your office walls while waiting for your systems to be approved. And when the C-level execs come by and want to see results while you still are not even started, you can give them some of this artwork to take home. They will all be impressed by your expertise of deep learning! And that is why I call this application the CLD, the c-level distractor.
