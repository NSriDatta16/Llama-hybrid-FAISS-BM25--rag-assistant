Is there a size limit of 16k for Silverlight LocalSettings (IsolatedStorageSettings)

I am trying to save my whole viewmodel into the IsolatedStorage Settings. It is quite large as it contains many other VMs. When I try and read the value it throws a "Operation not permitted on IsolatedStorageFileStream" error. This seems like a red-herring as I am not using files, I am using the IsolatedStorageSettings class. I checked out the __LocalSettings file under my local app data directory and it appears to be truncated at 16k (halfway through an XML element name). I suspect it has a 16k limit and therefore on the next load the IsolatedStorage class sees it as an invalid file and throws a fit (it then blanks it back down to an empty file). I would just like to confirm if there is a size limit of 16k on all your settings when using IsolatedStorageSettings? Some ways around it is to serialize it as a file and rehydrate it instead of using Settings or to not use this approach at all (store less info). In anyone has a better idea please let me know?
