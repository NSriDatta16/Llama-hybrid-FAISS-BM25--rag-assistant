At the very least, create a paragraph style for code samples, use a good monospaced font, and don't forget to turn off hyphenation. When I used to do this, I would create a table style and paste the code in there, so I had a nice title header above it, and it stood out a bit. The only gotcha there is that Frame table cells won't break across a page break, so if your code is longer than a page or threatens to go below the bottom of a page, you'll need to create multiple rows in your table and break up the code across the rows.
