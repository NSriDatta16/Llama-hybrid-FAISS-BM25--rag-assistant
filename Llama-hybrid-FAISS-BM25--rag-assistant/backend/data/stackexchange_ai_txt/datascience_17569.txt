On Some Analysis I found out the columns were mutually Exclusive and therefore created one column named Soil_Type(0..40 possible values) replacing 40 binary columns and Wilderness_Area(0..4 possible values) replacing 4 binary columns. This did improve performance of the classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree ) with respect to time and prediction accuracy as well.
