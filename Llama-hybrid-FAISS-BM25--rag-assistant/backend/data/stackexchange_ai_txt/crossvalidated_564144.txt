Controlling daily variation in A/B test

I want to run an A/B test over, hopefully, as shortest time as possible! I have severe variations in the metric over the week which inflates the variance of metrics and hurts the power a lot! I thought I have two options in classic statistics to remedy this, and another option that I do not know how to leverage. Would appreciate if you can clear my mind about it. 1- Statisticians use randomized block design to control for the variations induced by factors which is not of the main interest in experiment (day of week here). However , this needs giving treatment to a subset of users EVERY DAY! but we want to give treatment to some users at the beginning and track them afterwards. Further , this needs the test to be run over several weeks so that the daily variations can be ruled out. 2- Paired design is another option. Simply pair control and treatment over different days of the week. The only downside that I can think of is that treatment and control users who end up engaging may vary over the days of the week. 3-We have the historical pattern of metric over the past days. Is there a way to efficiently leverage that information?
