how to label 3d model for segmentation task

I'm working on 3d meshes dataset, i have to label it to train my deep learning model for a segmentation task like the picture shows. I spent days looking for a tool to label my 3d data but unfortunately i found nothing.. What tool i can use to label my data (3d mesh, .obj files) for segmentation task?
