Given your objective, the most direct (and simplest) analysis would be to find each student's score $X_{ij}, i = 1,2; j=1, \dots, n$ (number correct on each student's test.) Then do a Welch two-sample t test to see if the means $\bar X_1$ and $\bar X_2$ are significantly different. This assumes that student's average scores are approximately normal. More complicated designs might provide the opportunity to see if some specific questions differ from each other or as to preparation by the two teachers. However, I would want to look to see whether the residuals for the ANOVA model are normal. When fewer items are averaged, the normality assumptions seems less certain. Addendum per Comments on Normality. Suppose tests consist of 20 multiple-choice questions each (with scores that can be modeled as binomial), and that there are 45 students in Class 1 and 55 in Class 2. Then results might be similar to simulated results below. Using R. set.seed(2021) # for reproducibility x1 = rbinom(45, 20, .73) # 45 scores in Class 1 summary(x1); length(x1); sd(x1) Min. 1st Qu.

Normal probability plots (center and right) are close to linear, indicating near normality R code for figure: par(mfrow=c(1,3)) boxplot(x1, x2, col="skyblue2") qqnorm(x1); qqline(x1, col="blue") qqnorm(x2); qqline(x2, col="blue") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) A Welch 2-sample t test shows a highly significant difference (P-value $0.003 between class average scores (13.8 and 15.1 correct out of 20). However, it is worthwhile considering whether an average difference of just a little more than one question per test is meaningful in terms of the capabilities of the instructors of the two classes. t.test(x1, x2) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x1 and x2 t = -3.1009, df = 94.72, p-value = 0.002542 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.0942057 -0.4593297 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 13.77778 15.05455 Note: If you still had reservations that data x1 and x2 can be taken as if normal, a nonparametric two-sample Wilcoxon Rank Sum test gives a similar P-value.
