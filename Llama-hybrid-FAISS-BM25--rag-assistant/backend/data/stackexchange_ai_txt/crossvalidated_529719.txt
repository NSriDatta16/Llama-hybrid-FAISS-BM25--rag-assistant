You can't. Machine learning models, broadly speaking, learn to interpolate between the data points. Here you are trying to extrapolate, extrapolation is hard and can easily go wrong . If you used a simple model, say linear regression, then it is easy to extrapolate and fairly easy to assess how bad the result could go. If you are using a more complicated model, say a polynomial regression, then as in the extract of the xkcd comic posted below, it can go arbitrarily bad. Models like random forest or kernel regression can only interpolate between the data points. To extrapolate beyound the data, you could do something like using the last seen slope (as you did on the plot attached to the question), or just use the prediction for the last known point (x=4) as predictions for everything above. Such simple methods for extrapolating are commonly used for time-series and may be preferred if you don't have much data . Both solutions are rather arbitrary and there is no good answer.
