To get line wrap in the file itself (as opposed to something like longlines-mode that does not alter the structure of the file), I use auto-fill-mode , which automatically applies M-q ( fill-paragraph ) to each paragraph. For example, I use auto-fill-mode in mail-mode . You could do something similar with your LaTeX mode with a hook like this: (add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) Assuming your TeX mode's hook is TeX-mode-hook .
