[I know this doesn't answer the question, nor provide sources; this was going to be a comment but got too long] I think your problem here is you haven't clearly defined "95% confidence interval", and your problem presents with more than one way of interpreting that. If you decide exactly what you mean by "95% confidence interval" you will probably answer your own question. For example, do you mean: If I reran my experiment many times, 95% of the regions so generated would completely contain the true path If I reran my experiment many times, the regions would on average contain 95% of the true points If I reran my experiment many times, then for any given true $X_i$, the corresponding true $Y_i$ would be contained in the vertical region above $X_i$ region 95% of the time. If I reran my experiment many times, then for any given true $Y_i$, the corresponding true $X_i$ would be contained in the horizontal region across from $Y_i$ region 95% of the time. A region containing 95% of the posterior probability density for a point $i$ picked at random. This is probably closest to what you have generated. Or perhaps some other variation. Your problem is that your estimate is strictly a very high dimensional vector of all the $(X_i, Y_i)$ pairs, and so your "standard" confidence region would be a high dimensional ellipsoid. Remember that the uncertainty around each point in the process need not be independent of the previous points, if one step is way too high, the next will probably be as well. Because this is a Gaussian process, you should be able to work out the full 2N x 2N correlation matrix, and so you can work a lot of different confidence regions depending on what interests you.
