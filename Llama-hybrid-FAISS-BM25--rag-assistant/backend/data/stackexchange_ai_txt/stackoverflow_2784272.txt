If you're talking about manipulating source code, all of the IDEs have some degree of refactoring support that will allow you to select one or more lines of code and create a method consisting of those lines. If you want to do that programatically, you'll need to parse the source file. You could write a lexer and parser, but that's a lot of work unless you're building an IDE. You may want to take a look at Annotation processing . That probably won't go far enough unless you also use a Compiler Tree API . Note, however that when you go there you're venturing off the "run anywhere" path and entering "implementation specific" land. If you're looking to manipulate things at runtime, then take a look at BCEL or ASM and Java Agents .
