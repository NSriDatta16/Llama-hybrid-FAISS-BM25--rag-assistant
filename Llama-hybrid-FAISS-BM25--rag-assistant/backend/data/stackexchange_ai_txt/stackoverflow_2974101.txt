How about mousedown and mouseup . $( ".thumb" ).bind( "mousedown", function() { //$(this).draggable( "disable" ); $(this).unbind('mouseenter mouseleave'); }); $( ".thumb" ).bind( "mouseup", function() { //$(this).draggable( "enable" ); $(this).bind('mouseenter mouseleave'); }); Although I'm not sure the purpose of your unbinding. There may be another way. Anyway, the mousedown and mouseup should trigger the start and stop of your drag. Just remember, if a user does a normal click , the handlers will be bound and unbound every time.
