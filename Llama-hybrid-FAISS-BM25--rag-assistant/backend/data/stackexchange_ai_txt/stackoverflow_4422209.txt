Note See my comment on your question, I think both times I was writing the below I misunderstood it. If you're looking to ensure that the item you're dragging is always above everything else during the drag, you can set the z-index in a selector matching your draggable with the class ui-draggable-dragging . jQuery UI adds that class to the element being dragged during the drag operation. So for instance, let's say you're dragging spans that are inside a div called foo . The CSS would be: #foo span.ui-draggable-dragging { z-index: 1000 !important; /* Sadly, you may need the !important */ } Live example Since the class is only added during the drag, that z-index value will only take effect during the drag. See the "overview" in the docs . Edit : ...by using the zIndex option ( live example ).
