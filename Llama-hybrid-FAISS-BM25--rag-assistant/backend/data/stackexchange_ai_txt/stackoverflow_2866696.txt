Including/Importing aliases and functions for both bash and zsh

I have a directory of functions and aliases I'd like to include for both bash and zsh terminal invocations (So I don't need to put every function and alias into every separate script and to facilitate organization/tidying of .rc files) What I've tried so far hasn't worked. Just setting this out for further suggestions.
