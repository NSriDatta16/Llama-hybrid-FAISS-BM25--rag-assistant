Not only are there differences in available memory between 32 bit and 64 bit (as discussed in previous answers), but its the availability of contiguous memory that may be killing your app on 32 bit. On 32 bit machine your app's DLLs will be littering the memory landscape in the first 2GB of memory (app at 0x00400000, OS DLLs up at 0x7xxx0000, other DLLs elsewhere). Most likely the largest contiguous block you have available is about 1.1GB. On a 64 bit machine (which gives you the 4GB address space with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE) you'll have a least one block in that 4GB space that is 2GB or more in size. So there is your difference. If your XML parser is relying on a large blob of memory rather than many small blobs it may be that your XML parser is running out of contiguous usable space on 32 bit but is not running out of contiguous usable space on 64 bit. If you want to visualize this on the 32 bit OS, grab a copy of VMValidator (free) and look at the Virtual view for a visualization of your memory and the Pages and Paragraphs views to see the data for each memory page/paragraph.
