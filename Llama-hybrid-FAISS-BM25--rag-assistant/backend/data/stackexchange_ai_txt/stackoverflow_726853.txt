For an old example have a look at the ' distort ' example. Note that this is a thing created back in 1992 (just looked in distort.c). Awesome program that causes ripples in the image wherever the mouse button is pressed. Another mode of the program acts like a sheet of rubber and can be pulled by dragging the mouse. I managed to compile the example on my mac. Rename all #include to #include Add a usleep(33*1000); in the idle() function Rename the file ripple_precalc.c to ripple_precalc.c.org (or just rm it) Compile with " cc *.c -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL " will create an a.out
