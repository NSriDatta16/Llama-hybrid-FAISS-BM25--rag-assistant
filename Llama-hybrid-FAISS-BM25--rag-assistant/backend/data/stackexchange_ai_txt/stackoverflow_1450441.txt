My 2 cents... if your tests break because you switched the type of XML parser - it indicates that the tests are fragile . The tests should specify the what and not the how . Which implies that in this case, the tests somehow know that you're using a SAX parsing engine (an implementation detail); which they should not. Fix that problem and you should be better with large changes. When you're abstracting away GUIs or Mocks from tests via an interface, you're ensuring that your test subject which uses the mocks (as doubles for actual collaborators) works as intended. You get to isolate bugs in your code from bugs in your collaborators. Mocks help you keep your test-suite fast. You also need tests that verify that your real collaborator also conforms to the interface AND tests that your real collaborators are 'wired-up' correctly..
