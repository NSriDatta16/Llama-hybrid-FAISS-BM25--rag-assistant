EDIT: disregard, I still get the same result as you, everyone winds up in cluster 4. I shall reconsider my code and try again. I think I've realised what the problem is, k-means clustering is designed to break up differences in a set, however, because of the way you calculate averages etc. we are getting a situation where there are no large gaps in the ranges. Might I suggest a change and only concentrate on a single value(strength appears to make most sense to me) to determine the clusters, or abandon this sorting method altogether, and adopt something different(not what you want to hear I know)? I found a rather nice site with an example k-mean sort using integers, I'm going to try and edit that, I will get back with the results some time tomorrow. http://code.blip.pt/2009/04/06/k-means-clustering-in-php/
