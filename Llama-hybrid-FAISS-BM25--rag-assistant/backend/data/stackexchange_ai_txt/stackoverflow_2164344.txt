One of the big differences you'll find, other than the list from @Robert Harvey, is generating primary keys: SQLServer has autoincrement, which you'll have to do yourself in oracle (at least, up to Oracle 10 - I'm not familiar with 11). Typically, you'll have to use a sequence; for consistency you can create on insert triggers, or just use the sequence.nextval in your insert statement.
