Firstly, you will need to normalize the data to average spending per person (also stated in your question). You can consider to use two samples t-test (or Welch t-test) for comparing between your control and treatment group. To do that, you should normalize your data. Consider this simplified example: Before 10 9 Week1 12 10 Week2 13 8 You transform it to net-effect relative to the beginning of your experiment. Eg: Week1 2 1 Week2 3 -1 If you now run t-test on your groups, you will be testing the net-effect of discount vs non-discount relative to the beginning of the experiment. Under the null hypothesis, your discount is worthless thus the net-effect for your second group should be close to your first group. If you can reject your null hypothesis, you can prove statistically that your discount has some non-random effects.
