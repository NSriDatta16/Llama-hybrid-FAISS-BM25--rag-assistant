I've never been a fan of the dogma of "only a single assertion per test." It just doesn't seem practical to me - you end up with a lot of fluff (test declarations) around what you're actually interested in. Yes, if you've got multiple issues you'll only have one test failure. You fix the test, run it again, spot the next failure, fix that and repeat until it succeeds. No great loss. I'm not saying that you should be testing huge amounts of functionality in each test - but going to the other extreme isn't pragmatic either. I would normally only go for one error condition per test though - so if your constructors would actually throw exceptions for null arguments, I'd check each of those in a separate test. It's easy to accidentally miss something otherwise.
