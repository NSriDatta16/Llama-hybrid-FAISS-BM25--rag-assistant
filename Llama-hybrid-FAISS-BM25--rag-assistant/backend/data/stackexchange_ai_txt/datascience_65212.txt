Hello, anyone able to direct me to a "cheat sheet" of Neural Network equations with legends?

Can anyone here can direct me to a site that provides a cheat sheet of equations for Neural Networks with a legend for the notation? It can be on any and all aspects of NN, be it forward or back propagation, activation function, CNN, RNN etc. I have some reading material with the equations and I have worked through them. I am looking for a site that breaks it down by notation by legend. For example, without posting a specific equation, a landing page/cheat sheet that identifies each element in the equation, such as: b= bias w= weight a=activation the signification of what numbers are vectors in the equation etc. I work through equations but find most literature lacking in descriptions within the equation, which makes it difficult for someone who is trying to refresh their linear algebra and calculus. Thank you.
