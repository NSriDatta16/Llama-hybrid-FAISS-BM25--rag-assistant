I don't really think this is a useful way of looking at things. For instance, you could classify time series as "seasonal" versus "non-seasonal" - but this classification, by itself, won't tell you whether you are looking at ice cream (high sales in summer) or snow shovels (high sales in winter). Even if your classification is more fine-grained and classifies a given time series as "seasonal, with high sales in summer", your forecast would still depend on whether you are forecasting for summer or for winter. Same problem if you classify as "trended" versus "non-trended". If your classification involves finding the orders of an ARMA model, you still need to estimate the parameters. (And to know how far out you want to forecast.) I would not say that time series classification involves "projecting the outcome of a certain data set onto a predefined group of outcomes". I think the term "outcomes" is misleading here. In my view, time series classification is more about detecting features in time series, like the ones discussed above. These can then help you to choose and estimate an appropriate model (or multiple ones, for forecast combination), so you don't forecast an obviously seasonal series using a non-seasonal model. But you still need to fit that model and extrapolate.
