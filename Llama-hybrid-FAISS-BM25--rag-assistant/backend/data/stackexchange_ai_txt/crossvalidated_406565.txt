Does a PCoA (or MDS) assume normality of the variables behind distances?

More precisely, if I conduct a cmdscale (classical multidimensional scaling) on an Euclidean distance matrix by considering $n$ observations of $p$ variables i.e. $D_{ij}=\sqrt{ \sum_p (x_{ip} - x_{jp})^2}$ with $i$ and $j \in n$ : Must the distributions of $x_p$ be normal (like in a PCA) ? And actually, if $p=1$ , does it then mean something to conduct the PCoA and then do a clustering analysis?
