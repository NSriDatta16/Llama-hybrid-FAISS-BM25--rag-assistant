Well, a few thoughts: I would definitely not use the SupplierName as the primary key for your Suppliers table. Use something else - either you have some given item (e.g. a "Supplier Number" from some other system) that you can use, or if not, them just use a simple INT (possibly with an IDENTITY) to uniquely qualify each supplier Same goes for Product (use the ProductID, if that's unique and stable) and OEM (again: use some kind of a given, unique item of information, but not a name, or create your own "OEM ID" of sorts) Why do you have a SupplierProductID and a OEMProductID on your SupplierProducts table? There might be a good reason for that - just not obvious to me at first sight. I personally don't like to overuse GUID's - they're cumbersome, they're big and fat (when compared to an INT), they have all sorts of nasty consequences in your SQL Server indices (index and table fragmentation) - so unless you have a really good reason for a GUID (like replication amongst several physical locations), I typically prefer to use INT's - either ID's that I generate myself, or that I leave up to the database to handle (INT IDENTITY).
