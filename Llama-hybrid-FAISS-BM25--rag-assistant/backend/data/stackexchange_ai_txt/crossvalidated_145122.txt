Real-life examples of Markov Decision Processes

I've been watching a lot of tutorial videos and they are look the same. This one for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip4iSMRW5X4 They explain states, actions and probabilities which are fine. The person explains it ok but I just can't seem to get a grip on what it would be used for in real-life. I haven't come across any lists as of yet. The most common one I see is chess. Can it be used to predict things? If so what types of things? Can it find patterns amoung infinite amounts of data? What can this algorithm do for me. Bonus: It also feels like MDP's is all about getting from one state to another, is this true?
