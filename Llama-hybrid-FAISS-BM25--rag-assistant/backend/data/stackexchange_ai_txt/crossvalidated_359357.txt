There's no reason why you can't do clustering with the number of objects lower than the dimensionality of each object. However, there are practical reasons for why you shouldn't do this. 114 variables is a lot. You should consider going through and removing variables that you would consider unimportant if you have domain knowledge. If you don't, you could opt for dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA or perhaps factor analysis.
