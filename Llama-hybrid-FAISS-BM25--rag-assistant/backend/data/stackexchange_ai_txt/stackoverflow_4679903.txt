I don't like the having three columns for the "up to three" classifications. In my opinion it would be better to have a cross-reference table that allows your many-to-many mapping between organisation and type, i.e. table ORGANISATION_GROUPS with columns OrganisationId, OrgGroupId. To sort out the problem of being able to query a different levels of classification specified you could setup this cross-ref table to hold the actual classifications, i.e. ORGANISATION_GROUPS instead has columnns: OrganisationId, ClassCode, CategoryCode, TypeCode. This will make queries at different levels of classification very easy. For referential integrity to work with this scheme I'd then suggest not using surrogate integer keys for your ORG_* tables but instead setting the primary key to be the real unique key, i.e. ClassCode, CategoryCode, TypeCode for ORG_TYPE.
