Will Django's cache modules work on Google App Engine?

I am running Django (1.0.2) on Google App Engine, and would like to know which (if any) of the following Django caching modules ought to inherently work with Google's memcache implementation: Middlewear django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware Decorators django.views.decorators.cache.cache_page Template fragment caching In a template: {{ load cache }}{% cache 500 cache_name %}...cached...{% endcache %} Low level API django.core.cache If some or all of these modules ought to work, are there any changes necessary to make them work properly, and are there any concerns or pitfalls ought one be aware of when using them? I've perused the documentation and spent some time searching Google, but I haven't seen the answer to this. I suspect it may be a "turn-key" solution, but am wary of using the Django classes without at least one reference that someone else has done it without issue. Thank you kindly.
