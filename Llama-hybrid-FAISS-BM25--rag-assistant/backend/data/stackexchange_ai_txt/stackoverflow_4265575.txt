You can't do this and for a very good reason. If it were possible to disable the back button then malicious sites would all do it to stop you from getting away. Disallowing basic functionality for your users is never a good idea anyway. Saying all that, you can discourage the use of the back button. If you make your logout button POST a form and then respond to the POST directly (rather than redirecting) then the user will see a warning from the browser asking them if they want to re-POST the form. I suppose another trick would be for your page (the one you don't want the user to be able to go back to) to make an AJAX request on-load to the server. If the response from that subrequest indicates that the user is no longer logged in, then your javascript could bounce the user to another page. All this seems like a waste of time to me though, to be honest.
