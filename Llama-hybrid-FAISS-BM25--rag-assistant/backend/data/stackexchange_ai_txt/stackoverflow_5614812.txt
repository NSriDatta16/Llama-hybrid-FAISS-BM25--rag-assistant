android file io

i'm trying to create an app that uses a text file(holding values that will resolve to enums) to contruct a visual interface for the app to display. the question is a little complex so I think it would be better to just explein the outcome: what I want to do is read the file 2 characters(shall be numbers) at a time, that will then be concatonated to a string [str] (with a control character) so that I can tack that string into R.drawable [R.drawable.str] to get back and display the correct image. more specifically is making a string to give to R.drawable even possible to resolve the way I want to, or do I have to dance around it? at some point in my apps development lifecycle I will be implementing the ability to also generate these files as well to be used in divice. so is it possible to insure the user has no access to them but they can still exist as a form of text file? is there anything specific that I need in order to read from a file on the system in "known directory"? can I use carrage-return-line-feed when wtritting my text files and do I need to do anything beyond control code \n to manage it, as forced returns will make it more readable and can add another level of error checking to prevent modification, and system read errors(should they occur)?
