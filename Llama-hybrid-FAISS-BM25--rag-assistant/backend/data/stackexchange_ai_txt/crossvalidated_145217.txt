How to approach time series regression with monthly dependent variable and quarterly independent variables

I am building a regression model where my goal is to obtain a monthly forecast of the dependent variable for the next 2 years. I have a monthly historical series available. For my independent variables, I only have quarterly historical data as well as quarterly forecasts for the next 2 years. My current approach is converting the monthly dependent variable into a quarterly series by taking the simple average of the 3 months in each quarter. Thus my regression uses quarterly series for all variables. The quarterly forecast is converted to monthly by linear interpolation. If it matters, specifically I am using an ARMA model with exogenous regressors (using auto.arima in the R forecast package). I have 13 years of historical data. My question is- would it be better to instead convert the independent variables from quarterly to monthly? I would do just do a linear interpolation which I think is reasonable behavior for these specific variables. Thus I would now be regressing monthly data on monthly data. The benefit I see is obtaining more data points- I would have about 200 instead of 50. And when using lagged variables, I would lose a smaller percentage of the data. Are there any downsides to this approach or any other considerations I am overlooking?
