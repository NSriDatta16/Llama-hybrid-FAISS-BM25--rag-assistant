The model you describe in F) has been used previously in the literature (see my answer here ). It can be seen as a discretised version of the Hawkes process, where the conditional intensity function is the probability of an event happening in a bin at time $t$ , passed through a logit link (just as in logistic regression). From your description of the problem, it seems that you have binary (discretised) data from the start. In that case, fitting the binary autoregression model I linked to is the most sensible approach. The Hawkes model data are the event times, not the event counts, and this might explain the unstable solution you have found with spectral radius greater than one. The marks (values) of the past can be incorporated on top of the times into the logistic specification by adding extra linear terms. This is similar to the marked Hawkes process.
