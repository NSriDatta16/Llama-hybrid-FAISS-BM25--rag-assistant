Interpretation of Interaction coefficients in GLM using categorical predictors (in R)

I ran a Gamma GLM using 3 categorical predictors: Year - with 4 classes Organ - with 3 classes Site - with 3 classes My response variable is Biomass. My model is: GLM The summary(GLM) gives me this (3 coefficients are not defined because of singularities): Estimate Std.Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.34408 0.39101 8.552 7.89e-14 *** year2 -0.55195 0.29480 -1.872 0.06382 . year3 0.65445 0.29480 2.220 0.02847 * year4 -0.20425 0.29616 -0.690 0.49186 organ2 1.62266 0.39846 4.072 8.80e-05 *** organ3 2.64728 0.33840 7.823 3.40e-12 *** site2 1.01485 0.53400 1.900 0.05999 . site3 0.41056 0.52632 0.780 0.43703 year2:organ2 0.03728 0.29480 0.126 0.89959 year3:organ2 -0.03519 0.29480 -0.119 0.90520 year4:organ2 -2.03455 0.30021 -6.777 6.34e-10 *** year2:organ3 NA NA NA NA year3:organ3 NA NA NA NA year4:organ3 NA NA NA NA year2:site2 0.78444 0.36105 2.173 0.03195 * year3:site2 -0.01524 0.36105 -0.042 0.96641 year4:site2 0.28738 0.37216 0.772 0.44166 year2:site3 1.04849 0.36105 2.904 0.00445 ** year3:site3 0.08768 0.36105 0.243 0.80858 year4:site3 0.71053 0.36105 1.968 0.05159 . organ2:site2 -1.41692 0.48655 -2.912 0.00435 ** organ3:site2 -1.59445 0.48655 -3.277 0.00140 ** organ2:site3 -0.86975 0.47763 -1.821 0.07133 . organ3:site3 -1.30913 0.47763 -2.741 0.00715 ** The first coefficient (3.34408) is the intercept, so it stands for biomass for the year 1, site 1 and organ 1. The second one (-0.55195) is the difference between the mean biomass of the year 2 and year 1. The third one (0.65445) is the difference between the mean biomass of the year 3 and year 1. the 4th (-0.20425) is the difference between the mean biomass of the year 4 and year 1. The 5th (1.62266) is the difference between the mean biomass on organ 2 and organ 1. ...and so on until the 8th coefficient After the main coefficients start the interactions. What is their interpretation? YEAR2*ORGAN2 is the difference between what? In addition, year 3 significantly differs from year 1 while year 4 doesn't. What happens between year 3 and year 4? Do they significantly differ?
