Use deep reinforcement learning with recursive actions?

Can we use recursive actions in deep reinforcement learning ? If yes how ? For example, in a reassignment problem, for a task i the neural networks returns a node m , and then there will be some condition : If the node m is busy (If there's already a task j assigned to that node), then the task j will be reassigned to another node and so on until a vacant node will be returned (We suppose that there's always at least one vacant node).
