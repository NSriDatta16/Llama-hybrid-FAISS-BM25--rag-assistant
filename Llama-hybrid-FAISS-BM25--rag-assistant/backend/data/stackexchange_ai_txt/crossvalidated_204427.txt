Simulation of time series from pdf function, defined for each time step, with aucorrelation

I have a model defined by $\mathbf{X}= (X_{1}, X_{2},... X_{t} ... X_{M})$, where for each $t$ (time step) $X_{t}$ follow a distribution ${D(\alpha_{t}, \beta_{t} )}$. I want to generate time series from these distributions. The first thing I tried was a simple sampling, meaning that: 1) I (matlab) generated random probabilities $p_{t}$ from a uniform distribution ($U(0,1)$), 2) I have the cdf $F_{t} $of ${D(\alpha_{t}, \beta_{t} )}$ for each time step, then I found $\hat{y}_{t} = F^{-1}_{t}(p_{t})$, 3) I constructed one time series $\hat{Y^{(1)}}$ and 4) I repeated this process 100 times (then I had 100 time series, $\hat{Y^{(k)}}, k\in[1,100]$) The problem is that my "true" time series $Y$ is autocorrelated until the lag 3, and that each simulated time series $\hat{Y^{(k)}}$ did not display temporal structure at all (no autocorrelation). How could I solve this kind of thing ? I am not familiar with the AR models or MCMC simulations so anyone have an idea in which direction should I start with ? Many thanks !!
