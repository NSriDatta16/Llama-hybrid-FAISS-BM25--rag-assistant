You need to tell the browser (and possible proxies) to disable caching of the file with the appropriate HTTP headers: Pragma-directive: no-cache Cache-directive: no-cache Cache-control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Expires: 0 Of course, you'll just add each these in your script like this: printf "Pragma-directive: no-cache\r\n"; There's a fair bit of redundancy in these directives. All are probably not necessary, but it's good to make sure there's something all browsers and proxies out there understand.
