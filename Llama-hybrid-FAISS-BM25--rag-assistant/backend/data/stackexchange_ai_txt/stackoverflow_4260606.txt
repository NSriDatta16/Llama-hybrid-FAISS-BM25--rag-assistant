Why can't you expand your system to mulitple storage servers? If the documents are not stored in SQL, then SQL performance should be able to handle a large table, assuming you index and maintain it properly (of course there are hardware considerations). You'd just need to alter your application so it would start storing in different locations according to whatever rules you define. SQL 2008 also has a new FILESTREAM function which will increase managebility of the stored files. It looks like SQL will handle all the security and housekeeping on those files. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc949109(SQL.100).aspx
