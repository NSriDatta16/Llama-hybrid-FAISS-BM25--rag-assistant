Not sure what technologies you're using but I use http://github.com/jetheredge/bundler (ASP.Net/MVC) by Justin Etheredge. very simple framework that I could leverage to combine my css and javascript without a lot of fuss The JavaScript minifying and combining is handled by JSMin. Css compressing done with stock YUI compressor. If you're using php am sure there will be some alternative :) As mentioned above using a cdn and reducing http requests can benefit your website.
