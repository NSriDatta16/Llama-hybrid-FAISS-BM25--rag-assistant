The reason is probably that a mouseLeave event was never triggered (hover is a wrapper for mouseEnter and mouseLeave). A similar construction would be this: With the following jQuery I change the image on hover: $("img").hover(function(){ $(this).attr("src").val("/images/stackoverflow-hover.gif"); }, function() { $(this).attr("src").val("/images/stackoverflow.gif"); }); Now, when I hover over the image and click the link, the site is opened in a new tab or window, and when I switch back to my original site, the image will still have the stackoverflow-hover.gif image because the mouseLeave event was never triggered. What you need to do is make sure the behaviour you want is actually triggered. You could do this: $("span.item").mouseenter(function(){ $(this).addClass("active"); }); $("span.item").bind("mouseleave blur mouseout", function(){ $(this).removeClass("active"); }); The bind method will allow you to bind several events to the element, all resulting in the same behaviour. Try this out with several events to see the effects. Also, you could learn about triggering events yourself with jQuery: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ - you could trigger a custom event in the callback of the drag method: $("span.item").drag(function(){ // do some dragging }, function() { this.trigger("myEvents:draggingIsFinished"); }); $("span.item").bind("myEvents:draggingIsFinished", function(){ // do stuff after dragging });
