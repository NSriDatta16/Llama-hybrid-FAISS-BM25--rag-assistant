Pragmas are compiler-specific, so I'd use #ifndef . Preprocessor directives are resolved during (actually, before) compilation, so they do not make a difference in runtime except maybe for compile time. However, you will never notice a difference in compile time from these two alternatives unless you use them several thousand times I guess.
