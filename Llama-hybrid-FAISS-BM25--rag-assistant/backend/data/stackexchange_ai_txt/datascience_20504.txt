How do I forecast sales data down to the individual item?

I have a dataset that looks like, order datetime, customer id, product name, type of product, quantity sold I want a model to forecast sales for each individual item. I'm thinking of using one of the following but would like some advice, literature, or other options. One time series forecast (ARIMA) for each product RNN HMM What's the best method to predict sales of each individual item into the future?
