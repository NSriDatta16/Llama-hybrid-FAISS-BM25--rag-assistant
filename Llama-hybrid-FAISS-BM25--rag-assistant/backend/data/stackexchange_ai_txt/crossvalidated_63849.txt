It sounds like a mixture of the model probabilities is likely to be related to what you want. The question is how to weight. There are a variety of ways to produce approximate model weights. Some examples of methods: i) use approximate Bayesian inference via BIC to derive model weights ( Bayesian model averaging ); ii) use the information-theoretic approach discussed in the book Model Selection and Multimodel Inference by Burnham and Anderson (same approach as before, but using AIC); iii) there's also frequentist approaches ( e.g. ). iv) Outside likelihood-based methods (but not unrelated to them), there's approaches like cross-validation to choose the model-weights. There's probably an approach based on entropy too, I just haven't seen one.
