Generating larger apparent sample sizes in this way is not OK. Bootstrapping multiple samples of the same size, with replacement, uses information already in the original data sample to estimate, for example, how well results from that sample might generalize to other samples of the same size from the underlying population. Bootstrapping can't, however, add additional information that isn't already in the original data sample. For logistic regression, you are limited not just by the number of total observations but also by the number of cases in the smallest of the two classes. That can't be more than 14 in your case, which is barely enough to consider even a single independent variable unless you use a technique like ridge regression to avoid overfitting.
