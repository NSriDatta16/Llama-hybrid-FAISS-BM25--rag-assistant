As far as I understand you want to check if you are able to distinguish these 8 persons using only the 3 features you have chosen. For this kind of problem I would "melt" the data creating dataset with 4 columns: feature A , feature B , feature C , person ID (target variable). In the next step I would try to find the best apporach. As you probably research in psychology I think using a decision tree would be very informative. One big issue is that using this approach you would not utilize e.g. the information about raters themselves. Meaning that people are diffrent. One likes to give everybody high rates, the other one - low. Therefore some standardization of the scores would be nice. I don't know your scale but e.g. you could calculate z-scores within every feature but only for one rater. I don't know if there is a gold standard in this scenario. You probably should also assess inter-rater consistency using e.g. intra-class correlation coefficient, maybe Cohen's kappa or Bland-Altman regression. If you do not have programming knowledge I wouldn't go with R. I would use WEKA machine learning toolkit; as it is very intuitive and has very good MOOC.
