What do I use to describe the difference between two groups in terms of found latent variables

I need to describe what the difference between two groups (patients and normal controls) consists of in terms of latent variables that I can describe within each group. For instance, given this PCA variable map: how do I compare this to with the same latent variables in another group (in this case, the control group)? Edit: That is, what I would like to do is add more individuals to the data set, and a factor specifying which kind the individual described in the row is. From that, if possible, I would like to describe the changes in associations of the measures with the most associated component (in this case Dim 1 for most measures) when going from one group to the other. That is, describe what characterises the differences between the groups.
