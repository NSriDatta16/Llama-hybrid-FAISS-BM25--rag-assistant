I think you are getting bad advice from somewhere. First, it is not necessary to perform either the t-test or the MW test before proceeding to logistic regression. Second, the idea that OLS regression should be used instead of logistic regression because of the small sample size doesn't make much sense to me. With only 22 cases in your smaller group, your logistic regression should include at most 3 independent variables. There have been many threads here on model building.
