Windows Azure Queues need to be polled for new messages. See SDK samples or code here for examples on how to query queues for new messages. Quick list of things to take into account: Because polling is counted as a transaction in Windows Azure, you will be paying for those. It is usually better to implement some kind of retry mechanism if no messages are found (e.g. exponential back-off, etc) It is usually good to retrieve messages in batches (less round trips, less transactions, etc) Remember that messages can be delivered more than once (plan for duplicate messages) Use the " dequeuecount " property to deal with "poison messages". There's plenty of coverage on all these. See the documentation/samples in the link above. This article is pretty good too: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/appfabriccat/archive/2010/12/20/best-practices-for-maximizing-scalability-and-cost-effectiveness-of-queue-based-messaging-solutions-on-windows-azure.aspx
