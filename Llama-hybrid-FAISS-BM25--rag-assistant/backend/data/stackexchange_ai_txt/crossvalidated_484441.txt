Scaling revenues - Drawbacks and advantages of average vs. median scaling

Context Currently I am doing some regression-predictions with various machine learning algorithms (still in the experimental phase). Some features I use for the prediction are revenues customers generate. In order to use the revenues properly I have to scale them. Normally, I have good experiences with RobustScaling like Scikit-learn provides for Python ( documentation here ). Anyhow, this uses the median in order to center the revenues, which is why it is called "robust". Question Since the median represents an actual number within the dataset I am quite unsure if a median is realy the way to go in order to scale revenue-data. The revenues contain outliers which makes robust scaling attractive. On the other hand, I have never seen median-aggregations for any money-data. Also, the fact that revenue-data is a floating-point number makes me unsure if the median is what should be applied here. What are the drawbacks of applying the median to floating-point numbers like revenues in order to scale them? "Drawback" mostly refers to the comparison with using the average.
