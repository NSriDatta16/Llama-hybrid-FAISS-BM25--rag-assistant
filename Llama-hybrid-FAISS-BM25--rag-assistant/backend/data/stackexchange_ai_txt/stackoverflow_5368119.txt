How to consume multiple services using ServiceTracker efficiently?

I would like to use ServiceTracker in order to consume the services published by our company. Instead of creating new ServiceTracker for each service I want to consume I thought it would be better to create just one with a filter and then get the services from it: Filter filter = ctx.createFilter("(" + Constants.OBJECTCLASS + "=com.mycomp*)"); tracker = new ServiceTracker(ctx, filter, null); The problem with this approach is that I then need to iterate over the service references the tracker had found examine their objectClass property and see if I can assign it to the service object which is very cumbersome and error prone due to casting that is required. Any other ideas how to cunsume multiple services using more elegant way?
