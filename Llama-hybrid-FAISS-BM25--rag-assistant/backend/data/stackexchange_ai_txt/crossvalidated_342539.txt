If the time series data are coming from an unchanging data generating process (DGP), having a longer time series (larger sample size) can only be beneficial. Most models will be fit with greater accuracy on more data and thus will generate better forecasts. (A counterexample would be a spurious regression model for a pair of random walks. There, having a larger sample will not necessarily lead to a better estimate of the slope that is actually zero. Hence, if the model is terrible to begin with, a longer sample might not help in improving it.) If the time series are coming from a DGP that is evolving over time and the model does not account for that, more data may either be beneficial or detrimental. A longer history may be a more irrelevant history to the extent that it would harm forecasting performance. This depends on how quickly the DGP is changing and how much history you already have, and how much more history you are adding. [D]oes feeding data from before the break to the time series somehow throw the model off? Yes, it very well may, unless the break is minuscule and the historical data is relevant enough for the new period.
