The number of solutions can be estimated using Donald Knuth's randomised estimation method. Starting from no queens placed the number of allowed positions for the next row is n. Randomly pick one of the positions and calculate the number of allowed positions (p) for the next row and multiple this by n and store it as the total number of solutions (total = n * p) , then randomly choose one of the allowed positions. For this row calculate the number of allowed positions (p) for the next row and mutiple the total number of solutions by this (total *= p). Repeat this until either the board cannot be solved, in which case the number of solutions equals zero, or until the board is solved. Repeat this many times and calculate the average number of solutions (including any zeros). This should give you a quick and pretty accurate approximation of the number of solutions with the approximation improving the more runs you do. I hope this makes sense ;)
