XSLT parse text node as XML?

In the middle of an XML document I'm transforming, there is a CDATA node which I know itself is composed of XML. I would like to have that "recursively parsed" as XML so that I can transform it too. Upon searching, I think my question is very similar to Handling node containing inner escaped XML . That was a year ago: may I just clarify the following: It says this cannot be done by some XSLT in one go: rather you need a two-phase approach. I have just bought a shiny new book on XSLT 2.0. Is is still the case that there is no XSLT instruction to "re-parse" a string node as XML? In my case the XML-string node is just one node in the whole. Therefore in Phase #1 I would only be transforming a fragment of the input XML document; the rest needs passing through unchanged to Phase #2. I see several solutions to passing input to output unchanged, but often it seems they "mostly work", but skip/do not deal with some kind of node inputs. Is there a relaible construct for passing the rest of the input to the output without any changes? That approach relies on me being able to apply 2 transforms separately. I am limited (existing application) to only being allowed one transform (the XML output is fixed; it is transformed by one XSLT file; the only thing I can do is put whatever I like into that XSLT file, and/or add further XSLT files, but I cannot influence the top-level call to pass the XML through one XSLT file). Is there anything I could put into an XSLT file which could cause the second XSLT transform to be invoked?
