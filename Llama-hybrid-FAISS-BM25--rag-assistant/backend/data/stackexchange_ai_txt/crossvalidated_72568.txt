Coverage rates of confidence intervals in reality

One proves mathematically that if assumptions of a model are satisfied, then the coverage rate of a $100p\%$ confidence interval is $100p\%$. But then statistics gets applied to the world, where model assumptions may not be satisfied. Are there any studies comparing the coverage rates of confidence intervals applied to the real world with theoretical coverage rates?
