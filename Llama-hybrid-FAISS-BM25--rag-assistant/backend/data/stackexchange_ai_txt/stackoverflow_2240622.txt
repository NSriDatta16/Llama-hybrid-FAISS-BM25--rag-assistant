The WindowLeaked exception in the log usually happens when you have some sort of async task that is finishing after the activity that began it is destroyed. When you rotate the screen, the activity is recreated. Per the Android docs , you should save any instance state in the onPause method, including making sure that any async tasks are stopped. You can recreate in the onCreate method, using the saved bundle.
