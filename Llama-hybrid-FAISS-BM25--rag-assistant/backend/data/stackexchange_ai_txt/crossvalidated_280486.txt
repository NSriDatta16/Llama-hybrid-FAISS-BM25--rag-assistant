Similarity measures for more than 2 variables

If I have two binary variables, I can determine the similarity of these variables quite easily with different similarity measures , e.g. with the Jaccard similarity measure: $J = \frac{M_{11}}{M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11}}$ Example in R : # Example data N However, I have a group of 1.000 binary variables and want to determine the similarity of the whole group. Question: What is the best way to determine the similarity of more than 2 binary variables? One idea is to measure the similarity for each pairwise combination and then take the average. You can find an example of this procedure below: # Example data N This is very inefficient though and I am also not sure if this is theoretically the best way to measure the similarity of such a group of variables. UPDATE: According to user43849's suggestion the dissimilarity could be calculated with Sorensen's multiple-site dissimilarity: # Example data N almost 1
