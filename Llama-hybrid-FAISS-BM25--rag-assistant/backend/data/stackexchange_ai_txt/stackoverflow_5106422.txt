You can do it with MvcCodeRouting , a seprate open-source CodePlex project. MvcCodeRouting automatically creates the best possible routes for your ASP.NET MVC application. Organize your controllers using namespaces (no more areas) that can go as deep as you want . Default constraints for primivite types that can be overriden on a per-parameter or per-site basis. Intelligent grouping of similar routes for efficient matching. Support for a root controller. Detection of ambiguous routes. Formatting of routes (e.g. make them lower case). Render your routes as calls to the MapRoute extension method, for debugging. Use the same namespace-based base route for organizing your Views.
