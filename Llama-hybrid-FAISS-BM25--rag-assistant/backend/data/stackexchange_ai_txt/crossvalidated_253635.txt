Maximum Likelihoood Criterion vs Maximum A Posteriori

This problem was taken from a free online Computational Neuroscience class {1}. Suppose we are diagnosing a very rare illness, which happens only once in 100 million people on average. Luckily, we have a test for this illness but it is not perfectly accurate. If somebody has the disease, it will report positive 99% of the time. If somebody does not have the disease, it will report positive 2% of the time. Suppose a patient walks in and tests positive for the disease. Using the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion, would we diagnose them positive? What if we used the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion? I'm curious about the actual maths behind the decision outcomes. The correct answers are Yes and No , respectively, but I'm unsure of how to analytically derive those solutions. I would love to see some of the work texted up. References: {1} https://compneuromooc.wikispaces.com/HW3 and Coursera Computational Neuroscience by Adrienne Fairhall, Rajesh P. N. Rao
