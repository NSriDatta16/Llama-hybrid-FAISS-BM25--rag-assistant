How to calculate the odds ratio of continuous variables transformed by restricted cubic splines in a logistic regression model?

I am trying to incorporate several non-linear continuous variables into a logistic model, thus, restricted cubic splines(RCS) is used into the model. However, I don't know how to get the odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals of these continuous variables transformed by RCS. Some paper reported their established model by showing these two parameters of every variables included. As showed in the last column of the picture, the established model with a variable named TST90SaO2 transformed by RCS was reported. In R, what I already know is that the summary() function will show the interquartile-range odds ratios.Is it possible to calculate the odds ratio by the interquartile-range odds ratios or I have to use other function or ways? In the code sample, the Affairs dataset was used and I changed the number of affairs into a dichotomize variable and name it as ynaffairs to act as a dependent variable to be predicted by age, years of marriage, religiousness and rating. fit_aff_rcs fit_aff_rcs Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = ynaffairs ~ rcs(age, 4) + rcs(yearsmarried, 3) + religiousness + rating, data = Affairs) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.
