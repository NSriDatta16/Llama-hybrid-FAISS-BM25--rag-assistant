It would look like: int random = CallHardwareRandomGenerator(); Even with hardware, randomness is tricky. There are things which are physically random (atomic decay is random, but with predictable average amounts, so that can be used as a source of random information) there are things that are physically random enough to make prediction impractical (this is how casinos make money). There are things that are largely indeterminate (mix up information from key-stroke rate, mouse-movements, and a few things like that), which are a good-enough source of "randomness" for many uses. Mathematically, we cannot produce randomness, but we can improve distribution and make something harder to predict. Cryptographic PRNGs do a stronger job at this than most, but are more expensive in terms of resources.
