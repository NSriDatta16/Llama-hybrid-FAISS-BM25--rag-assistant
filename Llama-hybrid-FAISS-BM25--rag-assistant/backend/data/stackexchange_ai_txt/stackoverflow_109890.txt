If your header files generally start with #ifndef __SOMEHEADER_H__ #define __SOMEHEADER_H__ // header contents #endif (as opposed to using #pragma once) you could change that to: #ifndef __SOMEHEADER_H__ #define __SOMEHEADER_H__ // header contents #else #pragma message("Someheader.h superfluously included") #endif And since the compiler outputs the name of the cpp file being compiled, that would let you know at least which cpp file is causing the header to be brought in multiple times.
