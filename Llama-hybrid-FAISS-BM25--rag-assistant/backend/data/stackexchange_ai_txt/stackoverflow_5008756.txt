php templating system - Proper way to load default Javascript behavior for a template

Situation: A PHP Templating system that is responsible for building a pages HTML. Javascript core functions are all in external files Each Template has some default Javascript Functions that need to be called on a per/template basis When A page is rendered, I next need to call a set of Javascript functions: i.e. $(document).ready(function{ API.loadThis(); // all these Javascript functions are in an external JS file API.loadThat(); API.buildDateSelector("#idForSelector"); // etc }); Up until now I have just appended that as text to each of the HTML templates. However, in the case of a Page that consists of multiple smaller Templates (each possibly containing their own initialization Javascript), then I have multiple bits of inline Javascript thrown all over my webpage. My question is: how should I properly organize everything so that I can easily "register" or "trigger" some default Javascript to be called upon page load? Or is appending each block of Javascript to each template (like above) appropriate?
