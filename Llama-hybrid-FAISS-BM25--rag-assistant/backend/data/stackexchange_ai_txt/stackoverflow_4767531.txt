How do I build reusable JSP snippets in an app

I want to build reusable JSP components for an application that I am building. There are multiple ways to go around this. The ones that I know of include building JSPFragments and then stitching the page the together. But that is not an elegant way of doing it. I am also trying to get mt head around JSP tag libraries to be able to build reusable components for JSP. I read in multiple places that tag libraries are falling out of favour fast. There are other frameworks like JSF and Freemarker templates by which I can build re-usable components. What do I use to build these components. Is there a preferred and contemporary approach I can follow?
