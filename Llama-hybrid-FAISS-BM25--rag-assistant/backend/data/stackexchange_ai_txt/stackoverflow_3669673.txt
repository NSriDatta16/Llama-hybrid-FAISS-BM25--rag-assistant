UISegmentedControl with Badge or Highlighting

Occasionally I want to highlight one of segments of a UISegmentedControl , i.e. the third title is "News" and I want to draw user's attention to it. Ideally with a red badge with a number as on the UITabBar - any idea how to achieve this? Feel free to share other ideas as well. I thought about adding the badge as an image just on top of it, but maybe there is some better way.
