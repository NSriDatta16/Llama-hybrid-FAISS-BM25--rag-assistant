Multiclass classification question

I am working on applying Random Forests to a multiclass classification problem, where I have a set of 11 predictor variables and a response that can take the values of "Yes", "No", and "Maybe". In my dataset, which has around 500 rows, I'd say about 95% of the data consists of "No" and "Maybe", there are very few "Yes" responses. When I do the usual splitting of the data into the training and test sets, and then apply the Random Forests, no matter how many trees I have, my test error rate is always very good as it predicts the vast majority of the "No" and "Maybe" responses, but despite me trying many, many times, it NEVER predicts a single "Yes" response. The "Yes" responses are obviously very important, they are not just "outliers", any idea why the random forests or boosting for that matter is unable to predict them?
