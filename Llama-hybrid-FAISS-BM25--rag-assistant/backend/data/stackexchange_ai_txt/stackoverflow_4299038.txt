Yep - Martin's right - usually a good idea when letting users have direct access to storage to have a proxy. EdgeCast supports rsync which will automatically sync content from your server and the EdgeCast storage account. Or you can use our "customer origin" reverse proxy feature for our network to pull content automatically from your servers as its requested by the public. Feel free to contact us at sales@edgecast.com with questions.
