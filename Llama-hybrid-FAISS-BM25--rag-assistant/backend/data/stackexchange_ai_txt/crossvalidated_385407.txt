Are all transient states positive recurrent?

In my Stochastic process lecture notes, I noticed that in problems related to a finite Markov chain, the mean recurrence time are calculated only for recurrent states. I calculated the mean recurrence time of all transient states and found them to be positive recurrent. Is mean recurrence time calculated only for recurrent states? And is it true that all transient states are positive recurrent?
