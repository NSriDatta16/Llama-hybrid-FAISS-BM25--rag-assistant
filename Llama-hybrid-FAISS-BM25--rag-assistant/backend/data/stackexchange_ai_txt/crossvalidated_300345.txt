Yes this will be a Supervised/Classification problem.100 different markers per person become your features input to the model.You can analyze which markers(features) are having a higher correlation to the response(outcome) variable in each case using correlation techniques.You can also use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to narrow down your features.Using linear classifier algorithm (Logistic Regression,LDA etc) on the resultant features(markers) should suffice and give you good classification accuracy.
