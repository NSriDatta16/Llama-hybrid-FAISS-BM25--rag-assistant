MS Access Print Report using VBA

I have a very VBA intensive report. When I preview it everything is great but when I print it after previewing things go wacky. I have spent many hours narrowing down the possibilities and I have conclude with a certain level of confidence that it is a bug in MS Access. Up to this point my method for printing reports was to open the report using docmd.openreport "report" . I then use the docmd.printout command so that I can set the page range, collation etc. Is there a way to print a report directly and still be able to set options like page rage, collate etc without doing a preview first? Thanks, Jeff
