The issue is that the Android User-Agent is a general User-Agent and there is no difference between tablet Android and mobile Android. This is incorrect. Mobile Android has "Mobile" string in the User-Agent header. Tablet Android does not. But it is worth mentioning that there are quite a few tablets that report "Mobile" Safari in the userAgent and the latter is not the only/solid way to differentiate between Mobile and Tablet.
