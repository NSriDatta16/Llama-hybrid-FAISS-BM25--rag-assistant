Clearly, it depends on your exact definition of "regression". Here is what Wikipedia says: In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). by this definition, GLMM are a form of regression, but multivariate regression is not, since it involves multiple dependent variables. A nearly identical definition is in Britanica, Investopedia, and other sources. OTOH, Mathworld says: A method for fitting a curve (not necessarily a straight line) through a set of points using some goodness-of-fit criterion. The most common type of regression is linear regression. Which would also include MLMM The Oxford Dictionary of Statistics ed. by Upton and Cook, adds the notion of "expected value": The expected value of one variable Y is presumed to be dependent on one or more other variables ... which would also include MLMM. I don't have access to the Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences, maybe one of the academics on this site does, and would add that definition. But, so far, I didn't find any definition which would exclude MLMM.
