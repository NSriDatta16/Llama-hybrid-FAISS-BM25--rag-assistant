Concept of "auto" keyword in C

What is the exact concept of the keyword auto in a C program? When I went through the book Deep C secrets , I saw this quote: The auto keyword is apparently useless. It is only meaningful to a compiler-writer making an entry in a symbol table. It says this storage is automatically allocated on entering the block (as opposed to global static allocation, or dynamic allocation on the heap). Auto is irrelevant to other programmers, since you get it by default.
