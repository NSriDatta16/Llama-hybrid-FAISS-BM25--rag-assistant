A possibility is to learn a bayesian network between the features given some background data with no attacks. Learning a bayesian network is useful because it brings out conditional independence between features. Hence, you are not dealing with each and every possible combination of features. For example, if feature A affects B and C and features B and C together affect D, then you only learn a model for how A affects B, how affects C, and how B and C jointly affect D. This model will require far fewer parameters than the entire probability distribution and is the primary reason why bayesian networks are used instead of just storing the entire joint probability distribution. To test for anomaly given a Bayesian network, calculate the probability of incoming datapoint using the learnt Bayesian network model. If the probability is very low, you can flag that as an anomaly.
