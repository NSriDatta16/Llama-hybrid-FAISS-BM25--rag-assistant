I would solve your problem by abandoning C# and writing your program in Inform7 . Inform7 is just about the most awesome programming language I have ever seen and it is specifically designed to solve your problem. The awesome thing about Inform7 is that you write your text adventure in a language that resembles text adventures. For example, here's a fragment of one of the sample adventures' source code: The iron-barred gate is a door. "An iron-barred gate leads [gate direction]." It is north of the Drawbridge and south of the Entrance Hall. It is closed and openable. Before entering the castle, try entering the gate instead. Before going inside in the Drawbridge, try going north instead. Understand "door" as the gate. This adds an object to the game - the object is a door, it is called "the iron-barred gate". A door is understood to be between two rooms, in this case, the drawbridge and the entrance hall. If the player tries to "enter the drawbridge" then the game logic will know that this is the same as "go north", and then the door logic will determine whether the door is closed or not. And so on. It makes writing text adventures extremely easy. Is there some particular reason why you want to use C# instead of a domain-specific language like Inform7? If your goal is to learn how to write C# code or how to build a parser or whatever, then by all means do it yourself. If your goal is to write a text adventure, then I'd use a language designed for that.
