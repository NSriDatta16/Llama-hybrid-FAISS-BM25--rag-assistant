Nested mixed model with longitudinal data and variables with very few observations

I am doing my first data analysis and I have a hard time translating the experiment design to the model I want to fit. I have a couple of basic questions about the overall coding of the model, and a more complicated one that has been giving me headaches. We have 6 amounts of the same fertiliser added to pots containing the same soil. Each quantity is added to 3 pots. Inside each pot, there are 2 plants of the same kind. From each plant, we measure photosynthesis, soil temperature, and soil moisture once a month for 6 months. The pots are in-situ, and the effect of time is known for photosynthesis. (fertil. quantity) 6 x (pots) 3 x (plants) 2 x (time) 6 = 216 observations. > str(photo) 'data.frame': 216 obs. of 9 variables: $ quantity: int 169 169 169 169 169 169 76 76 76 76 ... $ pot : Factor w/ 18 levels "a","b","c","d",..: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 ... $ plant : Factor w/ 36 levels "10e","11f","12f",..: 11 22 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 1 ... $ month : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ... $ co2 : num 0.101 0.0669 0.1075 0.0893 0.0846 ... $ tsoil : num 9 8.75 11.05 9.4 10.65 ... $ msoil : num 16.4 18.8 14.4 7.8 15.3 ... Can I consider that plant is nested in pot and pot is nested in fertilizer quantity, with model as follows? full If it’s the case, to avoid pseudoreplication, should I consider plant as subsamples and average their values per pot? full2 If I am not interested in time, is it ok to consider it as a random effect? A random slope comes from the relationship between Y and X interacting with months. full3 Now a little bit more complicated part. There are other variables of interest, that I hope will explain the response, that were measured from the soil after the experiment (after 6 months). So, these variables contain 18 observations (1 per pot) as time and plant aren’t taken into account. Can I even dream of adding them to the model? One idea at the moment is add the variables to the model based on their relationship to the intercepts of pots (n=18) from one of those models above. I haven't found any information about it, so I'd appreciate comments and suggestions.
