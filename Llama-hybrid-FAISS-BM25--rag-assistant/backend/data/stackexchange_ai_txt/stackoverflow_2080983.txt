I don't have MySQL installed at the moment but I guess the first can be achieved with a query similar to this (off the top of my head, not tested, could not work at all): SELECT name, salary FROM emp WHERE salary>(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp); Or, a more complex query would be: SELECT name, salary from emp WHERE salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp) > (SELECT AVG(salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp)) FROM emp); The 2nd one basically selects the employees whose salaries differ from the average of the salaries by more than the average of the difference in all the employees' salaries. Lemme know if it works.
