How to rank film production companies based on weighted ranks?

IMDB uses a Bayesian estimate to compute its top 250 films. Let's say I know all the variables needed to compute this Bayesian estimate for these films. I also have the production company associated with each film. How could I fairly rank the production companies based on the weighted rank (and review counts) of their films? I'd be using all films with a more than m reviews. As a refresher, IMDB uses weighted rating (WR) = (v / (v+m)) × R + (m / (v+m)) × C . It probably doesn't matter, but I'm using R to do the analysis in case there are some packages that can help solve this.
