Two problems with this approach: In a Bayesian regression model, the parameters to be estimated are the regression coefficients, so any priors you have would be on those, not on the distributions of age, height, and weight in the population. If you simulate data in the way you described, then the new age, height, and weight values will be uncorrelated since you used independent univariate normal draws to generate them. This would bias any resulting regression coefficient estimates toward zero. One thing your question brings to mind is the idea of prior predictive checking, which is a way of evaluating whether your prior distributions result in reasonable beliefs about your observed data. You could do this in a manner similar to what you coded above, but you would need to specify priors on the parameters, then simulate data based on the resulting linear models. If you haven't seen it already, I would recommend Ch 4.3 from Peter Hoff's book A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods .
