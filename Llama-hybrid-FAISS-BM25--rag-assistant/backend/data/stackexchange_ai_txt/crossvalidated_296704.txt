Take a look at the R ade4 package's dudi.mix and dudi.hillsmith functions. These are natural extensions of PCA for mixed numerical and categorical data. You'll get different (better!) results using these functions if you first convert an integer column containing a categorical variable into a factor. From the documentation: "dudi.hillsmith allow to use various row weights, while dudi.mix deals with ordered variables. The principal components of this analysis are centered and normed vectors maximizing the sum of squared correlation coefficients with quantitative variables [and] correlation ratios with factors."
