A pooling step based on Rubin's rules will be unsuited to RF, SVM, etc, because these methods typically don't provide standard errors for parameters of interest. Rubin's rules therefore can't be applied apart from the trivial aspect of simply averaging the parameters (accuracy, sensitivity, etc) across all imputed datasets. I would recommend the approach in this paper as an alternative https://www.jstor.org/stable/2291746 . The suggested procedure (roughly) is: bootstrap one dataset impute missing values in this dataset use the imputed dataset to build your model and obtain your parameter estimates. In your case accuracy, sensitivity, etc repeat steps 1-3 B times. B should be on the order usual for bootstrapping, not for imputing. So B=1000 or so - not 5! - depending on size of data, uncertainty pool your parameter estimates using normal bootstrap rules, rather than Rubin's rules. You then have a reasonable estimate not only of the parameters of interest, but also their uncertainty. This approach really is only feasible if you have fairly small datasets or large computing power because imputing 1000 datasets takes time. I'm not entirely confident of the statistical validity of this approach, and I know little about your data. But it should give you an idea of the centrality and uncertainty of parameters in the presence of missing data.
