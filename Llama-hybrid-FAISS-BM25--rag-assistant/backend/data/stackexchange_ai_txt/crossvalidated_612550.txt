Handling Missing Not At Random Data

I'm working with a data set from here: https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge To put it simply, it is a binary classification problem. The gang affiliation variable is pretty useful, but it is only recorded for men, making this a missing not at random data, with the missingness completely correlated with the gender variable. I'd like to use both gender and gang affiliation variable along with other variables. Could someone point me to the resources to handle this kind of missing data? I'm thinking of fitting a logistic regression model and a Bayesian model. Thank you.
