Can I use odds ratio in Google trends?

I want to compare the popularity of several fish types: The way I'm doing it is by using a reference keyword (in this case "fish") and comparing it to whatever fish I'm interested in. I enter both keywords (fish and tuna or fish and salmon etc) in Google trends and it gives me an average of both keywords. Then I simply divide these averages and get an OR. I keep repeating this process for each fish type. Can I do that? And would that be called an Odds ratio? I'm hoping that this way I can get a feel of how popular each fish type is.
