The only serious answer to this question is Use something other than Objective-C Honestly, any way to avoid obj_msg_send() is guaranteed to be fragile and will probably save you nanoseconds per call. If you do have a very short function that is called very frequently, then you should probably just use C to reimplement that function. In almost all other cases, it's not worth the bother.
