multiple digit detection

This question is about detection of a number having multiple digits in a single image. I have a trained model in tensorflow using Deep CNN for image recognition. the training was done on cropped images which only had a digit and its label. Now, the task is to identify any number from the image using this trained model. I would like this model to work on arbitrary sized number. so how do i extract certain features from the image to be predicted so that individual digit can be detected. For reference this is the link to the google research paper though it does not elaborate on the issue here is the data this question is similar but it does not answer fully as digits nay be too small and close to each other.
