What is better, One javascript framework, or multiple frameworks

I am an avid user of the YUI framework ( http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ ). It has its' strengths and weaknesses both performance wise and syntax wise. I have seen a bit of JQuery and I have worked a little with prototype as well but I have stuck mainly to YUI. My question is, is it better to stick with one Javascript library per application, or leverage the abilities of multiple javascript frameworks in your application?
