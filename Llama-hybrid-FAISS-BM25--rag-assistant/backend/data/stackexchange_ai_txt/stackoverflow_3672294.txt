No, there isn't. Interface Builder doesn't have any concept of "add this to an array." It barely even has any concept of arrays aside from being "the thing that NSArrayController manages." If you're interested in this particular item, though, it would make more sense to give it an outlet than to iterate through the top level items. That seems needlessly fragile.
