Analyzing time series in depth

I want to create a code which tests absolutely everything for time-series forecasting accuracy. The current tests that I do are: bptest() - tests against heteroskedasticity (to test if series should be transformed) gqtest() - tests against heteroskedasticity (to test if series should be transformed) RMSE - of in-sample sqrt(mean((data-fitted values)^2)) MAPE - of in-sample mean(abs(100*(data-fitted values)/data)) MAPE - of out-sample (removing the last 4 data points and running model) mean(abs(100*(last 4 data points-the 4 forecasted points)/last 4 data points)) MAPE - of forced out-sample (removing the last 4 data points and running model keeping the same parameters as the model of the full data) ACF and PACF - of residuals data-fitted values Here is a link that will show you my code so you can see what i have done so far and where/what i can add. I dont want to miss anything so as many suggestions as possible please! If you could explain them a little too that would be fab. http://bit.ly/10iUY5Z
