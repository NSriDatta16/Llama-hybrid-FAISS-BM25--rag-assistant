First, I would question why you are just interested in statistical significance. Statistical significance does not necessarily imply an interesting or useful relationship, and in time series analysis there is a particular concern about spurious correlation. You might first look for trends and seasonality in your original variables (so your 25 X's and 200 Y's) then detrend and deseasonalize each variable. (Some of the significant relationships you found may be based on trends or seasonality). Then you can look at the sample cross-correlation function for each pair of variables. This will give you some guidance concerning which pairs of variables are significant and at what lead or lag. If you continue to go the uni- / multivariate regression route, I would at least reserve some of the data as a test dataset. Fit the models on the first forty observations and predict your Y's for the remaining ten. Use a measure of the prediction error (e.g. MSE) to assess the predictive power of the relationship.
