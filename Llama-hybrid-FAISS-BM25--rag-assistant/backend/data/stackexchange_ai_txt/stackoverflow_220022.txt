Its one of those things that you see 1 or 2 applications for, but soon enough someone will come up with a 'killer app' that figures out how to do something more generally useful with it, at superfast speeds. Pixel shaders to apply routines to large arrays of float values, maybe we'll see some GIS coverage applications or well, I don't know. If you don't devote more time to it than I have then you'll have the same level of insight as me - ie little! I have a feeling it could be a really big thing, as do Intel and S3, maybe it just needs 1 little tweak adding to the hardware, or someone with a lightbulb above their head.
