I ran into a similar problem. To fix: 1) In organizer, delete the profile from the phone. 2) Also in organizer, delete the profile from the Provisioning Profile list. 3) Finally, search your computer for provisioning profiles and delete the old ones directly. After that, drag in the new profile and it will work.
