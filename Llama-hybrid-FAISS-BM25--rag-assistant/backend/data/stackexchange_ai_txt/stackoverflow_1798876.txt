It's intended that markup, i.e. the HTML tags, represent meaning and structure, not appearance. It was badly mixed up in early versions of HTML but the standards people are trying to clean that up now. One problem with letting tags control appearance is that your pages don't play well with devices for the handicapped, such as screen readers. It also leads to having lots and lots of tags in your text that don't help clarify the meaning, but rather clutter it with information of a different level. So CSS was thought up to move formatting/display to a different language, which is separate from the text and can easily be kept that way. Among other things, this allows switching stylesheets to change the appearance of a Web page without touching the other markup. And to be able to do that for lots of pages in one swell foop. The tools CSS gives you to do this are not always elegant, I'm on your side there. For instance, there is no way to do effective vertical centering. And horizontal centering, if it's not just text amenable to text-align , is not much better. You have the choice of doing easy, effective and muddled or clean, elegant and cumbersome. I don't understand why Web developers put up with this mess, but I guess they're happy to have at least a chance to get their stuff done.
