Form based login while also applying REST principles

I am a Spring/JavaEE web programmer and am starting to investigate the principles of REST for future web applications, but I can't figure out how to do usable logins. For a Web API it makes sense, but what about end user facing web applications? I have looked into the HTTP Basic/Digest Authentication but that only produces an ugly dialog box. Anyone have any ideas?
