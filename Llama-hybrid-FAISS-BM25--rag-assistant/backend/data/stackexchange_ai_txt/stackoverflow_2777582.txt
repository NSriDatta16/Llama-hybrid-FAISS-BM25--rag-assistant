Using ViewableHeight and ViewableWidth instead of ActualHeight and ActualWidth in my scaling calculations along with setting the scroll bars Visibility to Visible instead of Auto works. However I'll accept another answer that allows the scroll bars to be set to Auto instead. Edit: OK, I've now got the scroll bars set to Visible. Then I do my calculation with the ViewableHeight and ViewableWidth. Then I set the scroll bars back to Auto. This seems to work even if it's not all that elegant.
