I'd suggest to use a centralized storage (this could be a MySQL database table, with a column "language" which stores what language the translation is in). This could also be XML files, one file per language. If you are looking for even more possible file formats, look at this documentation page from Zend Framework: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.adapter.html For the translation I would either create a custom function or custom class, if you are not using a framework that already includes translation. Another option is to use standard PHP functions. Just look for the "_()" function. I haven't worked with these functions though and only just found them, not sure how well they work.
