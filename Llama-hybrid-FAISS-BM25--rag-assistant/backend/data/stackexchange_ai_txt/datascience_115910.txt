Statistic methods to compute the average of a list of metric results

I have a Machine Learning model that fits and predicts many time series at once, so, for each time series I have a metric result, for example, MAE. What I need is to generate an unique value for that metric for the whole model, not just for the individual predictions. The metric results are a list, so they look like this: metric_results = [0.2, 2.5, 4.5, 0.9, 1.6] Possibilities tried for my data: Mean : that doesn't look the best way to compute that, as the results don't represent the quality of the model as a whole, because as there are some zeroed values, the mean goes down, even though I know the model ain't performing that great. Median : even worse results than mean. Geometric mean : cannot be used because there are 0 values. Harmonic mean : same problem as geometric mean. So, is there a better way to compute the average of a list of these values?
