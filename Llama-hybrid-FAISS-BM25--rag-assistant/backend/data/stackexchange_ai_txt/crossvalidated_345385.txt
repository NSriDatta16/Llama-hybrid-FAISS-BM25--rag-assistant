No, you don't need to make the time series stationary. BSTS should be able to handle that. Stationarity is a requirement specifically for AR and ARMA models. BSTS is supposed to handle structural changes in the time series, which means that by definition it should be able to handle non-stationary data - since a structural change in the time series would imply changes to the mean and variance of the series.
