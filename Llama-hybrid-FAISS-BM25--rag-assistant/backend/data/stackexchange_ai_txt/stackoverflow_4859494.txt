I have a set of names in a text file and i need to find out details of that names using a sqlplus query. textfile.txt content: john robert samuel chris bash script #!/bin/bash while read line do /opt/oracle/bin/sqlplus -s user@db/password @query.sql $line done sql query: query.sql set verify off set heading off select customerid from customers where customername like '%&1%'; exit problem is when I run the script I get errors like SP2-0734: unknown command beginning "robert..." - rest of line ignored. can someone tell me how to solve this?
