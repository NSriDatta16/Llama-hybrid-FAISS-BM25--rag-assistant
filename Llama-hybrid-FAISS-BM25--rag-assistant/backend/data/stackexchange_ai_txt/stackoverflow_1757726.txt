The theoretical advantage of *.ico files is that they are containers than can hold more than one icon. You could for instance store an image with alpha channel and a 16 colour version for legacy systems, or you could add 32x32 and 48x48 icons (which would show up when e.g. dragging a link to Windows explorer). This good idea, however, tends to clash with browser implementations.
