getCoverageStatus() returns A bitmask of COVERAGE_ flags*, where isCoverageSufficient() returns a boolean true if the device has the type of coverage specified by coverageType, over some available route; otherwise false . When coded the way you have there is no difference, but in hasMdsCoverage1 you have additional processing that makes them equivalent. isCoverageSufficient may be more convenient it this case, getCoverageStatus may be more convenient in others. I would not be surprised if the former calls the latter. There are many such examples in many different support libraries.
