You don't "login". You "authenticate". World of difference. You have lots of authentication alternatives. HTTP Basic, Digest, NTLM and AWS S3 Authentication HTTP Basic and Digest authentication. This uses the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header. This is very nice, very simple. But can lead to a lot of traffic. Username/Signature authentication. Sometimes called "ID and KEY" authentication. This can use a query string. ?username=this&signature=some-big-hex-digest This is what places like Amazon use. The username is the "id". The "key" is a digest, similar to the one used for HTTP Digest authentication. Both sides have to agree on the digest to proceed. Some kind of cookie-based authentication. OpenAM , for example, can be configured as an agent to authenticate and provide a cookie that your RESTful web server can then use. The client would authenticate first, and then provide the cookie with each RESTful request.
