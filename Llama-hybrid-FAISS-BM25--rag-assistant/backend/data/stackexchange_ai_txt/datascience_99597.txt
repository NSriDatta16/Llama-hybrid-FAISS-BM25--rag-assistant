How can I weight each point in one-class SVM?

I want to give weights to some data points Specifically, these are points related to anomalies (I'm implementing one-class SVM for anomaly detection ) Exactly, I want to consider some data points that are likely to be anomalies as more important data points Is it possible in one-class SVM ?
