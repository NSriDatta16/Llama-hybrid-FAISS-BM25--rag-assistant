Flash AS3 and XML: way to fix line breaks in htmlText that uses tags in the xml?

I'm importing text in from an xml file and i'm using htmlText to try to keep some styling with tags. I have both the regular and bold face font embedded, and the bolding works fine. The problem is that it ads spaces around the words in bold like a paragraph indent and then makes a line-break after them. What's going on, is there a way to fix? fromxmlText.htmlText = theXML.contenttext; If I pull the text in from a txt file it will work fine, but taking it out of an xml file causing funky formatting. lil' help?
