I will explain each loop case one by one, 1. For loop: When you are sure that you do certain no of iterations then go for for loop. 2. While loop: When you are not sure of no of iterations then go for while loop or you want to loop through until the condition is false. 3. do-while :This is same as while loop except that loop is executed for atleast once. Having said that , it is also ok to write one loop for another case. 4. Recursion : If you understand recursion correctly, recursion leads to elegant solutions. recursion is a bit slower than straight forward iteration. There is no performance differences between for,while,do-while.If any,they are negligible.
