How to measure accuracy of GPT model

I am working on a model to build questions automatically from some text My model will analyse provided article and ask authors questions that can help improving their articles How can we measure the accuracy of these ML-generated questions? There is the relevance part of the questions as these questions represent an area of improvement in the article How to measure that? Any previous work on similar models would be a great help too Thanks
