Just to add to the other answers (which look like they should solve your problem), did you try using standard clustering algorithms for you data when constructing your dendrogram? For example, heatmap.2(dataset, , hclustfun = function(c){hclust(c, method= 'average')} ) Instead of using the average distance for clustering, you can also use "ward", "single", "median", ... See ?hclust for a full list. To extract clusters, use the hclust command directly and then use the cutree command. For example, hc = hclust(dataset) cutree(hc) More details can be found at my webpage .
