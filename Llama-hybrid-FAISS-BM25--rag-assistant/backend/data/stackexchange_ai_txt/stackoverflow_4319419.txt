In a .Net web site, what are my options for sending email alerts when folder contents change?

I don't know much about the .Net environment, so my first idea was to just write a console app that scans the folder for new content, and then emails alerts out. Then put the .exe as a scheduled task on the server, executing every few minutes. This seems pretty archaic to me though. Is there a more elegant way to do this for my website?
