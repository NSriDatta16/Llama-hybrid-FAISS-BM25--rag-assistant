Merging these two tables I believe is wrong . A patient is always a human. So it cannot be a business or an organisation. I believe here you have: Address ======= ...... Person ======= AddressId (FK) BusinessEntity ============== AddressId (FK) Patient ======= PersonId (FK) Claimant ======== PersonId (FK) BusinessEntityId (FK) Here PersonId or BusinessId one of them can be null.
