You can modify the system launchd.plist that's bound to this so it launches your custom apache install. You do this by editing the: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist Disabled Label org.apache.httpd ProgramArguments /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND OnDemand SHAuthorizationRight system.preferences Change the /usr/sbin/httpd string to the path to your custom apache install. Make sure you disable Web Sharing first or from the command line: launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist After you edit it, either click the web sharing button or from the command line: launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist For the second question, you can set a redirect in your apache config /path/to/apache2/conf/httpd.conf Not exactly sure where this is for MAMP, the general syntax is: Redirect / http://mydomain.com:591/FMI/IWP/ It's usually good practice to wrap these in conditionals Redirect / http://mydomain.com:591/FMI/IWP/ And I think it'd be a more elegant solution to proxy pass the requests ProxyRequests Off Order deny,allow Deny from all Allow from localhost ProxyPass /filemaker/ http://www.google.com/ ProxyPassReverse /filemaker/ http://www.google.com/ ProxyPass /images http://www.google.com/images ProxyPass /extern_js http://www.google.com/extern_js ProxyPass /intl http://www.google.com/intl ProxyPass /csi http://www.google.com/csi In this example, I'd just have to go to http://localhost/filemaker and it shows the google page. What resources you pass in the ProxyPass depends on what filemaker needs. If you don't care about retaining your domain and you want everything to proxy, you'd ProxyRequests Off Order deny,allow Deny from all Allow from localhost ProxyPass / http://www.google.com/ ProxyPassReverse / http://www.google.com/
