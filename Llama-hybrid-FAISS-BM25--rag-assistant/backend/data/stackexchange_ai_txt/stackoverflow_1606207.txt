You might have a look at the LZO algorithm, which is designed to be lightweight. I don't know whether there are any implementations for the AVR system, but it might be something you could implement yourself. You may be somewhat misinformed about the amount of storage available in EEPROM on your chip though; according to the datasheet I have the EEPROM sizes are: ATmega48P: 256 ATmega88P: 512 ATmega168P: 512 ATmega256P: 1024 Note that those values are in bytes , not KB as you mention in your question. This is not, by any measure, a "shitload".
