The most "important" shortcut is the Secure Attention Sequence , Ctrl + Alt + Del . On XP you usually have to enable it otherwise it just runs Task Manager. While logged in, SAS brings up the Windows Security dialog on its own Desktop , which will get you out of almost anything (such as a hung full-screen DirectX app). The Task Manager shortcut is now (and always was) Ctrl + Shift + Esc . (this answer applies to NT4, 2000, XP and 2003. I can't speak for Vista)
