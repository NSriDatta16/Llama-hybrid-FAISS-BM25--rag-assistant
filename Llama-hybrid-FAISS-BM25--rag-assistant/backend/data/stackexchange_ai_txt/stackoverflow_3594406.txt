I had the same issue but with pages which were page cached. Pages got buffered with a stale authenticity token and all actions using the methods post/put/delete where recognized as forgery attempts. Error (422 Unprocessable Entity) was returned to the user. The solution for Rails 3 : Add: skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token or as sagivo and barlop pointed out in Rails 4 and 5 : add skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token On pages which do caching. Note added by barlop about Rails 5.2 : It deprecated skip_before_filter in favour of skip_before_action . Consider this Q/A or this official RoR doc . The *_filter family of methods have been removed from the documentation. Their usage is discouraged in favor of the *_action family of methods For Rails 6 (as collimarco pointed out) you can use skip_forgery_protection and that it is safe to use it for a REST API that doesn't use session data. As @toobulkeh commented, this is not a vulnerability on :index , :show actions, but beware using this on :put , :post actions. For example: caches_page :index, :show skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token, :only => [:index, :show] Reference
