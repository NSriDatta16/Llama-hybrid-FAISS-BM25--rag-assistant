"Which is better"-questions usually depend heavily on the context. This is no exception. What do you want to be able to achieve with machine learning? If you want to learn it just for the sake of understanding machine learning, then it is best to choose the language in which you can get most support from your immediate environment. Your friends know R inside out? Choose R. Anyway, both languages allow easy enough experimentation with machine learning for you to be able to get the general idea. If you want to get into machine learning in order to do something more specific, there will be differences. Does your machine learning task involve images? Go with Matlab, because you might want to use image processing as well. Do you want to get deep into the theory behind machine learning and use fancy statistical methods for your novel algorithm? Choose R, if you want to use their wealth of functions, or choose Matlab if its programming environment suits you better.
