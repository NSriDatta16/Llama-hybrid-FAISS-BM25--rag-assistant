How to compare Random Forest and Gaussian Process models on a regression problem?

I want to compare the model fitting properties of a Random Forest (RF) and a Gaussian Process (GP) on a regression problem. One way I thought of is by using mean-squared error values on a hold-out dataset. What are other ways of comparing the two models? Since GPs are probabilistic models, we can also visualize the model posterior over the test dataset (for low input dimensions) but I am not sure whether we can do the same thing for RF models.
