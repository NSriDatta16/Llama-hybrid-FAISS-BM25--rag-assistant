What is neural network good accuracy

I am very new at machine learning, and I'm building an artificial neural network that aims to classify inputs into 2 labels. I am training the network with randomly initialized weights and through the stochastic gradient descent. What would you say is an acceptable accuracy for training set and test set? Is around 80% for test set good enough or should I aim to get close to 100%? Thank you so much in advance.
