Assuming that you are randomising participants to use/not use the app, and thatâ€™s all you are randomising (i.e. you are not also giving them $1000 when you assign them to a condition), a much simpler approach is to treat the assignment as an instrumental variable for the treatment of actually using/not using the app. You will be estimating something called the local average treatment effect, which is the effect of app use among people who use the app because they were assigned to use the app. No need to adjust for any common causes of app use/the outcome.
