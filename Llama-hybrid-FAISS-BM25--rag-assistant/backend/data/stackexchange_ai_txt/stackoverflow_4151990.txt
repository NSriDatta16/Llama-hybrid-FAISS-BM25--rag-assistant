How do you Name and Organize CLASS Files?

I use ASP.NET in C#, I am pretty new at developing so I would like have some advice from experts :-). Questions: What is the best practice to organizing CLASS FILES? What kind of name do you use? For Web Application Project, how do you name NAMESPACE? In my Case I am building a simple CMS. I thought the FILE structure like this: - AppCode - Common - UserDataInput.cs - ExternalLibrary - BusinessLayer - FrontEnd - BackEnd - AccessLayer Thanks guys for sharing your thoughts with me! Bye
