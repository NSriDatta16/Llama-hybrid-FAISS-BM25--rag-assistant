Turn off enclosing tags in CKEditor 3.0

Is there a possibility to turn off the automatic enclosing of all written content within in CKEditor 3.x? I tried CKEDITOR.config.enterMode = CKEDITOR.ENTER_BR; but this just changes the inline linebreaks to while leaving the enclosing paragraph. Currently writing "Test" produces this output Test but I want it to be simply Test Is there a configuration property for this or would another inline editor to be better suited for this?
