Appending an existing XML file

I have an existing XML file that I would like to append without changing the format. Existing File looks like this: 1 Steve Lawrence NYC How can I add another user using this format? My existing code is: string fileLocation = "clients.xml"; XmlTextWriter writer; if (!File.Exists(fileLocation)) { writer = new XmlTextWriter(fileLocation, null); writer.WriteStartDocument(); // Write the Root Element writer.WriteStartElement("Clients"); // End Element and Close writer.WriteEndElement(); writer.Close(); } // Append new data here Ive thought about using XmlDocument Fragment to append the data but Im not certain if I can maintain the existing format ( and empty tags ) without messing up the file. Any advice you could give is much appreciated. EDIT Ive changed the code to read the original XML but the file keeps getting overwritten.
