I would first make sure I know why I'm getting a stack overflow. Is it actually because of the recursion? The recursive method isn't putting much onto the stack. Maybe it's because of the storage of the nodes? Also, BTW, I don't see the end parameter ever changing. That suggests it doesn't need to be a parameter, carried on each stack frame.
