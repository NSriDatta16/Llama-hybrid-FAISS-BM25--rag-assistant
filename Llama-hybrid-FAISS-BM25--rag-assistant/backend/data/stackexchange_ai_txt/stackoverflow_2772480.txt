I can't comment on that site in particular, but average time is usually calculated using some very clever bits of javascript. You can set events on various parts of the page in javascript which fire off requests to servers. For example, when the user navigates away from a page or clicks on a link or closes the window the browser can send off a javascript request to their servers letting them know that the user has left. While this isn't 100% reliable, I think it provides a reasonable estimate for how long people spend there.
