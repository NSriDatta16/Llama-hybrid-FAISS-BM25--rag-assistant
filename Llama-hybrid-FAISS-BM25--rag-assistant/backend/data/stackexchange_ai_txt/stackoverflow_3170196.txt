Is it possible to perform a cross site site request forgery attack on a URL that returns a JSON object?

I'm aware that there is a Cross site forgery attack that can be performed on a request that returns an array by overloading the Array constructor. For example, suppose I have a site with a URL: foo.com/getJson that returns: ['Puff the Dragon', 'Credit Card #'] This would normally be Javascript eval 'd by my own site after an XHR request, but another site can sniff this data by including something like: function Array() { var arr = this; var i = 0; var next = function(val) { arr[i++] setter = next; document.write(val); }; this[i++] setter = next; } My question is, can the same thing be done when the request returns a Javascript object? i.e. { name: 'Puff the Dragon', cc: 'Credit Card #' } I couldn't figure out a way to do this, but maybe I'm missing something. I know there are better solutions to protect my site, like using the while(1) hack or requiring an auth token in the URL, but I'm trying to figure out if this sort of security hole exists.
