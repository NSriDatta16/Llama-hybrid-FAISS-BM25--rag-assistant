Machine Learning is not a well defined term. In fact, if you Google "Machine Learning Definition" the first two things you get are quite different. From WhatIs.com , Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. From Wikipedia , Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Logistic regression undoubtedly fits the Wikipedia definition and you could argue whether or not it fits the WhatIs defintion. I personally define Machine Learning just as Wikipedia does and consider it a subset of statistics.
