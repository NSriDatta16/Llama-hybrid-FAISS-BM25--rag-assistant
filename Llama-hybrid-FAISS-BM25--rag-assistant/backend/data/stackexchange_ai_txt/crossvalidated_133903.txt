In addition to sharing a nice collection of books in the Quora thread that I've referenced in my comment above, I would like to share my personal selection of the IMHO top core statistics (excluding machine learning, econometrics and other specialized domains) books from my extensive Amazon wishlist's statistical books section (not sure about some of them being considered "best" or "classical", though). I plan to revamp the foundation of my statistical knowledge eventually (I have no formal education in statistics), based on studying these books: Probability and General Statistics "Introduction to probability" by Blitzstein and Hwang (based on Harvard's statistics course); "All of statistics: A concise course in statistical inference" by Wasserman; Regression and Statistical Modeling Strategies "Regression modeling strategies: With applications to linear models, logistic regression, and survival analysis" by Harrell; "Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models" by Gelman and Hill; Bayesian Statistics "Bayesian data analysis, 3rd ed." by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari and Rubin; "Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan, 2nd ed." by Kruschke (a more accessible alternative).
