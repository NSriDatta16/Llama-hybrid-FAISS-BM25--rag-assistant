Download and upload of data (eg. serialized objects) from a phone to a webserver

I'll be very simple: I want to be able to store Java objects from the phone to a webserver. Then, I want to be able to retrieve them later. What could be a good combination of tools/webservers/languages to achieve this? I have done that before with a serialization of objects through a LAMP server. Example [java object on the android phone] -> [object serialization] -> [POST request to PHP webserver ] -> [storage in a database] Do you know any better and comfortable technique? Can I work directly with Java objects using a JSP/Servlet? Thank you.
