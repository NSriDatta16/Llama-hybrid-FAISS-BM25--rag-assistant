Neural Network with ordered categorical output

We tried to predict valuef for univariate time series. Sometimes they trend. Firstly we calculated 6 levels: 3 up and 3 down. Values for tending occur for some levels. These levels can be understood as a value's borders for some time. Our purpose is to predict what levels will be reached. When sent to a neural network the position of value among the levels and with some different additional information, how can we get an output? Is it a classification? What should be used: NN or decision trees?
