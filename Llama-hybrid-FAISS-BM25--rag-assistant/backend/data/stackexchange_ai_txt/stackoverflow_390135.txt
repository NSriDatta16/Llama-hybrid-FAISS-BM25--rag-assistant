Inserting a Comment in Docx file *around* a text inside a run

How do you search for a specific text inside a text run (in Docx using the OpenXML SDK 2.0) and once you find it how do you insert a comment surrounding the 'search text'. The 'search text' can be a sub string of an existing run. All example in the samples insert comments around the first paragraph or something simple like that... not what I'm looking for. Thanks
