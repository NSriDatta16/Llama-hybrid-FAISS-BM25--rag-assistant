flex- Drag and drop

I am trying to drag and drop an object across the SkinnableContainer- am coming across a very strange issue The drop occurs only at a few places- elsewhere it just shows the "X" sign and on dropping there, reverts to original position. I have used very standard commands... from function 2 to function 3, the call occurs very rarely as seen in trace statements- any guidance on why this happens? I added the following code to SkinnableContainer: dragEnter="dragEnterHandler(event);" dragDrop="dragDropHandler(event); (1) : private function mouseMoveHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { var dragInitiator:Image = Image(event.currentTarget); var ds:DragSource = new DragSource(); ds.addData(dragInitiator,"img"); //made change here DragManager.doDrag(dragInitiator, ds, event); } (2) : private function dragEnterHandler(event:DragEvent):void { if (event.dragSource.hasFormat("img")) { trace("came here"); //comes here for each mouse move DragManager.acceptDragDrop(SkinnableContainer(event.currentTarget)); } (3) : private function dragDropHandler(event:DragEvent):void { trace("in drag drop handler"); //doesn't come here for most places
