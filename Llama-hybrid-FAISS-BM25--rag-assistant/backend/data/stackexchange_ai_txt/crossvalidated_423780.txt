Question about Bayesian Polling

A professor in the United States reads a headline stating that only 36% of Americans have ever been outside the U.S. She believes the headline to be true and would like to know whether the 30 pupils enrolled in her history class are more or less traveled than the average American. One day she conducts a poll and finds that 7 of the 14 students present that day have travelled abroad. How likely is it that more than 36% of her class has traveled internationally? I am not sure of the best way of attacking this problem from a Bayesian perspective. Let's say, for arguments sake, that before running the pole, she believes that her students are a legitimate random sample of the American population so that the 36% number can be used to inform a prior. The reason this problem is tricky to me is that it is asking a question about a finite population. Had she polled 29 of the 30 students and found that only 7 had traveled abroad, then there is a 0% probability that more than 36% of her class has international traveling experience.
