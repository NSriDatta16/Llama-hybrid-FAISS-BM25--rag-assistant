PCA with low variance ratio

I am trying to conduct PCA on a dataset with 17 features (which includes dummy variables; I converted two categorical variables into their corresponding dummy variables), and the first two principal components have a total explained variance ratio of 27% (15% and 12% respectively). I am trying to understand what does this mean? PCA/ dimensionality reduction is not appropriate here as I am losing out on 73% of the information? I shouldn't have included dummy variables in my PCA analysis? Converting two categorical variables to their corresponding n-1 dummies is not a good idea? Can you please help me, I am new to PCA!
