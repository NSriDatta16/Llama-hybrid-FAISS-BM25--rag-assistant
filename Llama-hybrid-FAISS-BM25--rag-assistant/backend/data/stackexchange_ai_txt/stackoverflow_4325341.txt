Question about embedding Flash: swfObject vs

I noticed that the Flash CS5 IDE publishes a very lean html code (see below) which appears to utilise the tag. This seems to work very well - although I have this nagging feeling that I should be using swfObject .. how is swfObject different to the tag? I've tested the code on all the browsers (IE6 included) with no problems. Is it time to ditch swfObject? Or are there features I'm overlooking? If swfObject is the "standard" why doesn't the latest Flash IDE utilise it? --> Get Flash -->
