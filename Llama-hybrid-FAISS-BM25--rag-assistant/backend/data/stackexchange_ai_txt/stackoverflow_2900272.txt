Example using LibXML , which is the standard big hammer for XML. Not lightweight, but your problem really is a familiar nail and at least we're not spending much time writing code, either. use XML::LibXML (); XML::LibXML::Document->new('1.0', 'UTF-8')->createTextNode($text)->toString; # returns properly encoded fragment See method toFile for writing into a file.
