Finding similar users

I am working on a problem in the online advertising space. I am trying to identify consumers similar to the set of consumers who have bought a product in the past (have 'converted'). If I can identify 'similar' users, I can deliver them targeted messaging with the goal of turning them into paying customers. I have approached this as a predictive modeling problem. I have been using KNN and logistic regression to determine major factors that influence the target variable ('being a converter'). I feel that I am approaching this wrong, as in my set of 'non-converters' I have a set of people who are quite similar in every way to 'converters'. So if I built a perfect model it would not be helpful in detecting 'non-converters' who should be 'converters'. My ultimate goal is to detect the non-converters who behave similarly to converters. Should my goal with the model be to predict converters with high accuracy, and argue that users classified as converters who were actually non-converters fall into the set of consumers I should be targeting? Can someone help push me in the right direction?
