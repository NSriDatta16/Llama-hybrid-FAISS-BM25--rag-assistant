Output of Logistic Regression Prediction

I have created a Logistic Regression using the following code: full.model.f = lm(Ft_45 ~ ., LOG_D) base.model.f = lm(Ft_45 ~ IP_util_E2pl_m02_flg) step(base.model.f, scope=list(upper=full.model.f, lower=~1), direction="forward", trace=FALSE) I have then used the output to create a final model: final.model.f = lm(Ft_45 ~ IP_util_E2pl_m02_flg + IP_util_E2_m02_flg + AE_NumVisit1_flg + OP_NumVisit1_m01_flg + IP_TotLoS_m02 + Ft1_45 + IP_util_E1_m05_flg + IP_TotPrNonElecLoS_m02 + IP_util_E2pl_m03_flg + LTC_coding + OP_NumVisit0105_m03_flg + OP_NumVisit11pl_m03_flg + AE_ArrAmb_m02_flg) Then I have predicted the outcomes for a different set of data using the predict function: log.pred.f.v I have been able to use establish a pleasing ROC curve and created a table to establish the sensitivity and specificity which gives me responses I would expect. However What I am trying to do is establish for each row of data what the probability is of Ft_45 being 1. If I look at the output of log.pred.f.v I get, for example,: 1 -0.171739593 2 -0.049905948 3 0.141146419 4 0.11615669 5 0.07342591 6 0.093054334 7 0.957164383 8 0.098415639 . . . 104 0.196368229 105 1.045208447 106 1.05499112 As I only have a tentative grasp on what I am doing I am struggling to understand how to interpret the negative and higher that 1 values as I would expect a probability to be between 0 and 1. So my question is am I just missing a step where I need to transform the output or have I gone completely wrong. Thank you in advance for any help you are able to offer.
