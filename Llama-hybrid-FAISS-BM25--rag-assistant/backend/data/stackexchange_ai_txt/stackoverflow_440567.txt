Practice and read. Repeat :) Some recommended books: Clean Code by Robert C Martin GoF Design Patterns Refactoring by Martin Fowler Personally I also liked Head First Design Patterns, but the style may not be for everyone. There's a similar book called C# 3.0 Design Patterns (see ora.com). It has much of the same stuff, but in a more traditional manner.
