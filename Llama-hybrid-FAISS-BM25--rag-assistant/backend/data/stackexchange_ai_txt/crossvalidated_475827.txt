What smoothing parameter makes sense for a LOESS calibration curve?

I am creating a calibration curve to asses the fit of a logistic regression. Does it make more sense to use the local or global optimum smoothing parameter for the LOESS line? The orange line uses the global optimum smoothing parameter, the blue line uses the global optimum. Both are types optimum parameter values determined algorithmically. The global optimum looks nicer, but I worry that I am over-smoothing and would be unable to detect actual model miscalibration. The local optimum (orange) has the opposite problem - I may be including too much noise, making the calibration curve useless. Note: For SAS users, the LOESS statement in PROC SGPLOT uses the global optimum by default. Whereas, the PROC LOESS uses the local optimum smoothing parameter by default.
