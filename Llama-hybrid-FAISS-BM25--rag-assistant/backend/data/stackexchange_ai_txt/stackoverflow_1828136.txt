Saving (Rich)TextBox's to memory and switching them off with a richtextbox in my form in C#

My goal is to have one main richtextbox in the form, and then several different richtextbox's in the backround, the backround textbox's get added, removed, and edited behind the scences all the time... and i need a way to swap my richtextbox in the form with the richtextbox's in the backround. what i origannally had was a Dictionary Dictionary RichTextBoxs = new Dictionary (); and would just go string Data = "string"; RichTextBox box = new RichTextBox(); box.Text = "Session for \""+Data+"\" started!"; box.Tag = (string)Data; RichTextBoxs.Add(Data, box); and it saves fine, but the moment i try something like richTextBox1 = RichTextBoxs[(string)Data]; Nothing happens! i can copy over attributes like richTextBox1.Text = RichTextBoxs[(string)Data].Text; works fine, but i need to copy ALL the properties, along with my advanced color formatting in the textbox's. i dont know why it isnt working, because as far as i know it should! Summary: I need to be able to swap out form textbox's with stored textbox's ~code exampled appreciated! and thanks in advance!
