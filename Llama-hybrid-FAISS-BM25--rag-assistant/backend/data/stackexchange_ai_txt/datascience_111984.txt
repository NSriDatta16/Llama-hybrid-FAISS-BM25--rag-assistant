Impact of small objects of multiple sizes on the performance of Tensorflow object detection API

I have asked the same question in StackOverflow . However, no one has answered the question yet. I am using Mask R-CNN with Inception ResNet-v2 from TensorFlow Object Detection API . However, the average precision (AP) and recall (AR) of objects of small size are not good enough. Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.172 Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.50 | area= all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.308 Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.75 | area= all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.174 Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.021 Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.157 Average Precision (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.293 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= all | maxDets= 1 ] = 0.148 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= all | maxDets= 10 ] = 0.212 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.213 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.036 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.205 Average Recall (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.329 I am inspecting for the problems and increasing performance by solving those. I found that there are small objects of size less than 32 * 32. And large objects of size more than 512 * 512 of the same class focused in the image. I am considering the impact of multiple shapes from the same object class in object detection. Is it impacting the training? How can I test the hypothesis? Can someone point me to any similar problem and solution?
