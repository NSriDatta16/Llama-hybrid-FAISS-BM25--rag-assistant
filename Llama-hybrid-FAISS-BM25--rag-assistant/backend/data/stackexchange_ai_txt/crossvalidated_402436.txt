What a person needs to know is going to depend on a lot of things. I can only answer from my perspective. I've worked as a data analyst for 20 years, working with researchers in the social, behavioral and medical sciences. I say "data analyst" to make clear that I view my job as a practical one: I help people figure out what their data means. (In an ideal situation, I also help them figure out what data they need, but ... the world is not ideal). What my clients need to know is to consult me (or someone else) early and often. I find it fascinating but rather odd that scientists with advanced degrees and a lot of experience in their fields will simultaneously Say that statistics is hard Admit that they have little training or expertise in it and Do it on their own anyway. No. This is the wrong way to proceed. And if this question is viewed as an attempt to figure out what a researcher needs to know, then I think the question is rather wrong-headed. It's like asking how much medicine you need to know in order to visit the doctor. What I need to know is When I am out of my depth. No one knows all this stuff, certainly I don't. A whole lot about models, methods and such, when each can be applied, what each does, how it goes wrong, alternatives etc. Also, how to run these models in some statistical package and read the results, detect bugs etc. (I use SAS and R, but other choices are fine). How to ask questions. A good data analyst asks a lot of questions. Enough matrix algebra and calculus to at least read articles. But that's not all that much. Others will say that this is inadequate and that I should really have a full grasp of (some list of advanced math here). All I can say is that I have not felt the lack, nor have my clients. True, I cannot invent new methods but 1) I have rarely felt the need - there are a huge variety of existant methods and 2) Most of my client have a hard enough time recognizing that you can't always use OLS regression, trying to get them to accept a totally new method would be nearly impossible and, if they did accept it, their PHBs would not. (PHB = pointy haired boss, a la Dilbert and could be a committee chair, a journal editor, a colleague or an actual boss).
