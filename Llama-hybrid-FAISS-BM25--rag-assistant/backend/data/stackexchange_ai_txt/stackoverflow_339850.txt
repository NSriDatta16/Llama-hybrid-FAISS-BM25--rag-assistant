Two questions. Does that file exist anywhere in your install tree? Check it again please, most codes are only 7 characters. The closest I've found is C57I1ML but that's part of Websphere Studio Site Developer 5.1.2. And, on top of that, WSAD 5.1.2 seems to have the C80 prefix. BTW, there's no C571ILML anywhere on the IBM intranet that I can see. EDIT: The standard Websphere Studio Application Developer 5.1.2 for Windows has five disk images located on IBM's Xtreme Leverage site, those being C802XML, C802YML, C802ZML, C8030ML and C804UML. I suspect your missing file is due to the fact that you only have the contents of four of those disk images. You'll need to go back to your source and get the other disk image (or contents). Alternatively, you may have the Integration Edition, in which case I'll need to look again - please clarify which one you have.
