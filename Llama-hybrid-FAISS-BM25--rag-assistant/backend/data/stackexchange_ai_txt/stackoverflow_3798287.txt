Creating an online visual designer using silverlight

I'm trying to create an visual designer like Visual Studio, Expression Blend, Dreamweaver etc as an ONLINE APPLICATION (ASP.NET). Can Silverlight be helpful with this? What are the things i need to be aware of before starting developing this online app? How good is it dragging, dropping & moving controls around with Silverlight? Thank you.
