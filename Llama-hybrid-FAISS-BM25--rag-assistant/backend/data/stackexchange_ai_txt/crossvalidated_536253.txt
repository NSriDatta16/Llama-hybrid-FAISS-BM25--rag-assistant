I hope this may help you to get further in solving your problem. I will assume you have a basic knowledge and understanding about mixed models. If not, you should start reading examples about simple linear model, before considering your design further. To be honest I thing you should restructure your model, however i may have misunderstood you. If so feel free to comment. You mention 2 males and 2 females, and an outcome (x). So you data should look something like, x | gender | id ---------------- | male | 1 | male | 2 | female | 3 | female | 4 | male | 1 | male | 2 | female | 3 | female | 4 With multiple observations pr. id. Thus I would start with a simple model. M1 x ~ gender + (1|id) Here I omitted for now your controlling factors. So let's look at them. First, you mention position. And based on above you would expect an interaction between gender and position. So now your model is M2 x ~ gender*position + (1|id) The problem with anova for mixed model is the interaction term. So to consider either one (gender or position), we first need to check the interaction term. You can do this in an anova for mixed models. If the interaction term is either significant or highly relevant to include based on your theory, we cannot use anova to test in this model. Instead we can use the F-test to go from M2 to M1, hence testing if position has significant influence on x under the model. I think R uses the Anova command for this, but you better check it to be sure. To investigate gender, we can create model M3 and do something similar. M3 x ~ position + (1|id). That ends the first part. Secondly you have a structure with multiple variables to correct for. You add control_variable_SympathyAttractPro + (1|Single_posture) + (1|Single_person) To the model. I would exclude (1|Single_posture) + (1|Single_person) , unless you have an argument for including them. If you want to include them as random effects pay attention to how you add them as random terms. You can easily find information on this online, so I will refer to internet here. However if you include them as random effect. I would not trust the tests mentioned above. You will need to include the random term when testing since it includes information on position and gender. In short I would recommend the following model for testing. x ~ gender*position + control_variable_SympathyAttractPro + (1|id)
