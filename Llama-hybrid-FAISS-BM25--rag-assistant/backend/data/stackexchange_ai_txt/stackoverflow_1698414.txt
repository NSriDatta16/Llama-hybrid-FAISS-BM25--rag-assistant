I've never understood how the manifest stuff all hangs together ... but instead of placing the C runtime DLLs in the same directory as your exe try copying the whole 'Microsoft.VC90.CRT' folder from the redist folder in the Visual Studio install (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\x86\Microsoft.VC90.CRT on my machine). I believe Microsoft encourages the use of shared libraries and running the official redist since it installs the libraries 'properly' and means they can patch security issues that may be found in them.
