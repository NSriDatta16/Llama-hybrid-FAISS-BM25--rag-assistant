What is the main difference between Hadoop and Spark?

I recently read the following about Hadoop vs. Spark: Insist upon in-memory columnar data querying. This was the killer-feature that let Apache Spark run in seconds the queries that would take Hadoop hours or days. Memory is much faster than disk access, and any modern data platform should be optimized to take advantage of that speed. Also, columnar data storage greatly reduces the amount of memory spent on empty or redundant data. Can someone explain: 1) what Apache Hadoop and Spark are, 2) how they differ, and 3) how this relates to memory vs. disk access.
