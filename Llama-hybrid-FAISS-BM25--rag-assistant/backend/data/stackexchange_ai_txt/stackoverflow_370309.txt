On SourceForge, if you apply the filter "Require", "Programming language", "D", you get 113 hits, so it would seem so. I've always been a bit worried about developing in D since I know little about this Digital Mars mob. Does D have a future outside of just piquing the interest of some nerds (using that term in a non-disparaging way)?
