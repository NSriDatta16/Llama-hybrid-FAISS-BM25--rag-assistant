It's not clear what you're trying to ask. You just mentioned some problems you have encountered while using BE.NET. However here's my point of view about BE.NET: BlogEngine.NET is one of the most popular blog engines written under .NET Framework (Current version [BE 2.0] under .NET Framework 3.5). It has a very flexible widget-extension API that you can use to be able to write anything you desire. It's in active development and from my personal experience, they reply pretty fast about the problems users encounter on their CodePlex forum. It supports XML as data storage as well, which can be a very good feature for people who want to have their blog on a cheap hosting server. Compared to Wordpress: BE is not nearly as big and popular as Wordpress. You should not expect such support you get on wordpress from BE team. Wordpress has many more ready to use addons-plugins. I have decided to go with BlogEngine.NET, Because I'm a .NET developer and I wanted to have full control over my blog's source code. Every time I think my blog is missing something and I can't find a good solution on the internet, I write a widget/extension thanks to BE's extensible plugin architecture. At last, If you're a .NET developer and you'd like to have a blog engine written under .NET Framework and want full control over it and don't mind writing and contributing extensions/plugins which have not been yet written, Go with BlogEngine.NET, otherwise, Wordpress might be a better choice.
