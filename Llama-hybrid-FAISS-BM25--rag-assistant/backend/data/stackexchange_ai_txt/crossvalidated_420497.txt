I agree with BruceET that Silverman's work offers a good read on kernel density estimation (KDE). However, it is far from recent. A good recent overview on KDE is given in "Scott - Multivariate Density Estimation". You can also have a look at "Simonoff - Smoothing methods in statistics" (less recent). One major development after Parzen's and Silverman's work is variable (or adaptive) kernel density estimation (VKDE), where you use a different bandwidths $h_j$ for each sample point $x_j$ : $$ \hat f(x) = \frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^{J} h_j^{-d} K\left(\frac{x-x_j}{h_j}\right), $$ (this approach can be generalized by using unisotropic kernels, i.e. $h_j$ being a matrix). VKDE is also discussed in Scott's book with many references to Abramson, Jones, Terrell, Wand and others. One particular publication I would stress (this is subjective) is the one of Botev, Grotowski and Kroese , for which there is a free Matlab implementation by Botev here . Remark: It is not quite accurate that VKDE began after Silverman's work, since it was pioneered in 1977 by "Breiman, Meisel, Purcell - Variable kernel estimates of multivariate densities". But a lot of its development came later.
