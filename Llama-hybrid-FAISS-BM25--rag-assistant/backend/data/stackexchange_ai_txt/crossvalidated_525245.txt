The point of using Laplace smoothing is not increasing the accuracy. If you set $\alpha$ to a huge value, it can even make the accuracy worse. With $\alpha=1$ , Laplace smoothing adds one to each of the counts , hence it prevents from problems with having zeros in the calculations. This smooths the probabilities and has a regularizing effect. It is a form of using a prior in Bayesian computation and the impact of a prior diminishes as sample size grows . This is pretty easy to show, if when calculating the empirical probability $\hat p_i = n_i / N$ the denominator $N$ is already large, then if you increment $n_i$ by a small value of $\alpha$ , it would not have much impact on the result. If you want to see a striking effect of Laplace smoothing, use large $\alpha$ , small sample, or make it have counts equal to zeroes.
