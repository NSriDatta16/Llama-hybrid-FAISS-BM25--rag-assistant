Please don't do this, installing an upper-level filter driver on all HID devices is an extraordinarily bad idea. That being said, I'll answer your questions anyways. When you install a driver, Windows manages where the driver itself gets put (in DriverStore), you don't worry about this. See #1 For some drivers, yes. For a filter driver above HID, no. You'd have to force remove all mice and keyboards on their system and re-add them (which isn't possible with PS/2 devices). Yes, it's fairly easy to update a driver given that you correctly version it and require a reboot. Once again, while I don't want to be discouraging, you're only going to get yourself in a world of hurt via doing this.
