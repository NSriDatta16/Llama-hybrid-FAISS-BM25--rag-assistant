JSF CDI Bean initialization on every page access

I'm currently learning about JSF 2.0 and i dont know how to initialize something in my CDI bean everytime a jsf page is accessed ? For example, let's say in my case, i have one CDI bean that is used in one JSF page. Somewhere inside the bean, i would like to query and initialize something, or check authorization everytime the page is accessed (not everytime the action method is called). I could put it into the bean's constructor, but that doesnt guarantee that the constructor would be called for every calls of the jsf page ? Or should i call using the #{myBean.initialize()} on the JSF page ? Regards, Albert Kam
