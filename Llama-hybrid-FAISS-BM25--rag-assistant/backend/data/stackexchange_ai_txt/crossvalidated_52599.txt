Congdon covers time series models (and WinBUGS code) in a chapter in his Applied Bayesian Modelling book. Alternatively, BUGS code for some time series models can be produced in my tsbugs package for R (and then run in BUGS via R2WinBUGS or similar such packages). Some of these are applied to the log of stock returns in the example code.
