Like FrinkTheBrave said, you can use an ide (Eclipse is perfect, because of the Android Development Tools, but you could use any other program. If you work on Windows, and after installing the USB driver , you only need to plug your phone to the usb and hit Run (or debug), and Eclipse will copy the apk into your Android and start running. It takes less than 5 seconds. If you work on a Mac, you don't need to install anything, just plug in the phone and it works =D. Well, in Linux it is a bit more complicated ( though not impossible , I actually work with Linux), but you can still develop there =). Cheers BIG BIG EDIT I've seen today just what you asked few time ago. Here, take it: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui It's obviously hard to type on a smartphone, but it could do the trick on an EEEPad transformer. Have a good day
