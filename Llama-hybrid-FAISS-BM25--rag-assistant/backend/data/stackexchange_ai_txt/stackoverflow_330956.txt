Like everything in the programming world, it depends. You obviously want to create indexes and relationships to preserve normalization and speed up database lookups. But you also want to balance that by not having too many indexes that it will take SQL Server more time to build every index. Also the more indexes you have the more fragmentation that can occur in your database. So what I do is put in the obvious indexes and relationships and then optimize after the application is build on the possible slow queries.
