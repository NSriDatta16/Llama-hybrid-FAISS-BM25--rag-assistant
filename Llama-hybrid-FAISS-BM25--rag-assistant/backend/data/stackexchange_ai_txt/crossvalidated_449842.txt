Covariance is a bilinear function, meaning that $$\operatorname{cov}(aX+bY, cW+dZ) = ac\operatorname{cov}(X,W)+ad\operatorname{cov}(X,Z)+bc\operatorname{cov}(Y,W)+bd\operatorname{cov}(Y,Z).$$ Ignoring the subscripts $i$ which seem to have nothing to do with the matter at hand, we have that \begin{align} \operatorname{cov}(X,\theta X+\varepsilon) &= \theta\operatorname{cov}(X,X) + \operatorname{cov}(X,\varepsilon)\\ &= \theta\operatorname{var}(X) + 0\\ &= \theta \end{align} where we have recognized that the covariance of $X$ with itself is just another name for the variance of $X$ (which is given to be $1$ ) and that $X$ and $\varepsilon$ are independent random variables and thus have zero covariance. No muss, no fuss, no dragging in unnecessary computations of means etc.
