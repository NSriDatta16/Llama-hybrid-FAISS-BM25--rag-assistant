As a rule, your model should not be defined by your GUI. Ie, the SpinnerModel that backs each JSpinner should not be your value A. (That would be a horribly inelegant tightly coupled dependency on a particular view.) Instead, your value A should either be a POJO or a property of an object. In which case, you can add PropertyChangeSupport to it. (And presumably have already done so in any case, as you want your spinners to update automatically if A is changed by other parts of your program). I realise this is similar to Marc W's answer, and you were concerned that it's "complicated", but PropertyChangeSupport does almost all of it for you. In fact, for trivially simple cases, you can just use a single class that wires a "setProperty" method through to a "firePropertyChange" call (as well as storing the value in a HashMap for any "getProperty" calls).
