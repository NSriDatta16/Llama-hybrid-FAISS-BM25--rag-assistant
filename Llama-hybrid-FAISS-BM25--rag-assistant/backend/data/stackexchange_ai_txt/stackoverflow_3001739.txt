jQuery/Javascript framework efficiency

My latest project is using a javascript framework (jQuery), along with some plugins (validation, jquery-ui, datepicker, facebox, ...) to help make a modern web application. I am now finding pages loading slower than I am used to. After some js profiling (thanks VS2010!), it seems a lot of the time is taken processing inside the framework. Now I understand the more complex the ui tools, the more processing needs to be done. The project is not yet at a large stage and I think would be average functions. At this stage I can see it is not going to scale well. I noticed things like the 'each' command in jQuery takes quite a lot of processing time. Have others experienced some extra latency using JS frameworks? How do I minimize their effect on page performance? Are there best practices on implementation using JS frameworks? Thanks
