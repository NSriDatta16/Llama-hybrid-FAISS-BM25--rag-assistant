The goto :eof pasteboard I add "goto :eof" to end of my scripts as a handy space for code fragments. That way I can quickly copy/paste to and from this area, without having to comment/uncomment. goto :eof :: code scraps call this.bat call that.bat set TS=%DATE:~10%%DATE:~4,2%%DATE:~7,2%-%TIME:~0,2%%TIME:~3,2%%TIME:~6%% for /R C:\temp\ %%G in (*.bak) DO del %%G
