Is it possible to call a method automatically every time a value changes?

i.e. I have a layer's "transform.rotation.z" value which may change several times. Every time that value changes, I'd like to call a method. Of course I could call it just at any point where I touch that value. But maybe there's a more elegant way in objective-c / cocoa-touch? Somebody told me a few days ago that there's some notification mechanism available. But is that useful for something like this? How would it look like?
