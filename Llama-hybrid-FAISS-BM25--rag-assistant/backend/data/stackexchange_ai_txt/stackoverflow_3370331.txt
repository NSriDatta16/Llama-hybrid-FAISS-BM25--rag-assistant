DataGrid vertical scrollbar problems after resizing

I'm working with a DataGrid in Silverlight. If I have enough items so that the vertical scroll bar is visible for all sizes of the window, and I re-size the window a few times, the vertical scroll gets out of sync. The thumb gets to small as if the control thinks that there are more items then it is. When I drag the thumb towards the bottom or the top, the content starts to jump. It happens all the time, very frustrating. The DataGrid is laying within a DockPanel that is re-sized according how large the window is (no specific size that is) Anyone have any ideas?
