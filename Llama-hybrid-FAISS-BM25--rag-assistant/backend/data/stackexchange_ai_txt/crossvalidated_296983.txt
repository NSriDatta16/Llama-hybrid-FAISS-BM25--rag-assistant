Essentially, you have a similarity matrix or distance matrix (how often they are put into different groups). That is the typical input for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). By no means these methods are restricted to numerical vectors. One of the few methods that really needs numerical vectors is k-means, because it needs to be able to compute means. Your objective function should correspond exactly to one of the average linkage strategies.
