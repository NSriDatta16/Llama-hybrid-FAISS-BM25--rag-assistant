Javascript iPhone selection

Quick question. I am writing a website and would like to redirect users to different webpages depending on their browser and also their version of the iPhone operating software. I know you may come back at me and say it should be up to the user to decide which site they view, they don't have a choice in this matter. The code I am using is in javascript and can identify between the different browsers but not the iPhone operating systems which is the key to this. This is the code: if(navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) { if(navigator.userAgent.match(Version/4)){ if(document.cookie.indexOf("iphone_redirect=false") == -1) window.location ="iPhone4.html"; } if(document.cookie.indexOf("iphone_redirect=false") == -1) window.location ="iPhone.html"; } //Rest of the site goes here Not sure if the brackets are right here it's early and may have got that wrong but any help will be appreciated.
