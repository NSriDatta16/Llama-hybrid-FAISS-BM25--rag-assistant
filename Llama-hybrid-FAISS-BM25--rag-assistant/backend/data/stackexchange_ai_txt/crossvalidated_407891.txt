Label Switching and Pivot method

I am working on the so called label switching problem in Bayesian inference with Gaussian Mixture Models. To put in a nutshell, when your favourite MCMC samplers estimates the parameters of your GMM, it does it without labelling the modes. That is to say that the parameters estimates are similar always up to a permutation, which prevents from taking the mean of parameters estimates as a good final estimator. A solution is to relabel each sample of parameters. A way to do so is to use the pivot algorithm describe here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02271.pdf . You define a pivot as the most likely sample of parameters and then align each sample of parameters to this pivot by maximizing the dot product between the pivot and the sample. To make it clear : let's say I have a GMM with 2 components in $\mathbb{R}$ . So my MCMC returns me samples of the form $\chi=(\mu_1,\mu_2, \sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ . After defining your pivot $\chi^*$ as the likeliest sample of parameters, for each sample $\chi$ you want to find a permutation $\tau$ that maximizes $ $ . I would like to know when this method fails. Do you have any idea of GMM or distributions when this method is unable to recover the permutation and then failing to have good final estimators for the parameters ?
