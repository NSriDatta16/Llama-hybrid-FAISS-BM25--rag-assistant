Look at the way you're calling setEdgeLabelTransformer , you need to pass it a new Transformer() , like I've done in my code snippet numbered 2 . When you pass a new ToStringLabeller() , you're telling the viewer to label using the toString() method of the edge object. You'll need to pass a custom Transformer instead, just correct your code to look like mine and you'll be fine.
