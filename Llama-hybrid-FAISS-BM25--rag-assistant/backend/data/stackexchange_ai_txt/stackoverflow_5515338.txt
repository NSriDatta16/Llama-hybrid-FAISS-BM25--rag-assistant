Thanks for the code. There are probably a number of ways to do this. One thing to recognise is that the built in controls with ASP.NET are rigid in the HTML they produce. For lots of modern UI / dynamic methods they can cause problems by their inflexibility. First I'd suggest coding the HTML manually so it is working how you want with the jquery functions. Look at other Jquery examples and possibly Jquery UI also. When you are happy I'd then do one of the following things. a) Write your own custom control or extend the existing asp:DropDownList. b) Manually write the HTML out in the page with a loop. This isn't as elegant or reusable but is might be technically simpler if you haven't written custom controls before however I would recommend a). Finally. Be aware that your finished HTML shouldn't be inserting anything other than OPTION tags into the SELECT tags within the HTML. If that is your approach you need to re-think the structure of the HTML, hence suggesting that as your first set. Hope that helps.
