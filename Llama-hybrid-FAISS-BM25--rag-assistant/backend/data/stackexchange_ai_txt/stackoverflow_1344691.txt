NYI means "not yet implemented." I would guess that the command "pragma table_info" probably can't be executed directly as a prepared statement. There's an example of executing that pragma statement in the code for the SQLite JDBC driver, class org.sqlite.Metadata , methods such as getColumns() and getPrimaryKeys() . I can't excerpt the code and post it here, because doing so would not be compatible with the Creative Commons license used by StackOverflow. So please go to that link and take a look.
