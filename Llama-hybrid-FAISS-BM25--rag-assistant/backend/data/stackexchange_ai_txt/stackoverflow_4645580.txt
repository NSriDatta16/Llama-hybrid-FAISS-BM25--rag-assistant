Ftp to the the remote site and execute the ftp commands by hand. When the error occurs, look around to see what is the cause. (Use "help" if you don't know the ftp command line.) Probably the /data directory does not exist. has anyone reorganized the upload directory recently, or maybe moved the root directory of the ftp server?
