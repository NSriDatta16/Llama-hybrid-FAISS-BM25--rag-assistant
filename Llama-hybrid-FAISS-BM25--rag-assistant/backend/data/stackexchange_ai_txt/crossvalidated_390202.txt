Slope is negative but confidence limits contain zero, how do I describe the effect?

I performed an ANCOVA on final height ( height4 ) with initial height as a covariate. Dependent variables: ipc.gm = initial % cover of garlic mustard fence = factor with 2 levels: Fence, Open There was a significant interaction effect: ipc.gm*fence An interaction plot shows that height4, corrected for initial height, increases with increasing ipc.gm, but only in Fence plots . I used emtrends() to get the slope of each line: > emtrends(model3, pairwise ~ fence, var = "ipc.gm") NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions $`emtrends` fence ipc.gm.trend SE df lower.CL upper.CL Fence 0.06585603 0.02670941 92 0.01280884 0.11890322 Open -0.02830168 0.03487092 92 -0.09755835 0.04095498 Results are averaged over the levels of: gm Degrees-of-freedom method: containment Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value Fence - Open 0.09415771 0.04201853 92 2.241 0.0274 Results are averaged over the levels of: gm The "ipc.gm.trend" for Fence gives a positive slope of 0.0659, with a lower confidence limit of 0.0128 and an upper confidence limit of 0.1189. The "ipc.gm.trend" for Open gives a negative slope of -0.0283, with a lower confidence limit of -0.0976 and an upper confidence limit of 0.0410. Questions When writing my paper, I will say that height4, corrected for initial height, increased with increasing ipc.gm at the Fence level. Do I back this up by reporting the positive slope, or confidence limits, or both? For the Open level, the slope is negative but the confidence limits contain zero. Should I say that height4, corrected for initial height, decreased with increasing ipc.gm and back this up by reporting the slope? Or should I say that height4, corrected for initial height, was not affected by ipc.gm and back this up by reporting the confidence limits?
