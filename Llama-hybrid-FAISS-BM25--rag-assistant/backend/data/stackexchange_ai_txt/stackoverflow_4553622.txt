Cruise control - project list is so long on dashboard - can we have folders?

CC.Net is pretty cool and we have been using it in our organisation for just under a year now. However the project list is on about 30 projects at the moment. and It takes ages just to scan though the list looking for the correct build and trying not to click on the wrong one! Is there anyway to group builds into folders on the dashboard UI i.e. this screen: (Random CCNEt dashboard image I found on the web) Jason
