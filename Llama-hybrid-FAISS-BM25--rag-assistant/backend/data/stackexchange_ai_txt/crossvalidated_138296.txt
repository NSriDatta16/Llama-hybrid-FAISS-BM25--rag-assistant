Forecasting daily demand for next year

I have two years daily demand data, corresponding to which I have to forecast the daily demand for next year. I am new to time series, and used Arima model for this purpose. But it predicts only about 10 days data for next year, for rest of the days it is simply a mean. How can I forecast daily demand for next year. Any help will greatly appreciated. Thanks.
