Nested UIScrollViews and scrolling in the same direction

I have a nested UIScrollView inside another one. Both Horizontal. My problem is: when i scroll the inner one and its already at the end (or to the other way, at start point) my outer scroll scrolls. I want to prevent my outer scroll from scrolling: if i'm trying to scroll the inner one, even if its not moving, prevent the outer from moving. If the inner scroll is at the end and I try scrolling, I don't get the didScroll events. I know tracking is YES, but I don't have an event for this, so I don't know when user tracked the inner scroll. Also, I can't use touchesBegan in my VC because the inner scroll swallows that touch. Doe's someone have any idea how to do it? Thanks, Noam
