Allow touch events only on some selected labels of view

I am a newbie in iPhone development, doing my first app. I have some labels on screen out of these labels I have to appy drag event on few selected code for dragging is - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Retrieve the touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; startLocation = pt; [[self superview] bringSubviewToFront:self]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Move relative to the original touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGRect frame = [self frame]; frame.origin.x += pt.x - startLocation.x; frame.origin.y += pt.y - startLocation.y; [self setFrame:frame]; } now I want that drag only implement to few selected labels. I implemented this by subclassing UILabel @interface DragView : UILabel { CGPoint startLocation; } @end @implementation DragView - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Retrieve the touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; startLocation = pt; [[self superview] bringSubviewToFront:self]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Move relative to the original touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGRect frame = [self frame]; frame.origin.x += pt.x - startLocation.x; frame.origin.y += pt.y - startLocation.y; [self setFrame:frame]; } @end but I want to implemet this without subclassing is there any way to do that
