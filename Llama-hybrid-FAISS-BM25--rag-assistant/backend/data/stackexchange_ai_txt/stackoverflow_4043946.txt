If by "native" you mean "already residing on the phone" then you don't have a whole lot of options. SQL Compact is already built in to the device - you just can't yet use it from 3rd party applications in the first platform release. There simply isn't a database engine already on the platform that is available to third-party developers. Your only option for persistent storage out of the box is isolated storage. Microsoft does not ship any database engine usable by third parties that uses that, so your options are to either use a third party solution like Perst (which has been around for a while) or SQLite (I've started the port to my ORM ) or to roll your own.
