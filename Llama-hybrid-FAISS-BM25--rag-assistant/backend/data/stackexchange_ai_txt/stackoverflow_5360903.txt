You could do this: // Provinces in the desired order string[] provinces = { "Ontario", "Quebec", "Alberta", "Manitoba", "British Columbia" }; var query = from province in provinces join person in people on province equals person.HomeProvince select person; That will basically: Ignore anyone not in the specified provinces Return a sequence of people in the province order specified If you need the people grouped by province, that's easy too: var query = from province in provinces join person in people on province equals person.HomeProvince into grouped select new { Province = province, People = grouped.ToList() }; Another option would be to create a mapping from province to "priority" and simply order by that. It really depends on exactly what you need as output.
