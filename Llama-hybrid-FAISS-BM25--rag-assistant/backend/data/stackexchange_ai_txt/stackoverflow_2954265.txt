How to make a derived UITableVIew work

I've made a new class in my Xcode project which is derived from UITableView I then drag a UITableView from in the interface builder onto my view and change the class of the object to my derived class. Then I drag the outlet from the table to the files owner and hook it up to an outlet variable in my main view, which is of the same type as my derived class. How do I also set up the datasource and delegate so that they belong to the derived class? I've got two table views on my main viewcontroller, and one of them uses that controller itself which works fine. The delegate and datasource is the file owner of the view controller. But my other table view will be for different data, so I want it to use the datasource and delegate which is implemented on my derived tableview.
