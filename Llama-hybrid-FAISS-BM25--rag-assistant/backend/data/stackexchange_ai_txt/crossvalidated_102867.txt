Random Forest mtry Question

I am just looking to understand how mtry works in random forests. Please correct me if I am wrong. When you specify mtry (say 10), it takes 10 random variables from your data set and examines them for one tree. So the next tree would take 10 more random variables, examine them, so on and so forth until it runs through the ntrees that you specify and then returns the average estimates for the best/most important variables?
