Reading a basic file through pd.read_csv

I'm starting to go through Ageron's Hands on Machine Learning Book. I came across a dataset on his github that I'm not able to open properly by myself and would appreciate assistance. Here's the link of the dataset: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/datasets/lifesat/gdp_per_capita.csv Here's what I tried pd.read_csv("https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/datasets/lifesat/gdp_per_capita.csv") That clearly didn't work. Then I went through the notebook and basically replicated what he had and tried to read the dataset as follows: pd.read_csv("https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/datasets/lifesat/gdp_per_capita.csv", thousands=',',delimiter='\t', encoding='latin1', na_values="n/a") I'm still getting tokenizing data errors. What could be the issue?
