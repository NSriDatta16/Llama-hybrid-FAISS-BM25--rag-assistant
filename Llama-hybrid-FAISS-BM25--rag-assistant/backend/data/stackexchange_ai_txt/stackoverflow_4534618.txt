How do I use jquery to manipulate a Div I've already pointed to?

I know in jQuery you can point to an element by $('#idname') but I'm using an API that returns to me the entire div element, as if it used document.getElementById(). I know a quick hack could be: var a = getContainerEl.id; $('#' + a); but is there a more elegant way? I need access to this to add to it's DOM.
