The issues with deviance and potential perfect separation aren't troubling by themselves. It's not clear, however, that the analysis you describe will address your questions adequately. You seem to have set up geographic grids, with each cell evaluated for presence or absence of a species. In a binomial model each cell would count as a trial. You have over 10 million trials ( PAR ) in each of your first 2 cases alone. The deviance necessarily increases with the total number of trials, so the large deviance values aren't an a priori problem. Although your "fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred" might be a sign of perfect separation, you don't need to worry about that, either, on its own. With your large number of trials, you don't have the usual problems of poor convergence, extreme regression coefficients and wide confidence intervals (CI). Your model converged in 6 iterations and shows narrow CI consistent with a very large number of trials. The problem is that your trials aren't independent. The large numbers of trials within each species aren't independent of each other and can't necessarily be compared against those for the other species. Observations within a species will incorporate any species-specific effects that aren't captured in your model, effects that will differ among the species. One species-specific characteristic is its own population density. With a random Poisson population distribution and an average population $\mu$ per cell, there is an expected fraction $\exp(-\mu)$ of empty cells. So the baseline probability of an empty cell, under a null hypothesis of a random distribution over the grid, depends on population density. That's not taken into account in your model. As it stands, your model might just be for a proxy of species' population densities. A mixed model with random effects for species, for example via glmer() in the lme4 package , might help in this regard. Random intercepts would allow for differences among species in baseline probabilities of cell occupancy, associated with species' population densities (and other differences, like the ability to detect the species). I'm a bit hesitant, however, as a standard random effects model imposes a Gaussian distribution on those random effects, and that might not be appropriate for your data with over half of species having cell occupancies over 96.5% but a quarter below 59% and some at less than 1%. Perhaps that skew in baseline probabilities is associated with corresponding skew in your predictors of interest and thus won't end up being a problem. Visual inspection of your data informed by your knowledge of the subject matter could help inform how to proceed. If there are data available on the overall population density of each species, it would be best to include that in the model directly. I suspect that there are established ways to do this in the ecology literature, but that's outside my area of expertise. Once you have a better form of model, there are a couple of other potential improvements to consider. First, your current model assumes that the log-odds of occupancy increases linearly with each of your continuous predictors. That might not be a good assumption in general, and would seem particularly poor with a skewed predictor like your PopdensityAvg . Consider flexible modeling of the continuous predictors, with regression splines or another form of generalized additive model. Second, your model as presented doesn't seem to address your intent: For instance, for a species with status 0, I expect no influence of Roads, while for a species with status 1, I expect an influence of Roads. To do that you need a model that includes status on its own and in an interaction with the other predictors whose associations with outcome you expect to differ depending on status .
