This sort of issue is exactly why some people discourage the use of String#succ. It clashes with Range , Object#to_a , and others. Anyway, you probably know this, but things like this might help... >> t => ["x", "y", "z", "aa", "ab", "ac", "ad", "ae", "af", "ag"] >> t.shuffle.sort_by { |e| "%3s" % [e] } => ["x", "y", "z", "aa", "ab", "ac", "ad", "ae", "af", "ag"] You could even renormalize this way and dispense with sort_by .
