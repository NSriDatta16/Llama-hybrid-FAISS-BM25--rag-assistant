Categorization scheme of regression techniques

There exist many techniques that can be used for regression task. Some are from statistics (e.g. generalized least squares) and some from machine learning (e.g. MLP), some are linear and some nonlinear, some are parametric and some nonparametric. Are there available any categorization schemes of regression techniques?
