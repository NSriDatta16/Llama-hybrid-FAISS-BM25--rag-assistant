Xcode / Organizer will show your device crash logs. Xcode -> COMMAND+CONTROL+O -> Device Logs or you (making sure the device is connected) can select the iPod from the list of devices, then choose Device Logs. You don't need to have any code in the applicationDidEnterBackground , applicationWillEnterForeground , or applicationDidBecomeActive delegates, so that's not making your app crash. I would definitely check out some of those logs in Organizer. Maybe post some of them here, or pastie.org
