Logistic Regression performing better than SVM with a Gaussian kernel performing better than a linear SVM

I am very new to machine learning. I am working with a data set, and my algorithm for logistic regression (with lasso regularization) is performing fairly well (~0.8 AUC), my SVM with a Gaussian kernel is doing well (~0.7-0.8 AUC), and my SVM without a kernel is doing fine but not as well (~0.7 AUC). It seems odd to me that a SVM with a kernel would have a performance in between two algorithms which do well with linearly separable data. Is this normal, and what could be going on here? Thanks for the help! EDIT: Could it be because of Lasso's hard thresholding? In response to Jason's query, my dataset has roughly 800 features and 800 observations, and is all numerical.
