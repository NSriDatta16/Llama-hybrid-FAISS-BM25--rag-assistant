imbalanced learning: precision vs recall trade-off

Working on a multi-class problem (five classes) for which the dataset is highly imbalanced (two classes with less than 2% samples). Which metric between precision and recall should I pay more attention to? print(classification_report) precision recall f1-score support Class 0 0.24 0.01 0.02 12826 Class 1 0.00 0.00 0.00 1380 Class 2 0.00 0.00 0.00 6543 Class 3 0.51 0.98 0.67 22856 Class 4 0.00 0.00 0.00 1561 accuracy 0.50 45166 macro avg 0.15 0.20 0.14 45166 weighted avg 0.33 0.50 0.34 45166
