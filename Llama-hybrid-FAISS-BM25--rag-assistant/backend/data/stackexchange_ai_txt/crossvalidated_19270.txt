Package car has quite a lot of useful functions for diagnostic plots of linear and generalized linear models. Compared to vanilla R plots, they are often enhanced with additional information. I recommend you try example(" ") on the following functions to see what the plots look like. All plots are described in detail in chapter 6 of Fox & Weisberg. 2011. An R Companion to Applied Regression. 2nd ed. residualPlots() plots Pearson residuals against each predictor (scatterplots for numeric variables including a Lowess fit, boxplots for factors) marginalModelPlots() displays scatterplots of the response variable against each numeric predictor, inluding a Lowess fit avPlots() displays partial-regression plots: for each predictor, this is a scatterplot of a) the residuals from the regression of the response variable on all other predictors against b) the residuals from the regression of the predictor against all other predictors qqPlot() for a quantile-quantile plot which includes a confidence envelope influenceIndexPlot() displays each value for Cook's distance, hat-value, p-value for outlier test, and studentized residual in a spike-plot against the observation index influencePlot() gives a bubble-plot of studentized residuals against hat-values, with the size of the bubble corresponding to Cook's distance, also see dfbetaPlots() and leveragePlots() boxCox() displays a profile of the log-likelihood for the transformation parameter $\lambda$ in a Box-Cox power-transform crPlots() is for component + residual plots, a variant of which are CERES plots (Combining conditional Expectations and RESiduals), provided by ceresPlots() spreadLevelPlot() is for assessing non-constant error variance and displays absolute studentized residuals against fitted values scatterplot() provides much-enhanced scatterplots inluding boxplots along the axes, confidence ellipses for the bivariate distribution, and prediction lines with confidence bands scatter3d() is based on package rgl and displays interactive 3D-scatterplots including wire-mesh confidence ellipsoids and prediction planes, make sure to run example("scatter3d") In addition, have a look at bplot() from package rms for another approach to illustrating the common distribution of three variables.
