How do I place a magento autocomplete mini search box outside the magento installation?

I would like to put a magento mini search box in my main website, so that when a search is made, it redirects to the magento search results page. This global search is in the header and helps to find products fast on my Codeigniter main site. I was able to achieve part of this, by placing the following code: Buscar: Buscar // The autocomplete function of the search box doesn't work, which is a main issue for me since it's a really useful feature. My main website is full of jQuery, and I know Magento uses prototype. So I managed to include the following scripts that seem to be required by the autocomplete Magento search box: Still no luck! I don't get any Console errors in Firebug, but I don't get any AJAX or autocomplete response either. Does anyone know what I could be missing?
