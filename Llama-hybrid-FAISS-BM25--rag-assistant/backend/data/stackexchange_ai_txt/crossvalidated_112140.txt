(1) You have an unbalanced dataset (~18%). Random forests may not perform well in this setting. You might want to compensate for this (internal undersampling) (2) I would argue that you should have a strong justification for not using a logistic model. For many reasons, including that probabilities obtained are believable. (3) There very likely is a high risk group - there always is. But seems like the "outlier" function is build to detect outliers not high risk subgroups. I wouldn't force it to do this.
