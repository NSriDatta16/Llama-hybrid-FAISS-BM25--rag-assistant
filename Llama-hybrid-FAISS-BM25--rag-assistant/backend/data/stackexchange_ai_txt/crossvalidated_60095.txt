Role of coefficients in model selection for logistic regression

I have a model that I am using to predict mortality and it gives me an AUC of 0.799. The R code that I am using would look something like this: fit I am calculating my AUC using ROCR : library(ROCR) fit.pred Calling sepsis.perf gives me: An object of class "performance" Slot "x.name": [1] "None" Slot "y.name": [1] "Area under the ROC curve" Slot "alpha.name": [1] "none" Slot "x.values": list() Slot "y.values": [[1]] [1] 0.7990628 Slot "alpha.values": list() So far I have conluded that this model isn't too bad as a classifier. However when I look at the coefficients, especially the 95% CI, of the logistic regression model I get some strange results: (Intercept) 8.248484e-03 3.394696e-02 SEXfemale 9.037957e-01 1.325291e+00 SEXNULL 3.864079e-204 5.780619e+192 Age 1.026437e+00 1.043482e+00 ASACLAS2-Mild Disturb 1.408200e-220 3.478857e+229 ASACLAS3-Severe Disturb 1.769693e-220 4.367441e+229 ASACLAS4-Life Threat 3.596686e-220 8.876357e+229 ASACLAS5-Moribund 8.561098e-220 2.113924e+230 ASACLASNULL 2.702457e-219 6.747396e+230 ASACLASNone assigned 1.513924e-219 3.793387e+230 WNDCLAS2-Clean/Contaminated 9.281083e-01 1.897956e+00 WNDCLAS3-Contaminated 8.968408e-01 1.604651e+00 WNDCLAS4-Dirty/Infected 5.114258e-01 8.718848e-01 What bothers me here is the 95% CI for ASA class, which is ridiculous. However when I take it out of my model, the AUC drops to 0.78, and clinically, the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification is often used to stratify patients into low to high risk for mortality in the perioperative period. So my question is, given these results of the 95% CI, should I exclude ASA class? If not, how should I interpret ASA class in view of my results? Thanks for the help!
