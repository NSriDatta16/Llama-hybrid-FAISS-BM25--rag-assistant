Using string literals as parameters to template tags in Django templates

One of the things I find myself doing often is passing string literals as parameters to template tags or functions; for instance: {% url my-url 'my_param' %} Unfortunately, the django template engine doesn't let you do this. So I find myself doing this a lot in my view code: my_context_dict['MY_PARAM'] = 'my_param' and then in my view code: {% url my-url MY_PARAM %} Or creating a series of URL mappings, which I personally try to avoid. Is it possible to use a string literal in Django templates? Or possibly a more elegant solution? I haven't seen anything on here or in the documentation.
