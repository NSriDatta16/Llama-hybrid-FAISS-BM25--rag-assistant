The right way to go about this is to compute the expected benefit of giving treatment and the expected benefit of not giving treatment, and then take whichever action has the greater expected benefit. A good introduction is "Making Hard Decisions" by Robert Clemen. In more detail here it is. Let U(blue, T) = benefit for giving treatment when patient is blue, U(blue, not T) = benefit for not giving treatment when patient is blue, U(red, T) = benefit for giving treatment when patient is red, U(red, not T) = benefit for not giving treatment when patient is red. Any of the "benefit" values U(blue, T), etc, can be negative to indicate it's actually a loss. If you can assign reasonable values to these, you can go ahead. The expected benefit for T is EU(T) = U(blue, T) p(blue | X) + U(red, T) p(red | X), and the expected benefit for not T is EU(not T) = U(blue, not T) p(blue | X) + U(red, not T) p(red | X). So the recommendation is to give treatment if EU(T) > EU(not T) and not otherwise. You'll want to be careful with plus and minus signs throughout; figure out a sign convention and stick to it. For example, so far I'm assuming losses are negative and benefits are positive, and you want maximize benefit. You can work it the other way too, you just have to be consistent. You can get some insight by simplifying the inequality a little. You can derive something like p(red|X)/p(blue|X) is less or greater than some ratio of benefits. Be careful about the signs of the benefit differences when you do that, since it changes the sense of the comparison. The histograms you showed are p(X|red) and p(X|blue) -- from these you can get p(red|X) and p(blue|X) via Bayes' rule. You'll need to estimate the background rates p(red) and p(blue) in order to do that. The most obvious take-away from this whole analysis is that if you have p(red|X)/p(blue|X) less or greater than some ratio of benefits, you can rework that into something involving p(X|red)/p(X|blue), and that means you can choose a place on the overlapping histograms plot and say, apply treatment if the ratio of densities is more or less than a threshold. That threshold ratio will be a function of the benefits and the background rates.
