OK, so: I don't think this is hierarchical logistic regression. The word "hierarchical" is sometimes used to refer to random/mixed effects models (because parameters sit in a hierarchichy). This is just logistic regression. R square is not a good way to compare logistic regression models. It depends on what you're interested in studying, but a generalized r squared (like Nagelkerke's R squared) are better. Is your goal here to infer some effect or are you trying to predict something?
