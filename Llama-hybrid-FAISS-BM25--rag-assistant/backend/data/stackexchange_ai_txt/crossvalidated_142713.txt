The citation and its last sentence says of the following. Singular matrix is a one where rows or columns are linearly interdependent. Most of factor analysis extraction methods require that the analyzed correlation or covariance matrix be nonsingular. It must be strictly positive definite. The reasons for it is that at various stages of the analysis (preliminary, extraction, scores) factor analysis algorithm addresses true inverse of the matrix or needs its determinant. Minimal residuals (minres) method can work with singular matrix at extraction, but it is absent in SPSS. PCA is not iterative and is not true factor analysis . Its extraction phase is single eigen-decomposition of the intact correlation matrix, which doesn't require the matrix to be full rank. Whenever it is not, one or several last eigenvalues turn out to be exactly zero rather than being small positive. Zero eigenvalue means that the corresponding dimension (component) has variance 0 and therefore does not exist. That's all; it doesn't hamper the extraction, nor it precludes computing component scores . So, you can do PCA with singular, multicollinear data. Sometimes PCA is used specifically for the purpose to get rid of the multicollinearity.
