Please consider trying SQL Source Control, which is a product designed to work alongside SQL Compare as part of a database development lifecycle. It's in Beta at the moment, but it's feature complete and it's very close to its full release. http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Source_Control/index.htm We'd be interested to know how this performs on a commit in comparison to the time it takes for Visual Studio to build your current Database Project. Do you actually need to build the project so often in VS that it's a problem? How large is your schema and how long is an average build?
