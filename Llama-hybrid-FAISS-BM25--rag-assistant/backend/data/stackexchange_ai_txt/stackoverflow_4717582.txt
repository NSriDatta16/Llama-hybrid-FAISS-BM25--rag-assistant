Displaying a subset of longitude/latitude points?

I have an array of coordinates (latitude and longitude) maded in this way: [0] = "45.01234,9.12345" [1] = "46.11111,9.12345" [2] = "47.22222,9.98765" [...] etc In a loop, convert these coordinates in meters (UTM northing / UTM easting) and after that I convert these coords in pixel (X / Y) on screen (the output device is an iPhone) to draw a route line on a custom map. [0] = "512335.00000,502333.666666" [...] etc The returning pixel are passed to a method that draw a line on screen (simulating a route calculation). [0] = "20,30" [1] = "21,31" [2] = "25,40" [...] etc As coordinate (lat/lon) are too many, I need to truncate lat/lon array eliminating the values that doesn't fill in the map bound (the visible part of map on screen). Map bounds are 2 couple of coords lat/lon, upper left, and lower right. Now, what is the best way to loop on this array (NOT SORTED) and check if a value is or not in bound and after remove the value that is outside? To return a clean array that contains only the coords visible on screen? Note: the coords array is a very big array. 4000/5000 Couple of items. This is a method that should be looped every drag or zoom. How can I optimize search and controls in this array?
