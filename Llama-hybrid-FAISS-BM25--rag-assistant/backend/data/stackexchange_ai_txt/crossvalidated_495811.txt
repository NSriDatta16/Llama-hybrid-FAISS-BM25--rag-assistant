Are there better approaches than the weighted mean?

If I have a data set where the distribution from which the data are drawn changes, for example in the following plot, the data set is comprised of four normal distributions with the same mean ( $\mu = 0$ ) but different standard deviations: If I wanted to get an average value for the data set, my instinct would be to calculate a weighted mean: $$\bar{\mu} = \frac{\sum_{i} w_{i} \mu_{i}}{\sum_{i} w_{i}}$$ where $\mu_{i}$ are the means of the individual distributions shown in the plot, and $w_{i} = 1 / (\sigma_{i} /\sqrt{n})^{2}$ are the weights, which can be used to compute a weighted standard-error: $${\rm{SE}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{i} w_{i}}}$$ I was wondering if there are better approaches where I could avoid binning or dividing the data up. One approach I have considered is considering the data as a mixed-distribution (mixed-normal distributions, with different $\sigma$ ) and performing a maximum-likelihood evaluation with the hypothesis $$G(x) = \sum_{i}\hat{w}_{i}g(x|\mu_{i}, \sigma_{i})$$ where ${w}_{i}$ are normalised weights and $g(x|\mu_{i}, \sigma_{i})$ are the component normal distributions. I would then construct my weighted mean and standard error from the parameters of this MLE. What I want to avoid is binning the data if possible, and assumptions based on where one distribution begins and ends. The property I am measuring is from a normal distribution. I can say this with some certainty due to the physics of the problem. However due to laboratory conditions the standard deviation can fluctuate (the mean can also fluctuate but to a lesser extent -- the mean is always very close to 0). The scatter of the measurement can be stable for a few hours before changing. I have many datasets recorded over the course of month, so it seems reasonable to group the data by like-scatter and perform a weighted mean. However this requires me to make an assumption on group size, or what constitutes "like-scatter". When I group data into like plots, Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots all indicate that the data is indeed normally distributed, while autocorrelation tests imply randomness (no autocorrelation).
