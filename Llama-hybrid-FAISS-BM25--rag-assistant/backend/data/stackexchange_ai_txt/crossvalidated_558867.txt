Can we get P value for each row in a contingency table?

I have following data on 4 different organisms infecting 115 adults and 69 children: Chi-square test can be applied to this table, but it will only show that there is non-uniformity somewhere in the table. I want to compare how each organism relates to adults vs children. Since number of samples in adult and children groups are not equal, I have calculated column percent for each organism separately for adults and children. By visually comparing column percentages, it appears (as highlighted in yellow) that organism A has greater predilection for children while adults are more susceptible to organisms C and D. Frequency of finding organism B seems to be nearly equal in adults and children. However, which formal statistical test should I apply to confirm these impressions? Edit: As suggested by @Patrick in his answer, I analyzed with proportion testing on each row as follows: Adult Children Adult% Children% Pvalues Significant SigBonferroni A 25.000 40.000 21.739 57.971 0.000 True True B 10.000 8.000 8.696 11.594 0.522 False False C 50.000 12.000 43.478 17.391 0.000 True True D 30.000 9.000 26.087 13.043 0.036 True False Total 115.000 69.000 100.000 100.000 Percentages are column percentages. P values are obtained by proportion testing for each row. Significant is True if P Above clearly shows that organism A has greater predilection for children while C is commoner in adults. Trying Tukey's HSD as suggested by @whuber in comments: Chi2 result of the contingency table: 28.567227276904696, p-value: 2.7609207293182665e-06 Significance results: ('A', 'B'): p_value: 0.303028; corrected: 0.363634 (ns) reject: False ('A', 'C'): p_value: 0.000003; corrected: 0.000020 (****) reject: True ('A', 'D'): p_value: 0.000317; corrected: 0.000950 (***) reject: True ('B', 'C'): p_value: 0.063603; corrected: 0.127205 (ns) reject: False ('B', 'D'): p_value: 0.184287; corrected: 0.276430 (ns) reject: False ('C', 'D'): p_value: 0.843860; corrected: 0.843860 (ns) reject: False Using Tukey's Post-hoc with transposed data: Chi2 result of the contingency table: 28.567227276904696, p-value: 2.7609207293182665e-06 Significance results: ('Adult', 'Children'): p_value: 0.000003; corrected: 0.000003 (****) reject: True However, this is not answering the question "Which organisms have greater predilection for adults vs children?"
