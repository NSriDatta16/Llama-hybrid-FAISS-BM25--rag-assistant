Use a CASE statement SELECT records.id, CASE contacts.organization WHEN '' THEN contacts.name ELSE contacts.name + ' (' + contacts.organization + ')' END as Contact FROM records LEFT JOIN contacts ON records.contact = contacts.contactid You could modify it to also check for NULL values, but I do not believe you have that issue because if you had a NULL in your contacts.organization, your entire result field would be null instead of blank.
