Efficient storage in .Net App

I'm looking for the fastest, least memory consuming, stand alone storage method available for large amounts of data for my C# app. My initial thoughts: Sql: no. not stand alone XML in flat file: no. takes too long to parse large amounts of data Other Options? Basically what i'm looking for, is a way that i can load with my applications load, keep all the data in my app, and when the data in my app changes just update the storage location.
