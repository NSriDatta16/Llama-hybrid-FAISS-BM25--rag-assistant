Is RTX 2060 (12 GB) or RTX 3060 (12 GB) suitable for complex deep learning tasks?

After many months of saving, I can now afford to buy RTX 3060 (12GB). However, I am afraid to waste my money after saving them for months. I am preparing myself for starting my Ph.D. degree. It will be related to applying deep learning in the medical domain, so I am expecting to run complex models, such as Xception, on large datasets ( and maybe I will use GANs). Moreover, I read that RTX 2060 (12GB ) is a good GPU for deep learning. So please guide me in putting my money in the right place. Thanks a lot.
