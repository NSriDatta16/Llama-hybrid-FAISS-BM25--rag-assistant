As per http://rfacebook.rubyforge.org/ rFacebook isnt being maintained, it suggested Facebooker, but even Facebooker hasn't been updated in months: https://github.com/mmangino/facebooker I suggest Koala (and not just because I'm an Aussie). Have a read at: https://github.com/arsduo/koala There's also details on setting Koala up on Rails: https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Koala-on-Rails I just built a FB app using Koala and a Custom Tab Page last week and it was very quick. You also need to read: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ (pay attention to the mention of scopes and permission levels). As per: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/ you must request 'friends_birthday' when you request your scope. I'm not sure there is an easy way to get all your friends' birthdays in a batch. You might have to traverse each friend and get their info. As a test, go to: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/ and click on the friends link. Then copy the ID of your first friend. In the URL replace '/me/friends' with the ID you copied. Eg: https://graph.facebook.com/me/friends?access_token=ABC123 becomes https://graph.facebook.com/12345678?access_token=ABC123 You will then see the data of that friend, one field of which is birthday. #i have already asked for user permissions, and have my access token #https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/OAuth graph = Koala::Facebook::GraphAPI.new(oauth_access_token) friends = graph.get_connections("me", "friends") friends.each do |f| friend = graph.get_object(f['id']) puts "#{f['name']} has a birthday on #{friend["birthday"]}" end Although, you might be able to use FQL to do a batch. #FQL taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5063431/easiest-way-to-get-birthday-info-of-all-friends-thorugh-graph-api fql = "select uid,name,birthday_date from user where uid in (select uid2 from friend where uid1=me())" #https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/REST-API @rest = Koala::Facebook::GraphAndRestAPI.new(oauth_access_token) birthdays = @rest.fql_query(fql) Good luck!
