Thanks to @guest's comment and to this lecture note by Germán Rodríguez, I think my question has been answered. From G.R.'s lecture note: It is important to note that we do not assume that the $d_{ij}$ have independent Poisson distributions, because they clearly do not . If individual $i$ died in interval $j(i)$, then it must have been alive in all prior intervals $j Plus, I realize only now that Royston and Lambert give a brief answer to my question in their book (page 53) (I missed it the first time I read it and I apologize with the authors): We [Royston and Lambert] are not actually assuming that the $d_{ij}$ have independent Poisson distributions. However, when we express the model in this way, it is the likelihood function that is equivalent to that from a piecewise exponential model. However, for a more detailed and in-depth explanation, read G.R.'s notes.
