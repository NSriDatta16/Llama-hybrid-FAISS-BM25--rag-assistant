Even after my edits, the question looks more like a "send-me-the-codez" demand than a typical StackOverflow question whereby the OP provides detailed information and demonstrates that he or she has put some real thought into it. So I'll just give a "half answer"... Anyway I'm only moderately familiar with OpenCV's machine learning module and barely cognizant of the rest of the library. ;-) In a nutshell, the pseudo code should look like that and the implementation would typically require the OpenCV methods mentioned. myCapt = cvCreateFileCapture("myInput.avi") // Assuming the feed is from a file. while (there are frames and we still want them) cvGrabFrame(myCapt) myImg = cvRetrieveFrame(myCapt) // alternatively to cvGrabFrame + cvRetrieveFrame, could use cvQueryFrame() // save the file (or do something with it...) cvSaveImage("some_file_name_with_seq_nr", myImage) cvReleaseCapture(capture) As hinted the above needs much syntax and logic work (eg. figuring out when to stop, producing the file name of the individual frames, and of course declaring properly the variables and using the right level of indirection w/ all them pointers ;-). Of course some of this is made easier if you use the Python interface. The Reading and Writing Images and Video OpenCV documentation page , provides more detailed info about the individual methods.
