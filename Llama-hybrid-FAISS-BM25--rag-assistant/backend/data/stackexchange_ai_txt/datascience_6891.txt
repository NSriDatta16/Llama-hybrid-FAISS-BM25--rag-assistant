A good method to reduce overfitting in Decision Trees is Pruning, i.e. not to generate the tree downto the last attribute (pre-prune), or generate the "full" tree and then post-prune. Not sure if it pertains to Bayesian theory per se, but the leaf nodes of the "pruned" tree have probabilities about the various classifications that are constrained by the pruned branches. There is an implementation in Weka (J48 classifier) and the accompanying book Data Mining - Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques: http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0120884070 If you would like to read in more detail on what I just wrote above, it is explained in detail in Chapter 6.1
