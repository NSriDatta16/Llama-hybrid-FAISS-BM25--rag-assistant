WP7 - Why are my bindings not firing when the windows back button is pressed?

Hopefully there is an obvious answer to this that my brain at 2am is not seeing (I'm basing this on the fact I can't find anyone else with the same problem). When I press the "hardware/built in" back button on my windows phone 7 none of my bindings are re-evaluating. For example on my MainPage I have a button's "IsEnabled" bound to a bool property in my ViewModel that checks if a value is in isolated storage. In the emulator it starts as disabled (obviously). I then navigate to another page and add the required value to isolated storage. When i press the hardware back button to return to the original page the binding does not get re-evaluated and my button remains disabled. However if I go back to MainPage via code using the navigate method the binding gets re-evaluated and everything is good. Any ideas as to why?
