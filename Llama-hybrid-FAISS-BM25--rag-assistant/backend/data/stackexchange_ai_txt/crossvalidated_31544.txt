There is no simple and obviously appropriate way to model dependence in this case. One artificial way to try would be to set this up as a Markov chain where the state is the grade in the current course and you move to the grade in the next course from there. You can set up the transition probabilities for the chain to fit your belief in how likely an A is to follow an A or a B to follow an A. If you have data on how the students did in courses over time you could estimate the transition probabilities based on the data for the students.
