Method A is my choice. I think Furnes has some of the best answers so far, but here are a few other things to consider... From what I can tell... your code isn't that complex in the first place - should you really be worrying about performance with this snippet of code? Leveraging others' code usually leads to better performance, flexibility and extensibility in the long run. Less of your own code is a good thing. If you choose to delegate the work to the database, there's plenty of optimization that you can literally drop in there, unlike if you rely on your own code. For example, adding indexes to the table you're querying might make more difference than choosing which programming route to take. If you still want to know the absolutely most efficient way ... why not time/profile the code? See which method is faster using concrete metrics using your own dataset rather than playing the theoretical game.
