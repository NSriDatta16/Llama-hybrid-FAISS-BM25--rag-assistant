You are looking for "Instrumentation", which is what frameworks like AspectJ do. In this case you have to specify a jar in the command line with the "-agent" option, and then have the possibility to filter all loaded classes. During this filter step you can check for annotations, and modify the bytecode before it gets loaded in the virtual machine. Libraries for doing the actual bytecode modification include "asm", and maybe the highlevel wrappers "cglib" and "javassist". You could even precompile your classes to generate a list of classes which have to be instrumented by you, to make filtering in the beginning a bit faster. See java.lang.instrumentation for more info.
