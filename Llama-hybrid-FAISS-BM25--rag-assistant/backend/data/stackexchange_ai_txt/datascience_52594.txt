What is the standard model for CNN to compare against other classifier technique?

I have created a new method to do binary image classification. I think it would be interesting to compare it to the convolutional neural network that would do the same binary classification given the same data sets. The question I have is what would be a standard architecture of such CNN model? How much should I tune it to increase the accuracy of the CNN model so it is fair to compare it to my methodology? I want this to be as fair as possible with the chance of maybe having my new methodology published. I tried googling my question but I could not stumble upon any blog about it. I would appreciate some guidance or links.
