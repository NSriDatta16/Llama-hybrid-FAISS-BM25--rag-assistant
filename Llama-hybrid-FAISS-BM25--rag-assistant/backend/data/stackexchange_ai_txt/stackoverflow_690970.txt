Ignoring the fact that you'd expect the requirement for Ajax to fall out of the user interface specification requirements (if you have such a thing), I'd think about implementing it (or implementing the hooks) sooner rather than later. 1) retro-fitting it to something that's been architected to return complete pages will not necessarily be straightforward 2) it'll potentially impact the deployment pattern of your solution, in that it'll be serving up pages plus page fragments/objects, and those fragments will result in many more hits to your server (imagine the extra hits that your server would get if you introduced something like Google Suggest , where potentially every keypress could result in a new server request). So you may not want to implement the Ajaxness immediately. But I would urge you to consider it (and if its required) sooner rather than later.
