Group by month and year in MySQL

Given a table with a timestamp on each row, how would you format the query to fit into this specific json object format. I am trying to organize a json object into years / months. json to base the query off: { "2009":["August","July","September"], "2010":["January", "February", "October"] } Here is the query I have so far - SELECT MONTHNAME(t.summaryDateTime) as month, YEAR(t.summaryDateTime) as year FROM trading_summary t GROUP BY MONTH(t.summaryDateTime) DESC"; The query is breaking down because it is (predictably) lumping together the different years.
