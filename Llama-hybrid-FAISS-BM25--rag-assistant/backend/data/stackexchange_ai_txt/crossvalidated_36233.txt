Simulate/Predict soccer standings after X rounds, based on current results/standing

How can I simulate/predict the soccer standings after a certain number of rounds, based on the currently played maches/standings. I would like to do this with R. After the first round, the result will not be precise, but after a few rounds, the simulation would probably become closer and closer to the real result. Data example: Round Home team Away team Home score Away score 1 Man Utd Arsenal 3 1 1 Liverpool Man City 0 1 1 Blackpool Newcastle 0 0 1 QPR Leeds 2 1 1 Chelsea Wigan 4 0 2 Arsenal Chelsea 2 2 2 Liverpool Wigan 0 1 2 Blackpool Leeds 2 2 . . . . And so on
