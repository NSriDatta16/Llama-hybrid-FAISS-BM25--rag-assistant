How to set the DataContext on a DataGrid Column Header

In my Silverlight 3 user control I am showing a basic DataGrid control. I need to generate the columns programmatically as follows: Style headerStyle = (Style)Resources["ColumnHeaderStyle"]; DataGridTextColumn col = new DataGridTextColumn(); col.HeaderStyle = headerStyle; dataGrid.Columns.Add(col); The style is defined as follows: I want to set the data context of the header to a "header" object (with "Name" and "Data" properties which are referenced in the DataTemplate). Unfortunately, I cannot use the StackPanel_Loaded event as suggested elsewhere , because the event handler is also called when the user starts a column drag&drop operation. What is the correct way of setting the DataContext of a DataGrid column header?
