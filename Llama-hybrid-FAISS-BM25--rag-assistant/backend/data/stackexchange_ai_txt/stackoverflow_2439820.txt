I invite any other answerers to give a good summary of pointers and references here. I don't think I can do that without making some mistakes here and there, and I have no intent to deal with the nerd rage that will follow. So I'll just point you to a good resource to learn about pointers and references which lies at the heart of your problem. http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/
