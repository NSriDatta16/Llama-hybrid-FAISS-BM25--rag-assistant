I don't think regression is old, it might be considered as trivial for some problems that are currently faced by data scientists, but still is the ABC of statistical analysis. How are you supposed to understand if SVM are working correctly if you don't know how the simplest model is working? Using such a simple tool teaches YOU how to look into the data before jumping into crazy complex models and understand deeply which tools can be used in further analysis and which cannot. Once having this conversation with a professor and colleague of mine she told me that her students where great in applying complex models but they could not understand what leverage is or read a simple qq-plot to understand what was wrong with the data. Often in the most simple and readable model stands the beauty.
