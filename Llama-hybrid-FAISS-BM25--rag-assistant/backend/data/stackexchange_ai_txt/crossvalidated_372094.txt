If I understand correctly, you have longitudinal data, i.e., data over time for each participant. If this is the case, then you can use a mixed-effects model or a multivariate regression model. In this type of models and provided that you define the mean and covariances structures appropriately/flexibly, you do not need to do any multiple-imputation. Estimating the models under a likelihood framework (e.g., maximum likelihood or Bayesian), will provide you with correct estimates and standard errors under the missing at random missing data mechanism (also under the missing completely at random mechanism). You will need some extra if you have missing not at random missing data. P.s., above I'm talking about missing data in the outcome variable. If you have missing data in the covariates, then multiple-imputation is indeed used.
