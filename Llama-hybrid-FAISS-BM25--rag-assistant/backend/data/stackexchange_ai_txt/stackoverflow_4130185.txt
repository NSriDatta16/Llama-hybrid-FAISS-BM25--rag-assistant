I'll be the first to admit that I have not learned how to do this yet (and I really should), but drag and drop would be a nice option to rearrange the tasks in the list. The look is very nice by the way. I'm using IE8 and I can't seem to use the keyboard shortcuts, unfortunately - but it seems like JSFiddle won't let me shift the focus to the result pane, so that may not be your code that's not behaving for IE8.
