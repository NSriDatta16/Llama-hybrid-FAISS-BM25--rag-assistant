Spring.Net Programmatic vs XML Configuration

If I define the objects in XML and call var xmlApplicationContext = new XmlApplicationContext() the job is scheduled and fires. What I would like to accomplish is to do this through code as the properties will be dynamic, the method fragment below compiles and runs but the job is not scheduled. Is this possible? // SpringJob.xml // Method var jobDetailObject = new JobDetailObject { JobType = new EmailNotification().GetType() }; var simpleTrigger = new SimpleTriggerObject { JobDetail = jobDetailObject, StartDelay = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1), RepeatInterval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1), RepeatCount = 0 }; var scheduleTrigger = new SchedulerFactoryObject(); var triggers = new Trigger[1]; triggers[0] = simpleTrigger; scheduleTrigger.Triggers = triggers; scheduleTrigger.Start();
