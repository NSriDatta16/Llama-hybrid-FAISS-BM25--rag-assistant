You need to think feature scaling, then pca, then your regression model as an unbreakable chain of operations (as if it is a single model), in which the cross validation is applied upon. This is quite tricky to code it yourself but considerably easy in sklearn via Pipeline s. A pipeline object is a cascade of operators on the data that is regarded (and acts) as a seemingly single model confirming to fit and predict paradigm in the library.
