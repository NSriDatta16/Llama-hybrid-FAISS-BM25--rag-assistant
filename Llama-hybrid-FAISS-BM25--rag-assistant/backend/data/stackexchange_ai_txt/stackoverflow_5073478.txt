First - indentation is important: Then thou must space to four. Four shall be the number of the spacing and the number of the spacing shall be four. Five shalt thou not space, neither shalt thou space three, excepting that thou then proceedeth to four. Tab characters are right out. Second - use helpful variable names. One character is usually Not Helpful. def average(lst): for lstNum in range(len(lst)): for sublistItem in range(len(lst[lstNum])): lst[lstNum] / lst[sublistItem] # It should be clear(er) now that sublistItem, used as an index into lst, makes no sense. If we were to replace lst[sublistItem] with lst[lstNum][sublistItem] it would be better, but then you would be dividing a list by an integer, which also makes no sense. Third - the pattern for num in range(len(lst)): val = lst[num] is un-Pythonic; if you really need to, use for num,val in enumerate(lst): instead, or even better, for val in lst: Fourth, to get the average you need to divide the sum of the list by the number of items in it; in your code you are doing neither. Try sum(lst) and len(lst) respectively.
