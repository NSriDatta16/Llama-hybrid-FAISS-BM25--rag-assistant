First we need to understand what a life form is. Take this explanation, for example: An entity which exists and tries to continue its existence through nourishment or procreation. If we accept this explanation then in fact many programs represent a life form. They exist, that's obvious. They attempt to continue their existence through opening child processes, surviving in persistent data storages and continuing the next day. So, here we are, among digital life forms around us. On the other hand, there's the idea of evolving and being sentient. With evolving, it's easy. Many programs have been written to be able to modify their body to adapt to certain scenarios. Computer viruses are first examples of that. With sentience, it is a different story. An entity needs to be aware of its existence, understand itself and the environment around it, also take active decisions on its life activities. A computer program has nothing of that kind. In fact, if it still applies, the scientists haven't figured out the definition of "being aware of itself" and consciousness. So until we know what that means, we can't attribute that quality to an entity or the other way around, to take it away. The bottom line is, you can argue a computer program to be a life form, but it does not qualify for a sentient being.
