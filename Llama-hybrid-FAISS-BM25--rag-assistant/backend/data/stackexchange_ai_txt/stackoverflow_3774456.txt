In my opinion you should skip the fake Azure tables completely. Even the MS development storage is not an exact match to how things will actually run in the cloud. You get 1M transactions for $1, 1GB of storage for $0.15 and $0.15 per GB in/out of the data centre. If you're just prototyping, live dangerously and spend $10. If you're new to working with Azure tables and you try to use a development storage or some other proxy you'll save yourself that much money in time spent reworking your code to work against the real thing. If you're just using tables and not queues, blobs $10 will go a long way.
