Exposing Entity IDs of Google Datastore data

Is it save to expose entity ids of data that is in Google Datastore. For example in my code i have entity with this id: @PrimaryKey @Persistent(valueStrategy = IdGeneratorStrategy.IDENTITY) @Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="gae.encoded-pk", value="true") private String id; The id is going to be similar to this: agptZeERtzaWYvSQadLEgZDdRsUYRs Can anyone extract password, application url and any other information from this string? What is the meaning of that string?
