Problem in Saving a custom registration fields in Magento 1.4.2.0 DB

I want to add some custom fields in the registration form and I tried to do that following the Magento Custom Account/Registration Fields and the Fontis Adding Custom Signup Attributes but no success yet. After searching the net, it seems that something has been changed in magento new version 1.4.2.0 as these tutorials were okay in the previous versions, even 1.4.2.0 beta. Now the actual problem is that the input data from the registration form, edit form cannot be saved into the database. It cannot be retrieved from the database. Also, the custom fields cannot appear in admin backend. Please let us know how to get it worked successfully by adding the custom fields in magento. I greatly appreciated it. Thanks. ~Shaman
