Strange CrystalReportsViewer toolbar behaviour

I have a problem with the CrystalReportsViewer's toolbar that puzzles me. Let's say I have a report that consists of five pages. If I click the next button, I get to page two as expected, but if I press it again, page two reloads! I can click the last page button and get to the last page , but if I try to go to the previous page from there, I end up on page one again. So, no matter how many pages my report has, I can only get to the first, the second and the last one! These problems began when we migrated from Windows Server 2003 to 2008 . We're running Crystal Reports 10 which perhaps have problems under 2008? Can any of 2008's new security stuff be responsible for this? Has anyone seen this behaviour before and know how to solve it? Thanks!
