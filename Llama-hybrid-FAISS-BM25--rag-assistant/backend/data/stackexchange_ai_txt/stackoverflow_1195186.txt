Transparent Swing Windows

I have a little JWindow with a logo on it that users can drag stuff to. I develop my application mainly on OS X. To get a transparent window i use setBackground(new Color(0,0,0,0)); On a mac this works beautifully but I can't get the same effect on windows. Is there any way to get a transparent window without using 1.6 specific features. I need 1.5 compatibility.
