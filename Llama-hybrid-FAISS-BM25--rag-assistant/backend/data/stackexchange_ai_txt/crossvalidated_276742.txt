Are there heuristics for prioritizing variable interactions to try to improve model performance?

I have a classifier model working with p predictors -- with a reasonable level of success. I have tried my typical feature engineering tricks but the classifier performance is stubbornly stuck -- this has been a bit unexpected. I want to explore variable(predictor) interactions to try to further improve the performance. I don't have a good intuition how the variable interactions would play to improve performance. The number of predictors is not small, thus the number of possible interactions is rather large. Is there any heuristic by which I can pick which interactions to try before others? For example: Prioritize predictors that have low correlation Prioritize predictors that have high correlation Prioritize predictors that are monotonic and non-monotonic vis-a-vis some variable
