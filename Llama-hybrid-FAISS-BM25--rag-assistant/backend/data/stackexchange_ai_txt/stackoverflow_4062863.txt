You can remove the linebreaks with rstrip : alus = [] with open('alus.txt', 'r') as f: for rida in f: rida=rida.rstrip() if rida: alus.append(rida) else: break By the way, the usual way to test if a string is empty is if not rida: rather than if (rida == ''): And if you have an if...else block, you should consider the non-negated form: if rida: since it is usually easier to read and understand. Edit: My previous comment about removing break was wrong. (I was mistaking break with continue .) Since break stops the loop, it needs to be kept to preserve the behavior of your original code. Edit 2: A.L. Flanagan rightly points out that rstrip removes all trailing whitespace, not just the ending newline character(s). If you'd like to remove the newline characters only, you could use A.L. Flanagan's method, or list the characters you wish to remove as an argument to rstrip : rida = rida.rstrip(r'\r\n')
