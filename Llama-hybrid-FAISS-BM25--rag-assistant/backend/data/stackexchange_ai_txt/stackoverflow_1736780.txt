I'm not exactly sure what you're asking, but it is possible. When a UIPickerView has a row tapped, it tells its delegate via the -pickerView:didSelectRow:inComponent: method. So, you'll need to set the picker's delegate. You do this by dragging from the delegate outlet to your controller in Interface Builder, or by setting picker.delegate = someObject in code. setting delegate http://grab.by/zlY Then, in the delegate: - (void)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView didSelectRow:(NSInteger)row inComponent:(NSInteger)component { // load xib or whatever you like } Edit with more info: To load the XIB you will most likely want to use -initWithNibNamed:bundle: on a view controller class. In that delegate function above, the number row is the row which was selected. You can use that row to construct the nib name you want to use.
