Recommendations of a high volume log event viewer in a Java environment

I am in a situation where I would like to accept a LOT of log events controlled by me - notably the logging agent I am preparing for slf4j - and then analyze them interactively. I am not as such interested in a facility that presents formatted log files, but one that can accept log events as objects and allow me to sort and display on e.g. threads and timelines etc. Chainsaw could maybe be an option but is currently not compatible with logback which I use for technical reasons. Is there any project with stand alone viewers or embedded in an IDE which would be suitable for this kind of log handling. I am aware that I am approaching what might be suitable for a profiler, so if there is a profiler projekt suitable for this kind of data acquisition and display where I can feed the event pipe, I would like to hear about it). Update 2009-03-19: I have found that there is not a log viewer which allows me to see what I would like (a visual display of events with coordinates determined by day and time, etc), so I have decided to create a very terse XML format derived from the log4j XMLLayout adapted to be as readable as possible while still being valid XML-snippets, and then use the Microsoft LogParser to extract the information I need for postprocessing in other tools.
