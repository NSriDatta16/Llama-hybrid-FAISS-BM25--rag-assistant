how the interaction between one binary variable with several binary variables modeled in logistic?

I want to assess the interaction among genotype (coded as 0 and 1) and dietary intake {(fat intake ‎‎(coded as 0 and 1), carbohydrate intake (coded as 0 and 1 and also energy intake (coded as 0 and 1)} by ‎logistic regression. How the model should be formed? I should assess them separately in separate ‎logistic model or put all of them in one model? Hope it is clear! ‎
