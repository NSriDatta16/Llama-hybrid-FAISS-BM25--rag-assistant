Firefox doesn't have that feature. Mozilla doesn't think SQLite is appropriate for the web, so in Firefox 4 they will be instead opting for and implementing the IndexedDB spec. draft by the W3C (incl. proposals by Mozilla). Here's a nice blog post detailing the differences: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/comparing-indexeddb-and-webdatabase/ So yes, you will have to use client specific code in order to support FF4 - at least until IndexedDB is implemented in the other major browsers. For anything before FF4, there is no support for any client database (not counting localStorage, etc.).
