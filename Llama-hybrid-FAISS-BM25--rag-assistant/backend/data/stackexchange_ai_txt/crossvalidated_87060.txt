Using fitted ARIMA model to forecast new time series

I'm new to ARIMA analysis and I'm trying to understand how fitted ARIMA model can be used to forecast new time series, given starting point only. Should the model be refitted or the estimated parameters are sufficient to produce forecasts? Thanks
