You could call it a time series or a time-series variable (though most people neglect the hyphen). You could also use the more general term of longitudinal data; time-series data entail one type of longitudinal data. (If the measurements were taken at only two points, this would hardly constitute a time series and would have to be analyzed with other methods besides time-series methods.) Analysts typically seek to answer two types of questions using time-series data. One is "to what extent can we explain the changes that occur?" -- as by creating a model of that single variable. ARIMA modeling is an example of such an approach. A second is, "To what extent can we explain changes in one such variable as a function of one or more others?" (A bit more on terminology: while the series of numbers is a variable, the term "data point" applies only to any individual number, such as the 82. And then "data set" would usually refer to a group of such variables that might be analyzed together.)
