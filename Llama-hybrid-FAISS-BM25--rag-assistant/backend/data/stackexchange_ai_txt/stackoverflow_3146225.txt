How suitable is flash for handling my audio processing needs?

This is not a specific question, instead I'm trying to get an idea of flashes capabilities. I'm building a website that has an Mp3 upload component on it. Serverside I can use the command line audio tool "SOX" for most of my heavy lifting but I'd like to offload some of it onto a flash client. Essentially, client side, needs to be able to do the following: User selects an mp3 file off their harddrive. Render it as a waveform. Display a scaled indication of 30 seconds of the waveform that the user can drag backwards and forwards. This will record a start time. Upload either the full mp3 or just the selected start time plus 30 seconds. I've never programmed anything in flash before so I'm not really sure what it's capable of.
