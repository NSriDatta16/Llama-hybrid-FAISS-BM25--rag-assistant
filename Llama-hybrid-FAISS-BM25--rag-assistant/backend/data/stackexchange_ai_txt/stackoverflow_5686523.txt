The restriction depends on the operating system. Standard Linux is 2 Gb, Solaris is 3 Gb, Windows is (I'm told) 2 or 3 depending on how PAE is used. However, you don't get all of that 2G for your data. Your code will take some of it, and your program's stack will take some, and the C library will take some, as will any other shared libraries that you reference. Typically the OS will organize the code, heap, and stack such that there are intentional gaps between them. As for your final question: it's all virtual memory. What you are actually asking is "if the programs in my machine use all that physical memory, will the OS use swap." And the answer is yes, but not quite the way you think. A CPU can only access physical RAM. It knows nothing of data stored on disk. So to give physical memory to a running process, the OS will take that memory from another process . In order to take the memory, it will write it to swap. When that other process needs to access the memory, the OS will read it back in, potentially writing some other process' memory to swap.
