It is likely that some parts of the page, most often images or scripts, are loaded non-secure. You'll need to go through them in the browser's "view page source" view one by one and eliminate the reason (most often, a configuration setting pointing to http:// ). Some external tools like Google Analytics that you may be embedding on your site can be included through https:// , some don't. In that case, you may have to remove those tools from your secure site. If you can't switch all the settings, try using relative paths but the first thing is to identify the non-secure elements using the source code view of your browser. An immediate redirection from a https:// page to a http:/ one would not result in a warning as you describe. Can you specify what's up with that?
