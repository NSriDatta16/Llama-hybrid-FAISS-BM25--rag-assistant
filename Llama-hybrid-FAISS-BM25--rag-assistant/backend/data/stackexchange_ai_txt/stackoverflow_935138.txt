Continuous Integration Advice?

I'm working on setting up a Continuous Integration server (using Integrity) for my Rails app, and I'd like advice: Do most folks set up CI to build and test their app on every push to their central SCM repository, or only when pushing to their staging branch? I'll use the CI server to automatically run flay, flog, reek, and rcov -- are there any other testing or code-coverage tools I should run? I'm planning to deploy my app on Slicehost. Should I set up the CI server on a separate Slicehost slice that's set up to be identical (wrt installed gems, libraries, etc.) to my production slice? If I do use a separate slice for CI, is there any harm in using the CI slice for a staging server as well? kind regards, Jacob
