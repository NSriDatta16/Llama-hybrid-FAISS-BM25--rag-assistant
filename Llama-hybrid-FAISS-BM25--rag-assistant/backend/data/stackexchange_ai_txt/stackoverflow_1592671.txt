I can offer you some general algorithms... O(1): Accessing an element in an array (i.e. int i = a[9]) O(n log n): quick or mergesort (On average) O(log n): Binary search These would be the gut responses as this sounds like homework/interview kind of question. If you are looking for something more concrete it's a little harder as the public in general would have no idea of the underlying implementation (Sparing open source of course) of a popular application, nor does the concept in general apply to an "application"
