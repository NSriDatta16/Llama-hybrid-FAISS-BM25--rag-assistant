How to Classify an Image in a Class and a Subclass?

I am a beginner in Machine Learning and I have a situation where an Image needs to be classified into first a super class, then a subclass. For Example, I have a set of images of fruits, containing images of Mangoes, Banana, Peaches, Apples etc. Then each fruit can either be fresh or rotten. I have training set containing images of rotten and fresh fruits for each Fruit type. So for a test image I need to classify which fruit it is (Mango, Banana, etc) and then whether it is fresh or rotten. I want to know how to approach this kind of problem
