One possibility would be to simply use a network sniffer. Wireshark is amazingly good. It would be tricky to measure by connection (when using multiple connections on a given machine), but you could use it to measure all the traffic to and from a client machine. One benefit of this is that it would also measure outgoing requests, which should be small in your situation (report generation) but are still a part of the overall load. Another benefit of measuring it this way is that it would find differences (if there are any) in the size of requests being made. For example, if one method caused individual records to be read from the server in separate requests and the other method caused a "batch" of records to be read in one request, then you would be able to see those differences. Both methods in this case might show that the total data at the DbDataReader level is the same, but the first method would result in significantly more network traffic. Wireshark shows a lot of statistics that could be useful for this. It can give total number of packets, average size of packets, total size, average bytes per second, etc.
