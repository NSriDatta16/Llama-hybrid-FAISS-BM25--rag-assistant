I think there are plenty of other posts related to this topic. However, I'll chime in since I've moved off mysql and onto mongodb. It's fast, very fast but that doesn't mean it's perfect. My advice, use what you're comfortable with. If it takes you longer to refactor code in order to make it fit with mongo or couch, then stick to mysql if that's what you're familiar with. If this is something you want to pick up as a skillset then by all means learn mongodb or couchdb. For me, I went with mongodb for couple of reasons, file storage via gridfs and geolocation. Yea I could've used mysql but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I must say, I'm impress and I still have ways to go before I can say I'm comfortable with mongo. With what you've listed, I can tell you that mongo will fit most of your needs.
