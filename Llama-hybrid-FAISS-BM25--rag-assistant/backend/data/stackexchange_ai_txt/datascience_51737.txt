I can not find a pre-trained neural network model for object detection

A simple model is needed, but with good accuracy, mAP for detecting objects is preferably trained on COCO, preferably on ipynb (to run or train on google colab). The models from the Tensorflow (Faster_rcnn, ssd, R-FCN, YOLO V2 ) will not fit, because need a custom model for example, because I need to develop my own model Any help?
