Neural networks learn from data and are able to generalize to examples which are new yet similar in some form. Hence, if you have something completely different and never seen before, the network will not be able to classify it correctly. One thing that you could do is move the decision threshold for your classes, for example instead of class good being over 0.5 you move it to 0.7. This way only objects which you are more certain are good are classified as such, all other objects are classified as bad. To decide the best place for your decision threshold you should look at the ROC curves for your classifier, and choose the compromise between the False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) that best fits your particular problem.
