What makes Rake so useful in Ruby?

Perhaps this is a dumb question, and I'm not under estimating the value of Rake here by any means, I'm just not getting it. What value does Rake have if all it is, is arbitrarily executed Ruby code? It's apparently good at handling tasks, but what's to stop me from writing a class and embedding it into a shared Ruby directory and executing that code as my task instead? What value does Rake really offer?
