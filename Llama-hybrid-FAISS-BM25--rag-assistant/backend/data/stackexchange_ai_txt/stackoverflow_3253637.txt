Using the indexes seems like it'll be fragile in the long run, so is probably best avoided. One approach would be to retain the pointer to the view in a member variable so you don't need to use objectAtIndex. Another approach would be to do: [CV setTag:5]; and instead of objectAtIndex, use: [self.view withWithTag:5]; ('5' is an arbitary choice - it should be a unique number within your program! It would be best to use a #define or enum to store the value - eg. #define MY_VIEW_TAG 5 and setTag:MY_VIEW_TAG etc)
