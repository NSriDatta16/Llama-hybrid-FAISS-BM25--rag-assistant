A string constant should be in double quotes, not single quotes: "bob" Single quotes are for character constants. Then, int length (std::string array) { return sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]); } should take an array as input, but even then won't work and can't be fixed except by making it a macro (which is a sure way to get you banned from the C++ experts' guild for a decade) or by making length a template function, which may be a bit advanced. Use std::vector instead, it has a size method for this. Finally, void output (int sortedItems) { for (int i = 0; ; i++) { std::cout doesn't really take an int , does it? A stop condition in the loop would also be nice, to prevent the proverbial dragons flying out your nose.
