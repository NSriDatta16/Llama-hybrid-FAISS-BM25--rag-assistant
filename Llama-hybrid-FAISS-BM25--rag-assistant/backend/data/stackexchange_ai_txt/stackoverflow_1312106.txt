Searching through my bookmarks, only links I found are those : Extension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs [continued] Extension Writing Part III: Resources Wrapping C++ Classes in a PHP Extension If you are really interested by the subject, and ready to spend some money on it, you could buy the book Extending and Embedding PHP ( some pages are available as preview on Google Books too) ; I've seen a couple of times that it was the book to read when interested on this subject (In fact, I've just bought it ^^ didn't have the time to read it yet, though :-( ; the first pages seem OK...) BTW, the author of that book is also the author of the first four articles I linked to ;-)
