I think it's pretty clear that the theory behind statistics is mostly pure mathematics, while the application is not. For example, showing that the sample mean is the optimal unbiased estimator for the mean of a normal distribution is clearly a rigorous mathematical theorem based on the laws of probability. In the same way, there are many theorems for statistical algorithms (bootstraping, MCMC) showing that they converge under certain assumptions. When applying statistics to real world problems there are other more practical elements to discuss. But the theory behind statistics is very profound mathematics.
