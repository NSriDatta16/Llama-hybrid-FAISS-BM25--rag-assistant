Gradually increasing reinforcement learning environment complexity

The problem of robotic arm control has different levels of complexity ranging from simulation to real-world application. For example, a simulation may not model friction of the joints, which becomes important in reality. Is it possible to use a model trained in a simple environment to bootstrap learning in a more complex environment? Does this have a name? Does it fall under hierarchical reinforcement learning?
