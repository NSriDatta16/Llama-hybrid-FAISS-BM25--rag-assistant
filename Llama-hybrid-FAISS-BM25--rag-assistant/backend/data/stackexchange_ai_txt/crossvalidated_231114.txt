Pooling Estimates from Multiple Imputation Logistic Regression

I'm currently attempting to pool multiple logistic regression results together. I used SPSS to perform the logistic regressions using complex weights. The option to pool the results together is not available when using complex weights in SPSS. Unfortunately, the resources available to me are SPSS and Excel. I'm attempting to pool in the results for the variables (significance, Odds ratio, Confidence interval) but was not able to find how to do so. How would I be able to combine the results in those multiple logistic regressions?
