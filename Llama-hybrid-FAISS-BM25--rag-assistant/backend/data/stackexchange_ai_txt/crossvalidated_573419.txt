Distribution of Residuals and Response - When to use which?

I would like to analysze the relation between my continuous response 'soil moisture content [%]' and 2 categorical and 1 continuous predictors. I fit a linear mixed model and checked the distribution with the check_distribution() function of the performance package. library(performance) lmer(soil_moisture ~ weed_coverage+distance + treatment + (1 | kettlehole/plot) + (1|date), data = BFK_comp) -> lmmod check_distribution(lmmod) I got this result and plot Predicted Distribution of Residuals Distribution Probability normal 88% tweedie 9% weibull 3% Predicted Distribution of Response Distribution Probability beta-binomial 34% tweedie 22% gamma 16% As I understand it, the predicted distribution of the residuals need to be normally distributed, so I can use a linear regression, right? I am not talking about the other assumptions here, just normality. After that I did a test with the check_normality() fuction, also from the performance package and it says Warning: Non-normality of residuals detected (p These results seem to be contradictory to me or am I missing something here? Also, I want to test if there is a significant difference between soil moisture content and distance (factor with 2 levels). Do I need to look at the distribution of the response or at the distribution of the residuals to find out if I need to use a t-test or wilcoxon signed rank test?
