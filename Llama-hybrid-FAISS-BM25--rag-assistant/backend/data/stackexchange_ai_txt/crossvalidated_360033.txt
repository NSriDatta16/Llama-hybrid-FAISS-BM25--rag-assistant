Just to complete Max's answer, here is one way to ensure that you select variables of your choice of subset-size from the output given above. Suppose you want a set-size of 10: set.size = 10 #you want set-size of 10 lm.vars The issue is that in different folds, different variables may be selected in the set of 10. So we average the importance/ranking score of all variables in set, and choose the highest ranked 10 variables #use aggregate to calculate mean ranking score (under column "Overall") lm.set This will give the following output: Group.1 x 9 hardness 452.3865743 10 homo 363.2872843 11 lumo 283.3329715 20 pnsa1 1.0754635 29 smr_vsa0 1.0078744 13 most_positive_charge 0.9588959 6 fnsa1 0.9310444 14 o_sp2 0.8874429 1 a_acc 0.8706394 18 peoe_vsa.5.1 0.8072423
