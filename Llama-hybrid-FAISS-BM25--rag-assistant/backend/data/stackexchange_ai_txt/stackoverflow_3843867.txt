libcurl should indeed solve your problem, check out their C API here . Here's a little code example to append an HTTP header: CURL handle; struct curl_slist *slist=NULL; slist = curl_slist_append(slist, "Content-Type: text/html"); curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, slist); As an aside, if you would like to simulate interaction with more complex websites (e.g., those that you can't feasibly POST data to), you could try using an actual web embedding framework (such as WebKit or Awesomium ) to simulate key-presses, mouse input, and Javascript calls.
