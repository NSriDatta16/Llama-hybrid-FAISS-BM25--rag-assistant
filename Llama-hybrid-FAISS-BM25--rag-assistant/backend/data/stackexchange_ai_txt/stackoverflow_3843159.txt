Get header values in ASP.NET MVC

I have a requirement to capture the HTTP User Agent header coming in from a device, take the value and remove a 'uuid' This UUID can then be used to direct the device to the correct location to give it the files relevant to the device. In webforms I was able to get it using Request.ServerVariables["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]; //inside of Page_Load method How would I go about this in MVC?
