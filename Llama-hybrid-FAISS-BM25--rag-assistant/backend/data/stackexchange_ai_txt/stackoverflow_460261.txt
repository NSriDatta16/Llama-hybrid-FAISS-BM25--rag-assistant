Does it have to be a List ? If not, you might consider using a SortedList or a SortedDictionary . You could then use the OrderNumber as the key, and just let the collection do the work. Alterantively, for List you can use List .BinarySearch with an appropriate IComparer which compares by order number - you'd have: int position = list.BinarySearch(newOrder, orderComparer); list.Insert(position >= 0 ? position : ~position, newOrder); You can use the same IComparer instance throughout your code, as it would be stateless. EDIT: This solution doesn't change the OrderNumber of any of the other entries, as suggested in Robert Wagner's answer .
