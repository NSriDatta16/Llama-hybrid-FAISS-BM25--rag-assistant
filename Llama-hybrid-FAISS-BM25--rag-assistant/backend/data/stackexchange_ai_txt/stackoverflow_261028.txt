Do you think that we as developers are worried about languages/tools than problem at hand?

I am a .NET developer now and have come from Foxpro /VB6/COM background. Over the time, I think we have changed to worry too much about languages/tools to do the work. If you look at what a developer in the .NET space would use, the list is ever growing. More so, the tools itself are so complex that - days are gone where you would find a solution by yourself. All of us has our dear friend Google (put your favorite search engine here) to rescue. How/When can we expect to raise the abstraction so that we don't have to worry too much about the complexity with the number of tools and instead focus on problem at hand? (Look at the number of tools a .NET developer would use. Yes, there are questions on it on Stack Overflow). How many of us can really fix some issue without looking it up? I am not saying that looking up is bad. But it wasn't the case some time back. Your thoughts are appreciated. There is no right/wrong answer for this. I am encouraging views of smart people here. If you think the question is flawed - please delete it :)
