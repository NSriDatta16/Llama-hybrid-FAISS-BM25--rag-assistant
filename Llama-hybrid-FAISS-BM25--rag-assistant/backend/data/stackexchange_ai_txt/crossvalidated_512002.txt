T-test vs. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test vs. Bayes

I am looking at a case where i have traffic to a page with say 10,000 visitors. About 2% of those visitors buy a product between $20-200. I want to test if a site redesign will increase my average revenue per visitor. My first instinct is to run a t-test on the control and test to see what the p-value is. Doing some research I found this page: https://www.blastanalytics.com/blog/best-revenue-significance-calculator-ab-testing It says a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is needed due to the skewed distribution caused by most users not converting and buying a product. Is this a test I should be looking into using? If so are there any power analysis tools I can use to determine the sample size? Or are there any other tests you would recommend? I have been looking into the Welch-t test as well. Thank you!
