While it does look simple enough to implement on your own with a timeout and a couple of mouse event handlers, it gets a bit more complicated when you consider cases like click-drag-release, supporting both press and long-press on the same element, and working with touch devices like the iPad. I ended up using the longclick jQuery plugin ( Github ), which takes care of that stuff for me. If you only need to support touchscreen devices like mobile phones, you might also try the jQuery Mobile taphold event .
