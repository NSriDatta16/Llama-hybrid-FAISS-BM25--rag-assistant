If both the following are true - I would suggest an entirely different approach. The File Service (sandboxed) demo works for your use-case. The user can be expected to be running Java 1.6.0_10+ (new generation plug-in). The linked demo. (written by me) is sand-boxed, and only when the user goes to open a file does the JRE ask them if they want to give it permission. It is not necessary for sand-boxed code to be digitally signed. Since the new generation plug-in, the JNLP API used in the demo. can be accessed by applets that are embedded in a web page. An example of that can be seen in the GIFanim applet .
