Does variable_get in Drupal have major issues with memcache?

On a few modules there is a variable_get that is pulling either the correct setting (toboggan/denied) or (node/200) even though the {variable} table is set to toboggan/denied? where is the node/200 coming from and why the randomness in values? Is this a caching issue? This problem is causing us to not be able to set admin settings on modules. Please suggest.
