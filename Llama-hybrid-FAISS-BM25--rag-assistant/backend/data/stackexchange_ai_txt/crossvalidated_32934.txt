I like the idea of looking for interventions that form level changes in a process. This can be done using ARIMA models and search for the changepoints. Our friend IrishStat does this with his autobox software as he so nicely demonstated yesterday. I am sure he will be happy to give you more details and perhaps even do a data analysis for you. I wouldn't call the level shifts outliers. There are various types of outliers in time series and numerous ways to try to detect them. We also discussed this either yesterday or today. Fox identified two type of outliers in his paper from back in the 70s.
