Decision boundary of a deep neural network

Given data points in $R^d$ , where $d$ is large, how does one compute the "actual" decision boundary from the output of a neural network? As I understand it, the neural network returns just a predicted class label associated with each test data point. Then, how is the entire decision boundary ascertained and how do people then plot a 2D cross-section of it? How does one decide which 2 dimensions to plot this on?
