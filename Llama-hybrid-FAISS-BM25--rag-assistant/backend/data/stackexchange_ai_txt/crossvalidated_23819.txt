This is a tough problem, here are a few observations: This paper might be of some help to you - it relies on the supervised learning techniques (in the context of multi-class classification) to detect adversarial ads. Since the adversarial strategies evolve, the authors have to rely on human experts who annotate rare "anomalies". They use SVM-based ranking techniques among others. As noted by others, you could try non-supervised-learning-based anomaly/outlier detection but that would require a lot of tuning to get the balance of false-positives and false-negatives right. Having a good set of features is very important - the choice of methodology is secondary (i.e. a simple technique such as Naive Bayes or logistic regression is often enough given a good feature set)
