A standard hurdle model is a mixture model consisting of a logistic regression model modelling the zeros and a poisson model modelling the counts. Therefore, you would have to use the count data in order to fit the model. Seeing that the sites differed in area, I would use the area of the site as an offset in your poisson model. This should solve your second and third question. In order to select the best hurdle model, maybe you could try a backwards selection procedure after incorporating all relevant predictors in both models, unless you have sound knowledge of which predictors will be associated with which part of the mixture model.
