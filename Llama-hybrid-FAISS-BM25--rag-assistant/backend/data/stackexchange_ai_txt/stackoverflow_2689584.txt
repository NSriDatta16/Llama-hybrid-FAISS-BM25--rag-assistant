I can see 2 different problems, but your question is a little bit too unspecific to really get. (Some code to test would be nice) Decimal is not an ideal storage container. Just like floats and doubles it has a limited range of good values and accuracy. It just happens to be bigger. Just because something is of type Decimal, does not imply that the gui control that deals with it know how to handle such large numbers. It may convert to float first and then put it in the decimal.
