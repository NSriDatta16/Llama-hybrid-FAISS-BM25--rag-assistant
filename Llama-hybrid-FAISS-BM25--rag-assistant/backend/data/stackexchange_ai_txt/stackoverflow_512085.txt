Most Linux distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard FHS (at least mostly). Big parts of it are simply rules that have been true for UNIX for quite some time ( /usr , /var , ...), others are rather new ( /media , ...). One thing that I found confusing initially is the existence of both /bin and /usr/bin as well as /lib and /usr/lib with a seeemingly random distribution of where stuff goes. The reasoning behind this split is that /usr might be mounted from a different storage (possible remote) than the root so /bin and /lib should contain a minimal system that is enough to get the whole system up and running in the event of some system failure. So Gnome, GIMP and so on can go in /usr , as they are not essential, but filesystem-tools such as fsck and mkfs as well as the shell sh need to reside in the non- usr directories.
