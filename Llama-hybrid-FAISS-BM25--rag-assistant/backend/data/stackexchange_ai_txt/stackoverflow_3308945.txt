You should use [hooks] incoming.btnet = python:~/path/to/hg_hook_for_btnet.py:debug_out and define debug_out as def debug_out(ui, repo, **kwargs): # ... as explained in the HG book -- all hooks are called with a ui and a repo argument plus some extra hook-specific arguments. The Mercurial API page explains what you can do with the ui and a repo arguments. Edit: Aha... I've now looked at the script . It is not designed to be run as an in-process Mercurial hook. It is instead designed to be run as a separate process. So you will need to use [hooks] incoming.btnet = c:\HG\MyRepo\hg_hook_for_btnet.py and make sure you follow the instructions in the script: it talks about setting the path to the hg.exe binary and to your Python interpreter. The latter means that the author expects you to install Python. There is an email address in the script -- I suggest you contact corey Trager directly or via a BugTracker.NET mailinglist. Since it's a bug tracker, I assume they have a proper place where you can report this! :-)
