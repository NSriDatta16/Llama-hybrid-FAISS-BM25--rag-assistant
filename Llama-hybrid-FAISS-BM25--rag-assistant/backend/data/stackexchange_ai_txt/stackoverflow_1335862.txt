Missing '{' after last if statement means that something in the "// ... code above skipped, not relevant ..." section is controlling access to that entire fragment of code. Out of all the code pasted only the strlcpy is executed. Solution: never use if statements without curly brackets to clarify control. Consider this... if(false) { if(something == stuff) { doStuff(); .. snip .. if(monkey == blah) some->garbage= nothing; return -1; } } crash(); Only "crash();" gets executed.
