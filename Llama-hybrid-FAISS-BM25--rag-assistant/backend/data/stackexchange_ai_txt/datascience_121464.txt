It won't matter if you would rank it in ascending order or descending order; as long as you have a specified order of the categories your machine learning model will be able to train the data. But you would still have to keep in mind the scale for "How happy with the service" column when you feed the data after you have trained to identify whether a customer will churn or not. You can read more about ordinal data on wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_data Another perspective here could be what if you just change the name of the column from "How happy with the service" to "How dissatisfied with the service". Would you still be thinking to change the scale? No, right.
