T-SQL While Loop and concatenation

I have a SQL query that is supposed to pull out a record and concat each to a string, then output that string. The important part of the query is below. DECLARE @counter int; SET @counter = 1; DECLARE @tempID varchar(50); SET @tempID = ''; DECLARE @tempCat varchar(255); SET @tempCat = ''; DECLARE @tempCatString varchar(5000); SET @tempCatString = ''; WHILE @counter ' + @tempCat; SET @counter = @counter + 1; END When the script runs, @tempCatString outputs as null while @tempCat always outputs correctly. Is there some reason that concatenation won't work inside a While loop? That seems wrong, since incrementing @counter works perfectly. So is there something else I'm missing?
