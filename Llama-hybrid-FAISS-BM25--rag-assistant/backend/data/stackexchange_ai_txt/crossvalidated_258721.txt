Gradient Ascent vs Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression

I've been going trough Machine Learning in Action book from manning ( https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action ) In the logistic regression chapter it uses gradient ascent to calculate the best weights. Why do we pick gradient ascent instead of gradient descent ?
