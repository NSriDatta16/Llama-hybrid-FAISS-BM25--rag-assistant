-The general idea of any Markov Process is that "given the present, future is independent of the past". -The general idea of any Bayesian method is that "given the prior, future is independent of the past", its parameters, if indexed by observations, will follow a Markov process PLUS "all the following will be the same in how I update my beliefs you give me new information A, then you give me new information B, you give me new information B, then new information A you give me A and B together" So its parameters will really be a Markov process indexed by time, and not by observations
