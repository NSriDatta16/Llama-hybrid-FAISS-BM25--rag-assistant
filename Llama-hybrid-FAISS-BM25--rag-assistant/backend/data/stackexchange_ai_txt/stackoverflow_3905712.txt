You think that's silly? Try re-downloading an entire 80MB app (resources and all!) every time a small code change is made. :) Given your figures of 8, 16, 32, 64 GB; I assume you're talking about storage capacity, rather than "memory" in the sense of RAM . If this is the case, you may consider compressing your resources and unzipping them to the app's sandbox for easy access on future boot-ups. Alternatively, you could bundle only the iPhone / iPod resources with the app and download the iPad-specific resources separately. Users might not like the surprise bandwidth usage and it might not even get past Apple. Finally, you could procedurally generate your resources and your users will love you for the saved space, if not battery life. Perhaps combine the best of both worlds and only generate the resources once?
