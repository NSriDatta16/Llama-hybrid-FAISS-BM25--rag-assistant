Unbounded likelihoods for unpenalized mixed effects

Most mixed effects models assume that the random effects $\gamma$ follow a $MVN(0, \Sigma_{\gamma})$ distribution. In some cases, specific structure is put on $\Sigma_{\gamma}$. For now, let's just assume it's an unstructured covariance matrix. Now, if we don't apply any priors or penalties on $\Sigma_{\gamma}$, it seems to me that the likelihood is unbounded. In particular, if we set $\gamma = 0$, then as $\det(\Sigma_{\gamma}) \rightarrow 0$, the contribution of the log-density of $\gamma$ approaches infinity. As long as the other contributions to the likelihood are finite (which is typically the case), this implies the log-likelihood would be unbounded. Clearly, for the MLE this creates an issue (although I know REML is a more popular alternative). For most MCMC algorithms, having unbounded log-densities can be problematic as well, even if the posterior is still proper. How is this issue typically handled? Is there a canonical penalty/prior on $\Sigma_{\gamma}$?
