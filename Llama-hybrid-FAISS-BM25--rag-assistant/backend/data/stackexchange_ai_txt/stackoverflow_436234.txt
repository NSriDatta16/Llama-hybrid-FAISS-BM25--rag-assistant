best approach to member variables in object-oriented javascript?

This is a follow up to a question I just posted. I'm wondering how you all handle member variables in javascript clases when using MyClass.prototype to define methods. If you define all of the methods in the constructor function: function MyClass(){ this.myMethod = function(){} } You can very nicely declare member variables and access them from inside your methods: function MyClass(){ var myVar = "hello"; this.myMethod = function(){ alert(myVar); } } When using the Object.prototype technique, you lose this nicety, and have to do it like this; function MyClass(){} MyClass.prototype.myVar = "hello"; MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function(){alert(this.hello)}; I'm not crazy about having to write "this" every time I access a member variable. I want to use the Object.prototype approach for memory and flexibility reasons, but it seems a lot clumsier syntax-wise. Is this how you folks generally work? thanks, -Morgan
