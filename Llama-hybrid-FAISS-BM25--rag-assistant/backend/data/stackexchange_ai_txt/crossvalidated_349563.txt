Suppose I am waiting for a bus at a stop. And suppose that a bus usually arrives at the stop in every 10 mins. Now I define λ to be the rate of arrival of a bus per minute . So, λ = (1/10). Now I want to compute the probability that no bus arrives in the next minute. I can do it using both the poisson and the exponential distribution. Poisson λ = 1/10 Probability of 0 arrivals in the next minute: P(X = 0) = 0.9048 Exponential λ = 1/10 Probability of my having to wait for more than 1 minute: P(X>1) = 0.9048 Note: Look at the expected values of both the distributions. For Poisson, we get that the average number of buses arriving per minute E(X) = λ = 0.10 buses. For exponential, the average waiting time for a bus to arrive E(X) = (1/λ) = 10 mins
