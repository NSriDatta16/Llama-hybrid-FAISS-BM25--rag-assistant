What is the relationship between training-test split and shifting window for time series?

I have created a stock trend prediction model with sentiment analysis but I am confused of the relationship between training test split and shifting window for time series. Is the shifting window used for validation and train-test split separates the data for the model? Or are the two interchangeable? I know the train-test split procedure is used to estimate the performance of machine learning algorithms when they are used to make predictions on data not used to train the model. But I don't understand why a sliding window is used in existing literature? Thank you for the help :)
