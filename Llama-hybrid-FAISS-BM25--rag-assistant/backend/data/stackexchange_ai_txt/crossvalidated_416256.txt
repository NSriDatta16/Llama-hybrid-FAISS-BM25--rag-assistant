GANs for non image data

I'm looking to narrow down the subject for my bachelor thesis: I am currently working on a project, that only offers a small dataset and there will be no more data incoming for now. What I'm trying to do now, is optimizing my neural net with augmented data, produced by a GAN. Mostly, I just find GANs that are being used for images. What I am trying to predict are machines that can be used for production. Does anybody here know about possiblities, sources or other ideas that fit to this topic? Any help would be welcome! The only source I found, yet is this one: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00981.pdf
