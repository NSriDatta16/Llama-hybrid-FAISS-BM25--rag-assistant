Your situation is actually very common. The ANOVA confirms that your model estimates provide a much better fit than just using a na√Øve model that would take the average as a best estimate. And, it does this at a statistically significant level. You have 4 variables. And, 2 of them are associated with statistically significant regression coefficients. That's good. You also have 2 variables that are associated with regression coefficients that are not statistically significant. And, that is not necessarily bad given certain conditions. Make sure that those variables are associated with coefficient signs that are directionally correct and convergent with the assumed direction of their explanatory influence on the dependent variable. Next, look at the P values. Are the P values not that high anyway. Different audiences and circumstances will be associated with different tolerance of P values. In certain circumstances, model developers want their P values to be at least less than 0.20. Some others would prefer I am somewhat agnostic on the above. But, I think it makes often very good sense to keep variables in a model that are not statistically significant. Here is a test I would use on whether to keep such variables in the model. Rerun your model with just that one variable. When you do so, is it now statistically significant and with a coherent directional sign that confirms the sign you have in your larger model. If it is? And, if that variable has much explanatory power whereby you now pretty much what sign it should have and it does in the models, I would consider keeping it and being rather liberal on the P value stuff. Keep in mind, all precise statistical significance criteria are really arbitrary by definition. What is more important is that your model makes sense, that it performs well (Hold Out and cross validation), and that the regression coefficients throughout the mentioned testing are reasonably stable... or when they are not... that you can readily explain why they are not.
