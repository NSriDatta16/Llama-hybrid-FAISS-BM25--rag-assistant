p-value = 0.5329 Does it mean that the probability to discard the normality hypothesis A p-value is not "the probability to discard the hypothesis". You should review the meaning of p-values. The first sentence of the relevant wikipedia page should help: the p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed sample results (or a more extreme result) when the null hypothesis is actually true. (NB: I have modified the above link to the version that was current at the time I wrote the answer, as the opening paragraph of the article has been edited badly and it's presently - June 2018 - effectively wrong.) It goes on to say: If this p-value is very small, usually less than or equal to a threshold value previously chosen called the significance level (traditionally 5% or 1% [1]), it suggests that the observed data is inconsistent with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true This is quite different from "probability to discard the hypothesis". is 53.29%? A p-value around 53% is quite consistent with the null hypothesis. (However, this does not imply that the distribution that the data were supposedly a random sample from is normal; it would be consistent with an infinite number of non-normal distributions as well.)
