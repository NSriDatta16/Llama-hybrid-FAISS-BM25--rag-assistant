Can I use ordinal regression?

I want to compare three groups on determinants: A group that has survived 10 years of survival. The question is whether certain determinants are different in the group with long survival i.e. What determinants are associated with survival of >10 years? I've already established I can't use a Cox regression to answer this question (because it doesn't tell me specifically what characterizes those patients with >10 year survival, but rather what determinants are associated with events during follow-up). Is ordinal logistic regression a good fit to answer this question? Or do you have other suggestions to answer this question? I've also considered to do a subgroup Cox regression analysis of only those patients with >10 years survival and compare the hazard ratios with the Cox model from the whole cohort, but I'm afraid that will give me a problem with the statistical power (as there are only 900 patients in this group with 120 events compared to more than 4000 with 700 events in the whole cohort).
