In theory, the very first thing to do should be fixing noises and seasonality. There are various ways of approaching the noises. If possible, try to understand the reason for noisy samples and extract the noise part from them manually. Or, use the smoothing algorithms to minimize the noises. In addition, you can create a dummy predictor variable that will be accountable for the noise part in the data. In time-series data, you can manually put 1 for the dates that you consider as noise and 0 for normal data points. You can read more about dummy variables here . However, it might be unhealthy to use dummy variables for improper cases. To overcome seasonality, there are some powerful approaches, for example, X-13ARIMA-SEATS is a good method of extracting the seasonality from the time series. If you want to do a split on the strength of some metric, you might encounter different possible scenarios. For example, if you would use some metric to split the data like variance or information then your test data would be very dissimilar compared to your train data. Thus, the test set would perform poorly since its characteristic is not like the train data. In other words, you might not objectively assess the performance of the model. Lastly, as Albert mentioned in the comments, if you do a time-series prediction, then it would be better to split the data using the time. In other words, n consecutive samples would be your train data and m consecutive samples would be your test data.
