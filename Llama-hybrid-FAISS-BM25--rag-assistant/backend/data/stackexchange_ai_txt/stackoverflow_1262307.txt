What are Navigation Properties in Entity Framework for?

I see in my EF diagram alot of these navigation properties but not sure what they are really for. Like I see in lots of my tables I have aspnet_Users properties. What are these for? Do they help for joins? or what? Error 2 Error 3007: Problem in Mapping Fragments starting at lines 1201, 1423: Non-Primary-Key column(s) [Field2] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties - data inconsistency is possible because the corresponding conceptual side properties can be independently modified.
