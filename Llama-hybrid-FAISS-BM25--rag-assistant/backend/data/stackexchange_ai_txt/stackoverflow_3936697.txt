HTML - Position an image in a new line

I have a series of paragraphs. Each one ends with a illustration which clarifies the subject being explained in the paragraph. I want the illustration to be on a new line and not display along with the text and I have found the following solutions, with it's own problems: Put the illustration in a different than the text related to the illustration. Some text here This seems to solve all the problems, but later I needed to enclose some of this paragraphs inside a instead of a . The problem being I cannot enclose the tag for the illustration inside a and does not make sense to put the illustration inside a . Some text Put the ilulstration inside the same as the text. Then use tag to move the picture to a new line. I'm not really happy with this workaround, the is doing presentational stuff that should be better in CSS. Some text here Finally, set the display attribute of the as block in the CSS style sheet. I'm not sure if this is a good way and don't know the unrelated consequences it may have. I don't know if there is a standard way of doing this. I have search for CSS to start my image in a new line but did not find it. Any help will be welcome.
