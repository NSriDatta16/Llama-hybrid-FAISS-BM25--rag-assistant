Gauss proposed root mean square deviation from the mode, which is similar to the standard deviation, just replacing the mean with mode. He also proved that, asymptotically, for any unimodal distribution with a finite second moment, this root mean square deviation from the mode is between one standard deviation and two standard deviation. Gauss, C. F. (1823). Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae. Henricus Dieterich. However, generally, this is an ill approach, because 1, if the distribution is not unimodal, than we can hardly choose which mode as the reference. 2, for non-asymptotic case, even for a unimodal distribution, the corresponding finite sample distribution is almost always not a perfect unimodal distribution, then, the same issue. Generally, there are three nonparametric approaches to estimate the population dispersion: Quantile differences (Range/Interquartile range), Bickel-Lehmann dispersion (median absolute deviation, standard deviation, average absolute deviation, any estimators defined using a location estimator to estimate the deviations of all points relative to the location estimate of the sample can be seen in this class), and Bickel-Lehmann spread (besides the estimators proposed in Bickel and Lehmann's landmark paper, the popular Rousseeuwâ€“Croux estimator and Gini's mean difference also can be seen in this class since they are a modification of the pairwise differences). Estimators belong to the class, Bickel-Lehmann spread, are the optimal approach in terms of variance, but their computational cost is often much higher than others. This is because the variance is mainly dependent on the sample size/pseudo sample size, this principle is governed by the Central Limit Theorem (although CLT is about the sample mean, the principle can be extended to other estimators, asymptotic normality). Suppose the sample size is n, the median absolute deviation is essentially estimating the median of all n absolute deviations, so, the pseudosample size, i.e., the acutual size related to the median is also n. The Bickel-Lehmann spread is the location of all n^2 pairwise differences, so the pseudosample size is n^2. The quantile differences (Range/Interquartile range) is just computing two quantiles, so the pseudosample size is 2. A rough comparison of the pseudosample size can immediately conclude that, in terms of variance, quantile differences>Bickel-Lehmann dispersion>Bickel-Lehmann spread.
