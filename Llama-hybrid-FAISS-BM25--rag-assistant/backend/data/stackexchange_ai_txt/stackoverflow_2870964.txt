Stefano Taschini's "Interval Arithmetic: Python Implementation and Applications" presented at Scipy 2008 (see here ) can be precious, as it can show the range of numerical uncertainty of your computations (so you avoid decisions based on too-fragile input data or equations). Since Stefano works at Altis Investment Management AG in Zurich, I'm pretty certain he developed and uses his pyinterval package in a finance context, although of course it's just a general-purpose tool, perfectly usable in other fields as well.
