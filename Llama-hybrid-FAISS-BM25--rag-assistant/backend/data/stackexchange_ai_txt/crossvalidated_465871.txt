Not sure what the questionnaire is... is it many Likert scale questions? Do the agree/disagree scores signify a calculation or are they the actual responses? How does this relate to the ANOVA tag? 1) You're not missing anything â€“ there is no single right answer. It turns out you can encode the variable as ordinal or numeric depending on your use case. I'm not exactly sure what you want to do with "measuring cheating behavior." Make a visualization? Manually investigate the most similar instances? It shouldn't matter for those use cases. If you want to build supervised machine learning model predicting if a student is cheating, I'd first try the feature as numeric, but then also try the feature as categorical. 2) Sorry if my answers are off topic, but I think the normality/makeup of the variable depends on the use case. If you were building a linear supervised machine learning model like logistic regression, you would want to make sure numeric "interval" features are standardized first. If it was categorical, this should be less important.
