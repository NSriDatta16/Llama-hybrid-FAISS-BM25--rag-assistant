How can I get feedback/interaction from the .NET WebBrowser control?

I am building some kind of eBook reader in C# and have the following problem. Rendering HTML in the WebBrowser control just works fine. However, I want to be able to mark text samples with the mouse. This should be available via a button event or (even better) by click-and-drag directly onto the text. How can I get the feedback of the mouse events in the WebControl (and also the selected text)? Are there any examples around? In a further step I want toe be able to insert notes as well (maybe by HTML injection) I tried to get it to work with the WebControl, but had not a lot of success. Maybe some of you know a different approach (Gecko, Webkit?).
