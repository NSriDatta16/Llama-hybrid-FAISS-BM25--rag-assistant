Highlight TreeView item being dragged over

In my application, I have a TreeView that allows drag/drop. I have all the functionality working fine, however I am having difficulty highlighting a TreeViewItem when it is dragged over. Here is my style for my treeview item. The IsMouseOver trigger does not work while dragging, because dragging seems to block other mouse events. Can anyone help me trigger the same border changes on my treeview item while dragging?
