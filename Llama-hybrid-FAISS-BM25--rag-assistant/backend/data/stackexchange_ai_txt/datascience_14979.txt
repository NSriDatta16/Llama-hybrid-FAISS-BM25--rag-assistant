This is the first hit on google for "anomaly detection text" . It's a little old but it's likely a good starting point. It seems the author uses heuristic algorithms (several measures of distance) to define an anomaly. Another option may be to look at the moving average of a given token (word) in your corpora over time and see if its t-stat is greater than some threshold. There are probably many, many better ways to do it but that might work depending upon your goal.
