If you choose “Open with” your application is probably opened as running in the same folder as the file you want to open. That is, the execution path of your application is different from the path where the executable is found. Thus, your file attention.jpg is searched relative to that path, rather than the application path. To correct this, use: string appPath = Application.StartupPath; myImageList.Images.Add(Image.FromFile(Path.Combine(appPath, "attention.jpg"))); Another, perhaps better, alternative would be to use embedded resources via My.Resource instead of relying on separate resource files.
