Is it possible to use .htaccess to send six digit number URLs to a script but handle all other invalid URLs as 404s?

Is it possible to use .htaccess to process all six digit URLs by sending them to a script, but handle every other invalid URL as an error 404? For example: http://mywebsite.com/132483 would be sent to: http://mywebsite.com/scriptname.php?no=132483 but http://mywebsite.com/132483a or http://mywebsite.com/asdf would be handled as a 404 error. I presently have this working via a custom PHP 404 script but it's kind of kludgy. Seems to me that .htaccess might be a more elegant solution, but I haven't been able to figure out if it's even possible.
