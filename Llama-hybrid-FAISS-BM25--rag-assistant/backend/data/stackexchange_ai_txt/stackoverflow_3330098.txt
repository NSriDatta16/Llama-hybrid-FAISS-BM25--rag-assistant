You can target a later SDK version using android:targetSdkVersion while still permitting your app to be run on earlier versions (since apps are filtered out based on the android:minSdkVersion ). If you use API's that aren't supported, your app will force close. So, you'll have to pay attention to the API level annotations in the documentation for all functions, and test your app on an emulator set to use the minimum SDK version. However, the Android Developer's Blog has some good advice on how to write applications that support earlier SDK versions - at a cost of some added work, of course. Whether it's worth it depends on whom you want to reach, obviously.
