Yes but for certain behaviour you may have to use the JVM startup options to enable the toplink agent. I believe this is for the lazy loading or something similar. Do you mean TopLink or TopLink Essentials? The first is a commercial Oracle product. The latter is the reference implementation of JPA 1.0, which is a somewhat cut down version. Honestly I don't think there's any reason to use anything other than EclipseLink (which will be the JPA 2.0 reference implementation) or Hibernate. To actually do this: Hibernate for Java SE ; Eclipselink in J2SE RCP Applications ; and Using the Java Persistence API in Desktop Applications .
