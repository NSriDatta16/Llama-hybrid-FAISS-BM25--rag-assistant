HTTP POST Not Working (408 Error)

I am having some problems trying to get a post request to work from a payment provider (WorldPay) to my host server. Basically WorldPay does a callback to a script on my website if/when a transaction is successful. Problem is the post request isn’t getting to my script – we just get a 408 timeout. This is the request sent from WorldPay below: POST /index.php?route=payment/worldpay/callback HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Host: www.mysite.com Content-Length: 711 User-Agent: WJHRO/1.0 (WorldPay Java HTTP Request Object) authAmountString=%26%23163%3B3.49&_SP.charEnc=UTF-8&desc=testItem&authMode=A And this is the response sent back from my hosts server: HTTP/1.1 408 Request Timeout Connection: Close Pragma: no-cache cache-control: no-cache Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 I know this is a long shot but can anyone see anything wrong with anything above? To simplify things i replaced the php script with a basic html output which returned a hello world message and we still got a 408 so i’m pretty sure the script works. We have also had this error once or twice: failed CAUSED BY invalid HTTP status line: >null Any help is greatly appreciated Cheers Paul
