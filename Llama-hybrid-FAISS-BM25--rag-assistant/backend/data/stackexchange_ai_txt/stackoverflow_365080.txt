The basic answer is "you can't". After looking at this for a bit, I think it's possible, but extremely complicated. It would involve implementing a resourceLoadDelegate on your WebView that implements -webView:resource:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:fromDataSource: and modifies the request to turn off HTTPShouldHandleCookies and adds any relevant cookies to the request manually. It also has to implement -webView:resource:didReceiveResponse:fromDataSource: to find out about any cookies returned from the server. You can alloc/init your own copy of NSHTTPCookieStorage per-webview and use that to store/retrieve the cookies.
