CGI is what you want; it will let you embed any program you want into a website, it was made for that purpose. Then perhaps embedding a few more options with PHP and HTML will let the user acutally input data into the program via the web. It should not be too hard. Take a look here for more info: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/perl/cgi.html I think that is a good pointer in the right direction. I hope that helps.
