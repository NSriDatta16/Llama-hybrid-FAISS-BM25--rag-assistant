According to Wikipedia: The repeatability coefficient is a precision measure which represents the value below which the absolute difference between two repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%. If that is what you mean, then, given your data, I think you need to abandon that part of rptR and do something else. You may have to bootstrap or do a permutation test. If rptR is what you want, then the quantity you want to bootstrap is $$R=V_G/(V_G+V_R)$$ where $V_G$ is group level variance and $V_R$ is residual variance (see documentation for more details). Note that rptR relies on a parametric bootstrap, but here you probably need a nonparametric one. However, later in the same document, it notes that: Permutation can be used as a robust alternative or addition to LRT. In the simplest case this will work by randomizing the vector of group identities against the response vector followed by refitting the model to the randomized data and storage of the repeatability for each of many replications. This may work for your case.
