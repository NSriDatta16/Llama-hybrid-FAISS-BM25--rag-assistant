xsl: how to split strings?

I want to split an address on semicolons ( ; ) into rows separated by : e.g. if address = 123 Elm Street , I want to output 123 Elm Street , but if address = 123 Elm Street;PO Box 222 , I want to output 123 Elm Street PO Box 222 and if address = 123 Elm Street;PO Box 222;c/o James Jones , I want to output 123 Elm Street PO Box 222 c/o James Jones Is there a way to do this? (probably easy but I'm not that familiar with XSLT) The plain XSL selector is and I would like to modify this XSLT fragment to split on semicolon. update : Apparently the answer involves the use of and the functions substring-before() and substring-after() . But I'm a beginner to XSLT and I could really use some help for how to do this.
