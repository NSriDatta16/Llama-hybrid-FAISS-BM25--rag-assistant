Variability of casewise likelihoods forms a basis for calculating a SE or CI around (differences in) information criteria, but I think that is also not available in M plus . blavaan obtains them from the loo package, but blavaan does not yet handle MLSEM, although you could simply code up the model manually in Stan ( rstan package) to utilize the loo package. If the models are parametrically nested (i.e., the more restricted model is equivalent to the less restricted model by fixing one or more of its parameters), then you can conduct a Bayesian version of the Wald test from M plus version 8.4: http://www.statmodel.com/download/BayesFit.pdf Note that Wald (and score) tests are asymptotically equivalent to a LRT ( Buse, 1982 ), so hopefully this provides the information you are looking for.
