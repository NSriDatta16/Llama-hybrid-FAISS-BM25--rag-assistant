Should I use pandas get_dummies and create additional columns or use my own encoding code that keeps 1 column?

I am running the Kaggle Video Games sales dataset through an XGboost algo. I want to encode the categorical column of "Game Rating" from E, M, etc. to 0-5 when I use: data = pd.get_dummies(data=data, columns=['Game_Rating]) pandas adds a column to my dataframe for each unique observation in Game_Rating Rating_E Rating_E10+ Rating_EC Rating_K-A Rating_M Rating_RP Rating_T 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 My question is two-fold: Does Pandas have the ability to replace categorical values of a dataframe inline, preserving the original column structure if not: I have a (slower) method that does the encoding inline and preserves the column structure of the dataframe. I am trying to keep the dataframe as similiar to the original dataset as possible for future processing. What are the risks I may not be seeing of using my own (inline) encoding method?
