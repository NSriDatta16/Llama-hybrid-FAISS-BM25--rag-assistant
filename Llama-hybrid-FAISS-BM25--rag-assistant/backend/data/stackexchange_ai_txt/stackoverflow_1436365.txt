How expensive the simplest thread is depends on the OS (you may also need to tune some OS parameters to get past a certain number of threads). At minimum each has its own CPU state (registers/flags incl. floating point) and stack as well as any thread-specific heap storage. If each individual thread doesn't need too much distinct state, then you can probably get them pretty cheap by using a small stack size. In the limit, you may end up needing to use a non-OS cooperative threading mechanism, or even multiplex events yourself using tiny "execution context' objects. Just start with threads and worry about it later :)
