Subclasses have an IS-A relationship to superclasses. BetterPlayer IS-A Player. For your first question about 'upcasting' your wording is flawed. You can pass p2 into the method because it takes a Player, and BetterPlayer IS-A Player. For your second question, yes. For your third question, you are again correct. You can just define p2 as a BetterPlayer to start with though, and then you can use it anywhere you need a Player, and anywhere you need a BetterPlayer.
