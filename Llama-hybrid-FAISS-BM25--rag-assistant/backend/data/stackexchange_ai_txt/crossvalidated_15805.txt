Mean and variance of a normally distributed random number created from the average of a set of uniformly distributed random numbers

An old-fashioned way of generating normally distributed random numbers entailed setting each normally distributed random number equal to the average of a set of uniformly distributed random numbers, rescaled and shifted by a constant. Let x be a uniformly distributed random variable, i.e. p(x) = 0 if x How would I compute the mean and variance of the variable x?
