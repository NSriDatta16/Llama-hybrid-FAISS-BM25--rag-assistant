This looked like a fun challenge. Give the following XAML a try. It will automatically adjust the size of the columns as the content expands. The key is placing some canvas elements in a grid to allow the lines of the borders to flow into the adjacent cells. This could certainly be cleaned up with some styles and will be a little fragile if you need to tweak the sizes, but I think it demonstrates the approach: Click Testing 1 Testing 2 Testing 3 I hope it helps.
