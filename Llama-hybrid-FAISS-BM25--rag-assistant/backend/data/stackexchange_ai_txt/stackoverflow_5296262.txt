New project reusing existing project core, branch or new project?

My question is pretty similar to this one . I am working in company that has a client specific application. The current development team (around 10 persons) is actively working on it, and the core of the application is also often modified/updated. I am in charge of a a new project, this application will reuse the business logic of the existing one (client specific), and I'll probably need to reorganize, rename and generalize a lot of the existing code (types, file names, etc...). The team currently uses Subversion, for me it seems right to create a new project based on the core of the existing one, then modify it, since the aim of the two applications will be very different. The only matters concerns the fact I would like to benefit of the recent update/correction and improvement made in the existing project, but I don't see clearly how this could be done knowing I'll have either a new branch (with a lot of changes in file names, functions header and so on), or a new project. I am pretty new to subversion or revision control used in the context of "architecture" changes or evolution. Thank you in advance.
