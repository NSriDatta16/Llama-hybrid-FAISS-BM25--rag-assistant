The create_time and update_time fields of information_schema correspond to the creation/modification timestamps of the underlying storage for the table. With MyISAM, each table has its own file, so the create/modify timestamp of that file is returned. For InnoDB however, storage for all tables is inside a single file, ibdata, so there is only one create/modify timestamp. This one timestamp is returned for all InnoDB tables.
