Alternatives to Job Sequencing using Optimization

I have to N jobs to be assigned in a sequence to a Machine/User. I know using optimization technique we can find an optimal sequence. But in my case there are lot of parameters (some to be minimized (time) , some to be maximized (profit etc)). So I am wondering if there any alternative methods to rank the jobs. It would be great if anyone can suggest some Machine learning method so that there is no need to update the optimization equation as new variables come in. In case if someone is wondering what Job sequencing is: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kabanets/307/sched307.pdf
