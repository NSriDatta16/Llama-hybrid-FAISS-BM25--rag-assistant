You are absolutely right - the "distance" between word embeddings does not automatically imply they are automatically semantically similar! This is a common misconception. This is more a result of when you train towards an objective, certain words can be used in place of one another and as a result, they can have similar representations inside of a neural network (hence similar embeddings and therefore reduced distance between your embeddings). However, this definitely does not mean that words are necessarily similar in meaning despite having similar embeddings! However, models can be trained such that similar sentences/words have similar embeddings. This was the case of Universal Sentence Encoder where it was trained such that similar words and similar sentences had high cosine similarity relative to others. This method of training falls under a number of names: siamese neural networks/one-shot learning/metric learning. Similarly, what we call "similar" can fall under a number of different definitions - for example - "questions" can be "similar" to "answers" and so their embeddings can be trained to be near each other - same with text and images! Now in order to build a recommendation engine, you will want to attain an embedding of an item and another item that has been purchased and similarly index them so that their embedding space is a lot closer. Then when you index them, you can immediately fetch the closest neighbors of a particular item and return them as results. I would recommend trying out some of these applications yourself and experimenting with various models/data! These will help you explore some rather interesting results!
