Windows Phone 7: Using Pinch Gestures For Pinch and As A Secondary Drag Gesture

I am using the drag gesture to move elements on a canvas. I am using the pinch gesture to zoom/tranlate the size of the canvas. What I want to do now is move the entire canvas based on the movement of both fingers in a pinch. I know I can do this with the move, but I need that for items on the canvas itself, and sometimes the entire canvas is covered with items that would make it so you could not select the canvas to move it. Is this possible with the PinchGestureEventArgs?
