I'll begin with a question: how are calculating the false discovery rate (FDR)? In a standard Benjamini Hochberg adjustment, you assume independence between tests. Therefore, your assertion that they partially overlap would suggest that you should avoid using the standard Benjamini Hochberg adjustment. Instead you need to adjust without the assumption of independence between tests. To do this you would you use the general case of the FDR: $FDR \le \frac{{{m_0}}}{m}q\left( {1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + ... + \frac{1}{m}} \right) \approx \frac{{{m_0}}}{m}q\log \left( m \right)$ From there, there is now no need to take an average of p-values or of q-values. The whole idea of the multiple testing correction is that you do the correction and then rank your significant hits. I don't see why you would want to average them.
