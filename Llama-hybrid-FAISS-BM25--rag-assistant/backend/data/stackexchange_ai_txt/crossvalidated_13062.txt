It would appear to me that you have 16 observations every time period (T=1,T=2,,,,). Identify and build a parsimmonious Vector Arima Model (VARIMA) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_moving_average_model to characterize how the 16 endogenous series relate over time. VAR models may be inadequate as they assume that the equations are pure autoregressive rather than a parsimonious mixture of AR and MA structure.
