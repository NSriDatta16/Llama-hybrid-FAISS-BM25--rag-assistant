My method for solving this problem ?...Sure babe....Here ya go..served up on a silver platter. [1] Google search for say: Consider the problem of neatly printing a paragraph on a printer [2] Pick say ~10 sites that are not obvious chaff. [3] Have a quick look at the source code on the site...pick some code that is well structured and has plenty of comments. [4] Pop it into visual studio..write some quciky code that excises the algorithm. [5] Follow the flow of the code and compare it with the stated problem. [6] Check a few of the results by hand. If they fail goto step 3. [7] Run through the code until you understand how it works. And there you go..How learn just about anything in 7 pain free steps. Drinks all around... Can I get you another cocktail ? It's you lucky day... I'm in a good mood...So, here is a little pseudo code for you....from the first Google hit ...even has line numbers so you can ask questions about specific lines...glory days...grrrr. Lets assume that for all k s where 1 0 and p
