I like the quick-sort option but I'd make a few tweeks: Keep the "comparison" results in a DB and then average them. Get more than one comparison per view by giving the user 4-6 images and having them sort them. Select what images to display by running qsort and recording and trimming anything that you don't have enough data on. Then when you have enough items recorded, spit out a page. The other fun option would be to use the crowd to teach a neural-net.
