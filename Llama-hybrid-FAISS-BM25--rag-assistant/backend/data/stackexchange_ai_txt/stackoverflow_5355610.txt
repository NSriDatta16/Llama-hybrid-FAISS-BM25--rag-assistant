I suggest you put those mapping in a file called cpp.vim placed in your ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/ (or any equivalent based on OS) directory. Vim automatically loads it as long as you have filetype plugin on in your .vimrc . This saves you writing autocommands and keeps your configuration well organized.
