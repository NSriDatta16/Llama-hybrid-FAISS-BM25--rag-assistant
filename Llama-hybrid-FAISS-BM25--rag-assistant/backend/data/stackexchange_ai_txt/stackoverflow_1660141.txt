Measure code coverage for remote scripting tests

We have an application which is deployed on JBoss 5.1, JDK 1.6. We also have scripts written in PowerShell for testing. These scripts access the application using a web-service. I would like to check the code coverage of the scripts. Any ideas? Most of the tools I saw are checking a JUnit test coverage and I don't see how we can use them.
