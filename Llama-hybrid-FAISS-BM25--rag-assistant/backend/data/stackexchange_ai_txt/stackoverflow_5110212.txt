One thing you could do is to use the rel=canonical tag on the pages of the site you consider to be "the copy". Basically, in the head section of each page's HTML you can tell which page on the "original" site has the same content. So if (for instance) your sites are called www.yourmainsite.com and www.yoursecondsite.com, you should tag testpage.htm on yoursecondsite.com like this: See here for more details. Otherwise you can simply tell search engines not to index yoursecondsite.com in your robots.txt User-agent: * Disallow: / Warning : I'm not an SEO person. I did have to implement something similar, but take my advice with a grain of salt
