One main effect and one interaction in R using multiple regression, is that possible? And why am I getting two interaction terms in output?

I have two factors that are fully crossed, the levels of the factor are each coded 0 and 1. I am running a regression testing for one main effect and one interaction. The following is my logistic regression formula: m1=glmer(y~1+A+A:B+(1|Participants)+(1|Word),data=data, family = "binomial") I am wondering if this is acceptable (only testing for one main effect and an interaction), and also why I am getting two interaction terms in my output: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.18740 0.21600 -0.868 0.38561 A1 0.74546 0.28399 2.625 0.00867 ** A0:B1 0.01537 0.28244 0.054 0.95662 A1:B1 0.15884 0.28650 0.554 0.57929
