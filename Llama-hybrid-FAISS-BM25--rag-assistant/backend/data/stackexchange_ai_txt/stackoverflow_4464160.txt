Well, if you divide the length of the string by 6 you know how many periods to add. So... // -1 to account for i = 6 in the loop to start int numPeriods = ( str.Length / 6 ) - 1; // we increment the index by 7 to account for the period we added for( int index = 6, i = 0; i I'm sure there is a more elegant way, but I have to get back to work! Also, your written request and your example are not the same thing. You say What I want to do is after every 6th character in a string place a '.' But your example shows adding a period at index 6 for each line . Which is it?
