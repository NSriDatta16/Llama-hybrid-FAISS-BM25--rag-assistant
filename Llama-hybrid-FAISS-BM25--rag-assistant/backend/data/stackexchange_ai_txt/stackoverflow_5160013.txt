Efficient way of finding average difference between elements in array

Hope title isn't confusing. It's simple to show by example. I have a row vector like so: [1 5 6] . I want to find the average difference between each element. The differences in this example are 4 and 1 so the average is 2.5. This is a small example. My row vectors might be very large. I'm new to MatLab so is there some efficient way of using MATLAB's efficient matrix/array manipulation to do this nicely? There is a similar question on SOF already but this question is specifically for MATLAB! Thanks :) EDIT: As queried by @gnovice, I wanted the absolute difference.
