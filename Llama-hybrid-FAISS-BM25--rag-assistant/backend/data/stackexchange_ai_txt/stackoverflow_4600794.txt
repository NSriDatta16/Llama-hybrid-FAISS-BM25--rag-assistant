From your config you have quite a few instances of TinyMCE on your page. In each, you have a button that allows the end user to insert some predefined content (a "Comparative Figures Table") When you say you want to " set different html content for each editor on page load " I assume you mean you want to have each instance of TinyMCE load with the appropriate content (either some default or what you retrieved from your repository). If that's the case then, as @russjman stated, each of the ID's in the elements config item refers to a TextArea/DIV on the page. All you need to do is put the appropriate content in those elements. Importantly, remember to HTML encode it. For example This is the content from the first text area. ");?> This is the content from the second text area. Note This needed to be encoded using htmlentities in PHP ");?> The other way to read your question is that you want the ComparativeFiguresTableButton to do something different in each instance of the editor. In this case you will need a different config for each element, each with a different value in the ed.selection.setContent() method As @Thariama states, the best approach would be to create a simple plugin that adds a button and has a config parameter that is the content you want inserted when it's pressed. Finally, if all you want to do is insert HTML fragments, then it may be worth checking out the template plugin.
