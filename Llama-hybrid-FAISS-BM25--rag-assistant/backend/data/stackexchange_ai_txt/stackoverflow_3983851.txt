This is the responsibility of your file system . In very brief, a file system is a data structure which is laid out onto your entire disk -- that's what "formatting" a disk does -- and your files are saved into that data structure. There are lots of file systems, and their details vary quite widely. http://www.forensics.nl/filesystems has a whole bunch of papers on file system design and organization. I'd start with McKusick's A Fast File System for UNIX ; it's old, but it contains lots of ideas that are still influential today. You need a filesystem-specific forensics tool if you want to look at the data structures on your disks. Ubuntu's probably using something in the ext2 family, so try debugfs .
