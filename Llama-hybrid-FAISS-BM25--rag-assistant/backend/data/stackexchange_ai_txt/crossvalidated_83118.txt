Linear regression for time-series prediction

Say we have $N$ time series $X_t^i$ for $i=1...N$and we want to predict a separate time series $Y_t$. Let's consider the following model: $Y_t = \sum_{i} \beta_i X_{t-1}^i $ I am just trying to figure when such a model makes sense Does this model have a name? Is there an interpretation in terms of random processes? Are there any known applications? Does it make sense to solve the $\beta_i$ by using regression approaches (ridge, lasso, etc) using the training points $( , y_t)$?
