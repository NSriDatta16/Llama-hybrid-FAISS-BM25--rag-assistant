Not understanding event binding. JavaScript and jQuery work differently. By popular demand, an example: In jQuery: $("#someLink").click(function(){//do something}); Without jQuery: Link SomeClickFunction(item){ //do something } Basically the hooks required for JavaScript are no longer necessary. I.e. use inline markup (onClick, etc) because you can simply use the ID's and classes that a developer would normally leverage for CSS purposes.
