Garbage collection is not triggered by references going out of scope. Garbage collection is usually triggered when allocating storage for new objects - specifically when generation zero's budget is exhausted. I.e. there may be a significant delay between when objects are eligible for garbage collection and when they are actually collected. As others have already pointed out, the CLR doesn't use reference counting. Instead it employs a mark and sweep approach. A good source of information on all the details about how garbage collection works is Jeffrey Ricther's book CLR via C# . The book goes into great detail about how the heap is partitioned and how garbage collection works. Highly recommended if you're interested in .NET implementation details.
