What does this notation $p(s', r \mid s, a)$ mean in reinforcement learning?

I was reading a book on reinforcement learning, and came across the following notation: Possibly rather basic question, but I cant seem to google how to read this. Is it A) Probability of (s' and r) GIVEN (s and a) B) Probability of s' and (r GIVEN s) and a? I really could not find any guide on how to read this triple notation online. Thank you for your time!
