django chain select

django-smart-selects is an elegant solution that enables Django developers to have chained select inputs in their forms. But as reported by developers in its list of issues, it does not work well when used in formsets. The javascript it renders is tied to the id of the "chained field" right in the model definition. How do you think this can be made to work when used in formsets? I think the render method of the widget (please see the django-smart-selects code) needs to somehow be made aware of formsets (and ideally, form prefixes). But how?
