Outlook has the ability to create custom forms. You use the forms designer bultin to outlook, there is one built all versions of Outlook. You can launch a design session with the Tools | Forms | Design a Form command. Alternatively, open any Outlook item in Outlook 2003 or earlier and choose Tools | Forms | Design This Form. When you design a form you start based on on of the exiting form such a appointment, task etc.. The closest thing to a blank form is the post form. Forms can have VBScript code behind them to react to user actions -- validating data, synchronizing it with databases, creating new Outlook items, etc. To add code, once you're in form design mode, click the View Code command on the toolbar or ribbon. You can then publish you form into the Organization Forms library, so that everyone has access to them. They can also be published directly to a folder. Personal forms are published either to a folder or to your Personal Forms library. There is quite a lot of help documentation for this kind of thing in Outlook Help, also google will return loads of sites that show you how.
