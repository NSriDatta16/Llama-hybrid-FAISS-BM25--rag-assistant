It depends, do you want to develop for Symbian or Maemo (more recent but available on less devices) ? For Maemo, you could start with the SDK Virtual Image (to use in VirtualBox or VMWare): http://maemovmware.garage.maemo.org/2nd_edition/ There is also a Virtual PC version, but I'm not sure if the image is as recent: https://garage.maemo.org/projects/vpc-sdk Otherwise, you could also check out the Nokia Forums, you could start here: http://www.forum.nokia.com/Library/Tools_and_downloads/Other/Maemo/ Also, you should also get the QT Tools if you're doing cross-platform: http://www.forum.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Tools/
