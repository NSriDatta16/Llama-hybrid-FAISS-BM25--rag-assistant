The minimun: unit tests work integration tests work deploy on test stage ok manual short check on test stage Better: unit tests work checkstyle ok integration tests work metrics like jmeter and test coverage passed deploy on test stage ok some manual tests on test stage finally deploy on production stage All unit and integration tests work automatically, best on a continuous integration server like CruiseControl done by ant or maven . When developing webservices, testing with soapui works fine. If a database used, automatic upgrade is done (with liquibase for example) before deployment. When external services are used, addidional configuration tests are needed, to ensure URLs are ok (head request from application, database connect, wsdl get, ...). When developing webpps, a HTML validation on some pages will be usefull. A manual check of the layout (use browsershots for example) would be usefull. (All example links for Java development) And last (but not least): are all acceptance tests still passing? Is the product what the owner wants? Make a live review with him on the test system before going further!
