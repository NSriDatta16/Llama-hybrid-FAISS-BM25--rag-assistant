Why the seasonality of daily time series is not predicted correctly in R with arima model?

I have a question related to the estimation of arima models in R. I have estimated a model with daily simulated data where Mondays have a lower value than the rest of the days. I have simulated two years of data, and I want to predict the next year. According to the data, I should obtain an estimation which has lower values on Mondays, but I get it on Tuesdays... It seems the data has been desplaced one day. I show my code. library(ggplot2) library(forecast) library(lubridate) date datos begins on Monday 2018-01-01. Every Monday has a lower value. Now I estimate the model with the corresponding seasonal periods. orders_ts Now the lower values are on Tuesdays, in 2020-01-07, 2020-01-14, etc. Could someone give me an answer of why this is happening? And how could I solve this? Thank you very much!
