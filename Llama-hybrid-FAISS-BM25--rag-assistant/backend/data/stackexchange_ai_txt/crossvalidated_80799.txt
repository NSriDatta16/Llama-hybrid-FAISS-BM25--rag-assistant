If you should view your individual vectors as time series (because of the signs of autocorrelation you mentioned), you should be more interested in a cross-correlation function (ccf) of the two time series. This functions is essentially the product-moment correlation as a function of lag, or time-offset, between the series. This link contains the relevant details , including statistical significance of the ccf. The example considered is as follows: Consider the two time series of annual tree-ring index plotted in Figure 1. The plots suggest the series are positively correlated, but the year-to-year variations are too noisy to visually judge whether one series tends to lead or lag the other. Both series, however, appear to be positively autocorrelated, as positive departures from the mean tend to follow positive departures, and negative departures tend to follow negative departures. The link above makes a reference to the 6th edition of Chatfield's The Analysis of Time Series masterpiece (and the 5th edition will have that material in chapter 8 entitled Bivariate Processes) if you want to read more on this. In particular, if a test is required for a non-zero correlation between two time series, both series must first be converted to white noise (the book will tell you how) and then the usual theory applies.
