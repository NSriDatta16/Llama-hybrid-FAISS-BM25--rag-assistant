How to configure commons-logging for JUnit testing of Hibernate

I'm trying to debug some hibernate functionality in a spring app with a junit test and commons logging, but I can't seem to get anything other than the default INFO messages to appear. I'm also running these junit tests from Eclipse. I've had no luck from the spring forums either. I'm particularly interested in the debug logging output by Hibernate (to try and figure out why it takes 23 seconds to run this test). Current output shows the default setting of INFO: Mar 29, 2011 4:44:35 PM org.springframework.test.AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests onSetUp INFO: Began transaction: transaction manager [org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager@5f873eb2]; defaultRollback true testGetSubjectsForSite time: [00:00:00:068] Mar 29, 2011 4:44:58 PM org.springframework.test.AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests endTransaction INFO: Rolled back transaction after test execution I've tried to add a commons-logging.properties file to the classpath (the same location as the hibernate.properties and test-components.xml) but still only the default INFO messages appear. Here's the commons-logging.properties file: org.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger # handlers handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler # default log level .level=FINE org.springframework.level=FINE org.hibernate.level=FINE # level for the console logger java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINE java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter Is anyone able to shed any light on why I can't get the DEBUG messages to print out? Is there a logging setting I'm missing? Edit: I've tried FINEST and DEBUG to no avail.
