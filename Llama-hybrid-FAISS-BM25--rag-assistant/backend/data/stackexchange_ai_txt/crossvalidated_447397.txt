Whether the arithmetic mean is a good measure for a strongly skewed distribution depends on what you are using it for -- what does "good" mean? One variable that is usually very right skew is income and, usually, you see median income rather than mean income. But why? Because, usually, when we look at some measure of central tendency, we are looking for something like a "typical" value. So if we wanted to compare incomes in different countries, it would be natural to compare medians (or maybe other quantiles) rather than arithmetic means, because it is closer to what we are interested in. On the other hand, if we were interested in the total capital available in different countries, the arithmetic mean would be better. Sometimes, though, the arithmetic mean makes very little sense. If we are trying to average numbers on different scales then the arithmetic mean is still BLUE, but it's a BLUE of a number that isn't useful. For instance, suppose you are averaging students' SAT scores (0 to 1600) and their high school grades (0 to 4). Then you won't want the arithmetic mean. Here you want the geometric mean. Or, if you are averaging rates that have different denominators, the arithmetic mean will again be BLUE, but of a number that isn't useful. For instance, if you make a trip of 300 km at 100 kph and return at 150 kph, then the arithmetic mean is 125 kph, but this is not very useful because you took 5 hours to go 600 km, which is 120 kph. Here you probably want the harmonic mean. For more details on this, see my blog post the geometric and harmonic means .
