Hiding/Showing a swf in a div?

I have a flex app that I want to hide in a div until the user clicks a link or element of some type. I've noticed that embedding the swf in a div with style display:none does not actually hide the swf, so how would I go about accomplishing this? The goal is to have the flex app loading in the background while the user does other things. Thanks.
