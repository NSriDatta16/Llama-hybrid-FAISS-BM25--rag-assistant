Getting bad results when testing my prediction model on new patients

I analyze medical diagnostic labeled data: the independent variables are medical parameters (assume that one of the variables is blood pressure) and the dependent variable is 1 or 0. The data contains just 4 features. the medical diagnostic duration is a few hours so each patient has dozens of records. my data contains less than 10 patients. When I split my current patients data to 20/80 test training/test data I get great results (I'm checking recall and precision metrics). But when I'm checking the model on a new patient that the model doesn't know the metrics results are very bad. I have tried many classifications models: logistic regression(checked both L1 and L2), random forest, GBM, SVM, and AdaBoost. In addition, the data is unbalanced and I also tried SMOOTH. I assume that my model is overfitting. What can I do to solve this?
