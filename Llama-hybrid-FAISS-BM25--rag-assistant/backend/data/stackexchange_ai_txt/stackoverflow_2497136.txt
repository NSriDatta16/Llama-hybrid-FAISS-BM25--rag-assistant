This is called "sequence association". In this case, what appears to be a scaler, an element of an array (actual argument in caller) is associated with an array (implicitly the first element), the dummy argument in the subroutine . Thereafter the elements of the arrays are associated by storage order, known as "sequence". This was done in Fortran 77 and earlier for various reasons, here apparently for a workspace array -- perhaps the programmer was doing their own memory management. This is retained in Fortran >=90 for backwards compatibility, but IMO, doesn't belong in new code.
