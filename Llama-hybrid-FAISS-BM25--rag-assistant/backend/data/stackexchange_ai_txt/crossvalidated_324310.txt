Residual autocorrelation in VAR with non stationary data

I am running VAR model with non-stationary time series. I am going to have a look only at impulse response functions, so I've read that I can use VAR for non-stationary time series. My model includes 4 variables. According to all ICs (AIC, HQ, SC), the lag order must be 2. But in VAR(2) model there is an autocorrelation in residuals of one variable. Is it a big problem? Can I continue my analysis with this problem? Thanks in advance.
