Number of trees is not a parameter that should be tuned, but just set large enough usually. There is no risk of overfitting in random forest with growing number of trees, as they are trained independently from each other. See our paper for more information about this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05654 Max depth is a parameter that most of the times should be set as high as possible, but possibly better performance can be achieved by setting it lower. There are more parameters in random forest that can be tuned, see here for a discussion: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03515.pdf If you have more than one parameter you can also try out random search and not grid search, see here good arguments for random search: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf If you just want to tune this two parameters, I would set ntree to 1000 and try out different values of max_depth. You can evaluate your predictions by using the out-of-bag observations, that is much faster than cross-validation. ;)
