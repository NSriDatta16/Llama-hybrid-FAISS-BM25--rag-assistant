First, to declare a paragraph tag, you wouldn't put a period before it. It should be: p {padding:2px;} Secondly, CSS is a cascading style sheet, therefore you can open an element declaration however many times you want. The style properties within it will take the last stated object. IE: p {padding:2px; border:1px solid #000;} and then later p {padding:5px;} Padding is now 5 px but it retains it's 1px border.
