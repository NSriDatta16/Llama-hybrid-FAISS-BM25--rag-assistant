Ultimately, search engine algorithms are designed to reward good usability (although obviously in practice that is not always the case). As a user, it would semantically make more sense to have the pizzeria name in the url, and you have the added advantage of it being easier to remember. Whilst kbrimington's comment is correct that page content it probably more important, SEOMoz, a search engine algorithm authority, puts keyword in the url at somewhere between the 9th and 11th most important ranking factor depending on where it appears in the url http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#ranking-factors At number 5 in the ranking factors, however, is anchor text; it's only an opinion, but I'm inclined to say that having the word "pizzeria" in the url is more likely to encourage people to put "pizzeria" in the anchor text when they link to your site.
