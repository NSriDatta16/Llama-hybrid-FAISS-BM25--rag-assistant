In IB when you select the Button Attributes of your UIButton choose "Highlighted State Configuration" (instead of "Default State Configuration") and select an image for the Background. Or in code: [myButton setBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"imagename"] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted]; So you rather set an image, than set a color. You might want to look into code examples of creating your custom UIButton ([ UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom] ), using UIImage's stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: instance method.
