If the HTML inside the element is considered to be a string literal, it has to be wrapped into a CDATA section as was already hinted in the comments $xml = ]]> XML; libxml_use_internal_errors(TRUE); $cell = simplexml_load_string($xml); echo $cell->Comment->Data; If it's not in a CDATA section, it will be considered nodes. Then you'd be looking for the innerXml of the to get that as raw XML. Unfortunately, neither SimpleXml, nor DOM have a native way to fetch that directly. You'd have to use a userland implementation. Userland implementations of innerXml usually either iterate over all the child nodes and concatenate their raw XML. Or they dump the entire tree and string replace the root node. Or they create a fragment or import the nodes into another document. I am not aware of any other way to do that. Not sure if this would be possible with XSLT . XMLReader has a readInnerXML method though.
