Randomforest on Bag of words TFIDF/ LSI for Video Recommendation

I'm working on the Ted Dataset which has the Name, Description and Transcript of 1000 TED Talks. My task is to recommend 3 TED Talks to a given video. What I'm doing now is converting the Text to Bag of Words. Applying feature extraction (TFIDF, LSI, LDA, ESA) to reduce dimensions. Taking cosine similarity and then returning the 3 nearest neighbours to that point. I want to know if I can use Random Forest method for this. Can Random forest classifier perform better than KNN?
