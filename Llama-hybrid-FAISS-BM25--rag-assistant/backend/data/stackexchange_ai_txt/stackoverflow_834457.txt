OK, complete re-edit to acknowledge the new "spec" :) I'm pretty sure you can't do that with one regex. The best tool definitely is an HTML parser. The closest I can get with regexes is a two-step approach. First, isolate each paragraph's contents with: (.*?) You need to set RegexOptions.Singleline if paragraphs can span multiple lines. Then, in a next step, iterate over your matches and apply the following regex once on each match's Group[1].Value : ((?:(\S+\s+){1,6})\w+) That will match the first seven items separated by spaces/tabs/newlines, ignoring any trailing punctuation or non-word characters. BUT it will treat a tag separated by spaces as one of those items, i. e. in One, two three four five six seven it will only match up until six . I guess that regex-wise, there's no way around that.
