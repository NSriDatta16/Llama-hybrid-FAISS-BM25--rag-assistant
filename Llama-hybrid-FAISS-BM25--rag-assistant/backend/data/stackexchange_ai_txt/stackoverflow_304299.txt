Does my page have to have the HTML5 doctype to access sessionStorage

Our dev shop continues to support IE6 etc. I'm wanting to use session storage to make an app-cache but wondering how much work it would be... Is it possible to use an HTML4 doc type in an HTML5-compatible browser and still access the sessionStorage, or do I have to browser sniff and return different pages (perhaps just with doctype alteration) to get it to work?
