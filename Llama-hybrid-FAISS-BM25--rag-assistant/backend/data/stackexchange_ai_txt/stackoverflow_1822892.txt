Another option, if the working set actually in the map is small enough would be to use an incrementing key, then re-generate the keys when the counter is about to wrap. This solution would only require temporary extra storage. The hash table performance would be unchanged, and the key generation would just be an if and an increment. The number of items in the current working set would really determine if this approach is viable or not.
