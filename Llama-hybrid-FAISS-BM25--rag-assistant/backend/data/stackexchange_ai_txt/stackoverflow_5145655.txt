I'm pretty sure you cannot actually format these devices. Or any modern storage device. Every device nowadays comes pre-formatted and cannot be reformatted (except possibly by vendor-specific software or firmware). You haven't said why you want to achieve it. My guess is that if you try hard enough you'll "brick" the device. You can write in a specific "logical position" easily enough through the standard block interface but in practice, on any modern drive (i.e. those manufactured in the last 15 years) that has no fixed relationship with a physical position. This is even more true on SDDs than it is on discs.
