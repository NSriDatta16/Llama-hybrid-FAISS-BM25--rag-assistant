If you want to prove that your model only needs 10% of the data for training, then there are multiple options. 1. fix a validation set of whatever size. from the rest of the data choose a random 10% and measure performance on validation set. repeat this step a few times (which performance metric to use is also important here for example whether you can calculate a p-value and FDR) compare average performance of that vs when you choose a random 20% (or other size) of non-validation data same thing as one except at every iteration choose a random validation set (always the same size) Basically - to compare performance of the model on different training set sizes, you should keep the validation set the same size
