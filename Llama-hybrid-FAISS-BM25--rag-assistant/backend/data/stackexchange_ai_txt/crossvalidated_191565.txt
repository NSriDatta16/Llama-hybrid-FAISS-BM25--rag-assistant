If I understand correctly, you have a collection of $Y_t:t=1,2,...T$. Moreover, your model for $Y_t$ specifies that it is conditional on $Y_{t-1}$. What you can do is a recursive scheme that is quite common in dynamic time series analysis. You essentially condition observation for observation as follows: $f(Y_t|\alpha, \beta, \mu, \sigma; \{Y_k\}_{k=1}^{t-1}) = f(Y_t|\alpha, \beta, \mu, \sigma; Y_{t-1})\cdot f(Y_{t-1}|\alpha, \beta, \mu, \sigma; \{Y_k\}_{k=1}^{t-2}) = \dots = \Pi_{t=2}^T f(Y_t|\alpha, \beta, \mu, \sigma; Y_{t-1}):= F(Y)$ The recursion happens at $\dots$, where we extend the conditioning principle to the next $T-1$ observations. Notice that the final product runs from $2$ to $T$, because we have to take $Y_1$ as given (aka, as 'initial condition') for this approach to work. It will appear in the conditional pdf of $Y_2$, but its pdf will not be part of the expression to be maximized. Once F(Y) is obtained, you can apply standard MLE techniques to it.
