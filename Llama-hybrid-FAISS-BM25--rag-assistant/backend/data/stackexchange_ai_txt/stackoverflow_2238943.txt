Firstly this is just a warning and should not cause you undue alarm when working with reflection and types that are unknown at compile time . The virtue of generics is stronger compile time type checking and all that goes out the window once you call Class.forName(className) . However if you are like most people (including me) then you probably want to get rid of the warning so that it does not continue to draw you attention unnecessarily. To do that you can parameterize the constructor variable cons : Class myClassType = Class.forName(className); Class [] types = new Class[] { File.class }; Constructor cons = myClassType.getConstructor(types);
