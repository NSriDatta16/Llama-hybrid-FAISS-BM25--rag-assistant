I have a book (Books) I would like to store in SQLite

I have a few million pages that I would like to store in sqlite. The books are broken down into the following format. Bookseries BOOKName BOOKChapter BookParagraph BookLine BookNote BookComment. The bookline will contain all the raw data that I will need to store. Some lines are more then 255 characters long. What I would like to know is how to store this data, Do I store it as a BLOB ? or TEXT? The program stores Bible verses in 5 languages, hebrew russion arabic english and french. SO I store this information as unicode and not ANSI
