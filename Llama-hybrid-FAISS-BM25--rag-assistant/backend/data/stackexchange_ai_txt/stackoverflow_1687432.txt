WPF GUI Manage using Thread.CurrentPrincipal

Hi I found this questions How to manipulate WPF GUI based on user roles and apply his answer to my project. I'm implementing the same behavior. but the thing is the property binding doesn't work. I create the RoleToVisibilityConverter class and make some test, calling the convert RoleToVisibilityConverter conv = new RoleToVisibilityConverter(); conv.Convert((object)Thread.CurrentPrincipal,cbo_organismo.GetType(),(object)"editor",System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture); this work find, then i add the resources to my usercontrol and make the binding to my button control after running my application, the button is still visible. if i'm hardcoding the Visibility property the button is hidden btn_Eliminar.Visibility=(Visibility)conv.Convert((object)Thread.CurrentPrincipal,cbo_organismo.GetType(),(object)"editor",System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture) Any suggestion? Note: I'cant use the last approach because in my real scenario the button is part of a DataTemplate for a ListView, and even if a capture the button using the TreeHelper the ListView only apply the change to the first items due to virtualization
