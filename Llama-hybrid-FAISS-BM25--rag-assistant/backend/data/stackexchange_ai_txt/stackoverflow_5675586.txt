I like the problem description! Deterministic approaches probably won't work, as there is some randomness involved. Also you might have to revisit some locations as new pathes may open due to object movement. Therefore enhancing random movement is a good start. For example you could assign timestamps to each visited cell and make it more likely to visit unvisited/older cells. That is similar to the pheromones in Ant Colony Optimization http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization only with a single ant. Another approach might be to select random target cells (far away) and trying to get there. You will probably encounter objects along the way. Use naive pathfinding around those objects and if that doesn't work, just pick another target. Update : An abstract but powerful way to create a somewhat clever AI is to first think about rigid facts/properties/annotations that you can assign to your model (like visited locations, timestamps, a priori knowledge, etc.). Then create a set of simple actions that the AI can use. You might also want to create more complex actions on top of them. Afterwards it all comes down to having the AI-controlled agents choose an appropriate action given the current facts in a non-deterministic way. That is: Assign scores to those possible actions and do a roulette wheel selection http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection or something similar to determine the next action.
