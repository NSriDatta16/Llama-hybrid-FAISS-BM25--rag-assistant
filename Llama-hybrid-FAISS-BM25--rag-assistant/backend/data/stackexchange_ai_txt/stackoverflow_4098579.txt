How to use the GWT editor framework for validation?

I am trying to integrate with the new GWT Editor framework of GWT 2.1.0. I also want to add my validation checks into the framework. However, I am struggling to find a decent example how to do this. For the moment I have the following code: And for my editor: public class GarageEditor extends Composite implements Editor { @UiField ValueBoxEditorDecorator personalReference; interface GarageEditorUiBinder extends UiBinder { } private static GarageEditorUiBinder uiBinder = GWT.create(GarageEditorUiBinder.class); public GarageEditor() { initWidget(uiBinder.createAndBindUi(this)); } } On what point do I have to call my validator and how do I integrate with it? Update: I am actually looking for a way to retrieve a map with as key the property path, and as value the editor. There is a path field on a delegate, but this is not the path within the edited object, but the path in the editor class. Does anybody know if it is possible to do something like this?
