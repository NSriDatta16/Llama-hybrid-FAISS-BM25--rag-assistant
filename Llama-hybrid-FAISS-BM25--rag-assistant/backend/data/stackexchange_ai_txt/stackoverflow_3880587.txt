Checking to see if object is out of canvas (Raphael.js)

currently I am using Raphael.js to drag and drop a circle around a canvas. However, I would like to disallow the user to drag the circle out of the canvas. My code is generally as follows: window.onload = function() { //create canvas matching the image's dimensions var paper = new Raphael(document.getElementById('canvas_container'), , ); //put the schematic image onto the canvas paper.image(" ",0,0, , ); //create the marker on the canvas var c = paper.circle( , , 5).attr({ fill: "#800517", stroke: "none" }); var start = function () { // storing original coordinates this.ox = this.attr("cx"); this.oy = this.attr("cy"); }, move = function (dx, dy) { // move will be called with dx and dy if (this.ox + dx >= || this.oy + dy >= ){ this.attr({cx: , cy: }); }else{ this.attr({cx: this.ox + dx, cy: this.oy + dy}); } }, up = function () { // restoring state }; c.drag(move, start, up); } I was wondering if there was anyone out there who has tried to do something like this and managed to get it right.
