Is it worth to use prototype or should we use OOP for javascript?

I am a developer for sometime now, and for the past few years I am using prototype framework and it's implementation for OOP, to be used in Javascript. I've used jquery and some other frameworks as well. I 've been studying how js works and how differs from OOP, as it is a prototype oriented language. In my opinion is in fact a great concept, the prototype oriented language. Given the right attention to: - it was how the language was meant to be used, and so therefore is faster, more productive and theoretically, simpler and smoother. - Every browser has its own implementation for how javascript is supposed to work, making sometimes impossible for having a concise code work in all browsers, or at least the majority. - Usually those OOP frameworks (dojo.declare(), Js.Class, MooTools, etc) are more than suitable to make a nice work, and they are cross-browsers. I can't help but wonder, is it worth to start making RIA's using javascript prototype oriented? Or Should I go for Dojo.declare() , js.class or some similar?
