Why is prewhitening important?

I am writing code, geophysical time series processing. First step is to prewhiten values in time domain. Why is this step important? For example, I have found this on sas.com If, as is usually the case, an input series is autocorrelated, the direct cross-correlation function between the input and response series gives a misleading indication of the relation between the input and response series. I do not understand, in my case all values are E field measurements over time. What means that input series is autocorrelated? How will it influence Fourier transform on the next step?
