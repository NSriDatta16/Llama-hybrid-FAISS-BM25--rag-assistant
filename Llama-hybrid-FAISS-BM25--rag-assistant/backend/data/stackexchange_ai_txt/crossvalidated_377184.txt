Why aren't you using conditional logistic regression? You've gone through the effort of matching, so drop the covariates from the analysis and estimate effects in the matched sets. If you fit the analysis with logistic regression then the matching doesn't count for anything and you can interpret all the coefficients the same as you would in an unmatched analysis. So yes, exp(beta_1) is the odds ratio for weight, and yes if the other matching variables are also included as covariates you can say it's been "adjusted for".
