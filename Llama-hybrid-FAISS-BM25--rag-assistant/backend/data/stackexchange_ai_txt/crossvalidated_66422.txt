Peter O'Brien has shown that logistic regression has several advantages over Hotelling's $T^2$. You reverse the problem and predict group membership using as predictors the series of multivariate responses. This does not require the multivariate normality assumption required of $T^2$, and allows mixtures of continuous and categorical responses. If there is not just a difference in means but a difference in variance for a response across the groups, you include a square term in the logistic model for that response. I suppose that if skewness differs you could include a cube term. @ARTICLE{obr88com, author = {{O'Brien}, Peter C.}, year = 1988, title = {Comparing two samples: {Extensions} of the $t$, rank-sum, and log-rank test}, journal = JASA, volume = 83, pages = {52-61}, annote = {see Hauck WW, Hyslop T, Anderson S (2000) Stat in Med 19:887-899} }
