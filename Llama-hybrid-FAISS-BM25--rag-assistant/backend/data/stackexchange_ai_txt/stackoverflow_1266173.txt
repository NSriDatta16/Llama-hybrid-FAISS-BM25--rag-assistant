Its not an anon type, below, I have the generated property for "PrinterTrays", in my case I have 1:M relationship between Printer and PrinterTray [Association(Name="Printer_PrinterTray", Storage="_PrinterTrays", ThisKey="PrinterID", OtherKey="PrinterID")] public EntitySet PrinterTrays { get { return this._PrinterTrays; } set { this._PrinterTrays.Assign(value); } } I'm assuming you're talking about joins that have proper pk / fk / constraints on them. Really tho, with the power of linq and delayed execution, you can do some really awesome stuff by piping your data into your own data types or anon types to be serialized for say json. you need to watch these videos on linq to sql and these videos on linqpad
