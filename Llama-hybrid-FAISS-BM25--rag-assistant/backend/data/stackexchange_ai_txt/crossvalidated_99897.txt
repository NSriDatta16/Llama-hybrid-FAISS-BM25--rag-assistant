I think this is a great question, and not an easy one to answer. I conceptualize that machine learning encompasses a lot of multivariate statistics, because many of the common techniques in multivariate analysis (ordination and clustering, for instance) use unsupervised learning algorithms. With people like me who aren't that concerned about the computer side of things, a lot of this stuff appears to be "under the hood", and I usually am focused more on how ordination relates as an extension of regression. But it cannot be ignored that the computer is doing some pretty advanced searching for patterns that I am not responsible for. Then there are supervised learning techniques in machine learning outside the realm of regular multivariate analysis. For instance, if you want to predict what categories some new object would go into based upon some of its variable's values, then you can train the algorithm to a bunch of objects that you know the classification of and then set the algorithm on classifying the new object. This is clearly not a multivariate statistics technique, and I tend to think of this when I think ofmachine learning because it involves that process of communicating the success or failure of a search to the system. Then this is where machine learning starts to overlap with AI, and things quickly get completely out of my depth... In the end, I do agree with the second answer on this thread that machine learning emphasizes prediction, whereas statisics in general is concerned with inference - but again, this is broad strokes stuff and not always going to be true.
