I think most more experienced C++ programmers would agree that this is poor idea. If anything, std::string already has way too many member functions, and adding still more will make a bad situation worse. Worse still, if you were going to do this, you'd probably do it by inheritance -- but std::string isn't designed to be used as a base class, and using it as one will lead to code that's fragile and error-prone. For another idea of how to do this, you might want to read Guru of the Week #29 . Do read the whole article though, to get an idea of both how to do it, and why you probably don't want to. Ultimately, what you have right now is probably the best option -- keep the case insensitive searching separate from std::string itself.
