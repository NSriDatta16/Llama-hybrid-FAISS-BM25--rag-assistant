If you publish an image on the web there's no foolproof way to prevent somebody from saving a copy. It has to be sent over the wire to be displayed, and a determined user can intercept it with tools like Wireshark or Fiddler or any browser debugging framework such as Firebug, even if you find a way to disable right-click and drag-drop to the desktop. You can make is very slightly more difficult, but the effort isn't worth it, IMHO.
