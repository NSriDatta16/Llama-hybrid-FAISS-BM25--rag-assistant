Learning a model which can fit the training data accurately

I am using weka for creating a model on a training set for a classification task. I am trying different classifiers for this. But when I try to give one of the data points which are present in the training set, it misclassifies it. Partly the reason might be that when we are creating a model, we are trying to learn a mixture of distributions in order to classify a future data point. Is there a way to accurately fit the training data ? I doubt that this might defeat the whole purpose of machine learning but I would like to know if there exists any ?
