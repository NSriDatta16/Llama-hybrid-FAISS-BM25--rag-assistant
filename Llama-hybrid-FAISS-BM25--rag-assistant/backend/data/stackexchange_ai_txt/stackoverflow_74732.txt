I was just talking with a guy who is an expert in microfilm. While it is an old technology, for long term storage it is one of the most enduring forms of data storage if properly maintained. It doesn't require sophisticated equipment (magifying lens and a light) to read altough storing it may take some work. Then again, as was previously mentioned, if you are only talking in the spans of a few years instead of decades printing it off to paper and storing it in a controlled environment is probable the best way. If you want to get really creative you could laminate every sheet!
