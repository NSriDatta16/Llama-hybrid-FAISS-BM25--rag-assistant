Stacking or Voting - Multiple feature sets extracted with different parameters

I am extracting features from time series data using different parameters and then creating a SINGLE feature based data set with all features to perform classification. If I wanted to create separate feature sets corresponding to different parameters and train classification models for each smaller feature set, how should the separate classification models be combined to provide a combined model? Is voting a better approach or is there some variant of Stacking for this kind of problem? I am aware that in general the data is the same and the classification models are different in Stacking or Voting, but in the above setting should this approach be applied or a combined feature set is a better option. Currently, I am using Random forests or Extra Trees as classifiers. Thanks.
