This isn't heteroscedasticity you are looking at, but truncation . You can see this very clearly in the first plot: No combination of the fitted + residual exceeds a certain number, causing this sudden imaginary diagonal line, past which no observations exist. In the scale-location plot, this strange shape reveals that the data are truncated at $1$ . It is easy to simulate some truncated data and show that the diagnostic plots indeed display this diagonal cutoff, as well as the strange V-shape in the scale-location plot: set.seed(1234) n The real question isn't what to conclude from these diagnostic plots, but rather what these data are . If you include a reference to the paper you read, we could see why the data are bounded, and whether that renders their conclusions invalid or not. Edit: In the comments you explained these are ratios. That gives you the actual answer to whether their approach is flawed (it probably is). Rather than an ordinary linear model, the authors should probably have used e.g. logistic regression using the original values that made up these ratios.
