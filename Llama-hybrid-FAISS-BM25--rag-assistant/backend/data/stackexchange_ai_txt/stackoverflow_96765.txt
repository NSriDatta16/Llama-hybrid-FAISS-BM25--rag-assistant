One of the goals for Maven't Project Object Model (POM) is to capture all information needed to reliably reproduce an artifact, thus passing settings impacting the artifact creation is strongly discouraged. To achieve your goal, you can check in your user-level settings.xml file with each project and use the -s (or --settings) option to pass it to the build.
