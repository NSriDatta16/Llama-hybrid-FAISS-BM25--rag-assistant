It is going to depend on how free is implemented. For some interesting reading, take a look at Doug Lea's allocator , which tries to be efficient at managing memory requests that can span a wide range of sizes. His primary concern is that the malloc and free calls be fast, and correct. But he does mention the issue of returning memory to the OS, and discusses what hinders it (memory fragmentation) and what aids it (use of mmap , or in a less flexible manner, sbrk ). Once you've read this article, you'll have a clearer idea of the trade-offs which lead to infrequent return of memory to the OS.
