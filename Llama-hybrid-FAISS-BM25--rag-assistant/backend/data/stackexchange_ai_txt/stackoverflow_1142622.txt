BizTalk 2000/2002 is completely different to BizTalk 2004 (onwards). The base architecture and concepts are completely different. Even though Microsoft provided some tools intitially to migrate 2000/2002 projects to 2004 I don't think they are effective. You might loose end up lot of time in the conversion, I would rather suggest you to take this opportunity to rearchitecture the solution (I know its not feasible in lot of cases). But if your organisation is thinking about migration, rearchitecture will be better approach.
