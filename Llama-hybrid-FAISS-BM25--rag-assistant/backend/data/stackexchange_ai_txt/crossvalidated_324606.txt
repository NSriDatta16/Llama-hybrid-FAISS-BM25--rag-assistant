Selecting predictors for prediction model (before the model building process) building with small sample sizes

I want to build a clinical prediction model and only can collect data from a small number of patients (let's say 500). Is it better to build a model by including only putative predictors in the model instead of everything that is available as often done in the machine learning community? I would think that using only 10 or 20 known/assumed predictors will produce a more robust model than including e.g. 1000s of gene data with no prior knowledge of its usefulness for this model. Is there any reference available?
