One option is to model the residual variance as a function of various predictors in your regression model, including time-varying and time-invariant predictors. Examples of this approach and its implementation in nlme can be found here and also here . A similar approach can be utilized in Bayesian setups as well, e.g., this article by Leckie et al. The residual variance is modeled as a log-linear function of the time-varying and time-invariant predictors. In a frequentist mixed effects modeling paradigm, the residual variance ( $\sigma^2$ ) is estimated from the model, but in this approach, its log is modeled directly as a function of predictors: log( $\sigma^2$ ) = $\alpha_{0j}$ + $\alpha_{1j}X_{ij}$ . As noted in the Leckie et al paper, if $\alpha_{0j}$ + $\alpha_{1j}X_{ij}$ are both equal to 0, the residual variance is constant across occasions (level 1 units in multilevel modeling parlance), which is the typical assumption of linear regression models.
