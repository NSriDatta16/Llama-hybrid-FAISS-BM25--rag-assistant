How do I organize my project files and directories to be put to svn and back?

Possible Duplicate: How would you organize a Subversion repository for in house software projects Hi, This is the svn question regarding the big projects and many directories in it. I'm new to svn but I googled for one simple answer and didn't find it: How do I organize my project files and directories to be put to svn and back? Or there is other solution to my question? My project consists of these: php, java, action script and MySQL. As you can see these are totally separate entities. Reorganizing it into one directory during devlopment, in order to put it to svn, seems to make a mess in my project. Are there any best practices on how to manage this? Notice! English is not my native language. Chris
