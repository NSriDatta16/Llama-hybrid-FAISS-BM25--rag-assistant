Can we test Variational Autoencoders with deterministic $z=0$?

Let's say we want to compare a vanilla Autoencoder to a Variational Autoencoder. The first one gives a deterministic output which basically represents the output with the highest likelihood. When we compare the two approaches, is it legitimate to force the output Variational Autoencoder to the one with maximum likelihood, i.e. at $z=0$ ? Are there any references in literature that do this?
