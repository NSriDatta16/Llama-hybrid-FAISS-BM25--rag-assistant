Distinguishing Bad Leverage Points from Vertical Outliers

Going through Regression class notes (written mostly following Kutner`s book, I believe), there was a brief display of how, in some cases, robust residual plots (such as standardized LTS residuals), do a better job pinpointing outliers. However, as a drawback, it claims that this kind of residual plot can`t distinguish bad leverage points from vertical outliers . By what this image shows, I can`t figure out why this distinction is relevant, considering both types of points seem bad enough for your regular Least Squares model.
