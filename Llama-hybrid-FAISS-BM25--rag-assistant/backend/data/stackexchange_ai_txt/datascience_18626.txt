What is the best hardware/GPU for deep learning?

What is the best GPU for deep learning currently available on the market? I've heard that Titan X Pascal from NVidia might be the most powerful GPU available at the moment, but would be interesting to learn about other options. And additionally - what might be considered a good machine for data-intensive computing, in terms of processor parameters, RAM etc. ?
