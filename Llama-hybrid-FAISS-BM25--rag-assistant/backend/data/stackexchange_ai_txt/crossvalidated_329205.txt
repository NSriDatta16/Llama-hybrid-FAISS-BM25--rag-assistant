About specifying independent priors for each parameter in bayesian modeling

I am reading Statistical Rethinking (Section 4.3) . When describing how to define a model for height in population the author says: To complete the model, we're going to need some priors. The parameters to be estimated are both $\mu$ and $\sigma$, so we need a prior $Pr(\mu, \sigma)$, the joint probability for all parameters. In most cases, priors are specified independently for each parameter, which amounts to assuming $Pr(\mu, \sigma) = Pr(\mu)Pr(\sigma)$. Then we can write: $$h_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) $$ $$\mu \sim \text{Normal}(178, 20) $$ $$\sigma \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 50) $$ Regarding the assumption that lead to the independent specification of priors for each parameter: Are they specified independently because parameters are considered independent each one with regards to the others? In which case should they be described only using the joint probability distribution? Is it possible to always describe the prior of each parameter independently of the others?
