Windows File Explorer control

Possible Duplicate: Embedding a File Explorer instance in a WinForms app form I want a windows explorer style control on my form so i can browse directories for files, and drag them into another section of my form, ideally with filters (eg *.mp3 etc). I can't find anything that will do exactly as I want. I have found this: http://hypercoder.com/?page_id=3 I have made the drag and drop work but with no documentation or examples I cannot work out how to double-click into directories in the file viewer and automatically update the tree. It seems that this type of control must be used all of the time! Does anybody know where I can find something that will work? TIA
