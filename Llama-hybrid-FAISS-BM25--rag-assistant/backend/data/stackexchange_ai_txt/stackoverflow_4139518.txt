For updated question: The solution you are trying sounds like it should work. It's not the sort of thing you want to use SessionState for but there are requirements here that make the situation out of the ordinary. Depending on how you are getting the base page to reload you may be able to add a query string to that which would save you from putting hte value in the SessionState. But I imagine you have probably considered that. But basically, as Postback values and viewstate are out of the question, SessionState and query strings are you only real option. Oh, unless you are allowed to use HTML5 local storage? (probably not) From before question update: If the aspnetForm is being posted back the the value should be persisted automatically by means of the postback values. So the first thing to know is whther your form is going through a postback or if you are refreshing the page in some other way. If you can't postback the main form then as rockinthesixstring said an Ajax post might be what you need. Also, if you are doing anything fancy with binding the datasource to the DropDownList or trying to persist the selectedValue yourself then check and re-think that.
