how to use paragraph text in uitableviewcell in cocoa-touch

I've been using uiLabels to put text in the cells of tableviews. I want to now use paragraph text that carriage returns to the next line instead of going out of the boundaries of the table cell. Would I do this by manipulating a uiLabel or would I use a different control all together like a text view. Also is there any project examples out there that implement this? Thanks, Joe
