Read existing margins in a pdf

I created a pdf file with iText. the pdf is a A4 file and have some margins defined. Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(); Document document = new Document(PageSize.A4, 36, 72, 108, 180); PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("c:\\margin.pdf")); document.open(); document.add(new Paragraph("Margin--->>roseinia.net")); document.close(); Now in another program, i want to read the margins of above pdf. Is there a way to do it in iText or some other library?
