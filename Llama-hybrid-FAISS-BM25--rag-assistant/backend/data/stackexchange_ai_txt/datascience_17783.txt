Using random forest to learn Imbalanced Data (rare disease)

I met a question when I ran the random forest. I used "V1", "V2", "V3" to predict a binary outcome (1: sick; 0: no) with random forest. I got a very high accuracy score (99%) however, when I check the confusion matrix, it shows that none of sick individuals were caught in testing data set (30% of entire data set). Here is the confusion matrix: [[856 0] [ 9 0]] This result means that 0 out of 9 people was detected as sick and it causes my attention. Maybe because the data set is imbalanced (very few sick individuals)? I would like to see if there is any other ways to detect sick individuals rather than a high accuracy rate, which means it is OK it has higher false positive rate but I would like to catch all 9 (true positive) individuals. Thanks!
