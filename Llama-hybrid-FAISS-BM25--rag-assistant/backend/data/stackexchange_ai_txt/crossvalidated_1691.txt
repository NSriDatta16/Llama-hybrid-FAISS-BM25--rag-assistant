You have a complex statistical problem and a complete analysis would be too long. However, I will suggest one idea that may perhaps help you to some extent. You have already performed some calibration tests to assess the mean and standard deviation of the velocity of a bullet. However, I suspect that either your testing or your calculations or both are sub-optimal for the reasons I mention below. The crucial point is this: The measured velocity of a bullet is a random variable that depends on three factors: (a) amount of gunpowder in the bullet, (b) random factors due to imperfections of the gun, and (c) errors because of chronograph inaccuracy. In other words, you can model the measured velocity of a bullet as follows: $v_m = v(gp) + \epsilon_g + \epsilon_c$ where, $v_m$ is the measured velocity, $v(gp)$ is the true velocity of the bullet given that the bullet has $gp$ amount of gunpowder, $\epsilon_g \sim N(0,\sigma_g^2)$ is the random error that arises due to imperfections of the gun and $\epsilon_c \sim N(0,\sigma_c^2)$ is the error induced by the chronograph. I think assuming that the errors are normally distributed with a mean zero and a finite variance is reasonable. Thus, we have: $E(v_m) = v(gp)$ and $Var(v_m) = \sigma_g^2 + \sigma_c^2$ The goal of testing is to get a sense of the average velocity and the standard deviation of the velocity of a bullet. You could simply compute the mean of the observed velocities to get a sense of the mean as $E(v_m) = v(g)$ but you cannot use the standard deviation of the observed velocities for setting your target as the the errors induced by the chronograph and the errors due to the imperfections of the gun are confounded. Thus, you need to design your test to disentangle the variation induced by the chronograph and the intrinsic variation because of other factors. One way to achieve the above disentanglement is to perform a test as follows: Start test 1 and choose a certain amount of gunpowder that you will fill up each bullet for this test. Load the bullet with the amount of gunpowder you chose for this test in step 1. Measure the velocity of the bullet. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a certain number of bullets. Perform several tests along the above lines ensuring that you choose a different amount of gunpowder for each test. Let: $i$ index the bullets, $j$ index the test. Then you have a set of velocities indexed $v_{ij}$. Then, you can calculate the variance of the velocity (and hence the standard deviation) as follows: Calculate the variance of all velocity measurements. Denote this number by $S_v^2$. Calculate the variance of velocities for each test separately. Denote each test specific variance by $S_j^2$. Note that each of these variance measures is a measure of how much variation is induced because of the chronograph as the amount of gunpowder is the same for each test. Then a measure of the variance of the velocity that you can attribute to the gun itself would be: $S_g^2 = S_v^2 - \frac {\sum_j S_j^2}{J}$ Once you know $S_g$ you can use your existing formula and there is no need to worry about the additional variation induced in your measurements because of your own chronograph as that has been 'taken care of' in our analysis. Hope that helps to some extent.
