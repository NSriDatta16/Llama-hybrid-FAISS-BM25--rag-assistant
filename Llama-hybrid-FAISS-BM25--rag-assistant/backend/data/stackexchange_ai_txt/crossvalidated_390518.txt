False discovery rate in binary logistic regression analysis?

I am analyzing a population-representative cross sectional survey to identify associations between several factors and cardiovascular disease. I am performing binary logistic regression analysis with the model having coronary heart disease as the dependent variable (0=no, 1=yes). From all the independent variables included in the model, I get 17 p-values. Many of them are 0.01. The question is: should I use some kind of correction for all the P values? Bonferroni correction is usually too conservative, but i was thinking about the false discovery rate method. What do you think? Would that be appropriate?
