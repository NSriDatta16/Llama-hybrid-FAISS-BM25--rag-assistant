Placing Your C# Application in the System Tray To get started, open an existing C# Windows form (or create a new one). Open the Visual Studio Toolbox. Drag a NotifyIcon control onto the form. The control will named notifyIcon1 by default and placed below the form because it has no visual representation on the form itself. Set the NotifyIcon control's Text property to the name you want to appear when the user pauses the mouse over the application's icon. For example, this value could be "KillerApp 1.0". Set the control's Icon property to the icon that you want to appear in the System Tray. Tip: If you have a BMP file that you want to convert to an icon file, I highly recommend the QTam Bitmap to Icon 3.5 application. -- Add an event handler for the form's Resize event that will hide the application when it's minimized. That way, it won't appear on the task bar. private void Form1_Resize(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { if (FormWindowState.Minimized == WindowState) Hide(); } -- Add an event handler for the NotifyIcon.DoubleClick event and code it as follows so that the application will be restored when the icon is double-clicked. private void notifyIcon1_DoubleClick(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { Show(); WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal; }
