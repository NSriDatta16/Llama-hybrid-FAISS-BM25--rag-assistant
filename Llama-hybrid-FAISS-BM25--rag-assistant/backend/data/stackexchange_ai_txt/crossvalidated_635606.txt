Can I use different transformations on features to ensure my data follow Gaussian Distribution

Suppose I am doing linear regression on a dataset. My dataset contains columns $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5, \text{target}$ . Features (independent variables) are the column names starting with "f" and my target variable (dependent variable) is "target". Suppose that $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$ , and $\text{target}$ are continuous variables and require data transformation to look like a Gaussian distribution. (As this is an assumption of most of the linear models) Now, I see that there is no one transformation that fixes all of those. For some, Yeo-Johnson did the job, for others I had to use something different. Similarly for target variables, I had to use something different. Suppose a Box-Cox transformation or quantile transformation. Is it a legit approach? Or do I need to use a single or same transformer for all the features?
