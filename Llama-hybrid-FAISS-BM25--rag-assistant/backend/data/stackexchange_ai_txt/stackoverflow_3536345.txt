Thanks for everyone's answers. It was indeed able to be solved in the code even if it wasn't exactly a true coding problem. Here is the xml data file I was reading the configuration details from: megan Adventure Works DW 2008 Adventure Works Now on the "localTrusted" or "localWithNetworking" setup, this was working just fine. It also works on the IE8 Flash player even in "remote". However, what was happening was that the xmlaUrl was being read as: \n\rhttp://localhost/olapbin/msmdpump.dll (with the newline and carriage return at the start) This is was what was confusing the domain checking and throwing a Sandbox Violation when run in the "remote" security sandbox. Of course, my xml should have been better, and maybe put in some ignore white space processing in the code, but still its quite some bizarre, inconsistent behavior from the Flash player code in Netscape compatible browsers (10.1.x). So the final, working solution looks like this: megan Adventure Works DW 2008 Adventure Works I did become a crossdomain.xml expert in the process though. ;-) Although, now I don't need the file at all. Bear it in mind if you see some crazy unexplained Sandbox Violations, check for white space in your service url.
