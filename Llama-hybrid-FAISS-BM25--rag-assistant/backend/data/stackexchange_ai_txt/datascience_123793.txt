Unfortunately this doesn't work. To understand why, let's think about the perfect classifier and the maximally wrong classifier. The perfect classifier has 100% recall on any given class. If there are 5 uniformly distributed classes, the average probability assigned to each of those classes by the classifier (over some set of data) will be 20% (because it will assign that class 100% when it is the true class, which is 20% of the time, and 0% at all other times). The maximally wrong classifier, which has 0% recall on every class, still assigns probability to wrong classes. Thus its average probability assigned to a class is > 0% even though recall is strictly 0%. Your classifier probably isn't perfect or maximally wrong, but hopefully this helps you have an intuition for why recall and average class probability are unrelated.
