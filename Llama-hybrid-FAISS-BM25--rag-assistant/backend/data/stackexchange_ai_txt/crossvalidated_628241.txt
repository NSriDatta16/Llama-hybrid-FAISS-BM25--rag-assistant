overfitting and random forest

I know that random forest is just getting a lot of trees that are not pruned But, by the act of averaging predictions across many trees actually reduces the variance and get consistent prediction. Then, how can you overfit? And I read that if you have too many trees and the ensemble method (random forest) will get really complex. By, don't we average the predictions and complexity decreases? One is saying you don't face overfitting and one is saying you are going to face overfitting. Do you know which one is true?
