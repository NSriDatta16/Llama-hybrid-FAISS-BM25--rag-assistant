Fraud detection using machine learning

I would like to implement a machine learning algorithm for data like this. id Date Amount isFraud 1 100 2018-03-20 10:20:10 110.0 No 2 101 2018-03-25 11:20:20 2.0 Yes 3 101 2018-03-25 11:20:22 2.5 Yes 4 101 2018-03-25 11:20:25 1.7 Yes 5 101 2018-03-25 11:20:27 2.1 Yes 6 101 2018-03-25 11:20:30 2.9 Yes 7 102 2018-03-29 11:00:11 290.0 No 8 110 2018-04-15 08:10:05 1.5 Yes 9 110 2018-04-15 08:10:09 2.3 Yes 10 110 2018-04-15 08:10:13 2.7 Yes 11 110 2018-04-15 08:10:17 1.9 Yes 12 110 2018-04-15 08:10:21 2.9 Yes 13 110 2018-04-15 08:10:27 2.2 Yes 14 110 2018-04-15 08:10:45 2.1 Yes 15 113 2018-04-15 10:10:05 190.0 No Algorithm needs to work in the following way. Transactions with lower amount are classified as scam. Frequent transactions from same id with same amount or lower amount are also scam. The above dataset was created for this purpose. For these kinds of problems, should we write our own algorithms by specifying the conditions? Or can we use any existing algorithms?
