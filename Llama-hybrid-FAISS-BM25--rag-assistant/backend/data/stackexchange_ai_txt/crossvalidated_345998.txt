Connectivity vs. density for random, small world and scale-free networks

I am trying to understand a paper by reconstructing the the analyses discussed in the Validation study section, however, I am confused when it comes to how a network metric is used. Specifically, the authors discuss that they manipulated the connectivity metric in order to generate sparse networks. I know that in graph theory connectivity refers to: [...] the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes from each other. Question 1: What exactly does connectivity refer to in the paragraph below? Is it network density or degree centrality ? Question 2: Also, I don't understand how increasing the preferential attachment parameter (i.e., $P_{attach}$) affects the network sparsity in the case of scale-free networks. The authors mention that only one edge is added per node at each iteration , so, regardless of the preferential attachment, the resulting number of edges in the graph should remain the same, right? This is the representative paragraph from the paper in question: The level of connectivity of the networks was chosen to generate sparse networks. For this reason, in case of random networks, the probability of a connection ($P_{conn}$) between two nodes was set to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. For small world networks, the neighbourhood was set to 2, and for scale-free networks only one edge is added per node at each iteration in the graph generating process. To obtain awide variety of well known graph structures, the rewiring probability ($P_{rewire}$) in small world networks was set to 0.1, 0.5 and 1, and the power of preferential attachment ($P_{attach}$) in scale-free networks was set to 1, 2 and 3. For the condition with 100 nodes, we used different levels of connectivity for random and scale-free networks (random networks: $P_{conn}=$ .05, .1, and .15; scale-free networks: $P_{attach}=$ 1, 1.25, and 1.5). Otherwise, nodes will have too many connections. â€” Van Borkulo et al. (2014; p. 4)
