Maybe question is about sharing session? This can be done using serialized J2EE sessions or using shared client variables . For example, this can be done in following way. Create empty database on one of servers (I've created MySQL one). Create datasources pointing to this DB on all CF servers. Use this datasource as Server Settings > Client Variables > client sessions storage with name SharedSessions (we'll use it later). If we're using cflogin in Application.cfm on all servers , it's code can look this (simplified) way: Not authorized other.server.com Now these show the same on both servers: Sure, there's much to do here to make process better and more secure, just described the general idea. Hope this helps.
