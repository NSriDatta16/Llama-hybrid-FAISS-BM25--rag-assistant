Logistic regression using penalized likelihood (lasso?) in Matlab/R

I am trying to use logistic regression in a scenario where there are very few positives. I'm aware that maximum likelihood suffers from small sample bias. So MATLAB's glmfit doesn't work for me. I tried using firth regression in R but it simply hangs up my powerful PC (150,000 observations, 9 dummy variables, 1500 positives). MATLAB also has the function lassoglm but I'm not sure if it can be used for logistic regression with few positives. Can you please confirm/suggest alternative? Some useful links - here and here .
