The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model and also a suite of protocols which follow that model very closely. Here is an example of a protocol stack using ISO protocols (this is the stack I used to work on 15 years ago when I was working on the management network for SONET telco equipment): Layer 7 (Application): ISO 8571: File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM) ISO 9596: Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) Layer 6 (Presentation): ISO 8823: Presentation Layer Protocol Layer 5 (Session): ISO 8327: Connection-oriented Session Protocol Layer 4 (Transport): ISO 8073: Protocol for providing the connection-mode transport service Layer 3 (Network): ISO 8473: Protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service Layer 2 (Datalink): ISO 8802-2: Local and metropolitan area networks -- Specific requirements -- Part 2: Logical link control Layer 1: SONET DCC These ISO/IEC protocols were somewhat widely used in the 80's and 90's, but these days they are only used in a few niche applications and the ISO/IEC protocols have mostly been replaced by the TCP/IP protocol stack which uses the ISO model only loosely.
