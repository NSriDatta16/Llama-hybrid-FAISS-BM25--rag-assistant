Day of year is one sensible predictor variable, and for that I think it is sensible to treat it as @pedrofigueira suggests. For other predictor variables you may need to be careful about how you represent time. For instance, imagine you have air temperatures by day -- how would you model air temperature as a predictor of ice-on day? I don't think comparing same day-of-year samples is sufficient. In any such analysis, I think it helps to write down what you think a plausible generating model (or models) of the data might be, (where some physics might be available as a guide). For instance, a reasonable model might be to integrate the number of days below freezing, and when that integral passes a threshold (e.g. related to the thermal mass of the lake), ice-on occurs. From such a model you can then ask what is a reasonable approximation and what isn't. For instance, day-of-year as predictor matters to that model only in so much as day of year is a good predictor of temperature. Thus knowing only the day of the year, one would just have an average day-of-year corresponding to the ice-on threshold, with perhaps some normal distribution about it resulting from interannual temperature variations, and therefore looking for a trend in day-of-year is completely justified. But if you know other variables like air-temp by day, you probably face dealing with somewhat more complicated model more directly. If you are just using the annual values (minimums? means?) than variable as a predictor of ice-on day also seems reasonable (by the same argument as above).
