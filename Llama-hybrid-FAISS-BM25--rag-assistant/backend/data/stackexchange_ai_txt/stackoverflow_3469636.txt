This is funny, because I often wonder how DDD can be applied to web development. I don't mean this to be a comprehensive answer to your question, but you might find something useful among the responses to an old question of mine: Should I map a DTO to/from a domain entity on both client and server sides? As a very general answer to your question, I'd say that you could move logic out of the view models and into a client-side domain model (since it sounds like the server side is working just fine without any concept of a domain model). You'd use the DTOs coming out of the web service to "hydrate" these entities. If you're creating a smart client, then you want to leverage the ability to maintain state and perform logic directly in the client (so, "no" to the footnote).
