Matching text within P tags in HTML

I'd like to match the contents within each paragraph in html using a python regular expression. These paragraphs always have BR tags inside them like so: this is nice isn't it? I'm currently using this pattern: pattern = re.compile(' (.*?) ') Then I'm using: pattern.findall(html) to find all the matches. However, it only matches two of 28 paragraphs I have, and it looks like that's because those two don't have BR tags inside of them and the rest do. What am I doing wrong? What can I do to fix it? Thanks!
