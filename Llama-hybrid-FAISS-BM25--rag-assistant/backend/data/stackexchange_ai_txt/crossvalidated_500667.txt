Applying Bayes rule in the context of reinforcement learning

I was watching this video on reinforcement learning. At 1:28 , it says following: $$Pr(s'|a,z,s)=\frac{Pr(z|s',a,s)Pr(s'|a,s)}{Pr(z|a,s)}$$ I was unable to get how this was obtained. I pondered a bit and come up with possible reasoning. But still unsure if I am correct. This is what I have thought: $Pr(s'|a,z,s) = \frac{Pr(s',a,z,s)}{Pr(a,z,s)} $ ... equation (1) by Bayes theorem $Pr(z|s',a,s) = \frac{Pr(s',a,z,s)}{Pr(a,s',s)}$ ... by Bayes theorem $\therefore Pr(s',a,z,s) = Pr(z|s',a,s)Pr(a,s',s)$ ...equation (2) $Pr(s'|a,z,s) = \frac{Pr(z|s',a,s)Pr(a,s',s)}{Pr(a,z,s)}$ ... By putting equation (2) in equation (1) Now I need to prove $Pr(s'|a,s) = Pr(s',a,s)$ and $Pr(z|a,s) = Pr(z,a,s)$ . As per the context available to me, even $a\cap s=(a,s)$ seems to form the whole sample space (I am not sure of this though, it seems so after watching the video from starting). That is both events $s'$ and $z$ are subset of Event $(a,s)$ . Will that make $Pr(s'|a,s) = Pr(s',a,s)$ and $Pr(z|a,s) = Pr(z,a,s)$ ? If yes, then I guess I will be able to get the original quoated equation. Am I correct with this? PS: I believe $Pr(s'|a,z,s)$ means $s'$ depends on all $a,z$ and $s$ .
