We can't help with the "is this correct" because that is predicated on the scientific question at hand and something only you and subject-matter experts can determine. If you are naive to statistics and their role in your analysis, I suggest you consult a statistician within the institution from where you are working on your PhD to guide you. These types of discussion are also off-topic for stack overflow (you may consider Cross Validated ) As far as the objective, coding-related question goes, I dont believe gee objects can use typical functions to gather the confidence intervals (ie, confint() ). However, you can calculate the Wald confidence interval directly using the results of the model. You didnt provide data, so using this reproducible data: set.seed(123) n You can run the model ( migee ), extract the results ( mdlresults ), then calculate the confidence intervals and organize the results in a data frame ( finalres ): # model migee Output # > finalres # param est lwr upr # 1 (Intercept) -0.79094492 -0.96054071 -0.62134914 # 2 GRUPO1 0.14851284 -0.07233009 0.36935577 # 3 Tiempo2 0.07898841 -0.15237451 0.31035133 # 4 Tiempo3 0.12337459 -0.09494036 0.34168953 # 5 GRUPO1:Tiempo2 -0.24411386 -0.56936113 0.08113342 # 6 GRUPO1:Tiempo3 -0.12646163 -0.42464761 0.17172435
