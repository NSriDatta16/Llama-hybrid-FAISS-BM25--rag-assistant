I might not fully understand the question - but for what it is worth: The random forest is a collection of individual trees. Each tree uses a subset of parameters, and (critically) a subset of the observations. It then "fits" a tree on this subset of the observations (of which you know the class). THe prediction error is calculated by making a prediction using the fitted model on the "rest" of the observations, and comparing the predicted classes with the actual classes. the final prediction error of the forest is the average error across all the trees in the random forest. The book "The Elements of Statistical Learning" might explain this more clearly.
