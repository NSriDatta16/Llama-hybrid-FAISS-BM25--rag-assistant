In addition to answers based on Gaussian processes given by other answers, it is possible to do something which resembles (to a certain extent) Nadaraya-Watson style regression using Dirichlet process mixture models. See, for example, this paper by Mueller et al. They discuss this connection very briefly on page 70. The analogy here isn't perfect. And the method suffers some pretty serious drawbacks (due to the fact that one must implicitly model the covariates), such that Bayesians don't really like using this approach anymore.
