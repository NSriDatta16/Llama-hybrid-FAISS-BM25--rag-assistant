I think you should consider development in GWT which is basically a Java based wrapper for Javascript. It has a lot of community support and a complete drag and drop support is available in the form of a library - http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dnd/ Since GWT is coding in Java, it is not really a new territory to venture into but knowledge of Javascript, css, html goes a long in way in building robust GWT application. Plus it allows you to debug your code in eclipse just like Java code.
