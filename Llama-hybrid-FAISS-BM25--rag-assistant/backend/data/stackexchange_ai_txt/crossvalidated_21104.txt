Calculate average of a set numbers with reported standard errors

I have 365 daily measurements that all have standard errors associated with them. Date | Prediction | Standard Error ----------------------------------------- Jan-01-2003 | 24.8574 | 10.6407 Jan-02-2003 | 10.8658 | 3.8237 Jan-03-2003 | 12.1917 | 5.7988 Jan-04-2003 | 11.1783 | 4.3016 Jan-05-2003 | 16.713 | 5.3177 etc ... What is the statistically appropriate way of getting the yearly average with a 95% Confidence Interval around it ? I am assuming that the errors must be propagating somehow and need to be accounted for. Google returns mostly information on how to calculate the average or standard deviation of a set of numbers, not a set of numbers with errors. I would also appreciate some type of internet reference so I can refer to it later.
