Before Java 5.0, use -Xdebug and -Xrunjdwp arguments. These options will still work in later versions, but it will run in interpreted mode instead of JIT, which will be slower. From Java 5.0, it is better to use the -agentlib:jdwp single option: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044 Options on -Xrunjdwp or agentlib:jdwp arguments are : transport=dt_socket : means the way used to connect to JVM (socket is a good choice, it can be used to debug a distant computer) address=8000 : TCP/IP port exposed, to connect from the debugger (will only allow local connections, see Antony Shumskikh's answer for remote debugging) suspend=y : if 'y', tell the JVM to wait until debugger is attached to begin execution, otherwise (if 'n'), starts execution right away.
