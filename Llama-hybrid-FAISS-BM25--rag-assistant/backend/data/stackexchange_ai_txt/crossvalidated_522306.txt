Can we use a matrix as input for feedforward neural networks?

I'm studying neural networks but haven't yet studied CNNs in depth. I'm wondering whether we can use a matrix as input for feedforward neural networks? Or can we only use vectors as input for feedforward NNs? I'm asking this because in all the practical examples I've worked with I had to flatten the input matrix (for example images) to use it as an input in form of a vector.
