You could try using other metrics to measure interest. An example for an article would be "time on page". If you measure scroll depth, even better. you could give a "5" rating if the user spent more than "n" seconds (where n is the time it takes to read the article, on average) or if the user scrolled all the way to the bottom. a "3" could be if the user didn't show a lot of interest in the article, for example.
