There's nothing in the default v1.3.2.4 Magento codebase that calls addTierPriceData() on that class. It does, however, exist in v1.4.2 and is called by Mage_Bundle_Model_Product_Price::getFinalPrice() So, either you have a commercial theme that is calling that function (unlikely), or an extension that has been installed that is not compatible with v1.3.3 If you turn on logging in System>Config>Admin>Developer, you should get a full stack trace in var\log\exception.log which you can paste into your question and we can verify which piece of code is calling that method.
