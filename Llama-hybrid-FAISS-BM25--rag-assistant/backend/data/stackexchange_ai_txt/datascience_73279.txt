The question is quite old, but LightGBM implementing various tree based learning algorithms : GBDT , Gradient boosting decision tree DART , or Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees GOSS, or Gradient-based One-Side Sampling Random Forest Has a GPU support and an R package which can call the GPU version. However, as often with GPUs it is more complex than a simple install.package You may find detailed build instructions for lightgbm on the GPU here and once built a couple of steps are needed to have the R interface.
