ROC curve under diagonal?

I trained an SVM to classify images based on some extracted features (using the ISIC dataset). The resulting ROC curve produced by sklearn looks like this: I have don't quite understand the line for class 0 and 1 (orange and green). I have never seen a ROC curve under the diagonal. What does this tell me now and is this even a valid curve? The other computed evaluation metrices are the following if that helps my question.
