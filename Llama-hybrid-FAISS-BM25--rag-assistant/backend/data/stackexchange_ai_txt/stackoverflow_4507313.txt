In the heading you heading mention "choice permutations" which suggests a dynamic pattern (i.e. how to use such a structure for decision making). If it's this then I'd agree with @robert that it's a Decision Tree. In the body however you say ...the data model needs to be represented using a tree structure... If your questions is simply the name of this tree-based structural pattern the answer is Hierarchical Database Model . It's characterised by 1..N relationships between parent and child and pre-dates the Relational model (it was - and still is - the basis for IBM's IMS database system). You allude to one of the problems with it. Namely, that the only way to model graph-based structures using it means denormalising and repeating elements. Removing that limitation is central to the Relational model. hth.
