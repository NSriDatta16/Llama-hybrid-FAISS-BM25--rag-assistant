I'm not sure that you can just create a CI, and then ask "how is this valid?". What you need to do for the frequentist inference is 1) specify your population; 2) specify your sampling distribution (or process); 3) specify your statistic, and which population quantity it is estimating; 4) calculate the sampling distribution of this statistic; 5) invert the sampling distribution to get CI. There is not necessarily 1 population that leads to 1 CI. You need to specify what the population is, and work through the steps. As for using the data to help with other situations, I doubt it would be too useful, because your sample only has 1 supplier, 1 time period, 1 section, 1 station. Your sample has no variation over these, so you can't test these assumptions with your data. An analogy is if you only planted grass species A in your sample, but want to know if it's better/worse than species B. However, these essentially would form caveats for how general the (A-B) difference is. It could be that A>B for all cases, or it could be for your particular time period, or the particular supplier, etc.. The above problems would show up in part 4) where your sampling distribution would depend on quantities you have no data for (eg average hay production for species A for a different supplier in the same section, same time period, same station).
