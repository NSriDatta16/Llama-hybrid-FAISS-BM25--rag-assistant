If I understood all you have written correctly you are opting out of natural clustering due to fragmentation penalties. For this purpose you consider meaningless IDs which will: avoid insert penalties for clustered index when inserting out of order batches (great for write performance) guarantee that your data is fragmented for reads that put conditions on the natural key (not so good for read performance) JNK point's out that fragmentation can be a real issue, however you need to establish a baseline against which you will measure and you need to establish if reading or writing is more important to you (or how important they are in measurable terms). There's nothing that will beat a good test case - so finally that is the best recommendation I can give. With databases it is often relatively easy to build scripts that will create real benchmarks with real workloads and realistic data quantities.
