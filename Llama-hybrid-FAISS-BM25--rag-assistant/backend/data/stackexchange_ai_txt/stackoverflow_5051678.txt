I think you're making this too hard. You already have the information you need to go back stored in "local storage" -- the browser history . Simply use javascript to look at the history and go back as far as you need. As far as returning to the home page, isn't the home page a well known URI? What's wrong with go home ? Update Isn't the home page always going to be the first page in the history? You seem to be saying that you're in a situation where you want to return to a page for which you don't know the base URI, don't know how you got where you are, and don't know where you started. I suppose you could put the place you'd like to go into a cookie, but if you don't even know the base URI, how would you retrieve it? I'm beginning to think the real answer is "you need to rethink your design, there's something deeply wrong."
