In this 2007 paper `Central limit behavior of deterministic dynamical systems by Tirnakli, Beck, and Tsallis, they state that What is less known in the physics community but well-known in the mathematics community is the fact that there are also CLTs for the iterates of deterministic dynamical systems. The iterates of a deterministic dynamical system can never be completely independent, since they are generated by a deterministic algorithm. However, if the assumption of IID is replaced by the weaker property that the dynamical system is sufficiently strongly mixing, then various versions of CLTs can be proved for deterministic dynamical systems. They provide as an example the logistic map $$x_{i+1}=T(x_i)=1-ax_i^2$$ When $a=2$ , the sequence is strongly mixing , with invariant density $$\pi(x) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{1âˆ’x^2}}$$ (that is $T\pi=\pi$ ). Then the limiting distribution of the average $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$ is centred Gaussian, when the original value $x_1$ is a random variable with a absolutely continuous probability distribution. The (limiting) variance of this Gaussian distribution is $1/2$ . Note that the logistic map is chaotic for $a=2$ and hence can be used for a random generator . Similar central limit theorems can be found in ergodic theory , for some dynamical systems with an infinite ergodic measure (see, e.g., these lecture notes , Theorem 76, or this paper ).
