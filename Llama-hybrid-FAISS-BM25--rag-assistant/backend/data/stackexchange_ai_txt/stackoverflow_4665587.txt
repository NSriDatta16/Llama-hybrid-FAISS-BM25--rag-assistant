spring mvc bind into 2 objects that have identical fields

I submit a form, lets say this form contains and i have 2 objects to which i need to bind to: class Address { String address; .. } class BillingAddress { String address; .. } obviously billingAddress wont bind to address in BillingAddress without some magic. lets say i have multiple identical fields in both Address and BillingAddress but on the form i prefix the billing inputs with billing , ie billingFirstName, billingLastName etc. is there some elegant way i can bind to BillingAddress that i can reuse for similar problems? (or is there a better way to solve this then what i have come up with?)
