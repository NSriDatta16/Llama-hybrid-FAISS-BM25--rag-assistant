Haven't looked at VS for a while, so I'm note sure what's changed in the last few years. That being said, I like a couple of Source Forge Projects in this area KDiff3 and Notepad++ with the Compare Plugin from the plugins project. and the reason I haven't paid a lot of attention to the Visual Studio side of things is that I am a Delphi freak, and the diff tool I've been using for years, because until recently even what I was using from Project JEDI's JediVCS which has an integral diff tool.
