Generate sentences using given data

I am working on an automated insights generation use case where I want to generate meaningful sentences from given aggregated data. For example, Data: Student = John Total_Marks = 96 Class_Average = 85 NLG model-generated insights: 1. You did an excellent job, John! Your score is 96! 2. You have scored 11 marks above the class average. When I look at classic NLG, they are sentence generation approaches given a starting letter or word. This might be more of a Neural Machine Transition use case. What do you think my approach should be?
