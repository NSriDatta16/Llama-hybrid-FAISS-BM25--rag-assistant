Exuberant ctags already supports tag field "module" for Erlang. $ /usr/bin/ctags --version Exuberant Ctags 5.8, Copyright (C) 1996-2009 Darren Hiebert Compiled: Aug 17 2010, 17:33:33 Addresses: , http://ctags.sourceforge.net Optional compiled features: +wildcards, +regex $ /usr/bin/ctags xref_parser.erl A typical tag line with a tag field named "module" looks like: yeccgoto_const xref_parser.erl /^yeccgoto_const(24=_S, Cat, Ss, Stack, T, Ts, Tzr) ->$/;" f module:xref_parser Actually, it is VIM which doesn't support this tag field as for now. From VIM doc : {field} .. A list of optional fields. Each field has the form: {fieldname}:{value} The {fieldname} identifies the field, and can only contain alphabetical characters [a-zA-Z]. The {value} is any string, but cannot contain a . There is one field that doesn't have a ':'. This is the kind of the tag. It is handled like it was preceded with "kind:". See the documentation of ctags for the kinds it produces. The only other field currently recognized by Vim is "file:" (with an empty value). It is used for a static tag. That's it. Only "kind" and "file" are supported tag field names.
