If you set up a new iPhone and did not restore it from a backup, your profiles have been lost. You need to reinstall them. Of course, you can use the same one again, as your unique device ID (UDID) does not change with a software update. Connect your device, open the Xcode organizer (Windows -> organizer or Cmd+Option+O), select your device and click "Use for development". Then you can add your provisioning profile again.
