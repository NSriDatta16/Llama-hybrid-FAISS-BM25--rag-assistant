Here's my workflow: library("RSQLite") setwd("~/your/dir") db The field.types isn't necessary. RSQLite will guess from the header if you don't provide this list. The index isn't required either, but will speed up your queries later on (if you index the correct column for your queries). I've been learning a lot of this stuff here on SO, so if you check my questions asked/answered on SQLite, you may find some tagential stuff.
