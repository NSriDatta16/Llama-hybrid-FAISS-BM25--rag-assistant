Get VAR's coefficients for old basis

I've made dimensionality reduction with PCA and got data expressed with new orthogonal basis PCA1, ... , PCA4. After I've modelled VAR (Vector autoregression model) and got some coefficients for PCA1, ..., PCA4 equations. How to transform this coefficients to apply for my original data? I need these coefficients to make interpretation of my model. I don't want to build VAR without PCA, because it give me worse predictive results.
