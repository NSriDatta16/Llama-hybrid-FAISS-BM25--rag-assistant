Wow, I see the topic is hot, lot of good answers... Irony aside, I recently discovered BDD and found the concept interesting. Hey, it forces to write both tests... and specifications! As surprising as it might seem, the latter can be also missing in some projects... Or just lacking the precision that BDD forces to introduce. The Behavior Driven Development article summarizes the concept and links to some good articles (like the one written by Andrew Glover). Moreover, to the topic of this thread, it gives a rather comprehensive (I suppose) listing of BDD frameworks, a good number of them being for Java. It doesn't solve the problem of choosing the framework but at least it will ease the search... Since BDD relies heavily on readability of test code, I suppose a good criterion of choice is to look at the quick tours/tutorial and see which one seems the more fitting your style. Other criteria could be the fact a framework leverage tools you are familiar with (unit test, mocking), usage with IDE, and so on.
