I think that it is quite the opposite of what @Konstantin says. The differences between multidimensional and multivariate are easier to understand through an example: Consider you are recording wind speed at different places, say $P_1, P_2, P_3, ... P_n$ . You will have $n$ time series, right? But only one variate, which is the wind speed. So this is your $n$ -dimensional, one-variate data. Now, imagine that at the same points, you start recording different variables, like wind $v_1$ , pressure $v_2$ , ozone concentration $v_3$ , so each location recording is a function $ f(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ . So you will have to deal with a $n$ _dimensional, $3$ -variate process. I your specific case, you have a diagram, that is neither multidimensional nor multivariate. It is the data to have this properties not the diagram. If you explain better the data, we can further discuss about it.
