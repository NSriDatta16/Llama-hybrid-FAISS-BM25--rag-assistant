What more you can do with your DAL other than dbml file

NOTE: I am not an expert, so if you feel this question stupid/lame please forgive and mind your business. :) Ok, as all video tutorials tell, create a LinqToSqlClasses item (dbml) file. drag tables and we are done here. But in my case (or probably in all real world scenarios), we need more from our Data Access Layer than just the auto generated classes, right? For Example: In a simple accounting software: i have a Accounts Table and a AccountingTransactions Table, Now to get any account's ledger we need to write a pretty Lengthy sql query, same goes for trial-balance, day book, and Single Vouchers et cetera. What can we do in DAL to optimize these queries to have best performance.
