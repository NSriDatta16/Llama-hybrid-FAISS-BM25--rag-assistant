See Section 5.2 in Aki Vehtari, Andrew Gelman and Jonah Gabry (2017). Practical Bayesian model evaluation using leave-one-out cross-validation and WAIC. In Statistics and Computing, 27(5):1413â€“1432. doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4. arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544 If you are using Stan with R, see loo package in CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=loo which computes the desired se. Note also that if you have a large number of models, a direct comparison with LOO and WAIC is not recommended as the selection process will overfit. See more in Juho Piironen and Aki Vehtari (2017). Comparison of Bayesian predictive methods for model selection. Statistics and Computing, 27(3):711-735. doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9649-y. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-016-9649-y For tutorial video and case studies for recommended way to do reliable and stable variable selection with Stan, see https://github.com/avehtari/modelselection_tutorial To get faster answers for questions related to Stan and loo, I recommend Stan discussion forum http://discourse.mc-stan.org/
