Model-View-ViewModel in WPF

I've currently noticed that many people start using this model very often. Anyways, I think it's very correct to separate logic from presentation. What more, some functionalities cannot be accomplished without it, or just very hardly. Consider a Tree that is selectable, has search capabilities etc.. But in some cases, you don't need to implement this MVVM model, although people do it. Do you think it's correct? Wasn't the purpose of WPF to simplify coding - try to do the majority of work in XAML? I have a feeling, that this model is often misused just for the elegance of the design, but breaks the WPF efforts. Or am I completely wrong?
