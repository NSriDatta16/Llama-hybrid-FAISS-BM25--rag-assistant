It sounds like you want to simulate the formation of tracks and then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to see how many tracks fall into the red region. To do this, I would first convert the lines to two functions, one giving direction and the other distance from one point to the next on that track. Now you can study the probability distributions associated with those two functions. For example, you might find that distance travelled follows a specific distribution (be careful that the distribution doesn't change over time). If either variable does change over time then you have to delve into time series analysis (not my field, sorry). Another thought that comes to mind is that, since the direction of movement in x-y changes gradually in most of the tracks, you might do better examining the change in direction vs time for the tracks. You will also need to estimate the probability of a track starting at a given x-y co-ordinate with a given direction. You may want to consider using kernel density estimation to smooth the resulting PDF or, if it appears to follow a distribution for which there is an analytical model then expectation maximisation could be used to fit that distribution to the data. The Monte Carlo simulation would then draw random samples from these distributions to simulate the shapes of the tracks. Then you have to simulate a large number of tracks and see how often those tracks pass through the red region. This could be thousands or millions of tracks, you'll have to experiment to see when the distribution stops changing as you add more tracks.
