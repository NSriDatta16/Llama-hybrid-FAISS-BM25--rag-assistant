Common denominator between good/bad models for binary classification

I am working on a simple binary classification problem, where I compare various models. I have posted the mean accuracies for 5-fold cross validation for the models below (the area-under-curve values behave similarly). The accuracies were calculated on a test set. My question is: Can I make any assumptions why the accuracies differ so much between models (52% to 88%)? Is there any common denominator between the good/bad performing models? Model Accuracy Naive Bayes 0.52 Logistic Regression 0.53 Linear SVM 0.53 QDA 0.54 AdaBoost 0.63 Random Forest 0.64 RBF SVM 0.85 Nearest Neighbors 0.88 Deep Neural Network 0.88
