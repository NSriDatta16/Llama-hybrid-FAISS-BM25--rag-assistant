Parser Generators and Ragel... Making my own D Parser

I'm new to the world of compilers, and I recently heard about something called a parser generator. From what I (think) I've understood, parser generators take in a syntax file and output a source code file that can parse files with the given syntax. A few questions: Did I understand that correctly? If so, is Ragel such a tool? If it is, can Ragel output a D parser into D source code? Thank you!
