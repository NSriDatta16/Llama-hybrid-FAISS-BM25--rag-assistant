I'm going to take the Javascript to Objective-C bridge approach and store everything in core data. Set localStorage to false, then build a JS object and an instance named "localStorage" with the same methods. My javascript devs won't know the difference, and I already had to do the same thing with Air (basically). There's another way to leave the localStorage intact even though it doesn't actually store them in a persistent db. The elements can be iterated through in javascript and manipulated from there, but I think it will be better to simply replace the object with my own.
