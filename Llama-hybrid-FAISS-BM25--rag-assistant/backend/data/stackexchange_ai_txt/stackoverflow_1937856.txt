Like adrianm said, when you trigger your animation off a bool property you are actually responding to an event. Specifically the event PropertyChanged which the WPF subsystem. Which is designed to attach/detach correctly to/from so that you don't leak memory (you may forget to do this when wiring an event yourself and cause a memory leak by having a reference active to an object which otherwise should be GCed). This allows you to expose your ViewModel as the DataContext for the control and respond correctly to the changing of properties on the datacontext through databinding. MVVM is a pattern that works particularly well with WPF because of all these things that WPF gives you, and triggering off a property change is actually an elegant way to use the entire WPF subsystem to accomplish your goals :)
