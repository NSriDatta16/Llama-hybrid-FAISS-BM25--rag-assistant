Way to avoid creating a sub-directory in topicref

I have a very simple template match in my xslt code to create a ditamap, and it works by just creating a topicref whenever matches a "Section" of the original document. The initial xml code fragment looks like: WBG (S-GW/P-GW) chassis The xslt template match for section looks like: The code works, except that for the Heading like above "WBG (S-GW/P-GW) chassis", it will take the "/" as a sub-folder, so it will create a subforlder called "WBG (S-GW" then create a file "P-GW)_chassis.xml". Is there a way to make xslt ignore the "/" in the Heading and just treat it as a string to create an xml file by simply using that string?
