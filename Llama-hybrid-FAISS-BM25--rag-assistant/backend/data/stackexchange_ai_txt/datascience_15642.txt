Outliers Approach

Having a schema which the majority of the values are IDs. Like this example (this isn't my real data): ID SCHOOL_ID CLASSE_ID STUDENT_ID GRADE 1 1 1 1 17 2 1 1 2 10 3 1 1 3 4 4 1 2 19 11 5 1 2 21 8 ... ... ... ... ... Which one of this can be a better approach to detect outliers using SQL: - Standard Deviation + Average - Try to implement an clustering algorithm I'm a little bit confusing about this... Thanks
