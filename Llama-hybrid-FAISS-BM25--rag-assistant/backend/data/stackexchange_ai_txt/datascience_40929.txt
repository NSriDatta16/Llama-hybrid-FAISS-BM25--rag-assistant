I think that there is actually a pletora of tools for working with big data in R. sparklyr will be a great player in that field. sparklyr is an R interface to Apache Spark and allows the connection with local and remote clusters, providing a dplyr back-end. One can also rely on Apache Spark's machine learning libraries. Furthermore parallel processing is possible with several packages such as rmpi and snow (user controlled) or doMC/foreach (system based).
