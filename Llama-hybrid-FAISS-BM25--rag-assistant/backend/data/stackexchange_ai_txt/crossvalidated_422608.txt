It seems to me you are mixing the times for series and parallel performances of 'child' tasks. If we modify your example so that 10 workers are up and all 10 'child' tasks are done in parallel, then the time to completion is the sum of time for the 'parent' and the longest (maximum) 'child' working time. Assuming normally distributed working times all around, then the average wait would be about $10 + 912 = 922,$ not $10 + 850 = 860.$ The distribution of the maximum of 10 independent normal working times is not trivial to compute analytically, but easy to simulate: set.seed(817) longest.of.10 = replicate(10^6, max(rnorm(10, 850, 40))) mean(longest.of.10) [1] 911.5538 However, without verification based on data, it is not clear that individual working times are normally distributed. Also, it is not clear what combination of series and parallel work you have in mind for four workers doing 10 tasks. One scheme might be to treat it as a four-server queue with 10 'customers' waiting in the system. But the most common assumption with queues is that working times ('service times') are exponential. If you could clarify which workers are performing in series and which in parallel when 4 workers are assigned 10 tasks and what distribution is reasonable for working times on individual tasks, that would be helpful information toward a complete Answer. Addendum. You commented, "I think it's a decent assumption that workers 1 and 2 process three tasks each while the other two workers get two each. Thus, the total time for the 10 child tasks to complete is roughly the expected sum of three samples from task B's population. How can I estimate this (well enough)?" While other configurations are technically possible, I agree these seem the most likely possibilities. The sum of 3 independent random variables distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=850,\sigma=40)$ has distribution $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=3*850, \sigma = \sqrt{3*40^2}) \equiv \mathsf{Norm}(2550, 69.28).$ Then as above, we can find the maximum of two such random variables to be about $2589$ (slightly larger than 2550), by simulation: longest.of.2 = replicate(10^6, max(rnorm(2,2550,69.28))) mean(longest.of.2) [1] 2589.134
