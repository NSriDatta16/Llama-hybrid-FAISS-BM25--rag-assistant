replacing value only from an Xelement using linq

EDIT: A bit more detailed HTML document... In short- how do I actually do the lookup and where precisely should the element.setvalue or element.value appear in the query... Edit 2: The list of monkey id does not appear clear so I will add proper id's and add additional properties to my Lookup data object, sorry for the confusion! The reason I have used a list is bacause my datasource could be from anywhere also I have used a List object because I do not really know the proper usage of Dictionary (I am a newbie to coding hence why my question is all over the place, please bear with me) I have an XElement which is a properly formatted HTML document, I am trying to replace only the value of a html element with a value contained in a List Object for example some guy wants to buy a monkeyfield for some price that I do not have a clue about, maybe we should suggest a list of other monkeys he may like: list of special monekeys you may want chappy... monkeyfield monkeyfield animalfield seacreaturefield mamal field Note: the value "monkeyfield" is a temporary value inserted onscreen for the purpose of identifying this is a field, once the values from the data source is binded the new values should appear. public class LookupData { public string id{get;set;} public string value{get;set;} public string Type{get;set;} public string Url{get;set;} } ... public void DataTransformerMethod() { var data = new List (); data.add(new LookupData{id="monkey3", value="special monkey from africa" }); data.add(new LookupData{id="monkey13", value="old monkey from china" }); data.add(new LookupData{id="seacreature5", value="sea monkey" }); data.add(new LookupData{id="animal4", value="rhino" }); data.add(new LookupData{id="mamal1", value="some mamal creature" }); //what linq query will iterate over the document and set the values from the values //found in the list? var answer = from x in HtmlDocAsAXelement where x.Attributes() .Any(a=> data.AsEnumerable().Where(f=> f.Name == a.Name) ); //somehow I should use .SetValue(a.value)??? SaveTheNewXElement(answer ); //all other original data must stay in tact... }
