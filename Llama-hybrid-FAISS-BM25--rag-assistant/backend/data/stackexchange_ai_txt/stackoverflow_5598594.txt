Why doesn't LoadFromStream show anything after TIdHTTP.Get?

I just began having problems with Indy. For some weird reason, even this very basic procedure doesn't work: procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); var ID: TIdHTTP; ms: TMemoryStream; begin ID:=TIdHTTP.Create(); ms:=TMemoryStream.Create; ID.HandleRedirects:=true; ID.Get('http://www.google.com',ms); Memo1.Lines.LoadFromStream(ms); end; Nothing gets added to the Memo1. SizeOf(ms) returns 4. I even reinstalled Indy, still nothing. My project definitely worked before, but doesn't download anything from any page now. I wonder, what is the problem?
