Interpreting model

If I trained a model (say logistic regression) on train, test and validation. During interpretation which dataset (test or validation) should I base on for interpretation? If test and validation shows some difference in performance (say 10% where test is higher than validation in terms of accuracy) does it indicate signs of overfitting?
