Rails Caching Log Level

With the new caching options in Rails 2.1 i get nice entires in my log along the lines of Cached fragment hit: views/homepage (0.16549) However they are logged at the :debug level, which is the same level as the SQL output. I want to be able to disable the SQL output, and still see the cache info. How can I do this
