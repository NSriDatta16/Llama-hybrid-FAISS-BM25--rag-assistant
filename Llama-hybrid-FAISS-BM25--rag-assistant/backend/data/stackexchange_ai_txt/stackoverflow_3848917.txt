I would go for "a new record for each visit". Programming will be complicated, otherwise. You can get an estimate of how much storage you need depending on the traffic of your site. Do this, and you might decide not to worry about storage because storage is not usually an issue for modern day DBMSs. If storage is really a problem, then you need to decide (and fix) what statistics you need, beforehand. Then, you can record each visit for just a single month. At the end of each month, you summarize that month and add this summary to your existing summary which should have been compiled from the previous months' statistics.
