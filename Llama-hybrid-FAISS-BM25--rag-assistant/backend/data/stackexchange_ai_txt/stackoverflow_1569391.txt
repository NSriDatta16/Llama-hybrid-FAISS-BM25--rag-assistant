One could easily argue Spring.NET... Spring is becoming the norm in the Java side, either in addition to JavaEE/EJB or outright replacing it. Many of the concepts in Spring are very similar to JavaEE/EJB, but simply better. Spring.NET is, obviously, the .NET implementation of it. Beyond this, I couldn't suggest anything else as I haven't actively used .NET in years...
