I'm not trying to turn you off of using sqlite, but just to put down some other options. They are, direct from the Data Storage Developer doc : Shared Preferences Internal Storage External Storage Network Server I would recommend either Shared Preferences or Internal Storage for such a small amount of values. Performance wise, my understanding is you will get better performance using one of these two but I would get confirmation, I'm just repeating what I've heard at SO before. For such a small amount of values, I'm not certain that the difference is even measurable or will have any effect on your app.
