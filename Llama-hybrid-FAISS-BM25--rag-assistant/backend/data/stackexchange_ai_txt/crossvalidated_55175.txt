The three exams are different data points. Though they are clearly not independent (nor random) observations of all possible exams in your population of interest, at least for any analysis I can imagine. Others have emphasized that you may do well to include those data points in your analysis (since you already have them), as simple replicates within patient [a nested design] or including "time/visit" as an absolute (e.g. date) or relative (number of visit) variable of interest [some form of repeated-measures design], if interesting. I agree that this is the most interesting (and probable) scenario. However , it may not be necessary, pay for increased complexity, or improve your conclusions if you are only interested in between-subjects variables. Let's say that you only care for differences between males and females, or you want to explain air volume by patient age. Since you know that you can not properly characterize a patient in one blow (cause measurements result variable even for the same patient at the same moment), then you take several measures and average them. You don't care about that variation, it's just inevitable; you just want to get as close as possible to the "true" (mean) value for that patient (at/in that time). This may be the most reasonable analysis. [Check this paper for a good read about simplicity vs. complexity in statistical analyses.]
