Can we compare statistically z-scores? Isn't their mean is always zero?

Let's say I have two variables of any distribution for which the population average and variance is assumed/known/fixed for some topic (common in psychology). Using this I can calculate z-scores for both variables and easily compare them. But is it possible to perform any inference on such transformed data? Their population mean is assumed to be zero, even if sample one may be non-zero (collected all big values or all small ones). I noticed some people tested it with t-test, while others told them it's pointless, because even if they find some statistically significant difference, it's a priori known to have both zero mean and unit variance. We could only compare the shapes of their empirical cumulative distribution functions, maybe quantiles, but not means, is this correct?
