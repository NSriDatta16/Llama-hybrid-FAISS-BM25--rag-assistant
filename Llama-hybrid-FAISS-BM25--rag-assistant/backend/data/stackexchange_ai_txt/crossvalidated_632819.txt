modelling repeated measures with correlated responses within groups

I have a dataset which contains information on the average crime rate, population, average gas price and number of tesla charging stations - for different cities over different years. This is a repeated measures data. These cities belong to 5 different EU countries (ex: UK, Belgium, France, etc.). Data is aggregated at the city and year level. Ex: London 2018, London 2019, London 2020 ... Paris 2018, Paris 2019, etc. I want to make a model which looks at which factors are associated with increases in the number of tesla charging stations. For example, I have a hypothesis that increasing gas prices might lead to more people buying electric cars and therefore result in the creation of more tesla charging stations. What kind of model can I use here? Longitudinal regression for count data with mixed effects?
