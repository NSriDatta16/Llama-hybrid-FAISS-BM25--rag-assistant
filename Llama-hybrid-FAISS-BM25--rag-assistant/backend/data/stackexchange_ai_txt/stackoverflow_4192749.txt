Devexpress grid - header filter does not work if column is initially hidden

I'm using a DevExpress grid and I'm trying to get a 'Country' column to display the header filter properly: If the 'Country' column is set to Visible='true', then the header filter is displayed as it should(it shows the value option list). However, I want the 'Country' column to be initially hidden, but available in a Customization window(like in the code above). In this case, when the column is dragged outside the Customization window and into the grid and the header filter is clicked, a Javascript error is encountered: element is null element.addEventListener(eventName, func, true); Is this a known bug? Are there any workarounds?
