This was due to ignoring the case where users apply marginal tests for one-variable models. Marginal models test significances of each variable after all other variables, and if there is only one explanatory variable, this is an empty model. Empty models are just skipped, and we set the permutation model NA when we did no permutation. In addition to adonis2 , this also concerns permutational anova models for constrained ordination with only one explanatory variable. This is fixed in github version of vegan.
