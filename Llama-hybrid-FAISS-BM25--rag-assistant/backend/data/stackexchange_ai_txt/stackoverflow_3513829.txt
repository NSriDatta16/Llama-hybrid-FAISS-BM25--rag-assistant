I know very little about it but it doesn't sounds like something I would consider. Whenever I work on a an application we tend to follow some basic architectural guidelines such as layering/reusability etc. Typically I tend to get away from shortcut tools/frameworks as this one. There are a lot of "neat" tools that are available in the .NET world that have their place in certain small business/internal app space perhaps, but are not a great idea for a well designed application. For example embedding SQL into the datasource controls that can be bound directly to GridViews, etc.
