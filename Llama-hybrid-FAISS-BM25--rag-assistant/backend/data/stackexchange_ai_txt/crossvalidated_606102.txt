What do I make of all classification scores being equal to 1?

I've built an XGBoost classifier with following code: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=42) xgbc = XGBClassifier() xgbc.fit(X_train, y_train) y_pred = xgbc.predict(X_test) rep = metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred) print(rep) And I get the scores as follows. Then I performed 5 fold cross-validation: cross_val_score(xgbc, X, y, cv=5) And got the following cv scores. 1.0 1.0 0.99497487 0.98994975 0.98492462 I'm fairly new to machine learning, and I can't figure out if my model is pefroming excellently or if it has overfit.
