Difference in Difference with control - common trend interpretation

I have a question concerning the interpretation of the common trend assumption in a very specific case of diff-in-diff. I am using a panel to find the effect of a treatment (on houesehold level) on the number of years of schooling of individuals. The regression I use is $$\text{yrschl}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{treatment}_h + \beta_2 \text{after}_t + \beta_3 (\text{treatment}_h \cdot \text{after}_t) + \gamma X_{iht} + \epsilon_{iht}$$ and I cluster the standard errors at the household level. As there has been no randomization across the two groups, I use control variables as $\text{sex}_{it}$, $\text{age}_{it}$, $\text{age}^2_{it}$, $\text{mother's education}_{it}$, $\text{father's education}_{it}$ and $\text{urban/rural area}_{iht}$. My question now is how to interpret the ceteris paribus condition jointly with the common trend assumption. In particular, my doubt concerns the ceteris paribus condition related to age. How do I have to formulate the common trend assumption in this case? Is it that, IN ABSENCE OF THE TREATMENT, the change in the average number of years of schooling of the children who are, e.g. 14 years old in $t=0$ and therefore 20 years old in $t=1$ (I only have data for 6 years later) and belong to the treatment group is the same as the one of those children who were 14 in $t=0$ and 20 in $t=1$ and are untreated? Or does it rather mean that, IN ABSENCE OF THE TREATMENT, the change in the average years of schooling between treated 14 years old children in $t=0$ and treated 14 years old children in $t=1$ is the same as the one between untreated 14 years old children in $T=0$ and untreated 14 years old children in $t=1$? Does the ceteris paribus condition hold across time periods? Since I am using a balanced panel, there would be only observations for young individuals in $t=0$ and not in $t=1$ (as they got 6 years older in the meanwhile). This speaks against this second interpretation, isn't it?
