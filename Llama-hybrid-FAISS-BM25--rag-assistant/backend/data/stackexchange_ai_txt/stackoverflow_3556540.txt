problem with static variable

I have a problem with static variable. Part of the organization of my controllers is as follows: namespace MyApp.Controllers { public class DevicesController : Controller { static int some_var = 0; [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult SetValue(int temp){ some_var = temp; return RedirectToAction("DisplayValue"); } [Authorize] public ActionResult DisplayValue(){ .... return View(some_object); } } } The problem arises when multiple users simultaneously using this view. The same static variable is used by all users and change its value. How solve this?
