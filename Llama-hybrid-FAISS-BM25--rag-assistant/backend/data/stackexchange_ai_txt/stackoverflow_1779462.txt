Why not make use of the fact that your infrastructure is already talking HTTP ? So servlet A can perform an HTTP GET on a particular path to check a status (either sending back an object or checking an HTTP response code - this latter method seems a misuse of status codes, however), and PUT/POST an object if required. I note that you're running across multiple hosts, and this will work in your scenario. The objects can be serialised using standard Java, or via a representation such as XML - perhaps serialised using XStream ). That would seem to me a pretty straightforward way to leverage off the infrastructure you have.
