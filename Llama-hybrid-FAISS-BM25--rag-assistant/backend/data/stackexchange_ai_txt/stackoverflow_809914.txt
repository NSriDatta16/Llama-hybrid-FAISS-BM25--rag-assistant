Splitting a String into Smaller Parts based on Parens

Using java I am trying to develop a method using recursion to analyze a String of the form: (PART0(PART1(PART2)(PART3))) I want the method to split apart the relevant Strings. I want this method to give me the ability to perform some logic on each part of the String without the parentheses being involved in this order: PART2 PART3 PART1 PART0 Here is what my method currently looks like: private void check(String stmt) throws Exception { System.out.println(stmt); int firstIndex = 0; int lastIndex = 0; while(firstIndex !=-1){ firstIndex = stmt.indexOf('('); lastIndex = stmt.lastIndexOf(')'); check(stmt.substring(firstIndex+1,lastIndex)); } } Here is what my output is so far: (PART0(PART1(PART2)(PART3))) PART0(PART1(PART2)(PART3)) PART1(PART2)(PART3) PART2)(PART3 Basically it breaks down at this part: PART1(PART2)(PART3) Is there a more elegant way to do this?
