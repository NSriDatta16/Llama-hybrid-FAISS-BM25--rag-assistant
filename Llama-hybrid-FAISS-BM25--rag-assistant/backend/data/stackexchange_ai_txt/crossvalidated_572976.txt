Turning sleep schedule data into a statistical distribution

I have a dataset that tracks the time at which people go to sleep and when they wake up. This data is recorded daily for an entire year. So for each study participant, I have information for when they went to sleep on a given day, and when they woke up. I am trying to find outliers in these data based on sleep schedule - which participants have sleep schedules that deviate from the norm? I would like to convert the sleep hours data into a distribution, so that I can see how their sleep schedule data is extreme or normal based on the distribution I construct - sort of like getting a Z-score. However, I'm not exactly sure how to do this. My initial thought is to take the distribution of sleep start times and sleep end times for each day of the week and construct a distribution from that, but that feels inelegant. Is there a more general solution that you can help me identify that would tell me which participants have irregular sleep schedules?
