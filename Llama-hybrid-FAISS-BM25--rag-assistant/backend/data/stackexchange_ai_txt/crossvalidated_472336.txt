Does test AUC of 0.98 mean overfitting if we have highly imbalanced dataset (0.5% minority class)?

I built a Random Forest model to classify imbalanced data (0.5% for minority class.) I used grid search to hyper tune parameters. I got the test AUC of almost 0.99. The test AUC is completely out of bag. I am not sure how we can extrapolate that this signifies overfitting? I got some answer from https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/333199/random-forest-has-almost-perfect-training-auc-compared-to-other-models . But I was curious about the behavior when we have imbalanced class at our desposal.
