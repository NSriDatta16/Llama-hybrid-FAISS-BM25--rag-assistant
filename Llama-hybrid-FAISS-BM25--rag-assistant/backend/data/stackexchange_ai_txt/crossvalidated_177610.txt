Technique to linearly transform factors in a factor analysis solution in order to achieve some secondary goal, usually for better interpretability. Factor rotations are applied to standardized factor scores and to factor loadings. Rotations can be orthogonal (such as varimax) or oblique (such as oblimin); only if the factors are rotated orthogonally they remain uncorrelated. Rotations are sometimes applied to PCA solutions too. Let ${\bf R}$ be the rotation matrix applied to the factor loadings matrix ${\bf A}$: $${\bf R}_{VARIMAX} = \underset{R}{argmax} \sum_{k=1}^{q} Var[({\bf AR})_{[k]} ({\bf AR})_{[k]}]$$ This rotation maximizes the within column variances of the squared elements.
