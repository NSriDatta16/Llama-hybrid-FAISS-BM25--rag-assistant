Firstly, anamoly detection does not look to be the right approach for your use case. Approach 1: There is a python module to perform under and over sampling with various techniques here . This package includes SMOTE implementation as well. Using this package try to balance event data in your sample before running RandomForest or any other classification algorithms. Approach 2: If the above does not work well, then firth's bias reduced logistic regression approach with penalized profile likelihood based confidence intervals for parameter estimates will suit your case. You can try L1 (Lasso) regularization on logistic regression from Python scikit library. Alternatively you can try R's 'logistf' package example .
