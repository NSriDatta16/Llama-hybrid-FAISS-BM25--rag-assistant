Which hardware for Machine Learning software?

I would like to build a desktop PC with Linux and use it mainly for machine learning research and related stuff. I am aware that there are software packages that use GPU "magic stuff" to train statistical models on GPUs. However, my knowledge in hardware is very poor. I don't want to buy hardware that doesn't support machine learning software. Questions: 1- does it matter what CPU one buys? AMD, Intel? 2- does it matter what graphics card one buys? nVidia, ATI? 3- does it matter what motherboard? does it have to contain certain ports/features?
