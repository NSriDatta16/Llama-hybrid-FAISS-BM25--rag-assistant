Regression What you probably need is a Logistic Regression model. A regular linear regression model needs a continuous dependent variable to work, but a logistic regression is used to predict a binary outcome variable. String Variables The 'sting' variables will need to become dummies. A regression model can handle categorical variables with more than two categories as binary pairs. For example, the variable education with the 3 levels of high_school, college, graduate will be turned to 3 binary variables with each pointing to the representative level: high_school [1,0] where 1 represents high school graduates and 0 college and grad college [1,0] where 1 represents college graduates and 0 high school and grad graduate [1,0] where 1 represents graduate school graduates and 0 all others Make sure that the recording is 0 and 1, or else the interpretation of the coefficients will be less straightforward. When using these variables (known as Dummy variables) you must keep one out of the regression and it will be your reference category, which all other compare to (more on that in a sec). So if I am interested most in high school graduates, that will be left out of the model. The logic here is that when the rest are 0, than the reference variable will be used. If its NOT graduates and NOT college, than in MUST be high school.
