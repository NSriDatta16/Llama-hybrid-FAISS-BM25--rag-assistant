No, you can get away with a minor upgrade. See the MSDN Documentation for more information. A minor upgrade can be used to add new features and components but cannot reorganize the feature-component tree. Minor upgrades provide product differentiation without actually defining a different product. A typical minor upgrade includes all fixes in previous small updates combined into a patch. A minor upgrade is also commonly referred to as a service pack (SP) update. Basically you can update files without any problems.
