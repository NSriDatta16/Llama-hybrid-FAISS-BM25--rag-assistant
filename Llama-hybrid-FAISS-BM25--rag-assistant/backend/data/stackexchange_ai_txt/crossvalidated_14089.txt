What is the difference between "mean value" and "average"?

Wikipedia explains: For a data set, the mean is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. This definition however corresponds to what I call "average" (at least that's what I remember learning). Yet Wikipedia once more quotes: There are other statistical measures that use samples that some people confuse with averages - including 'median' and 'mode'. Now that's confusing. Are "mean value" and "average" different from one another? If so how?
