btnSubmit is Hungarian notation which I don't personally consider good for UI programming since the type of control is evident directly through its declaration or intellisense in Visual Studio. SubmitButton is better. Generally it takes a form - Purpose-TypeOfControl For example InputLabel FirstNameLabel LastNameLabel CancelButton This is a good reference: http://10rem.net/articles/net-naming-conventions-and-programming-standards---best-practices Update: Hungarian notation is also discouraged by stylecop/Fxcop. So its better to not to use entirely.
