PCA to decorrelate variables

I have 2 variables that I want to decorrelate. I was told I can use PCA to do so. I did PCA on the data and got all the parameters. Now how do I get the new set of transformed data that no longer correlates with the second variable? I want to use this set for further analysis. thanks,
