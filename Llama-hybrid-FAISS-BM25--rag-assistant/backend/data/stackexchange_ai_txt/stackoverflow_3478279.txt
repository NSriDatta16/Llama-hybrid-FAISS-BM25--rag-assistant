If you're doing pure TDD, there's less value to code coverage because as you say, you only write code from tests so you should be at around 100% anyway. but then, it's probably pretty rare (and at times not possible) to be doing it so purely. if you aren't doing pure TDD, 100% is a pretty unrealistic target anyway. I usually try to go for Roy Osherove's method and only test things with logic (e.g. not straight getters/setter or pass-throughs). But then, higher is always better, and it can be tempting to put a couple more tests in there to increase that coverage..!
