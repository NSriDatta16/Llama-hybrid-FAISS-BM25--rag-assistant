Have the common code accept a delegate which will be invoked if the bad condition arises (probably a function which returns false). Then: if (SomethingBadHappened) return ReportSomethingBad(new ImNotFeelingWellException("I'm not feeling too well...")); The "TryDoingSomething" version of the routine (which should return False rather than throwing an exception) should invoke the common version with a delegate that does nothing but return false. The "DoSomethingAndThrowExceptionIfItFails" version should invoke the common routine with a delegate that will throw the passed-in exception. Doing things that way will allow the exceptions to contain much more useful information than would be possible if they were simply generated by a TryDoingSomething() routine that returned false.
