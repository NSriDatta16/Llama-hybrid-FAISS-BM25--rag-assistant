Is the density of the unnormalised posterior distribution the same as the density for normalised posterior?

The posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood times the prior distribution $p(\theta|D) \propto p(D|\theta)p(\theta)$ . Computing $p(D|\theta)p(\theta)$ would give the un-normalised posterior distribution and the normalising constant gives rise to a valid probability distribution of 1. However, the normalising constant is just a scaling factor for the height of the distribution and it does not in any way affect the density of the distribution because the height of the posterior are all scaled proportionately. What is the purpose of techniques like MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distribution ?
