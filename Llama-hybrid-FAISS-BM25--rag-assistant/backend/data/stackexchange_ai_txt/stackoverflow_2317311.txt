How to print webpages in vb.net

I currently have this code use for printing a table in mysql database , but there's a problem, the print button is also shown when I print the table. Do you know of any alternative or even a vb.net code that will print what is currently on the web browser in vb.net(the one being dragged from the toolbox used to view web pages or php files). ST. CATHERINE HOSPITAL "; echo " CENTRAL EAST BANGAR LA UNION "; echo " HospNum RoomNum LastName FirstName MidName Address TelNum Nurse "; while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { echo " "; echo " " . $row['HOSPNUM'] . " "; echo " " . $row['ROOMNUM'] . " "; echo " " . $row['LASTNAME'] . " "; echo " " . $row['FIRSTNAME'] . " "; echo " " . $row['MIDNAME'] . " "; echo " " . $row['ADDRESS'] . " "; echo " " . $row['TELNUM'] . " "; echo " " . $row['NURSE'] . " "; echo " "; } echo " "; mysql_close($con); ?>
