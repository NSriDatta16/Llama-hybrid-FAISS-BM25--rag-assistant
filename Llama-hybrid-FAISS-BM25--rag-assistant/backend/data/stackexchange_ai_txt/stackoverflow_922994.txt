Error Installing App on ipod/iphone

I am a registered iPhone developer and I am getting the following error: Your mobile device has encountered an unexpected error (0xE8000001) Try disconnecting and powering off the device; then power the device on and reconnect it. My System Specifications: PowerPC G5 Mac OSx - 10.5.6 iPhone os - 2.2.1 I am getting this error whenever I click 'Build&Go' from XCode, which I am trying to install on my iPodTouch. I gave a proper AppId as in info.plist(Bundle identifier) , which is the same as configured in the iPhone program portal. In XCode -> organizer -> Console the following error is getting displayed: : user mobile has uid 501 : mode is 0x41e8.
