Initial vector $h$ in Bayesian stochastic volatility models (Jacquier, Polson and Rossi, 1994)

I was going through the paper Jacquier, Polson and Rossi (1994): Bayesian Analysis of Stochastic Volatility Models. While the model seems straight forward to implement. I'm not able to find how the initial vector for $h$ is determined. While the use of regression in order to get $p(w|\mathbf{h},\mathbf{y})$ is clear and the iteration component of $p(h_{t}|h_{t+1},h_{t-1},w,\mathbf{y})$ is also clear, I'm lost when it comes to finding out the initial vector $h^{(0)}_t$ .
