How to form a Precision-Recall curve when I only have one value for P-R?

I have a data mining assignment where I make a content-based image retrieval system. I have 20 images of 5 animals. So in total 100 images. My system returns the 10 most relevant images to an input image. Now I need to evaluate the performance of my system with a Precision-Recall curve. However, I do not understand the concept of a Precision-Recall curve. Let's say my system returns 10 images for a gorilla image, but only 4 of them are gorillas. The other 6 images returned are other animals'. Thus, precision is 4/10 = 0.4 (relevants returned) / (all returned) recall is 4/20 = 0.2 (relevants returned) / (all relevants) So I only have a point, , not a curve. How do I have a curve (i.e., a set of points)? Should I change the number of images returned (this is fixed at 10 in my case)?
