Generally, develop on what you'll deploy on. If you need to run your code on e.g. RHEL, it might cost you a lot of time if you develop on a recent Ubuntu/Fedora machine (older Python version, different version of libpcap, initscripts not working, just to mention a few time-wasters when we went that route and were oblivious to what we needed to deploy on) If that isn't your concern, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian - or really, any recent distro with a fairly big community will do fine. (also, gcc on Centos5 isn't out of date, it works quite well - and if absolutly needed you can compile/install the current gcc release from source)
