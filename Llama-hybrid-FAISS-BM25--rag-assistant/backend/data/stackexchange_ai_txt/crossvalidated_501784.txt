Q1: It's a hyper-parameter, so there is no single answer. Values to try depend on your problem, and previous works on the literature. If none, you'll be guessing, or guiding your network to an embedding dimension. Q2: $W_zx_t$ is a vector of the same size as $h_t$ , the embedding dimension. So, the sigmoid operation is element-wise and $1-z_t$ is also a vector subtraction, where $1$ is the vector of ones of the same size as $h_t$ . Q3: After choosing the hidden state (embedding) dimension, all the matrix dimensions are already determined because you already know the dimension of $x_t$ . For example, $W_zx_t$ is a matrix multiplication, and the number of columns of $W_z$ should be equal to the dimension of $x_t$ . Also, the number of rows of $W_z$ should be equal to the dimension of $z_t$ , and thus $h_t$ , the embedding dimension. Similar logic applies to all matrices.
