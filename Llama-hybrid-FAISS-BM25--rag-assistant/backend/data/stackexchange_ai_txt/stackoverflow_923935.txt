Parsing strangely formatted files

I need to parse a file but the data is in a strange format that I'm not familar parsing. The data is always formatted like this. The field name is to the left and the data is right of the "=" and all fields are always in this order. File Data: Report 1 of 1 job_name = JOBNAME job_no = JOB99999 job_id = 6750 rprt_id = 27811 rprt_name = SOMEDATA.SOMEUSER.JOBNAME.JOB099999.0000000.? ftp_size = 999999 job_group_name = 1 clas = Z form = 9999 user_id = SOMEUSER My first instinct is to do something like this... 'New up a class created to hold the data' Dim NFOData As New NFOData 'Create counter for line numbers' Dim i As Integer = 1 Using sr As New StreamReader(filename) While Not sr.EndOfStream Dim line As String = sr.ReadLine Select Case i Case 2 NFOData.JobName = line.Substring(11) Case 3 NFOData.JobNo = line.Substring(9) Case 4 'snipped to save space' End Select i += 1 End While End Using This doesn't seem very clean or elegant to me. Is there a more elegant way to handle parsing files like this?
