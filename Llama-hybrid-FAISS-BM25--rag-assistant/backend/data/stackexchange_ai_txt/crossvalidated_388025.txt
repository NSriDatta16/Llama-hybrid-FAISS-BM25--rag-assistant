Must all supervised algorithms have (complexity) parameters?

I have noticed that all commonly used supervised algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, etc.) have some (hyper)parameters to tune (otherwise the model may underfit or overfit the data). Does it mean that all supervised algorithms must have this kind of "complexity" parameter? Or, are there any algorithms that don't have any such parameter and may adapt to any data automatically?
