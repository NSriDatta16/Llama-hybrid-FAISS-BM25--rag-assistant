Regression Algorithms in Production

I am interested in predicting if a doctor would prescribe a specific drug and have chosen Logistic Regression as a starting point. I have a few questions: Is feature selection the first step to take to choose relevant variables? Is Logistic Regression only for binary output? For each doctor, can I get probability of drug prescription (e.g. doctor 1 = 0.87, doctor 2 = 0.56)? How can my model be deployed into production? Is it a huge task?
