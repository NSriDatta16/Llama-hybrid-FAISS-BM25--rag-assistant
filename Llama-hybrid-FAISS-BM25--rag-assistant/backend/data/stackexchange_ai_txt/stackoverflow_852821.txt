Subversion issue after cvs2svn

I am using eclipse / subclipse for development. I also have the TortoiseSVN client. I am trying to move a CVS repository. The old CVS repository had a single project. We want to reogranize as several of the projects have their own development streams, and should be managed separately. I ran the standard full move of the repository using cvs2svn, and had no issues. I want to restructure the projects in the subversion repository, so after the cvs2svn, I attempted to do an svn move and did the restructuring. I was able to successfully do the move, again no issues. I check out the project in eclipse, and then choose a file in one of the moved projects. It seemingly doesn't matter which project. If I do an Update Version in eclipse, and choose a version in the file's history to update to, the file is deleted from my filesystem, but the older version never comes down. The file is simply gone. I have the same issue using TortoiseSVN, so I assume that it is not a subclipse issue. The interesting thing is that if I do an svn move of a project back to its original location where it was initially converted to, and follow the same steps, I don't have any issues, the Update Version works as expected. So, to my question(s): Did I do something wrong during the cvs2svn move that would preclude me from successfully reorganizing my subversion repository? Is there a better way to do what I am trying to do?
