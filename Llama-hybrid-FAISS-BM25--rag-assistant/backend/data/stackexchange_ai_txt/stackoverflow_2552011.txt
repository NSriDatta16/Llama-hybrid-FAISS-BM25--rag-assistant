Look up Monkey Patching . It's not most elegant technique, but sometimes it's the only option. In your case you can substitute your own function for locale.setlocale() which will do whatever you want. It would look something like that: import locale original_setlocale = locale.setlocale def my_setlocale(category, locale=None): # Do anything you want # optionally call original function original_setlocale(category, locale)
