You could do this pretty easily with custom forms. Just derive from the "ipm.appointment" appointment form and add you fields and logic to validate and save those fields as user properties on the meeting item You can then attach to exchange using RDO or OOM to call back the properties off the meeting items. you can then publish the form to you whole organisation if you want and over righ the default with soem reg key changes. or you can do as above and create yourself an addin using vsto.
