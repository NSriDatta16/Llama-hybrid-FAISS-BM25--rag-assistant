Can you compare probabilities of an epidemic by knowing R0 values?

In comparing two diseases with different basic reproduction numbers (R0), is it possible to use the R0 values to calculate the probability of an epidemic spread through a population? For example, if you compare ebola (R0 ~ 2) to measles (R0 ~ 18), can you say that measles in 9 times more likely to develop into an epidemic? Or 9^2? Or 10^9? Or something more complicated? Or is there no closed-form function way to make that comparison? Is this even a sensible comparison to make? If this is not the right Stack Overflow site to post this to, could you please point me in the right direction? Thanks! CONTEXT I am much more afraid of an unvaccinated measles epidemic than an ebola epidemic, and I'm trying to explain why to some friends - inspired by this graphic that appeared in today's Guardian blog: http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases I'm pretty good at stats (mostly self-taught-on-the-job), but my epidemiology knowledge consists of Bio 101 in college, reading And The Band Played On , and briefly dating a med student studying it. If you're not familiar with R0, it's a dimensionless measure that measures how many people will become infected, on average, from a single case.* As always, Wikipedia has a good introduction with references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number ( * ) Note: In writing that, it occurs to me that it that definition probably implies that it's exponential, so a disease with R0 = 18 should be on the order of (constant)*(10^9) times more likely to spread?
