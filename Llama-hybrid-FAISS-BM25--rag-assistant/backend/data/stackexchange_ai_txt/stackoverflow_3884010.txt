Some date fields are varchar(20) This one of the things that will always get you in trouble in the future, now you can have invalid dates and then you can't do normal date arithmetic. Some look-up ID foreign keys are varchar(100), even though the actual look-up table primary key is an int This is bad because you will get conversions when you join and this will make it slower Store decimals as decimals...sooner or later you will get bad data in there and then it will be a classic case of GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) Also using nvarchar to store numbers is insane, you just doubled the storage needed to store those numbers, this will then store less rows per page and you will need more IO to bring back the same number of rows if had used regular varchars or integers
