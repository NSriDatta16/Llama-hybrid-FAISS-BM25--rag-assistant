What errors/exceptions do I need to handle with urllib2.Request / urlopen?

I have the following code to do a postback to a remote URL: request = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com', postBackData, { 'User-Agent' : 'My User Agent' }) try: response = urllib2.urlopen(request) except urllib2.HTTPError, e: checksLogger.error('HTTPError = ' + str(e.code)) except urllib2.URLError, e: checksLogger.error('URLError = ' + str(e.reason)) except httplib.HTTPException, e: checksLogger.error('HTTPException') The postBackData is created using a dictionary encoded using urllib.urlencode. checksLogger is a logger using logging . I have had a problem where this code runs when the remote server is down and the code exits (this is on customer servers so I don't know what the exit stack dump / error is at this time). I'm assuming this is because there is an exception and/or error that is not being handled. So are there any other exceptions that might be triggered that I'm not handling above?
