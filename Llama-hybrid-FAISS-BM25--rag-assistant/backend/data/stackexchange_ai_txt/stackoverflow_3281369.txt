I don't understand why you need the string without the terminating character so badly. Storage/performance wise, it doesn't make it an issue. You can just work knowing there's a null character at the end you don't need for your application, if you want to use that instantiation. Or you could maybe do something like: char reshte[]="sample strin"; reshte[strlen(reshte)]='g';
