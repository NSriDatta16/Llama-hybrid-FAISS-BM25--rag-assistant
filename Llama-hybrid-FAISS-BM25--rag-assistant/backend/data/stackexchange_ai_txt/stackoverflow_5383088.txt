Have you considered using a class to name them all as opposed to explicit ids? Text paragraph 1 Text paragraph 2 Text paragraph 3 so then you would be able to use a single click event for all of them? $(".x a").click() { //Use $(this) to refer to the clicked item. alert($(this).parents().attr("id")); });
