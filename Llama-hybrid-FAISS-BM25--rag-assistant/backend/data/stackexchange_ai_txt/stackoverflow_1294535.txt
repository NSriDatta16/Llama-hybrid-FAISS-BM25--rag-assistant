Embedding User Controls a bad idea?

I am embedding usercontrols in a panel and using DevExpress Navigator control to navigate from one to the other. What I am concered about is any implications to this method? I would give examples of what I am concerned about but then I wouldn't need to ask this question... I have a primary form, ShellForm that has a docked Navigator Control on the left and a docked Panel Control for the rest. I then dock a User Control , say ucSearchPage , in the Panel when the link is clicked. public partial class ShellForm : XtraForm { private ucSearch searchPage = new ucSearch(); private ucEnrollments enrollmentPage = new ucEnrollments(); private ucGeneral generalInfoPage = new ucGeneral(); private ucContacts contactPage = new ucContacts(); public ShellForm() { InitializeComponent(); } private void ShellForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { this.pnlShellHost.DockControl(this.searchPage); } private void navSearch_LinkClicked(object sender, DevExpress.XtraNavBar.NavBarLinkEventArgs e) { this.pnlShellHost.DockControl(this.searchPage); } private void navEnrollment_LinkClicked(object sender, DevExpress.XtraNavBar.NavBarLinkEventArgs e) { this.pnlShellHost.DockControl(this.enrollmentPage); } The code for DockControl() is as follows --> public static void DockControl(this Control control, UserControl userControl) { userControl.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; control.Controls.Clear(); control.Controls.Add(userControl); } Are there any implications to this approach? Is it just plan stupid? I am one of those programmers that had to learn to run before walking so I have a tendency to fall flat on my face! There will be about 30 User Controls in all. Any insight is welcomed and appreciated!
