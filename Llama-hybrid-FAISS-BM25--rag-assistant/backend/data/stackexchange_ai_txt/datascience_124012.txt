Pre-trained text classifier to check whether a document is business or personal

I need a pre-trained classifier that checks if a document is either a business or personal document. I don't have time to train one myself so if anyone knows of a classifier that is pre-trained and they think it's good, please let me know. Here is an example of a document it would have to classify: # Relationship Notes With Alex (Partner) Date Ideas [ ] Plan a romantic weekend getaway to the mountains. Alex loves the mountains. It's been a while since our last escape to nature. ️❤️ [ ] Surprise Alex with tickets to his favorite band's concert. Found out they're coming to town next month. It'll be a great surprise! [ ] Cook a special dinner together and have a movie night at home. Sometimes, the simplest evenings are the most memorable. ️ [ ] Organize a picnic in the park for a relaxing day outdoors. We used to do this a lot when we started dating. Time to bring back those moments. ☀️ [ ] Write heartfelt love letters to each other on our anniversary. It's our 5th anniversary next week. A handwritten letter can express so much. Vacation Plans [ ] Research and book our next international adventure. Thinking about Greece or Costa Rica. We both need a break from work. ✈️️ [ ] Discuss potential travel destinations for our summer vacation. We have conflicting ideas. Need to sit down and find a destination that excites both of us. ️ [ ] Create a shared calendar to coordinate our schedules better. Our schedules have been chaotic lately. A shared calendar might help us plan quality time together. ️❤️
