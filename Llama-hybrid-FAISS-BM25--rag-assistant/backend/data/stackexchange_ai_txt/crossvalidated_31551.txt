I think the context is a MCMC algorithm, because this terminology is rather standard in such a context. The goal is to simulate a multivariate distribution, that is, the distribution of a random vector $(\theta_1, \ldots,\theta_p)$. The full conditional distribution of $\theta_1$ is then nothing but the conditional distribution of $\theta_1$ given all other variables.
