You could have calculated simple mean and variance and standard error as if it would just be one big stream, but calculating separately (as a weighted avg) will reduce the variance. This is a variance reduction technique that called stratified sampling. Let's mark $n_i$ - number of numbers is stream $i$ $n$ - the total number of numbers from all stream $p_i - \frac{n_i}{n}$ - the proportion of stream $i$ $\mu_i$ - the simple average of each stream $\sigma_i$ - the standard deviation of each stream $Y$ - the new variable for which we want to compute expectation and variance Then the expectation (the weighted average) will be: $E(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i \mu_i$ The variance will be: $Var(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i^2 \sigma_i^2 $ $\sigma(Y) = \sqrt{(Var(Y))}$ $stdError(Y) = \frac{\sigma(Y)}{\sqrt(n)}$
