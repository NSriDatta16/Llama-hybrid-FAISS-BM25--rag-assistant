What open source document-oriented database system is most mature for Windows usage?

After using relational databases as back-end storage all my Windows programming life (currently .NET), I want to experiment with a document-oriented database by this Wikipedia definition ; it can be standalone or layered over an existing non-commercial database system. What open source document-oriented database solution would you recommend from your own Windows programming experience and why? (Reason for open-source is to keep it on the cheap, also because open source is often darn good and on the leading edge.) A nice to have would be a .NET provider to connect with. Ultimately the chosen system might be rolled into a real solution if everything works out well. Admittedly this is somewhat subjective and potentially argumentative so keep it real folks and I'll do the same - also your answers will be invaluable to others looking into document-oriented databases for the first time on Windows. I'm sure the overall value of your answers will outweigh any biases. Thanks.
