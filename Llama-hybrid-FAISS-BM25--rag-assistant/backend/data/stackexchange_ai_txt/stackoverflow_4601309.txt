AccessDenied.aspx / List does not exist on list that user has access to

I am getting this error: List does not exist The page you selected contains a list that does not exist. It may have been deleted by another user. at Microsoft.SharePoint.Library.SPRequestInternalClass.GetListsWithCallback... Unfortunately it's not the unpublished masterpage manifestation of the error - the list GUID in the query string leads to one of several lists in the root web that are used to display user settings in controls on the master page. The list is being accessed using the following code: _RootWeb = SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb; storageList = _RootWeb.GetList(_RootWeb.Url + "/Lists/" + LocalStrings.TimeZoneStorageList.ListName); SPListItemCollection result = list.GetItems(query); SPListItem StorageItem = result[0]; xmlDoc.LoadXml(StorageItem[LocalStrings.TimeZoneStorageList.Fields.UserXML] .ToString()); Is there anything that could cause that code to throw an AccessDeniedException while the user is able to access the list through the UI? Alternatively, is it possible for SharePoint to report a list as the source of the error when the permissions issue is actually somewhere else entirely?
