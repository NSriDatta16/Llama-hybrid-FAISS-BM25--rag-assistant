The maximum likelihood estimate of $p$ is $\hat {p}$. The variance of the average is $p(1-p)/n$. Its MLE is $\hat {p} (1-\hat{p})/n$. Therefore the MLE of its standard error is $\sqrt{\hat {p} (1-\hat{p})/n}$. That is, the estimate with $n$ is maximum likelihood because functions of MLEs are (usually) themselves also MLEs.
