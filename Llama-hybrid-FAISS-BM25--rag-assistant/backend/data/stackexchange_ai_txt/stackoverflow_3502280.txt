How to add/subtract to value rather than just be that value

Using the Openframeworks library in C++, I have the radius of a glow (max_distance) that is determined by the stretch of the mouse dragging across the screen (mouseDragX). It works fine. But rather than every time I resize it (by dragging the mouse), I want it not to start at 0 and follow the mouse drag directly. max_distance = mouseDragX/2; But rather, if I have already dragged the mouse to the right to say 200 on a previous drag, that the next time I drag the mouse, and go into the opposite direction (negative numbers) that the value of max_distance decreases by that amount , instead of just being that amount. I thought it would be max_distance += mouseDragX/2; but that seems to kill it altogether Can you help me? #include "testApp.h" //-------------------------------------------------------------- void testApp::setup(){ ofSetWindowShape(700,700); max_distance = 700; // ofDist didn't work(?) // ofDist(0,0,700,700); ofEnableSmoothing(); ofEnableAlphaBlending(); } //-------------------------------------------------------------- void testApp::update(){ max_distance = mouseDragX/2; if (max_distance Thank you so much.
