Which is better? DataTable.Select() or Linq for filtering objects?

I'm storing a collection of objects of custom class type. I've given the type below. public class AnonymousClient { private string ipAddress, city, country, category; private Guid id; } I may have to get the objects filtered based on city, country, category etc. I'm able to think of two ways - Storing it in a dictionary Dictionary and using Linq to filter the objects. Storing it in a DataTable with multiple columns for the members and using DataTable.Select() to filter the records. I guess both of them loop internally. Which one is faster and elegant? Any insights?
