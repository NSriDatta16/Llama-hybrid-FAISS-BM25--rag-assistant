While I 100% agree with Peter Flom's answer (+1), I personally think you should drop the null hypothesis testing approach for this project. This advice is notwithstanding what you can convince your editor is reasonable. Instead, I would develop a Bayesian mixed effects model. With a Bayesian analysis you will/should spend substantial amounts of time considering your choice of prior and likelihood, but there are no hard constraints on sample size per se . However, with small sample size you should expect that with weak priors you will have large standard errors. That's fine provided that you are okay with being imprecise if that is all your background knowledge (encoded into priors) and the data can support. If you have insufficient clarity about what I just suggested due to Bayesian inference being unfamiliar to you, I recommend watching Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking lectures and then reading Gelman et al 2020 . (I am not retired and sometimes take small modelling projects on the side. I can be found if you look hard enough.)
