Two things: 1) You should not assign a specific $i$ value to a regression coefficient. The same estimated coefficient applies to all $i$ 's, so you should write it as $\beta_1$ , not $\beta_i$ . 2) An easier to read interpretation would be: "If a firm's cost increases by 1 unit between two consecutive periods, the firm's revenue is expected to increase by $\beta_1$ units, on average." If the sign of the estimated $\beta_1$ is negative, you can change "increase" to "decrease".
