Large n small p regression - Machine Learning

In the area of machine learning, most of the algorithms are intended for small n large p problems. I am familiar with the statistical techniques of PCA, etc but was wondering what algorithms are available in the machine learning area for similar analysis work. The aim is to determine the effect of a limited number of predictor variables on the outcome using robust methods such as pca in the ML domain, Thanks in advance.
