Example Transforming A time series using the Backshift operator

I am trying to understand the idea of differencing (using the Backshift operator ): Let's look at this times series: $$X_t = at^2+bt+c+Y_{t-1}$$ with $Y_t$ being some (mean-zero) white noise process. How do I exactly the define the Backshift operator, and can I somehow transform this series into some stationary series? By the Backshift operator $B$ I mean the solution to the equation: $$BX_t=X_{t-1}$$ The way I see it: the only way a transformation is stationary is if $B$ doesnt depend on $t$, but how is that possible?
