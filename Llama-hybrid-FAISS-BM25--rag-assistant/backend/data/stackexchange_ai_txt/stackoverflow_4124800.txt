I found a solution - the problem was that I was attempting to read local files(ie, on my computer), which don't have a domain name associated with them (apparently local ip doesn't count in this instance). To protect the security of interests of people with online content, the W3C + browsers have made it so that getImageData() doesn't work on files stored outside of the server that's home to the javascript. Unfortunately, it treats local files as domainless, and so the security restrictions apply, apparently. I'm looking around for ways to overcome this problem (looking at appCache and websql in HTML5 at the moment, may or may not bear fruit). I'd prefer for the user of my web app not to have to upload the material they're working with (so they can work offline, and for security reasons). Any suggestions welcome!
