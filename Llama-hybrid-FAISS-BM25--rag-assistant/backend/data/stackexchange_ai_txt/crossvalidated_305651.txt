How to provide CI for prediction for mixed model? lsmeans vs predictInterval

I have a linear mixed model, say: $$y \approx x_1 + \cdots + x_n + (1\,|\ \text{person})$$ I would like to have a Confidence interval for the prediction, so I would like to say: if $x_1=3\ $ and $\ x_2=6$ , etc, and ignoring the random effect, then $y$ is probably between 10 and 12. I have found 2 ways to do this: with lsmeans with predictInterval in merTools. The 2nd method gives me a much wider CI than the first. My question is: Why is this? Thank you for your attention. Toy code example: library(lsmeans) library(lme4) # create some data N I do get a warning message with predictInterval, but I do not get that in my real code, and I doubt it is relevant.
