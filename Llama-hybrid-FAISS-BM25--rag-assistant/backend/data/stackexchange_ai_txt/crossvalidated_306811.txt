What regression do I use for a Likert item response?

I am trying to analyse how people respond to the question: "It is all right for a couple to live together without intending to get married?" The data is in the form of a Likert scale. I want to analyse if age, gender and religious status affect this. What form of regression should I use - multinomial logistic regression or ordered logistic regression?
