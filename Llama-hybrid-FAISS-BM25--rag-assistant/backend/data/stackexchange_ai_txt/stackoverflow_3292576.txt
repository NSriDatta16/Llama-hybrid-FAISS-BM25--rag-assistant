Third-party Ribbon component vs. Microsoft Ribbon UI License?

I'm just creating a multiplatform e-mail client in Java, and I want to use Ribbon UI using Flamingo Ribbon Component (you can see WebStart demo here: https://substance-flamingo.dev.java.net/webstart/testRibbon.jnlp ). However, I noticed that Microsoft have some license on their Ribbon UI. Can anybody please tell me if is it 'legal' to use this third-party components? I just want to avoid the scenario that I'll finish the application, and Microsoft say "sorry, but you're violating our license" and I'll have to rewrite it without Ribbon. Thanks for your tips and excuse my mistakes in English, I'm not native ;-) Vaclav Svejcar
