Some unsorted food for thought: Canvas is just a bitmap. It is faster when rendering large numbers of objects. SVG on the other hand must maintain references to each object that it renders and slows down signifigantly with a ton of objects. ...but those references mean that some of the footwork of dealing with the things you draw is done for you. And SVG is faster when rendering really really large objects. SVG has seen poorer adoption than Canvas has, though. But browsers have both now so I don't see much worry there I suppose. A game would probably be faster in Canvas. A huge map program would probably be faster in SVG. Some browser optimization for Canvas is here. Last week was Chrome's 7.0 hardware acceleration debut. IE9 preview and Opera already have hardware accel too (don't recall FF). Canvas is still very much a living spec (MeasureText returns a width but no height!), but I've loved working with it so far.
