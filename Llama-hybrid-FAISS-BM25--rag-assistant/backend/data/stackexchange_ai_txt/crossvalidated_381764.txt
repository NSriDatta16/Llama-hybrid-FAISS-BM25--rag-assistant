Stationarize count based time series data

I have a count based time series sequence with lot of 0s. Usually to achieve stationarity we can do the following transform: 1. Differencing (Single, Double or seasonal) 2. Log When I try differencing, I get negative values which is not applicable in this case. So I am trying to use log(value +1 ). Since log(0) is inf transformation. But I read some posts which is against log transformation of count based data. Any suggestions to what are the transformations that I could consider in this case to achieve stationarity.
