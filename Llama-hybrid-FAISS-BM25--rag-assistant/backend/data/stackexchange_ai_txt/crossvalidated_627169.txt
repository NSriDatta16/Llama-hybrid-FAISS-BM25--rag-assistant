BMA formula with BIC

I am interested in using Bayesian modele averaging as a selection creteria (BMA) vs AIC. I read that BMA is widely implemented in clustering models. Suppose that we need to fit M models to a data and select the best among them using BMA. Suppose that BIC for each model is calculated. Then, I read that some author use BIC as weight for BMA. However, instead of using BIC directly, they substract maximum or minimum BIC from each BIC_M of each fitted model. As here Use BIC or AIC as approximation for Bayesian Model Averaging Suppose we have three fitted models. Suppose the BICs values as follows: BIC_1 = -122 BIC_2 = - 130 BIC_3 = - 230 So, if we substract the lowest value which is BIC_3, then, BIC_ - BIC_3 = 0. Is that Ok?. I mean if we substract the lowest BIC from itself we will have a zero. Any help, please?
