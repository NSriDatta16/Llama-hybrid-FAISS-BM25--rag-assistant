Time series/Regression question.

I am trying to figure out what variables most significantly affect the download rate of my app. Right now I have a data frame with a column for dates, downloads per day, payouts per day, and a few more other variables that correspond to the date column. This may be impossible but I'm looking for some way to be able to predict how many downloads I will have based on the values of the factors I have.
