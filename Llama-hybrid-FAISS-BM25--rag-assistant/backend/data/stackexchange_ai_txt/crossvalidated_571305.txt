What does it mean for a binomial distribution to be normalized over something?

This is my first post on cross validated (and my first attempt at statistics!) so please let me know if I haven't been clear enough with my question. So I was learning about Bayesian Parameter Estimation, when I came across this for likelihood: This was immediately followed by the statement "The binomial distribution is normalized over . Later, we will need to normalize over ." I looked up on the internet to see what 'normalization' is and apparently it means shifting the distribution so that are under it becomes 1. What I didn't get, however, is what it means to 'normalize over some value'. Any insight is appreciated.
