In justified text, the last line of text in a paragraph is not expanded to fill the whole width. So to make the inline images spread out you need enough content to pull the paragraph out to two or more lines, eg.: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (or some other equally-ugly but less-visible version involving &nbsp; .) This is a bit of a nasty hack.
