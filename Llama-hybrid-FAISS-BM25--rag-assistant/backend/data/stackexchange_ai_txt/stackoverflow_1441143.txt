How to set the line where a QToolBar is displayed?

I would like to ask if anyone knows how to display 2 QToolBars in two lines, one on top of the other? I found the class QStyleOptionToolBar, but I don't know how to use it... It is easy to drag one toolbar with the mouse to be placed below the other, so I think there must be a way how this can be done from the source code as well... Any hint would be appreciated! Claus
