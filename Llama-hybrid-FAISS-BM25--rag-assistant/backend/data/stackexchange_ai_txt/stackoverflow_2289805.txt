The script is executed before the desired element exists. Additionally, I don't think, p has an onload -Event. Windows, frames and images, yes, but paragraphs? You should use or window.onload=function(){ â€¦ } or a library function, if you use a library. Example: index.html This page will not work with JavaScript disabled. scripts/eventInit.js window.onload=function(){ alert('JS is working!');} Edit: Okay, I am very sure, p makes no use of an onload event handler. And it's no wonder, you don't need it. If you want to execute JS code just after the paragraph is finished, do this: /* stuff */
