Are there any good (functional) neural network simulators for Windows?

I've tried using SNNS but only on a Linux machine, and it's fairly awful. Since my home machine is Windows 7, I was hoping there'd be a decent neural network simulator for Windows. SNNS does have a Java version, but it's equally as if not more awful to use. Any suggestions?
