Actually, it shouldn't really matter what classification algorithm you use. The whole point of machine learning is that the algorithm learns how to combine the available features to achieve the desired result. If one feature has the ability to 'turn the others off,' the algorithm will learn that (It'll also learn lots of things that you probably aren't aware of). So in short, no, modifying the data this way probably won't affect classification performance. Not needing to incorporate these kinds of things into the training set is part of what makes machine learning so cool!
