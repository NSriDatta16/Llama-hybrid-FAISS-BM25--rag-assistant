What you're describing is not possible with OpenGL. That said, considering that you're new to OpenGL, maybe what you're describing is not exactly what you're after ? Blending is the step that happens once you decided what color your current fragment (usually coming from a triangle) is supposed to have. That color needs to be merged with the previous color in the frame-buffer. Are you sure that's what you're after ?
