The typical way to handle this is with an ajax request. Instead of a link, you put a javascript handler that calls a view, wich updates the db, and returns a json / xml object with the new rating for the item. Then another javascript handle receives that response and updates the rating number on the screen, without a page reload. Ideally, you'll keep both versions: plain html (the one you currently have) and the ajax one. The ajax one can be attach to the element after page load, so if javascript is not available, you'll still have a working site. Then, regarding organization, you can have an "ajax" parameter on your view. The view should update the db accordingly, and if it's an ajax call, return the json / xml response, otherwise, return the new page. That way you can keep the logic (fetching the object, updating the db) on one place.
