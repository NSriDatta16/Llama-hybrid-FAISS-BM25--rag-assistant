Best way to let a remote bot (agent) and a web panel communicate (PHP)

Im in the process of writing a web panel that will manage game servers on local and remote servers. The remote servers will have a simple PHP bot on them that carries out the instructions given to it by the web panel. My question is, what is the best way (taking into consideration performance and reponsiveness) to get the instructions from the web panel to the agents? EG: Sockets extension? A memory table in the database called queue that the agent periodicly queries? Please discuss all options, even if they may not seem better than alternatives :3
