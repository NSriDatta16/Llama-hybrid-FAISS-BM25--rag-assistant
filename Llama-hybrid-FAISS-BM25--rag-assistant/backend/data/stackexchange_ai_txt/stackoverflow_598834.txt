A few simple tricks: Firstly, limit yourself to exactly one CSS and one Javascript file. No more. If you have multiple compact them into one (each). Ideally, your Javascript should also be minified. I've been using JSMin for this lately. There are some more advanced techniques to optimize this further. You set the expires header to far in the future so the browser doesn't download it as often. To push changes you need to change the link to the css/js file though. You can do this with Apache mod_rewrite and a small PHP script. More on this in What is an elegant way to force browsers to reload cached CSS/JS files? You can also use the expires trick on images. Secondly, gzip your constent. Typically all you have to do for this in PHP is start all your scripts wiht: ob_start('ob_gzhandler'); This turns on output buffering (good idea anyway) and if the browser says that it supports gzip encoding, your script will be gzipped before sending it to the client.
