Doesn't ConvNets allow parameters to be shared, detecting the similar features of different images? Your final statement holds true for convolutional layers which are in early layers, but final layers detect more abstract features, e.g. a full object. Consequently, the last layers of a CNN that is trained with images of flowers will not be helpful for a dataset that is full of cars. Their high-level features differ. In transfer learning, there are different scenarios depending on the size of the datasets and the similarity of the datasets. By the way, the last layers in conv nets see a wider range, and first layers access to limited regions simultaneously.
