is this kind of data (sparse and mix of binary and float features) suitable/compatible with LSTMs? I don't see any reason why that kind of data would be not suitable with LSTM. I think you can just add some default values(just symbols different from other values) for those days when no event appears. What would be the right strategy to solve this kind of problem ? I thought you would train it like a labelling task or language model task. If you obtain the latter. You can try adding a transformer before the RNN to better encode the interrelations of the data in the day and the sequence relation between continuous days. If you try the former maybe you can employ the CRF. First try to train the model with some good data and if data are limited you can try semi-supervised learning.
