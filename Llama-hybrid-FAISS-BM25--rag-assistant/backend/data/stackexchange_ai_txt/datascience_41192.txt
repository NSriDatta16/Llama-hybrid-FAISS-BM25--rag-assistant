Grouping domain specific words/phrases with same meaning

I am looking at NLP methods to group together words/phrases which could have the same meaning. For example, in the sentence 'the table is broken' broken could be replaced by the following words/phrases and the sentence would still have the same meaning. Broken: damaged, ruined, busted, unfit for purpose, missing a leg I want to do this for texts that contain domain specific and colloquial jargon so existing NLP solutions may not be suitable? My intention is to do this as a bridging step between named entity extraction and named entity linking.
