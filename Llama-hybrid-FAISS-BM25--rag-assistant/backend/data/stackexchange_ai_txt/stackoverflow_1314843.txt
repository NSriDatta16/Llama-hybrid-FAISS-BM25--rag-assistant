After you call htmlentities() , call nl2br() . The web browser ignores plain newline characters so you need to convert them to elements to make them show up. nl2br â€” Inserts HTML line breaks before all newlines in a string Description string nl2br ( string $string [, bool $is_xhtml= true ] ) Returns string with or inserted before all newlines. For example: echo nl2br(htmlentities($input)); To only show double newlines and ignore single ones, you could instead use a more sophisticated string replacement function, preg_replace : echo preg_replace('/\n\s*\n/', " \n \n", htmlentities($input)); Here '/\n\s*\n/' matches a newline, followed by any amount of whitespace, followed by another newline. It replaces any such substring with two elements. Single newlines are ignored. It's also nice because it'll ignore extraneous spaces and tabs that are invisible, such as if a user typed this: This is a paragraph. \n It is pretty short. \n \n Here's another paragraph. \n It too is short.
