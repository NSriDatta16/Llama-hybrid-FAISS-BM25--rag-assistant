Polling is used to detect scheduled reports and subscriptions. SQL Agent runs jobs (created by the subscription page) that populates tables that are polled every 10 secs by Rpt Svcs (defined in .config files, default is 10 IIRC). Anyway, this means that the RS box could not query the RS database to see if anything happened.
