Do logistic regression with the three variables (and possibly interactions). From the results of the regression, you can estimate the probability for any combination. SAS and other programs can do this for you for combinations that you set, or you can use the formula: $$ P = \frac {e^{b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_3 + \dots b_p X_p}}{1 + e^{b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_3 + \dots b_p X_p}}$$
