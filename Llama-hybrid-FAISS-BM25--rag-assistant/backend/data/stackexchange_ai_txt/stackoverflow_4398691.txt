Data Binding of Computed Properties in Entity Framework

I am trying to find an effective way to databind computed fields of an Entity Framework model in winforms. I am using Visual Studio 2008 and .NET framework 3.5. An example would be for EntityX, say I have columnA and columnB, and I want a computed property named sumAB. The way I have been doing this has been with partial classes: public partial class EntityX { public int sumAB { get { return this.columnA + this.columnB; } } } I then am using visual studio to add EntityX as a data source, so I can use the automatic drag and drop data binding. The issue that I am having is that the computed properties are not appearing under the Data Source fields. I am looking for a way to have the automatic databinding of computed fields. I know I could do this manually, but then I would have to also manually write all of the binding code to refresh the field when columnA or columnB are changed. I also do not have access to make this field computed on the SQL server side either. Does anyone know of any ways to accomplish this or any other similar directions to persue? Thanks! UPDATE I tested this on another machine, using Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4, and I am still receiving the same behavior. Interestingly, I can manually create a textbox and add a databinding, and it will work fine, as below: sumABTextBox.DataBindings.Add( new System.Windows.Forms.Binding("Text", EntityXBindingSource, "sumAB", true)); It also worked if I placed the property in the .edmx file, but this is not desirable, as it will be wiped any time the database is updated. Any other ideas? UPDATE 2 Still no solution... I had to use alternatives in my code to meet deadlines. I am still very interested in this if anyone finds an answer...
