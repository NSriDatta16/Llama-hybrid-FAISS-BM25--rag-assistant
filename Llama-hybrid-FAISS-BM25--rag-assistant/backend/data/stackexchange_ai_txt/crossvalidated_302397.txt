Multi-agent reinforcement learning: An introduction

I would like to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with 10X10 board and I want to have 2 agents playing against each other and learning to play from interaction. A naive approach could be taken - to simply let agents learn as if the other agent were stationary and thus part of the envidonment. However, I think this would work only if actions of the agents would not have significant influence on the environment of either of them. Please correct me if the following statement is not true: Single agent RL may not be applied in case of a game, where one agent is a part of the environment of the other and the other way around, since the transitions in MDP would not be stationary (one agents' strategy influences other agents' strategy and vice versa and as both of them are changing strategy according to their foe, the environment transitions change), which would violate the convergence properties of RL algorithms. An option would be for both agents to account for the other agents' learning. I read An Analysis of Stochastic Game Theory for Multiagent Reinforcement Learning paper and the multi-agent RL seems to be a promissing framework and quite a lot of research has been done in this area. However, I am struggling to find a comprehensive overview of MARL methods. Is there any self-contained introduction to multi-agent reinforcement learning? Something like Sutton & Barto ? If not, what are some easy-to-understand resources to start with, given that I somehow understand RL concepts in a single-agent setting? An overview of research on MARL can be found here .
