How can I analyse an annual cyclic dataset with large gaps between some readings?

I have solar panels and have been logging their output in a Google spreadsheet. The only data I collect is the following: Reading Date kWh Where kWh is the cumulative reading on the meter. I don't perform a reading every day, sometimes weeks or months can pass without me taking a reading. In total I have 144 readings stretching back to 11th May 2013, the average gap between readings is 10 days, but the max is 106. Therefore the data isn't of a very high quality. What analyses can I perform on this, principally to see whether my panels are deteriorating over time? Is my only option to calculate an average reading per day and then compare different years or is there something else I can do? I'm coming from a programming background by the way - I am far from being a statistician or a mathematician!
