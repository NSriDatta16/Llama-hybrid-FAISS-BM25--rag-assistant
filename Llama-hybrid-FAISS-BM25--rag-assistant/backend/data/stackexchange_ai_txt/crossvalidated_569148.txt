How to optimise ARIMA model results - Have p q d been selected properly

I'm having trouble interpreting my ARIMA results and would like to know what I can do to improve the model. I am working with a crime data set with 7740 entries collected over 21 years which I've structured as daily aggregates: My p,d,q values are 6, 1, and 7. p and q come from (Using First Order Differencing on data): d value of 1 comes from first order differencing rejecting null hypothesis in ADF. and my model results are: Have I understood the attainment of p, d ,q values properly? Is my data organised correctly? Are there glaring errors in my model summary that I can correct? Thanks! edit: After reducing the spe of the dataset to just 2015 - 2020 to avoid likely structural break, these are my new results: (With no differencing:)
