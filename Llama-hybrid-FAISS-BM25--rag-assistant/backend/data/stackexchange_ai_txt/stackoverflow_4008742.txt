Ruby and Python are quite similar in terms of the real CS that your brain will get out of it â€” the differences are largely cosmetic and pragmatic. Areas in which they are essentially the same: Both languages are strongly, dynamically typed. Both support many paradigms like functional, object-oriented, etc. Ruby has a little more fluff/sugar (similar to Perl), while Python believes that explicit is better than implicit. If you are interested in interpreters, frameworks, and testing, it can be worthwhile to battle the two, but from a theoretical standpoint you will learn much more from Haskell or Prolog.
