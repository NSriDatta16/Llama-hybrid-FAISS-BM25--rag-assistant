I think that by ARCH effect they mean the correlation between volatility of a time series, measured by conditional variance, and its values or innovations in the past. The letter AR stands for auto regressive, C for conditional (i.e conditional variance), and H for heteroskedasticity. So if non-constant conditional variance of x(t) has some correlation with itself/or innovation in the past, then we say there exists ARCH effect.
