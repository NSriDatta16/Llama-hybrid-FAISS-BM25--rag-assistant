C# 3.0 Func/OrderBy type inference

So odd situation that I ran into today with OrderBy: Func orderByNumber = currentClass => currentClass.SomeNumber; Then: someCollection.OrderBy(orderByNumber); This is fine, but I was going to create a method instead because it might be usable somewhere else other than an orderBy. private int ReturnNumber(SomeClass currentClass) { return currentClass.SomeNumber; } Now when I try to plug that into the OrderBy: someCollection.OrderBy(ReturnNumber); It can't infer the type like it can if I use a Func. Seems like to me they should be the same since the method itself is "strongly typed" like the Func. Side Note: I realize I can do this: Func orderByNumber = ReturnNumber;
