Based on the example, it looks like you need more than simple POS tagging. Thankfully there is a full subdomain of NLP devoted to biomedical data, and there are many tools available which can help with this kind of task: In case the data is made of biomedical research papers, you will find a lot of resources related to the Medline and PubMedCentral databases: UMLS and the tool MetaMap PubTator , a recent annotated version of the biomedical literature. SemRep for relations. cTakes is another annotator system which is more specialized with clinical texts. SciSpacy is a Spacy variant specialized for biomedical text. It can also annotate medical terms with UMLS labels. The last one in particular seems particularly appropriate in your case. biomedical text presents a lot of specific difficulties which cannot be handled with general domain models. Note that there are probably more tools and resources, this a very active domain. (disclaimer: I recycled a large part of an older answer )
