Correlation between model parameters isn't a bad thing per se but this correlation often leads to poor mixing of MCMC chains. Highly-correlated surfaces in some dimensions are difficult to traverse due to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm's non-zero acceptance of low probability areas. Leaving a highly correlated space of high probability can be difficult to return to unless proposal distributions are carefully constructed or you have an adaptive framework guiding the chains. In the extreme, you can almost think of this as stepping off a plateau into a vast empty plain - you're going to spend a bit of time wandering around on the small hills of that plain before getting back onto the plateau unless you have a good map or are catching yourself from falling off the edge of the plateau in the first place. An alternative to re-parameterization (although a little dimensional analysis is rarely a bad idea) is to use principal component analysis to generate your proposal distribution, as demonstrated in this paper . The idea is to have a good understanding of how your parameters correlate prior to running MCMC, and then use PCA to avoid the problem of correlation because principal components of your parameter sets aren't correlated.
