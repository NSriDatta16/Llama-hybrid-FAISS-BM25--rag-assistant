I'd recommend the new book "Crafting Rails Applications" from the Pragmatic Programmers http://pragprog.com/titles/jvrails/crafting-rails-applications The second chapter does something very similar.. all that's needed on top of that, is to implement something similar to activerecord-3.0.3/lib/active_record/persistence.rb , which acts as a go-between from your virtual model to the underlying persisted models.
