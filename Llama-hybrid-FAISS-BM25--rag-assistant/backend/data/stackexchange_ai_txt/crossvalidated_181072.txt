This looks tricky. You may want to think about how you manage to sell the same product at different prices - this may give you an idea of how to segment your problem and/or model it causally. You may be able to forecast total sales per product across all prices and then disentangling them by price. Look at Forecasting functional time series by Hyndman & Shang for a possible approach. They forecast age pyramids over time. Total population would correspond to total sales in your example, and ages to prices.
