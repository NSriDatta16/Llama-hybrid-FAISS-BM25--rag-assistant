How do I add a control at design time without using Drag 'n' Drop?

I'm attempting to create a Wizard type control in VB6 and have run into a stumbling block. I'd like to allow users of the control to be able to add and manage CWizardPage(s) to the design time control using a property page. The first approach I used was to add the Wizard pages to the OCX directly using a Collection, however I ran into two problems in that the Collection class is not persistable (and I couldn't find an easy way to make it so) and that VB6 seems very limited in it's ability to instantiate controls at run time - so it would seem to be a struggle to actually re-instantiate them. My next thought was to just allow the users to draw the wizard pages at design time. This sort of works, however it's far too easy to draw one of the wizard pages inside another wizard page instead of inside the CWizardContainer. So can anyone please tell me how to add controls to a form at design time without using drag 'n' drop?
