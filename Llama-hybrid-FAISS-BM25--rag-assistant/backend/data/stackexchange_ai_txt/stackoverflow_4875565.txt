You should not assume anything is safe for concurrent calls unless you have reason to believe it is. In the docs, you have the boilerplate text that instance members are not guaranteed to be thread-safe, so you should defensively lock the des3 object when you're using it. You should not be hard coding the initialization vector; it should be randomly chosen when encrypting data, then stored in some way with the encrypted data (many people choose to tack it onto the beginning of the data, then remove it and use it for decryption; use whatever storage scheme you prefer, though). Using the same IV defeats the purpose of the IV, which serves to make plaintext attacks more difficult.
