How to organize attendance system code (using $_POST instead of $_GET for dynamic forms)?

I'm currently developing an attendance system for my high school. Right now, my method for submitting data is relatively messy as I'm using the $_GET method. I'm also executing tons of SQL queries. I was wondering if I could receive some assistance on simplifying the code. This form is generated by fetching the student ID, class ID. If attendance was taken, it fetches the status (Absent, Present, Tardy) or if they are excused by the administrator it's marked "Excused Absense" This is all being processed through $_GET. Here's the loop it's running through. Please bear with me, it's not pretty: The reason I'm using $_GET instead of $_POST is because I do not know how to loop dynamic information in a form and process it. Any tips? Sorry if I'm not completely clear: I'm really just trying to find a way to simplify this and not rely so heavily on $_GET (which is a huge security risk, but also sloppy) Thanks!
