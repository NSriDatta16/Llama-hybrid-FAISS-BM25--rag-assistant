Cost function of neural networks can be non-convex, then why do we use it?

I saw a thread here ( Cost function of neural network is non-convex? ). After I read this, I am really confused. I am wondering that if the cost function is not convex, and we do backpropagation, then can it be "well-backpropagated?" Because it is not convex, we cannot optimize a model. My hypothesis was wrong? I want to know this...
