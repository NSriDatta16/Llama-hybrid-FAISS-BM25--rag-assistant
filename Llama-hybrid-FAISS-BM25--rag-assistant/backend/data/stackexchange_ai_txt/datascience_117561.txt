In time series data mining we have a database of time series that we want to query in some way. Answering many of the queries involves finding a time series, or a sub-sequence in a time series that matches or is similar to a query time series. The simplistic way of doing this is simply to search through the entire database to find the matching time series. Obviously this is time-consuming, especially if the database is large. Indexing is a method of organising the time series database in a way that allows us to find the matching time series by only searching a small subset of the time series.
