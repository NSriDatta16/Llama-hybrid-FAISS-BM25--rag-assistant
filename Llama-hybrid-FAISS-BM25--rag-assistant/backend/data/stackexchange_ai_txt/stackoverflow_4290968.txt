Isn't that representation-dependent? If you represent lists as contiguous storage plus start and end index (similar to bytestrings), you can share the storage and just need to traverse once to build the list of indices. The algorithm would not change, just the representation. For this particular use case, using snoc lists (binary lists, but nested from the end, not the start, of the list) would also allow for sharing of sublists, right?
