Cannot drag tables from Server Explorer to .edmx designer pane

Why can't I drag tables from the Server Explorer to the .edmx designer pane? I've done this before in the exact same steps and it worked, but since yesterday instead of getting the classic + sign for dropping items, I get the no entry symbol (circle with slash in the middle). What am I doing wrong? As I said, I've done this before but now it doesn't let me drag things.
