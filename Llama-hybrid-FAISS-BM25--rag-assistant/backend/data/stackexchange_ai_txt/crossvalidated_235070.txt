Relation between MAP, EM, and MLE

I am a beginner in machine learning. I can do programming fine but the theory confuses me a lot of the times. What is the relation between Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum A posteriori (MAP) estimate, and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm? I see them used as the methods that actually do the optimization.
