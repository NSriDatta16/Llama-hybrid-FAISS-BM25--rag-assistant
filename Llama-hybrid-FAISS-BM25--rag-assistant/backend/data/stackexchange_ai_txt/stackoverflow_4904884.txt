section [basic.life] of the standard says The lifetime of an object is a runtime property of the object. An object is said to have non-trivial initialization if it is of a class or aggregate type and it or one of its members is initialized by a constructor other than a trivial default constructor. [ Note: initialization by a trivial copy/move constructor is non-trivial initialization. â€” end note ] The lifetime of an object of type T begins when: storage with the proper alignment and size for type T is obtained, and if the object has non-trivial initialization, its initialization is complete. Since your class has virtual members, it requires non-trivial initialization. You can't assign an object whose lifetime hasn't started, you have to initialize it with new .
