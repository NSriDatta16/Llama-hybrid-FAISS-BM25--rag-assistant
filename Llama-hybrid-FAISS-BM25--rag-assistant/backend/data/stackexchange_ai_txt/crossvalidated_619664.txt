Algorithm choose for: event based time series prediction

I have a dataset which is a electronic bus charger station, data include: voltage current and power consumption. There is no time rule in the use of charging piles, but I want to predict the power consumption of charging piles. Traditional transformer is based on time series, and the data needs to have obvious time characteristics, but my data does not, so I would like to ask if there is any good algorithm that can handle such problems.
