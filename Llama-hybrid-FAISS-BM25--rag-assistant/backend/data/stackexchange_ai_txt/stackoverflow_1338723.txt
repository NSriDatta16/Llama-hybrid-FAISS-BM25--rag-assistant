Our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is an ecosystem for building code analyzers and transformers. DMS is parameterized by a language definition, and has language definitions for C#, Java, C++, C, PL/SQL, PHP, JavaScript, COBOL and a variety of other langauges. When DMS parses according to a langauge definition, it automatically builds an AST. An AST library provided by DMS can print the tree in Lisp-like parenthesized form, or in XML format. Rather than convert XML back into source code, DMS can regenerated the source code directly from the AST. DMS also provides source-to-source transformations to allow manipulation of the AST.
