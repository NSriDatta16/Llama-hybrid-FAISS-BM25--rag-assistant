Magento > Backend > New Menu Item needs specific action -> How do I do it?

I have created a new menu in my backend, and added some children. One of these children named "Manage Pages" must retrieve all the products that correspond to the attribute sets that begin with "CMS_" and should not have a price column. I have done this so far: app/code/community/Mycompany/Content/etc/config.xml 0.1.0 Content 31 adminhtml/newmenu/ Manage Pages adminhtml/newmenu/ Manage Attributes adminhtml/catalog_product_attribute Manage Categories adminhtml/catalog_category/ app/etc/modules/Mycompany_Content.xml true community Once again, this is what I want: - when I press “Manage Pages”, I want to be sent to a “Manage Products” page filtered on a certain set of atrributes - sets of attributes that have names begining with “CMS_”, and without the price column. How do I do that? Thanks in advance! HT Ok, maybe I can try dissecting the problem. How do I create a copy of "Manage Products" page in the backend which is filtered on a certain attribute set?
