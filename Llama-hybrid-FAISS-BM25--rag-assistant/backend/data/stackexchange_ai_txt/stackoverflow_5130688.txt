Upgrading free to paid Android apps without leaving two icons

I have an Android app with free and paid versions, where the free version has a time limit, after which it redirects users to the Market to buy the paid version. The two versions have different package names and are submitted to the Market as separate applications. However, when users buy the paid version, this doesn't replace the free version - they're left with both versions installed at once. I'd like it to install over the free version. Ideally it would also replace any existing shortcuts on the home screen with shortcuts to the new version, but that's less important. Is there an elegant way to handle this?
