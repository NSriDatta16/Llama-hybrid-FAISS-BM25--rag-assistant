Probability distribution associated with nuclear norm?

The $\ell_1$ norm of model parameters is often added to loss functions because it induces sparsity in the solution of the overall cost function: $$ c(\theta) = -\log L(x|\theta) + \lambda ||\theta||_1$$ The fact that the added loss term can be written as the log of the density of a Laplace or Double Exponential distribution reveals a Bayesian perspective on this procedure. The Laplace density $\delta_L$ is given by: $$ \delta_L \propto e^{-\lambda ||\theta||_1}$$ Similarly, the nuclear norm $||A||_*$ is increasingly being used in cost functions due to the low rank property it induces in solutions. I would like to determine what the analagous Bayesian procedure would be, in terms of what prior it would place on the unknown $A$ . The matrix distribution would thus be of the form $\delta_N \propto e^{-\lambda||A||_*}$ . Is this a well studied distribution?
