I'm not sure if I got you right, but if you want touchesBegan act like touchesMoved why don't do like: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if(specialModeOn)//I don't know if you need this { [self touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } else { //whatever touchesBegan should do normally } }
