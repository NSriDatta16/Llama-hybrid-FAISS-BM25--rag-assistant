I have used this NSInvocation approach in a few shipping iPhone products and Mac products. It definitely employs a few strange techniques but it's not a fragile hack by any means: it's rock solid and about as fast as NSInvocation creation is likely to be. I did briefly have a retain count bug in the code (long since fixed) but it's no harder to debug retain counts here than anywhere else. Of course, my opinion is completely biased.
