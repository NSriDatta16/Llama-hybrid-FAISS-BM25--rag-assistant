Internally, you shouldn't be using the smaller values--just use int. As I understand it, using smaller units does nothing but slow things down. It doesn't save memory because internally Java uses the system's word size for all storage (it won't pack words). However if you use a smaller size storage unit, it has to mask them or range check or something for every operation. ever notice that char (any operation) char yields an int? They just really don't expect you to use these other types. The exceptions are arrays (which I believe will get packed) and I/O where you might find using a smaller type useful... but masking will work as well.
