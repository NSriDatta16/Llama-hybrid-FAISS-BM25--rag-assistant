Problem with GPS porting

I'm working on a GPS porting project where we need to avoid all the framework changes. This was acheived through a socket where an application (GPS Settings) talks to GPS library (Middleware) and vice versa. Issues In GUI, Socket is running in one thread and not able to call methods in the main thread activity(securitySetting.java). For this we are using the Handler to communicate with the main thread but the problem still persists. The problem here is the actual source is modifed, securitysettings is inherited from "SettingsPreferenceFragment" where when i check the actual source it is inherited from preferenceactivity. Every time i am using securitysettings.this.getactivity() to get the context. Need to show few notifications, after completion of work in GPS library. Its is not possible from security settings activity as it can't be avaialble all the time. Please suggest if any work around to show the notifications.
