I edited the Workspace and added a specific mapping for: $/ProjectB/Dev/Source/SharedBinaries/* I also then renamed the existing windows folder, added the SharedBinaries folder through TFS, checked it in then, finally, I was able to drag and drop the dlls. Not quite sure which bit of all that was the key though!
