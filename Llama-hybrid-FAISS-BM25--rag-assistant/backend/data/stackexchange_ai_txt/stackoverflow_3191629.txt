It is partly browser-specific. For instance, some browsers don't allow a nested child frame (iframe within an iframe) to change its parent's fragment. See this blog entry . But the basic functionality still works in recent browsers. This demo , which has an iframe change its parent, and vice versa (single level) works fine in Firefox 3.5.9 and Chrome 5.0.375.99. The demo you gave also works both ways in that version of Firefox. It doesn't allow the child to change the parent in Chrome. The main difference seems to be that the working one uses parent.location , while the broken one uses parent.window.location.hash . The best solution for recent browsers is postMessage . If necessary, you can also use a server proxy.
