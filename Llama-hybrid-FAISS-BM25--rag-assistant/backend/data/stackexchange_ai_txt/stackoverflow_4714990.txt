Since you only want to replace the _CHRnnn bits, it's enough to search for: _CHR(\d+) After the match, backreference number 1 will contain the character code. With this, you can: string resultString = null; resultString = Regex.Replace(subjectString, @"_CHR(\d+)", new MatchEvaluator(ComputeReplacement)); public String ComputeReplacement(Match m) { return ToString((char)(Int32.Parse(m.Groups[1].Value))); } EDIT: Thanks to Alan Moore for his C# expertise and regex improvement ideas!
