Is it redundant to use moving average AND auto-regressive terms in an ARIMA model?

Seems to me they are by the following equation: $$(1-\phi_1B)(1-B)X_t = (1-\theta_1B)\epsilon_t$$ We could just divide both sides by $1-\theta_1B$ and not ever have to deal with lagged error? I'm sure I'm missing something so I'm obviously throwing up a straw-man here...
