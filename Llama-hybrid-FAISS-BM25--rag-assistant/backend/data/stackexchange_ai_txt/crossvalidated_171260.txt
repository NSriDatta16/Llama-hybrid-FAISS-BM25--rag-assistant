This is a problem where mathematics can at best supply a "toy" answer, as there is so much more to sporting outcomes than simple statistics. But this looks fun, so let's crack on with it anyway. Take everything that follows with a pinch of salt. We have two estimates, $a$ and $b$ for team A scoring. Let's go with the average, $(a+b)/2=0.6$, and say that's equal to $\mathbb{P}(S_A)\ge 1$, the probability that the number of goals scored by team A , $S_A$, is at least 1. Let's model $S_A$ as a homogeneous Poisson process , which therefore has rate parameter $\lambda_{AB}=-\log\left(1-(a+b)/2\right)\approx 0.916$. This means we expect team A to score $k$ goals against team B with probability $e^{-\lambda_{AB}}\lambda_{AB}^k/k!$, like this: goals | probability ------+------------ 0 | 40.0% 1 | 36.7% 2 | 16.8% 3 | 5.1% 4 | 1.2% 5 | 0.2% Similarly, the number of goals that team B scores against team A could be modelled as Poisson with rate $\lambda_{BA}=-\log\left(1-(c+d)/2\right)\approx 0.223$, with the probabilities working out like: goals | probability ------+------------ 0 | 80.0% 1 | 17.9% 2 | 2.0% 3 | 0.1% Finally, we treat those independently (multiply the probabilities) to find the most likely overall scores: score A : B | probability ------------+------------ 0 : 0 | 32.0% 1 : 0 | 29.3% 2 : 0 | 13.4% 0 : 1 | 7.1% 1 : 1 | 6.5% 3 : 0 | 4.1% So there we are. But please don't put any money on it!
