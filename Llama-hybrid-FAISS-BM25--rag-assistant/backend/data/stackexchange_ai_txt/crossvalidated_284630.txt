There is no way to pool the two surveys you have described. Pooling for comparison is done when two different groups, treatments, etc have had the same measurements made and the two groups are to be compared on those measurements. This might use two sample tests or possibly logistic regression. Pooling for improved estimation is done when there are two different samples of a population which have had the same measurements made. In this case, the sample size is increased and estimates of rates or means can be made that have smaller standard errors than in either single sample. Pooling of samples taken across time, eg, annual surveys, is done in order to use multiple samples to measure the pattern of some measurement over time. Again, the measurements must be the same. Sometimes, different information about the same subjects is taken from different sources and matched into a single set of data for the purpose of finding correlations or differences. This isn't usually referred to as pooling but as matching. The measures can be different but the subjects must be the same. You appear to have two different groups of subjects, each with its own measurements, taken at about the same time. There is no way to pool the two groups since you do not have the same measures on the two groups.
