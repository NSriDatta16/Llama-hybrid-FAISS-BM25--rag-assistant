Forecasting using Boosting methods on Non-stationary Time Series data

Theoretical Noob question - Can we use boosting methods to effectively forecast the future after being trained on a non-stationary time series? Or do you train/fit on the residual of the training set and then add seasonality/trend components while forecasting? Thanks in advance.
