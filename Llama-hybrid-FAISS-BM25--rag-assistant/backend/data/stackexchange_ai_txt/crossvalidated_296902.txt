how to analyze these type of time series data

my data consist of 35 measurements done at two different times (see plot below). I was wondering if a regression model could be created based not on the individual points (time 1 and time 2 treated as separate observations), but rather using the pairs of data (forgive the choice of words here). If you look at the plot, you can see that a nonlinear model could be created, the question is - can it somehow use the data pairs? Is there any modelling technique that allows this?
