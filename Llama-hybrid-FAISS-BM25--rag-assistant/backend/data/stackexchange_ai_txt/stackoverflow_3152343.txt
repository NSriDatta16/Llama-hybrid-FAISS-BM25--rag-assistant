PHP Regular expression help to work with Browser Agent String

I'm currently trying to learn regular expressions with some simple "real world" examples. Take in consideration the following string: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko I want to find the RV value (1.9.2a1pre). I need to apply the following rules: RV: can be in any case (RV, rv, rV, Rv...). RV: can be anywhere in the string. The RV: value ends with either a closing parenthesis, any whitespace (including linebreak), a semicolon or the end of string. So far I did: /rv:[.][\)]?/i but it's not working (I must be far from the "true" solution)... The expression must work with PHP preg_match .
