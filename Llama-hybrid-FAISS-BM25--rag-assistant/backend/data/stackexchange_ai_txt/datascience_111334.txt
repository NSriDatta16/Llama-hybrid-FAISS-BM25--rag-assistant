Why MLOPs is gaining so much traction? Because MLOps is about management of the lifecycle of machine learning, and without proper management any machine learning project would just fail in real production. How it is different from DevOps? The difference lies in the difference between machine learning and traditional programming: 1) machine learning projects are uncertain; 2) machine learning projects are iterative(iterative in each step and iterative in the whole lifecycle); 3) machine learning projects are data-hungry. What are the tools used for MLOPs? Programming language: Python, R, C/C++ Data processing toolset: Jupyter Notebooks(Colab or Kaggle kernel), Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit learn, Matplotlib, NLTK, SpaCy Modeling toolset: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras API / interface: AutoML Platform: MLFlow, AirFlow, Kubeflow How to get started? Read books or watch lectures .
