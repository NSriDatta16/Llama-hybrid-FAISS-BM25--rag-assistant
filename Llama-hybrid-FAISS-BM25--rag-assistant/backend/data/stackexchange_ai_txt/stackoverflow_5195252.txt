You can use the accelerometers. Have an app that allows you to input the length of the treadmill then place the iPhone at the front of the treadmill. The iPhone will accelerate pretty rapidly up to the speed of the treadmill and this is the cue to for the app to start timing. When it reaches the end of the treadmill, the iPhone will start accelerating downwards in accordance with Newton's Theory of Gravity. This is the cue for the app to stop timing, calculate its average speed and transfer its result to a server via wifi or Bluetooth. The iPhone is almost certainly powerful enough to complete the transfer before hitting the ground and smashing into a million pieces.
