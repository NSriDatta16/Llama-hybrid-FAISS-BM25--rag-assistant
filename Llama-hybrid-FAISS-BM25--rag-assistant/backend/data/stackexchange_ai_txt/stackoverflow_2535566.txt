First of all, keep every translatable unit of text in a uniquely identified div tag on each web page. Store the content in a database table that has the div id and the language id as the key and a text field for the content. Allow basic HTML markup, but no script or styling. Have a page on your system to set language preferences, and store it on the user's profile, or in a long-lasting cookie in the user's browser. Have your web application render the unique div or span tags from the database based on the language preference. You can have a separate application that displays the default text (e.g. English) and then has a text area for a translator to type in a translation. Once it is typed in, that div tag can be rendered in the language of the user's choice. Another big thing to watch for is that some content is layout-independent, such as paragraphs, blog postings, etc. Other content is very layout-dependent such as menu items, headers, etc. Also, some languages such as Hebrew and Arabic go from right to left instead of left to right. That may affect how the translated content is laid out. In such situations, you may want a separate layout template for those languages, and the selection of the template would be driven by the language preference.
