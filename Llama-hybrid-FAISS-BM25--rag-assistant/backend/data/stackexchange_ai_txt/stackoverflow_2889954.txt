constrain a touchesmoved object from colliding with walls?

I'm trying to create a very simple game where you can drag a simple imageView. The thing is there is a wall in the frame (just a rectangle) on which the image should not go. so I did something like this: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([touch view] == myImage) { if (CGRectContainsRect (CGRectMake(0, 0, 800, 768), [myImage frame])) { myImage.center = [touch locationInView:self.view]; } } } But the problem was that the image did went out of it's bounds and then got stuck there and the touchesmoved ended. so I've added this: else if (CGRectIntersectsRect (CGRectMake(801, 0, 223, 768), [myImage frame])) { CGPoint touchedPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; myImage.center = CGPointMake(730, touchedPoint.y); } But this made the image to start flickering when intersecting with the "wall" and eventually got stuck there either. I feel there must be a simple way to do that. could anyone enlighten me please?
