Block defined in page.xml do not render

I have made a custom block in Magento that contains some JS. I want to have it placed right after in output HTML. Block looks like this: isHomePage()): ?> ns_loadingtime1=(new Date()).getTime() In a page.xml file of my template I have this: (...) In output HTML my custom block ( baobaz_nedstattag_head ) don't exists. Do you know what can I do to render it as I wish? EDIT Thanks to comment of Fabrizio I was able to make it right. Because in his approach I was getting double entry of my block. So I left the page.xml as it's written above and I have added to 1column.phtml $this->getChildHtml('nedstattagHead') before calling head block
