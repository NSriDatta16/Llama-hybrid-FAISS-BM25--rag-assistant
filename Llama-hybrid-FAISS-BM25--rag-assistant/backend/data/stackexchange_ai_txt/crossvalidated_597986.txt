You can use any model that you like to forecast each series in the hierarchy. However, the fable package only supports a few forecasting models including ets, tslm for automatic reconciliations. If you want to use a random forest or deep learning model, you can do so but you need to either write your own wrapper to use fable (see https://fabletools.tidyverts.org/articles/extension_models.html ), or write the reconciliation function separately to do the hierarchical forecasting reconciliations.
