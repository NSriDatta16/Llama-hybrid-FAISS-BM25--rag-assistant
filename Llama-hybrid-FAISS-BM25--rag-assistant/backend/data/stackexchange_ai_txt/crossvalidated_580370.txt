Logistic regression difficulty with multi-level factor and many 0 outcomes

My dataset describes the presence/absence of an animal in a number of different plant species. Below is a table of plant species Vs animal presence/absence, i.e each row show the number of animal presence/absence records I have for each plant species. Question: What are my analysis options here for looking at the association between animal presence/absence and plant species? Keep in mind that my outcome variable is animal presence/absence and I am interested in the odds of animal presence across the 32 plant species. I am also looking at how other variables influence animal presence/absence. My original plan was to use logistic regression. However, I have many instances were there are animal absence records for a particular plant species but there are no animal presence records for the same plant species. This creates separation issues when attempting to run logistic regression. In addition, plant species is a factor variable with many levels, which again presents its own challenges. What are my analytical options given these two constraints/challenges? One option would be to conduct a logistic regression on a subset of my data for which I have both animal presence/absence records for each plant species. However, in doing this I lose information on many plant species that were available for use by the animal but not used. Thoughts appreciated. $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} \text{Plant species} & \text{Animal absence} & \text{Animal presence} \\ \hline \text{Species 1} & 6 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 2} & 4 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 3} & 144 & 7 \\ \hline \text{Species 4} & 7 & 2 \\ \hline \text{Species 5} & 14 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 6} & 36 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 7} & 18 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 8} & 4 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 9} & 22 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 10} & 243 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 11} & 3 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 12} & 10 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 13} & 23 & 7 \\ \hline \text{Species 14} & 1 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 15} & 30 & 3 \\ \hline \text{Species 16} & 8 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 17} & 69 & 5 \\ \hline \text{Species 18} & 116 & 18 \\ \hline \text{Species 19} & 33 & 18 \\ \hline \text{Species 20} & 4 & 3 \\ \hline \text{Species 21} & 33 & 3 \\ \hline \text{Species 22} & 19 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 23} & 37 & 12 \\ \hline \text{Species 24} & 53 & 1 \\ \hline \text{Species 25} & 92 & 44 \\ \hline \text{Species 26} & 54 & 3 \\ \hline \text{Species 27} & 36 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 28} & 31 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 29} & 1 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 30} & 49 & 5 \\ \hline \text{Species 31} & 4 & 0 \\ \hline \text{Species 32} & 56 & 0 \\ \hline \end{array}$$
