Recommended unit test framework for new .NET projects

I'm about to start a new C# application, which will probably take some while (read: > 1 year). I want to keep it cross-platform, that is, it should work using Mono, but my primary development platform is Visual Studio. Now I'm looking into the test frameworks, but I wonder which one you would take for both being portable and reliable in the future. Right now, nUnit seems to be the standard, but given xUnit.net, I wonder whether this would be better as it seems to be more actively developed. Or should I stick with MSTest only? After all, I can expect MSTest to be supported for several years. For Java, it would be rather clearly JUnit, as it is supported everywhere, but the .NET landscape seems to be much more fragmented. So the main question is not features etc. (MSTest is not too stellar in that direction anyway), but rather long-term reliability. In this light, which unit testing framework can you recommend?
