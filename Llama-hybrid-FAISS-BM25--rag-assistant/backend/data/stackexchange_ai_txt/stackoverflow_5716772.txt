The "drag and drop" in Visual Studio just creates the code for you. The resulting executable is built out of the code, and the compiler does not care whether the code was written by you personally, by Visual Studio or by a trained monkey. Yes, it's possible that the graphical designer in Visual Studio adds additional attributes to your HTML/ASP elements that you would not have added yourself, but I doubt that it makes a measurable difference w.r.t. performance. Experienced developers usually like to either hand-craft their code or use the graphical designer and double-check the created code (the "split screen" view is very useful for that) because unnecessary attributes make the code harder to maintain.
