I find the primary difference between 'modern' C++ and the old* stuff is careful use of class invariants and encapsulation. Well organised code tends naturally to have fewer pointers flying around. I'm almost as nervous swimming in shared_ptrs as I would be in news and deletes. I'm looking forward to unique_ptr in C++0x. I think that will tidy away the few (smart) pointers that do still roam the wild. *still unfortunately very common
