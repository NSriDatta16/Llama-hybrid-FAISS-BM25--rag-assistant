Impersonate FormsAuthenticated user in HttpHandler for WCF call

I'm using HttpHandlers to generate PDF report files "on-the-fly" using the authenticated user context. However, to create the report PDF file I need to call a method on a secure WCF service with the context of the caller (the authenticated user). I saw plenty of answers for the Windows authentication but I'm using plain old Forms authentication so the answers don't apply. The authentication on the service side is done using ASP.NET membership (same server that hosts the HttpHandler). There should (I hope) be a way for me to just pass on the caller context to the service. I'm afraid I didn't make myself clear enough. What I have is a WCF service and an HttpHandler. The user is authenticated with the WCF service with ASP membership. What I want to do is, in the HttpHandler, be able to do SetContextAsCaller(); myWCFService.MyMethodCall(); and have MyMethodCall() called using the HttpCaller's context to pass on its ASP ticket/username etc.
