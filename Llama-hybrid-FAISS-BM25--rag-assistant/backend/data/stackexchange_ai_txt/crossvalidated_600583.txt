I would say that usage of paired t-test and cross validation would be okay but in the way described in paper and article: split data into K-folde train both models for each split get K pairs of metrics (for model A and B) use obtained pairs to perform paired t-test I hope this link will be helpful - it is about comparing classification algorithm but uses K-fold cv and paired t-test comparing classification algorithms and source paper itself I don't get one thing, what do you mean by The value of each row is also the average of a 10-fold cross-validation. Do you have 9 separate time periods (number of rows) and you run 10-fold cross validation on each of them?
