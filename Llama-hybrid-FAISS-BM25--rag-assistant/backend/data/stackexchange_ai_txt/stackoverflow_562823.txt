PHP way to execute SQL LIKE matching without a database query?

I want to match an input string to my PHP page the same way a match done by the LIKE command in SQL (MySQL) for consistency of other searches. Since (I have seen but don't comprehend) some of the PHP syntax includes SQL commands I am wondering if this is possible? The reason for this is I am now implementing a search of a keyword versus fields in the DB that are stored in a serialized array, which I have to unserialize in PHP and search depending on the structure of the array. I can't query against the table, just need the matching ability of the query. Otherwise I need to find an alternate matching routine, which won't be consistent. I can't go back and re-structure the DB since this wasn't anticipated wayyy back in the spec. Yes, I need an ugly hack, but am looking for the most elegant. If it's not possible I could use any recommendation of matching user typed text as a keyword against stored text. EDIT (for clarification): my main problem is I don't have a thorough grasp on how the LIKE command works (just copying the code) and as the keyword implies some degree of vagueness, I would like that vagueness preserved if I switch to a regular expression. I am better with regex's just not so good with like. My query is "LIKE 'matchme%'"
