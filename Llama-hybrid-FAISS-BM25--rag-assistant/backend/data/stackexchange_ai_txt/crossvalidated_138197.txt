A reasonable way to estimate the confidence interval for log_loss metric is to assume that the model X is a perfect model, meaning that X gives true probabilities of output of classes for every sample in test set. Consider two-class case. Then log_loss metric is an average of independent $N$ random variables, each one of which takes value $\log(p_j)$ with probability $p_j$ and value $\log(1-p_j)$ with probability $(1-p_j)$. Here $N$ is the size of test set. It is theoretically possible to compute the resulting distribution of log_loss as a sum of random variables with known distributions analytically, but is quite challenging. It is easier to get a numerical approximation by Monte-Carlo procedure. Here is a sketch of the algorithm: Compute predictions $p_j$ of model X for each sample from test set. Generate fake class labels for each sample $p_j Compute log_loss using fake class labels Repeat steps 2 and 3 many times. Compute standard deviation of log_loss estimates over the repetitions. Compute confidence interval estimation by multiplying standard deviation by a constant corresponding to desired confidence level. I have evaluated this approach on a proprietary click through dataset by comparing estimated standard deviation to the standard deviation obtained by splitting test set into multiple independent subsets of equal size and computing log_loss standard deviation from them. I have found that standard deviation of the log_loss depends on the number of samples in test set $N$ in an expected way: $$ std = \frac{a}{\sqrt N}, $$ where $a\approx0.5$ and depends mildly on the average click through rate. From this a very rough estimate (maybe up to a factor of 2) for 95% confidence interval of log_loss evaluated on 10 million samples is $\pm 0.0003$ For the recent Kaggle CTR contest the final standings looks like this: 1 0.3791384 2 0.3803652 3 0.3806351 4 0.3810307 Assuming 10 million records in the test set, I believe that first place score is significantly better than the second, but difference between the second and the third place may not be significant.
