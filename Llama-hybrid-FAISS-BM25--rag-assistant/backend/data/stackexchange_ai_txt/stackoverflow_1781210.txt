What are all of the automated build tasks that can be performed?

I'm curious. I'm looking into creating a CI server and wondering, after the first couple of obvious tasks, what else can an automated build do? The tasks that I'm aware of (not in any order): Compile (debug/release versions) Code style conformance Automated tests (unit/integration/etc.) Code coverage Version incrementing Deployment I'm not looking for the names of software, the build engine to use, or anything like that; just the repetitive and (maybe) important tasks that can be automated to make the build process ridiculously simple from an end-user perspective.
