Correct Type of Statistical/Machine Learning Analysis For Inflow

I want to predict the number of people joining (inflow e.g. 4000, 5000, 6000 etc) online subscription. The dependent variable is ‘inflow in the first 4 weeks for a certain content title’ as this is what we would like to estimate for new future titles. I’m taking several variables like time (year, month, day, etc), genre, content classification (age recommendations, etc.), number of episodes, language, etc. as independent variables. However, I have a number of variables which are binary (0, 1). 1- I am wondering what sort of statistical/machine learning method/tool I can use for this analysis? 2- How can I inference which variables contributes most to inflow? Could someone please guide me through the analysis process? I would appreciate your time and useful insight. Thanks in advance
