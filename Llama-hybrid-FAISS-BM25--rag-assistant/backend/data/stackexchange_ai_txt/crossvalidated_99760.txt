Actually, since you have only two samples (before vs after) I think you can consider this as a paired $t$ test: you're trying to detect a difference in the average value of (after-before). There are many canned power calculators for this case, including power.t.test() in R: power.t.test(delta=0.01,sd=3*sqrt(2),power=0.8,type="paired") Paired t test power calculation n = 1412800 delta = 0.01 sd = 4.242641 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.8 alternative = two.sided NOTE: n is number of *pairs*, sd is std.dev. of *differences* within pairs I have increased the sd to $3\sqrt{2}$ because (as noted in the output) we want the standard deviation of differences. I hope 1.5 million pixels is not a depressing answer ... If we assume that the standard deviation between pairs of measurements on the same pixel is the same as the standard deviation across pixels at the same time , then the paired $t$ test doesn't give you any advantage over the pooled test ( power.t.test(delta=0.01,sd=3,power=0.8,type="two.sample") gives exactly the same answer). However, if the measurement error is what you say, and there is some true among-pixel variation, then the standard deviation in the two-sample test will be even larger, and the results will be even worse (but the paired test will not lose any power).
