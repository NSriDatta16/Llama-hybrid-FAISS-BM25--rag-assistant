Look at the builtin functions charindex , patindex , and substring . charindex finds the positon of a specified character, patindex of a pattern, substring returns a portion of a string by position. My advice would be to write a view over the table column X is in, that uses the above functions to provide two calculate columns. Then you could insert into result table select info1, info2 from columnX'stable; . At least the calculated column info2 will involve a case statement to handle the case when there is only one parenthesized "info" in the source, something along these lines: case when [some test using patindex too check for two parenthesized infos] then [some combination of patidex and substring to extract the second info] else null; In particular, patindex returns zero when a pattern is not found so: patindex('%(%)%(%)%', columnX) would return zero for your first example but not your second example. You'll also need to consider how you want to handle erroneous data, specifically 1) rows with no parentheses, 2) with unequal numbers of open and close parentheses, 3) with additional text between two parenthesized "infos", 4) with additional text after the closing parenthesis. I'd encourage you to add examples of all these possibilities, as well as correctly formatted columnXes, to your test data, and then test that the view does what you want in all cases.
