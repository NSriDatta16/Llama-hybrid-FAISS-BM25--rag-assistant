Time series data transformation for Prophet model

I have a time series data that looks as follows The data has the following frequency distribution Here is the Q-Q plot It looks like the data is exponentially distributed. My assumption is that the noise or error component of the data will also be similarly distributed. So to make the data normally distributed I applied a log transformation, which resulted in the following frequency distribution and Q-Q plots. It looks like that even after log transformation the transformed data did not look normally distributed. Is there any other transformation that should be done? More importantly, does the prophet really require transformation? I would really appreciate your answers/comments.
