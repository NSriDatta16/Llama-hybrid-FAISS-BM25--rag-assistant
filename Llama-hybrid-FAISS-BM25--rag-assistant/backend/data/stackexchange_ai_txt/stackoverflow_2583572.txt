PHP: How to store XML data in an array?

Below is the XML I am working with - there are more items - this is the first set. How can I get these elements in to an array? I have been trying with PHP's SimpleXML etc. but I just cant do it. listing 0 Used 2005 Ford Mustang V6 Deluxe 2005 FORD MUSTANG 1ZVFT80N555169501 12987 42242 no Grand Rapids Michigan http://www.lemonfree.com/images/stock_images/thumbnails/2005_38_557_80.jpg http://www.lemonfree.com/56832429.html Thanks guys EDIT: I want the first items data in easy to access variables, I've been struggling for a couple of days to get SimpleXML to work as I am new to PHP, so I thought manipulating an array is easier to do.
