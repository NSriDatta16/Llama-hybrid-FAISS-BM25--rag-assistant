Tensor = multi-dimensional array In the machine learning literature, a tensor is simply a synonym for multi-dimensional array : Tensors, also known as multidimensional arrays, are generalizations of matrices to higher orders and are useful data representation architectures. Tensors in Statistics Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application (2021) Hence a 1.d tensor is a "vector/tuple", and a 2.d. tensor is a "matrix/2.d.array". Theano vs TensorFlow vs Pytorch vs ... In specific libraries the term may be restricted to numerical arrays: Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. or those containing a broader range of data-types: Tensor - The primary data structure in TensorFlow programs. Tensors are N-dimensional (where N could be very large) data structures, most commonly scalars, vectors, or matrices. The elements of a Tensor can hold integer, floating-point, or string values. Etymology Tensor has a more specific meaning in mathematics as an abstraction of a multilinear map between vector spaces, but given a fixed basis such maps can be represented as multidimensional arrays, and it is from this usage that the machine learning term gets its name.
