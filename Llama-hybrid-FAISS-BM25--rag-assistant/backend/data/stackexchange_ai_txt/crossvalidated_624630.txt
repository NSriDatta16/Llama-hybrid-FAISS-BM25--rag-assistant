You can absolutely propose a test with uneven tails. There is no written rule to do otherwise. As @PeterFlom says, people have accepted equal tail tests because of a. convenience (you can take the absolute value or square of the test statistic, compare to the known distribution, and calculate only one $p$ -value) and b. pragmatism, many statistical tests are simply pragmatic. In theory, reporting out the results of a significant two-sided tests affords the statistician no definitive comment about the directionality of effect, in practice most people accept significance, and then check direction against their assumptions. "Does alcohol rehab prevent recidivism? The two-sided test rejects the null, but by golly rehab increases recidivism?? The data must be wrong." Ideally, a statistical hypothesis is connected to a decision - like to approve a drug, or to implement a policy, or even a flag, in a sense, to the scientific community. The agnosticism that usually accompanies two-sided hypotheses does not accord with a cost-benefit evaluation of science. However, if a compelling argument could be made about the respective costs of a type 1 error in each direction, you could justify uneven bounds. Otherwise, you would be expected to balance them because, if you truly don't know anything, the equal-tail test could be shown to be minimax. There are examples. In practice, these types of hypotheses are posited as a family of hypotheses actually. In randomized clinical trials, a group sequential design might separately test the hypothesis that the drug is favorable $\mathcal{H}_{1,a}: \theta>0$ or that the drug causes harm $\mathcal{H}_{2,a}: \theta with a nominal alpha . Another example I have seen that is interesting is a sequential hypothesis design where one first tests for non-inferiority $\mathcal{H}_{1,a}: \theta> - d$ where $d$ is a non-inferiority margin, and then superiority $\mathcal{H}_{2,a}: \theta>0$ .
