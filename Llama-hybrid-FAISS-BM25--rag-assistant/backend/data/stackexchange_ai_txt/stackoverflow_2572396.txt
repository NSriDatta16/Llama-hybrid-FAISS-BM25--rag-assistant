Nokogiri, open-uri, and Unicode Characters

I'm using Nokogiri and open-uri to grab the contents of the title tag on a webpage, but am having trouble with accented characters. What's the best way to deal with these? Here's what I'm doing: require 'open-uri' require 'nokogiri' doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(link)) title = doc.at_css("title") At this point, the title looks like this: Rag\303\271 Instead of: Ragù How can I have nokogiri return the proper character (e.g. ù in this case)? Here's an example URL: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tagliatelle-with-Duck-Ragu-242037
