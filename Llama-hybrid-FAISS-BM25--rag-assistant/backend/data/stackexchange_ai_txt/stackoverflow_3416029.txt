Best way to have a perl-base self contained HTTP Server that also manages TCP connections

I am writing a small glue tool for doing some testing and I would like to heavily leverage CPAN. My tool must act as an HTTP server to bridge posted data to other TCP connections and vice-versa. I have started the tool using IO::Event , which has been working very well for me. I would like to integrate it with something like HTTP::Server::Simple to do the HTTP parsing for me rather than muck around with parsing the HTTP headers myself. A quick perusal of HTTP::Server::Simple didn't seem like it could just work, but perhaps I missed something. Has anyone done something like this?
