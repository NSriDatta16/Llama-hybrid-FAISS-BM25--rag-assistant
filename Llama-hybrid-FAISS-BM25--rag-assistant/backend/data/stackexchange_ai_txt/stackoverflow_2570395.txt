Cosine Similarity In the case of information retrieval, the cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies (tf-idf weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term frequency vectors cannot be greater than 90Â°. - Wikipedia EDIT: SIMILAR but different pages currently have their own comments, so many users ended up copy and pasting their comments on all the SIMILAR pages. This similarity can be exploited. Find similar Posts. Find users COMMON to the posts just ignore others. This grouping should reduce your task :)
