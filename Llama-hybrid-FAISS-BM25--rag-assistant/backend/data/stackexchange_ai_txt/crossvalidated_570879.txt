Non-significant logistic regression model - Are all coefficients non-significant, or are all coefficients equal to 1?

I've got a couple of non-significant logistic regression models, and am figuring out how to word it appropriately. Before that, I want to confirm the implication. Most questions/websites I have gone to don't go to the verbiage aspect or explain in-depth the implications, hence I'm clarifying here: If my overall logistic regression model is non-significant: Does this mean: (a) All odds ratios are nonsignificant, or (b) All odds ratios are equal to 1? (i.e., same as the base case) Thanks for your clarification.
