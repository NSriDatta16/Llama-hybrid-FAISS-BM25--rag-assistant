Writing standards for unit testing

I plan to introduce a set of standards for writing unit tests into my team. But what to include? These two posts ( Unit test naming best practices and Best practices for file system dependencies in unit/integration tests ) have given me some food for thought already. Other domains that should be covered in my standards should be how test classes are set up and how to organize them. For example if you have class called OrderLineProcessor there should be a test class called OrderLineProcessorTest. If there's a method called Process() on that class then there should be a test called ProcessTest (maybe more to test different states). Any other things to include? Does your company have standards for unit testing? EDIT: I'm using Visual Studio Team System 2008 and I develop in C#.Net
