What you want isn't very clear. I think you are after a long-running process that accumulates "messages" of some sort, and then allows retrieval of those messages. Here's one possible solution: Try to create a fifo at a known location. If this succeeds, fork a daemon that listens on that fifo, accumulating messages until it receives a * , at which point it echos all messages back to the fifo, including the * . The original process (whether it spawned a daemon or not) opens the fifo for writing, and pushes the message. If the argument was * , it then reads the fifo and outputs everything it gets until it receives the echoed * .
