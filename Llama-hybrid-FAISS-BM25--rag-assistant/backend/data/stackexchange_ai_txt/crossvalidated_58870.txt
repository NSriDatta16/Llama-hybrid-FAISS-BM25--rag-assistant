Here's how I see it. Technically, you are right. Simply adding the scores (or averaging them) weights them all equally and this may not be the optimal solution. However, it does have certain advantages: 1) It is simple. Factor analysis is not. OK, readers of this list probably understand factor analysis; but what about journal editors, dissertation advisers and the general group that will read whatever you write? 2) It is not subject to objections from choosing the wrong options. Factor analysis is, even if you force a single factor (principal components? Maximum likelihood? What priors? etc). If you allow multiple factors, the complexity goes way up as do the number of choices. 3) It often makes relatively little difference. Sums often correlate very highly with factor scores; in many fields, we have so many other sources of error that this may not matter. So, if you are developing a scale that you hope will be published and widely used, and you are doing a full development, it makes sense to go for FA. But if it's just a one-off scale that won't be used again, it may not be.
