Unless this is the Grid , saying this.CaptureMouse() will prevent any other element including the Grid from receiving mouse events. For drag-and-drop you probably don't need to capture the mouse at all, but if you do capture the mouse, you need to use fieldItemGrid.CaptureMouse() in order for your mouse move handler to be called before the capture is released.
