A class in html is an attribute you can add to any html element (like paragraphs, links). You can make up the name yourself (has to start with a letter though), and then stylesheets or javascript can do something with that specific element. For instance: This is a paragraph with no class This paragraph has a class named "foo" This span has a class as well Now if you apply CSS to style your html, you can use: p { color: blue } p.foo { color: red } span.foo { color: green } .foo { font-size: big } This way all paragraphs have blue text, except the paragraph with the class 'foo'. The rule p.foo effects only paragraphs with the class foo. The rule span.foo applies only to span elements with the class foo, so that part will have green text. Then finally, the .foo rule applies to all elements with the 'foo' class, so the last two elements will have big-sized text. You can also have multiple classes. has the classes foo and bar. You can access those separately in the CSS by using .foo or .bar
