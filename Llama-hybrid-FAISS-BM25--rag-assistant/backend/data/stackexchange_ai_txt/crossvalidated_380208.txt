1) One super simple suggestion (Vector space model in information retrieval): Each user is represented as an (row) vector Each location is represented as a (row) vector Use as similarity measure the scalar product (cos-similarity). Suggest the locations with the highest similarity score. for cos-similarity see, eg https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dot-products-1.html 2) If you have labels, i.e. users-location pairs (users that like locations) you can use an architecture similar to a "Siamese neural network" (maybe without weight sharing) for finding the similarity between users and locations. The idea is to map the users and the locations in another feature space where the similarity is computed by the neural network. Without knowing much more about the data (sparsity, synonyms etc.) it is difficult to say more if that makes sense or not. for an overview to Siamese NN, see https://www.quora.com/What-are-Siamese-neural-networks-what-applications-are-they-good-for-and-why
