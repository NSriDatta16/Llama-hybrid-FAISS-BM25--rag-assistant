statistical analysis between two time series

I have two time series, which by looking at they appear to be correlated i.e. when one is high the other is high, and when one is low the other is low. Besides looking at the figure and saying these are correlated, I am looking for a statistical approach to assess whether these two time series are correlated or not. The image below shows the time series plotted against one another and a corresponding scatter plot. The data can be found here . I work primarily in MatLab but also sometimes use R. If anyone could provide some support in either programs that would be great. I basically want to analyse what is the relationship between the 2 series and is the series greater during some stages compared to others, but I cannot determine which method is most suitable. Thanks in advance.
