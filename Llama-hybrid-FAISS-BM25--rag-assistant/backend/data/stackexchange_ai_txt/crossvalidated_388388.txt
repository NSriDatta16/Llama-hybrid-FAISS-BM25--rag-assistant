This is not a good situation for classification as detailed here . Biomarker research is all about tendencies , not about forced choices. And note that just to estimate an overall tendency, e.g., a simple unconditional probability, requires a minimum of 96 subjects as detailed in my RMS course notes and in BBR which also has a chapter on complexities of analyzing high dimensional data, especially about the stability of features "selected". Think of 96 as the minimum number of subjects needed to estimate just the intercept in a binary logistic model. And that only achieves a margin of error (with 0.95 confidence) of $\pm 0.1$ in the predicted risk of outcome/disease. To nail down the outcome probability to within a margin of error of $\pm 0.05$ requires $4\times$ that many subjects. The above is for the 2-outcome case. For 3 outcomes things are more challenging. If the outcomes are not ordered you would be right to use polytomous (multinomial) logistic regression. Yes the dataset is too small by a factor of perhaps 500 for data splitting to be reliable. You might consider 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation, or 500 bootstrap iterations. For either of these resampling techniques all supervised learning steps must be repeated afresh for each iteration. As a rough guess, the total sample size needed for a 3-class unordered problem such that the smallest outcome category has at least $15 \times$ the number of candidate features.
