Where to store dataset when creating neural network models and using github?

I have been recommended to use GitHub for all my coding projects as it is a great way to demonstrate to employers what you have been working on as well as just sharing anything you have created that might be useful to others. So I am storing my code for Neural Network Models I am working in a GitHub repository but I am not sure when I download a data set to run a test with where I should download that too? Inside or outside the git repository? Sorry if this is a dumb question but new to this. I can imagine arguments for either answer. Mainly size being too big or the results being easily reproducible.
