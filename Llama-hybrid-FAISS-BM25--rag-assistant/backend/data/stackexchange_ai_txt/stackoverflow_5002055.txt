Is the pointer guaranteed to preserve its value after `delete` in C++?

Inspired by this question . Suppose in C++ code I have a valid pointer and properly delete it. According to C++ standard, the pointer will become invalid (3.7.3.2/4 - the deallocation function will render invalid all pointers referring to all parts of deallocated storage ). At least in most implementations it preserves the value and will store exactly the same address as before delete , however using the value is undefined behavior . Does the standard guarantee that the pointer will preserve its value or is the value allowed to change?
