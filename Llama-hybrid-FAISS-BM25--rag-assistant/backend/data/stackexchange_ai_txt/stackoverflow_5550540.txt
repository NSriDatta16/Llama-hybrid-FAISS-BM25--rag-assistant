Firefox extension preferences

How to save and get the user preferences seperatly using firefox extension. Note: don't use the firefox core preferences. for example type about:config in firefox address bar it shows a default preferences stored in browser. I don't need this type storage. I need only store the user preferences collecting from the text box and save seperatly.
