What you're talking about is a Segmented Control inside a Navigation Bar, a ToolBar is something entirely different. There are plenty of tutorials online for customizing the innards of a Navigation Bar. In fact you should just be able to drag one into your view's navigation bar within Interface Builder. From there you can customize it's different segments. Hope this helps.
