With approx n=50,000 in each sample, there's no point in a statistical test since it will most likely be statistically significant regardless of the meaning of the difference. Instead, I'd plot the two distributions (histograms and boxplots) and carefully consider what is the practical meaning of a difference of 0.3 between the two genders. Most importantly, the question is: what will this result be used for? Is it really the averages that you need to compare?
