Strange blank space showing up in page. Possibly CSS?

I've got a real problem here. I have a page at: [page removed] and if you go to it, it loads fine, but then the middle contents "shift" over to the right, and only in the top paragraph and headline. In particular, I'm talking about the headline "Pipes" and the paragraph that follows. They should be left aligned like the rest of the centre content. The problem isn't the position of the divs, it's the header and paragraph moving after the page loads. I've removed almost all the CSS to try and find out what is doing this but I'm not certain it is CSS-related and I can't think of anything else to try. I've tried to use every tool I can think of and there doesn't seem to be anything actually there in the code that would "shift" the copy over so I'm trying to see if someone else has an idea that I could try. The page is done in classic ASP, with HTML5 and CSS3, and a little jQuery just fyi. If you need to see code, let me know. I am baffled at what is doing this, I've never seen anything behave like this. Any help would be great.
