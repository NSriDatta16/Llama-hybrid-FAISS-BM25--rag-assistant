One hack around it is to cast it as an nvarchar(max) . This is a documented way to increase the string length beyond 4,000: nvarchar [ ( n | max ) ] Variable-length Unicode string data. n defines the string length and can be a value from 1 through 4,000. max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes (2 GB). The storage size, in bytes, is two times the actual length of data entered + 2 bytes. The ISO synonyms for nvarchar are national char varying and national character varying. A similar trick applies to varchar() .
