From this thread : Since 3.4 (Ganymede) , the default encoding is inherited from the resource (project) associated with the launch configuration. If encoding is not specified for the project - encoding configured for the workspace or system default encoding is used. (source: eclipse.org ) Since it appears you cannot change console encoding anywhere else but in the Run configuration's common tab (see this thread ), I am not sure it can be done at this point. That already has some side effect like bug 238945 . As illustrated by this article , you can only change the encoding once.
