What is the difference between ZCA whitening and PCA whitening?

I am confused about ZCA whitening and normal whitening (which is obtained by dividing principal components by the square roots of PCA eigenvalues). As far as I know, $$\mathbf x_\mathrm{ZCAwhite} = \mathbf U \mathbf x_\mathrm{PCAwhite},$$ where $\mathbf U$ are PCA eigenvectors. What are the uses of ZCA whitening? What are the differences between normal whitening and ZCA whitening?
