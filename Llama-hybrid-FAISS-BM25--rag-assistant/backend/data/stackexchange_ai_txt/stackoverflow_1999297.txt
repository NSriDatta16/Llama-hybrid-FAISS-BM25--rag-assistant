Really sounds like you are looking for thread local storage as Igor suggests - I would choose to use the boost.Thread code ( documentation here ) because: cross platform / compiler generally useful and convinient for this kind of task (actually I wonder if you are actually trying to create something quite a lot like a boost::thread_specific_ptr given what you said about your needs)
