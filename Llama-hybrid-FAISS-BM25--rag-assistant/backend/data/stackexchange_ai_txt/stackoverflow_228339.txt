Thanks for the responses. The users themselves want to get away from Excel. They are battling with multiple users trying to enter and update data. I might investigate what options VSTO gives for embedding small Excel sheets into applications. I'm leaning towards using an embedded 'language' to store and evaluate the formulas. Using a simple parser to turn entered formulas into SQL is probably a reasonable idea as the variables in the equations are time series vectors not scalar data points and the SQL approach should make it easier to compute the results over the required time periods. Thanks
