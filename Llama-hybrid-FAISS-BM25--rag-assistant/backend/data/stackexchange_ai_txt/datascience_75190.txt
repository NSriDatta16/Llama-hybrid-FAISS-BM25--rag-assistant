Linear algebra is very important for ML, but ML is not "just" linear algebra. Any sequence of linear matrix-vector operations is linear. Therefore any non-linear operation cannot be computed using linear algebra. A few examples of non-linear operations that are used in ML: The if statement: e.g. (x The softmax activation The rectified linear unit Can advanced features like convolution be expressed as basic matrix operations? This statement is true actually. A single convolution can be expressed as matrix. However, any modern CNN has non-linearities following the convolution.
