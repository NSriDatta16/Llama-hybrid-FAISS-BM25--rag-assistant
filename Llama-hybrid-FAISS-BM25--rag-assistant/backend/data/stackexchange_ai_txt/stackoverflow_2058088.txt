I've used LimeLight with an origin pull model and it works quite well. The only issue is their edge network is constantly expanding so if you want to employ any kind of security for your content on the origin (i.e. firewall ACL's) it becomes a constant maintenance PITA. OTOH, if your content if wide open to the public then I would highly recommend them. I don't know how cheap they are for a new customer. I guess it depends on how much traffic you are expecting (and ultimately how much money you will give them). My company does a fair amount of CDN business so we got really nice pricing, but YMMV. Also, if you are a Rackspace customer you might be able to leverage their pricing - they use LL exclusively for their own content and for their cloud offerings ( http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files ). Good Luck!
