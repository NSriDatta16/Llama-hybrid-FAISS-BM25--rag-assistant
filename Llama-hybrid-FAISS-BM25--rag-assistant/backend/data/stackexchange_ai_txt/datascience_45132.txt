This can be done with RNN/LSTM/GRU (type of Neural Networks that are well-suited for time-series). For example : https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/ This example is quite similar to the problem mentioned in question (predict air quality based on ~10 parameters. Parameters are available as a time-series).
