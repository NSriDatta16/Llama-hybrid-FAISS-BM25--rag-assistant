How can I use Data Science to profoundly contribute to Humanity?

Undergraduate researcher here. I worked at many traditional scientific research labs, ranging from cancer biology, to radiation medicine, and to supercapacitors. I'm thinking of switching to Statistics and Computer Science from Computational Biology to join the exciting field of Data Science. What ways can I contribute to Humanity without a technical background in basic science? I don't know how I will feel about making better clickbaits. I've thought about continuing in scientific research but I will lack the science background. I've thought about working for the United Nations. What other ways can I contribute? Inspire me!
