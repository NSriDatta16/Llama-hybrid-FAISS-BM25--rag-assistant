A couple of ideas: The agent-addr may be set to the IP address of the network adapter by a lower layer. Is there an option to associate one particular adapter with SNMP? Why do you need to set the source port for the trap? SNMP only requires that the trap be sent to UDP port 162; the source is irrelevant unless your specific application has additional requirements. (See RFC 1067 for SNMP details.)
