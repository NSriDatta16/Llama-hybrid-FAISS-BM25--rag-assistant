Create loss function thats takes probability in calculating

I am training object detection, the output is 5 numbers, probability that something is in the box , xmin, ymin, xmax , ymax What i am trying to achieve, is the "probability", to be scaled between 0 and 1. I have tried numerous loss functions , fox example "mse", and adjusted MSE that reuturns binary crossentrophy of 1st parameter ( probability )(classification) + MSE of other 4 parameters. (regression). But the number has never been scaled beween 0 and 1. Is it possible to create such loss function, or do i need to create another output for CNN that will act as classficator? Thanks for help.
