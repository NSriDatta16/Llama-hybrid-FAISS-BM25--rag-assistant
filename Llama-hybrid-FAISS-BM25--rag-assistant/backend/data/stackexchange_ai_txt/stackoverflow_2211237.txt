Attempting to parse non-trivial languages like SQL using regexes or other low-level string bashing is a BAD IDEA. You end up with unreadable code and a fragile "parser" that breaks when supplied with input that is invalid or valid-but-different. You either need to implement a proper SQL parser (or use an existing one), or change your code so that you are not parsing SQL but assembling it from something else. I have an application depending on a framework and don't want to introduce new libraries! That is a bad reason for not doing proper parsing. What is wrong with not using another library???
