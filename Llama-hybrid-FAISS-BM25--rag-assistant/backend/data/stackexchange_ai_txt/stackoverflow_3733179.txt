string get_bin () return get_bin(twoscompliment); These are mutually incompatible. I don't see how you can say that code works for positive numbers since it's not even compiling. You probably need to change the first line to something like: string get_bin (int x) but, since you don't actually use the argument, you may have other problems. If you're using global or object-level variables to do this work, recursion is not going to work, since they different levels will be stepping on each other's feet (unless you do your own stack). One of the beauties of recursion is that your code can be small and elegant but using local variables is vital to ensure your data is level-specific. By way of example, examine the following (badly written) pseudo-code: global product def factorial (n): if n == 1: return 1 product = factorial (n-1) return n * product Now that won't work for factorial (7) since product will be corrupted by lower levels. However, something like: def factorial (n): local product if n == 1: return 1 product = factorial (n-1) return n * product will work just fine as each level gets its own copy of product to play with. Of course: def factorial (n): if n == 1: return 1 return n * factorial (n-1) would be even better.
