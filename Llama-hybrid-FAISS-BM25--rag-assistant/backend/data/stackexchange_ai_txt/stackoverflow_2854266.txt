You can't think of enterprise architect as a development tool. Enterprise architect is a modeling tool with developer benefits. The main feature of EA is to leverage UML models. EA gives you flexibility to model your data in all different ways. You can create all levels of standardized models from Logical to Physical. It also allows you to take it to the next level and model domain classes that map to your conceptual model. I have also been on projects that took EA models and exported them to XMI and ran rules based code generation. Which basically generated a whole project architecture based on diagrams.
