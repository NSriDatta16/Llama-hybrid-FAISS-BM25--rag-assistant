I am working on a pose dataset and want to convert this data into CSV format. How to convert this data into a single row of data

This is the data for one pose. I have a lot of data like this which i want to convert to CSV to apply machine learning algorithm. I am assuming I have to convert this data into a single row of comma separated values which will define a single pose. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
