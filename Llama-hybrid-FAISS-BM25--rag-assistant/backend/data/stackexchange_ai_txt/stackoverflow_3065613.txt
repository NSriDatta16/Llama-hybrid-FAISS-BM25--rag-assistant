It's going to be sensitive to lighting - what happens if you view it under a red light! I don't know if using YUV space is much easier than looking for similar RGB values. edit - normally you would call something with no color gray (might help you with searches). If you have a choice this is the worst color to search for because it will reflect any other lighting in the scene. So you will have to detect the overall lighting color and adjust for that. So what you are looking for are pixels with simlar RGB values, or RGB values in the ratio of the average for objects in the scene.
