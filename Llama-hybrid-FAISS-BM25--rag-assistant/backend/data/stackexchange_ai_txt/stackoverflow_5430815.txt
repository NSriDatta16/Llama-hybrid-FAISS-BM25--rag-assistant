jQuery UI : Combining Selectable with Draggable

I'm having a big problem trying to get my head round how the selectable() and draggable() components of jqueryUI can work together. They work fine on their own. I am trying to create a file browser type interface that users can select multiple files or drag INDIVIDUAL files to other droppable places in the app. I know a lot of people have been looking at ways to drag multiple files but this is not a requirement for me at the moment. In the example provided selectable works if using the mouse drag marquee box but no longer works for simple mouse clicks or crl click to select multiple (when draggable is enabled).
