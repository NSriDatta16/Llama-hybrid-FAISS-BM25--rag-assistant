If you really have large files (let's say larger than 100 MB), the best thing is to load only the things you need at the moment. Let's say you have a list of 10.000 customers - each with an image. It makes no sense to keep this list in the memory. For example, you could load all lastnames and the position of the person in the file. So the user could search for a person and you could load exactly that person. Another possibility would be loading the first ten and display them to the user. As soon as he clicks at a "Next" button you could load the next ten - just plan how to organize the information. Instead of very large files, databases can bring some advantages. They can abstract the large amout of work required to navigate within the file. "Single-Line-Serialization" using BinaryFormatter etc., however, reaches its limits at files of that size in my opinion. You have to think of other concepts.
