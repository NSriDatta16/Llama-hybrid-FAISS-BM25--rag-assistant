Hibernate Get List of a table's attribute

Hello everybody and sorry for the rather confusing question-title. I have a Hibernate Class configured using Annotations. This class has a String-attribute which contains the name of a company. What i need is to get a list of these String-attributes without needing to get all objects that contain the attribute. Is this possible using Criteria? Example: class Company { Customer customer; String companyName; } So I'd need a list with all companyName-Values and not a List of Company-Objects. Thanks in advance for any help! Best Regards, Robert
