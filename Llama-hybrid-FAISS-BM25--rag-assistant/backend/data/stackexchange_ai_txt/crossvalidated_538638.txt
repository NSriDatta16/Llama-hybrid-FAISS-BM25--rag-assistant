Problems with cross-validation for time-ordered data

Let's assume a simple scenario: You want to forecast the house prices of various properties. The dataset is cross-sectional in nature, as you only observe each property once. However, you also have a timestamp of the observation (month/year). In a sense, this means that the data is intrinsically time-ordered. In general, I know that with time series data, the use of e.g., k-fold cross-validation can be problematic. However, I don't have real time series data (multiple obs. for one house), but time-ordered data across houses. It is also clear that for time series data, there are other approaches such as rolling estimation. In particular, I would like to understand theoretically from a statistical/econometric perspective why this might be problematic rather than just intuitively. Does anyone have a theoretical guide to this topic or know of relevant literature to delve deeper into this topic? EDIT: Based on @Bj√∂rn's answer, it seems useful to provide more information about the goal here. The goal is actually to predict future prices based on the trained model.
