use cookies - they would work irrespective of your load balance environments other options include: 1) writing your sessionvalues to a sql database - you can configure your asp.net app to configure session state to use sql server - but this has its own problems as sessions never time out (so u need to handle this via code explicitly) 2) if not using sql server - basically you would face a problem when you have too many users and you implement load balancing on your web server - so a user can go to a different web server in the same session (and it would not work) there is a work around for this too - its called STICKY SESSIONS - where your web server guarantees your user would always hit the same web server within the session 3) with .net 2.0 provider model, you can even write your own session storage provider by implementing their delegates - so you can create your own xml files on your web server / shared server to read / write session data there :-) so there are many ways you can solve this. however the simplest and cost effective solution is to use cookies
