Checking CPU speed isn't really an Objective C thing, it is an OS thing. On OS X (and I assume iOS) you want to look at sysctlbyname(3) and the hw.cpufrequency property, something like: int hz; size_t hz_size = sizeof(hz); int rc = sysctlbyname("hw.cpufrequency", &hz, &hz_size, NULL, 0); if (0 == rc) { fprintf(stderr, "Clockspeed is %d hz\n", hz); } I don't know a good way to get the RPM of a disk drive, but I do know a bad way. Parse the output of system_profiler, the info is in there (as "Rotational Rate"): Hitachi HTS543232L9SA02: Capacity: 320.07 GB (320,072,933,376 bytes) Model: Hitachi HTS543232L9SA02 Revision: FB4AC50F Serial Number: (omitted) Native Command Queuing: Yes Queue Depth: 32 Removable Media: No Detachable Drive: No BSD Name: disk0 Rotational Rate: 5400 Medium Type: Rotational Partition Map Type: GPT (GUID Partition Table) S.M.A.R.T. status: Verified Volumes: Macintosh HD: Capacity: 319.73 GB (319,728,959,488 bytes) Available: 12.4 GB (12,397,940,736 bytes) Writable: Yes File System: Journaled HFS+ BSD Name: disk0s2 Mount Point: / There is likely a better abstraction to use, I just don't know it.
