MAE=10 implies that, on average, the forecast's distance from the true value is 10 (e.g true value is 200 and forecast is 190 or true value is 200 and forecast is 210 would be a distance of 10). MAPE=10 implies that, on average, the forecast's distance from the true value is 10% of the true value (e.g true value is 100 and forecast is 90 or true value is 100 and forecast is 110 would be a distance of 10%).
