Coding resources: Accessible introductions to Bayesian Structural Time series?

Hey, all. I am asking this question in not necessarily a "subjectively recommend something for me" approach, but with a clear focus on just an accessible beginner's reference. My situation is I have been learning the theory behind Bayesian structural time series, or state space models estimated utilizing Bayesian methods (some variant of MCMC), but have found it extremely difficult to locate succinct guides on implementing them. Books on cross-sectional Bayesian coding abound, are excellent, and are well-known, such as Bayesian Methods for Hackers and Doing Bayesian Analysis . However, the single resource I located on Bayesian time-series that is both 1) relatively new, 2) features more complex types of models (non-linear models, or HMM's), and 3) has full implementing code is Basic and Advanced Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling . Though featuring examples in BUGS, they seem included more for fullness, and the book does not attempt to explain how they were coded. So what do you all think is the best resource for coding more sophisticated Bayesian structural models, focusing on guiding you through its tool of choice ( Stan , JAGS , OpenBUGS , some random R library ...) rather than focusing on the theory? I hope the experienced Bayesians here can offer some pointers on where to get started.
