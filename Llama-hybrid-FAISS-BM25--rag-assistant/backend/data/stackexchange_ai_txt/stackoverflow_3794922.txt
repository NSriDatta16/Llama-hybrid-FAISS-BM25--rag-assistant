How do I use perlbrew to manage perl installations aimed at web applications?

I have been using perlbrew to manage multiple versions of perl on a Linux Fedora notebook. I have used it with great benefit to run command-line scripts mostly using App::cmd . I now want to move to running web applications written using CGI::Application using different perls installed in my $HOME . I am familiar with running Perl web applications in $HOME s using Apache's user_dir or creating Virtual Hosts but I am unable to come up with a clean way of integrating this and the perlbrew managed perls. Specifically I need help in understanding and finding answers to these questions: How do install mod_perl under perlbrew? Assuming this is done, how do I configure my VirtualHost so that it picks up the correct perl that is current? If this is not possible, (which I doubt) can I at least use local installations to run vanilla CGI ? Thank you for your attention.
