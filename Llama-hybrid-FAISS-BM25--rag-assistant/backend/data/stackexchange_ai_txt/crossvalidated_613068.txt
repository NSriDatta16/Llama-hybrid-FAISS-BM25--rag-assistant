Convolutional Neural Networks - resolution

I would like to ask you a question regarding CNNs. Is it possible to train CNNs for such kind of pictures (~ 1100 x 703 pixels). They are scatter plots, which can be classsified into 2 categories (signal and background) based on the patterns of the dots. However, as far as I know images in the CNN process are shrinked into 256 x 256 pixels. Do you think the CNN will be able to resolve patterns in such scatter plots? Thanks a lot in advance!
