We have only few details given here, but in general, the problem of estimating the underlying signal from noisy measurements seems to me like a Kalman filtering problem (or structural time series more generally). In the following, I follow very closely this textbook: https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/ , Chapter 6 and in the code I'm using the R package accompanying the textbook. (Here is how Kalman filter works in picutres: https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/ ) To illustrate how one would approach such a problem, conisder $p=3$ noisy measurements $y_t$ of the same underlying phenomenon $x_t$ . We can write this as $y_t = A x_t + \epsilon_t$ $x_{t+1} = \delta + \Phi x_t + \eta_t$ $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,R)$ , $\eta_t \sim N(0,Q)$ , $x_1 \sim N(\mu_0,\Sigma_1)$ For simplicity, let's say that in our case $\Phi = 1$ and $A =\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ , $\delta=0$ , and that $R = \begin{bmatrix} r_{11} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & r_{22} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & r_{33} \\\end{bmatrix}$ is diagonal matrix (meaning that the three measurements $y_{t,1}, y_{t,2}, y_{t,3}$ are uncorrelated). The four unknown parameters that we want to estimate are variance of $\eta$ , $Q$ , and variances of $\epsilon$ , $r_{ii}$ . The following code shows how to do setup the above model and estimate it. We can estimate this parameters by maximum likelihood, meaning the we will look for the values of these parameters for which the model-implied series of observations $\hat{y}_t$ resembles the actual one as much as possible. We start by creating some artificial data # library accompanying the book library("astsa") # for reproducibility set.seed(1); # dimensions of the problem in our case N Next, let's estimate the four parameters as described above # now setup the estimation procedure # see the textbook Ch. 6 for details input $par[1] cR1 par[2] cR2 $par[3] cR3 par[4] cR
