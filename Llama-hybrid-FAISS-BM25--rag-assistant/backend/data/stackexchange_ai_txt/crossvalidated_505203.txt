to my perspective, you can simply understand the characteristic equations as the restrictions of your target. Your target has to be the root of your characteristic equations. If you don't understand how the time series AR or MA or ARMA model come from, you can read the book "Analysis of Financial Time Series" by Ruey S. Tsay. I would also highly recommend you check out the youtube channel named "ritvikmath", his explanations of some terminologies are really easy to follow. We have to understand "what is stationarity" first. Normally we refer to "stationarity" as weakly stationarity since strict stationarity is a very strong condition and hard to verify empirically. The weak stationarity means the mean $/mu$ and the covariance $/sigma$ are constant or time-invariant. If the roots of the characteristic function are greater than 1, by the expression of mean and variance, they will not be time-invariant. That's why the roots have to be within the unit-circle.
