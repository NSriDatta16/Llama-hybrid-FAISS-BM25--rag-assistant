A purely discriminative approach is "regularized information maximisation" by Gomes et al . There is no notion of similarity/distance involved in it whatsoever. The idea is to have a logistic regression like model that puts points into bins. But instead of training it to maximise some form of log-likelihood of the class labels, the objective function is one that puts points into different clusters. To control the amount of clusters used by the model, an additional regularisation term weighted by the hyper parameter $\lambda$ is used. It boils down to a the inverse variance of a Gaussian prior over the weights. Extension to kernel methods or neural networks for non-linear clustering is straightforward.
