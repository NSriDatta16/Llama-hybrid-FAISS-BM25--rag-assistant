Although array_unique was mentioned twice now, I feel the answers failed to point out that you have to use the function on the nested array and not the array itself, so here is a usage example $array = array( 'Organization_id' => array(4,4,4) ); $array['Organization_id'] = array_unique( $array['Organization_id'] ); print_r($array); which will do what you want.
