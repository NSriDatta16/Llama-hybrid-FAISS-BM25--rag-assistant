In caterpillars, is diet more important than size in resistance to predators?

I am trying to determine if caterpillars that eat a natural diet (monkeyflower) are more resistant to predators (ants) than caterpillars that eat an artificial diet (a mixture of wheat germ and vitamins). I did a trial study with a small sample size (20 caterpillars; 10 per diet). I weighed each caterpillar prior to the experiment. I offered a pair of caterpillars (one per diet) to a group of ants for a period of five minutes, and counted the number of times that each caterpillar was rejected. I repeated this process ten times. This are what my data look like (A = artificial diet, N = natural diet): Trial A_Weight N_Weight A_Rejections N_Rejections 1 0.0496 0.1857 0 1 2 0.0324 0.1112 0 2 3 0.0291 0.3011 0 2 4 0.0247 0.2066 0 3 5 0.0394 0.1448 3 1 6 0.0641 0.0838 1 3 7 0.0360 0.1963 0 2 8 0.0243 0.145 0 3 9 0.0682 0.1519 0 3 10 0.0225 0.1571 1 0 I am attempting to run an ANOVA in R. This is what my code looks like (0 = Artificial diet, 1 = Natural diet; all vectors are organized with data for the ten artificial diet caterpillars first, followed by data for the ten natural diet caterpillars): diet And these are what my results look like: Analysis of Variance Table Response: Rejections Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Diet 1 11.2500 11.2500 9.8044 0.006444 ** Weight 1 0.0661 0.0661 0.0576 0.813432 Diet:Weight 1 0.0748 0.0748 0.0652 0.801678 Residuals 16 18.3591 1.1474 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 My questions are: Is ANOVA appropriate here? I realize the small sample size would be an issue with any statistical test; this is just a trial study that I'd like to run stats on for a class presentation. I do plan to redo this study with a larger sample size. Have I entered my data into R correctly? Is this telling me that diet is significant, but weight is not?
