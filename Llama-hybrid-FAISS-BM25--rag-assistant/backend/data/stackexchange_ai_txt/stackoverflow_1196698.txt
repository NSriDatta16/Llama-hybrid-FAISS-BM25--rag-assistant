I think Kylotan has the right strategy. Baseball has stats for everything. Simulate a game to the most detailed level you can manage. Combine player stats to determine a percentage chance for every outcome. Use randomness to decide the outcome. For instance: The chance of a hit is based on Batting Average, Pitcher's ERA, etc. The opposing team's feilding percent determines the chance an out becomes an error. Every stat you display to the 'manager' when selecting lineups should have some effect on gameplay - otherwise the manager is making decisions based on misleading information.
