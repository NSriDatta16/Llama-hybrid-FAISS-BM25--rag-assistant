We recently upgraded our Swing-application (lots of drag and drop) from 1.4 to 1.6 to get the concurrent facilities, and we have not seen a single issue which is due to Java itself. We also want to go to the Nimbus Look and Feel since the Windows look and feel doesn't look and feel like Windows. The killer feature you should show your boss, is how to attach to the application using jvisualvm to introspect the running program in case of issues.
