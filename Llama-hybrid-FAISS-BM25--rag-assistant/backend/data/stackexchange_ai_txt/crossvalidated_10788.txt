Methods to best test lead/lag relationships

I was wondering if you can share your experiences on what you feel is the best method to test lead / lag relationships between I(1) time series variables (i.e stock prices) and advantages and disadvantages of your proposed method(s). Also if you have links to academic papers that further describe these methods I would greatly appreciate them. I have read several papers that speak of VECMs, IRSUR, simple OLS, threshold regression etc.. but I'm not sure which to use for my study. I am trying to establish lead/lag relationships in intraday stock data returns (using 1 minute price time series) between stock prices of ~50 companies in one particular sector. Appreciate the help.
