Comparing a value to a set of values

I'll start off by saying I know very little about statistics, and I'm not sure if some of these methods would even make sense, statistically, to the more initiated statistician. But, I have a vector of data, $V$ , and a new piece of data, $\beta$ , and I want a way of calculating how 'unexpected' this new value is. I.e. how out of character it is, how much it doesn't follow the trend, how different it is from what would be expected, given the previous values (in their order). My data is not normalised (but could be if that would make it better?) and I know it follows a power-law distribution. Most likely beta or pareto. Once I find a way I'll also be weighting the data. I came up with a few methods, so if someone could tell me which is best, or if they don't even make sense, or if something already exists that would be far better I'd appreciate it. A bonus if the value could be in the range $[-1, 1]$ , although I don't see how... Comparing the distance to the mean I think I'm correct in saying the variance of some data is the average squared distance to the mean. So, the squared distance of the new value, $\beta$ , to the mean, $\mu$ , could also be measured. I.e. $(\beta - \mu)^2$ . Then I had a few ideas of how to compare it: Largest distance If the largest value is $M$ , then perhaps some metric like: $$ \frac{(\beta - \mu)^2 - \sigma^2}{(M - \mu)^2} $$ Simple ratio $$ \frac{(\beta - \mu)^2 - \sigma^2}{\sigma^2} $$ Adding to the set If the vector $V$ has the new value, $\beta$ , appended to it, so that it's a new vector of data $U = V ; \beta$ , then the standard deviation (or variation?) could be compared. Something like: $$ \frac{\sigma_V^2 - \sigma_U^2}{\sigma_U^2} $$ I'm sure there's some far better way I just don't know about. If there is please tell me :) Thanks.
