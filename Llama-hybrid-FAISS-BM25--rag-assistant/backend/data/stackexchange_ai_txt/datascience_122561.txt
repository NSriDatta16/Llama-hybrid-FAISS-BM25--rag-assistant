annotation file for ham10000

I am attempting to train a Faster R-CNN model using the HAM10000 dataset. However, I have been unable to locate an annotation file specifically for this dataset. I am seeking guidance on the most effective approach to annotate bounding boxes for this dataset. Is there any possibility of automating this process to streamline the annotation procedure?
