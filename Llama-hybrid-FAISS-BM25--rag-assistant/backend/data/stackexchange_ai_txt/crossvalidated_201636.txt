Correlation between matrix variables and its PCA scores

Suppose a matrix $X$ and $T$ the score matrix obtained from a PCA decomposition of $X$. Denote as $x_i$ and $t_i$ the columns of $X$ and $T$ respectively. Is there any reason for which $cor(x_i, t_1) > cor(x_i, t_j)$ ??? In other words, the variables of $X$ are more correlated with the score obtained from the first principal component?
