How can we interpret the learning curve including loss for training and test in a deep learning model?

I am working on 3D medical image segmentation area. It may take 2-3 days to finish one round of training. How can I interpret the learning curve if over-fitting is happening or not? It happens to me that learning curve shows that loss is decreasing but in fact the model over-fits on data. I have problem of knowing and detecting it in advance. I would really appreciate if there is any helpful link, please share here. Your help is really appreciated.
