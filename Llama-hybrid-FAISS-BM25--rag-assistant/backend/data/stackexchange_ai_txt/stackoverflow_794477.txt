I think it depends on how many pages there are, if there are not too many, you could create a template and use a wysiwyg editor to copy and paste the content. However if you need to do it programaticaly I would suggest parsing the html to extract the content. Or cleaning it up, If you have access to it you can use Expression Web, which I used for a similar task, you can clean the html and only leave the header tags, paragraph etc, then you can apply css to it to format it in the design you wish. However it might take longer to write code to do it than do it manualy. Sometimes nothing is faster than by hand. Good luck
