Embedding Razor views in class library as resources

I'm using VirtualPathProvider to provide themed views. In action method I want to return a view by path return View("~/Themes/SomeTheme.dll/Views/Content/Item.cshtml"); In Visual Studio Item.cshtml has a build action "Embedded Resource". VirtualPathProvider finds that .cshtml file, but I get an error The view at '~/Themes/SomeTheme.dll/Views/Content/Item.cshtml' must derive from WebViewPage, or WebViewPage . I guess I have to compile that view and I've followed these instructions . Now the VirtualPathProvider can't find the Item.cshtml because it's not an embedded resource anymore. How do I solve this problem? I can't add reference to that SomeTheme.dll because activated theme is loaded dynamically at application start. I've done this before with aspx files and those didn't need to be compiled. They worked out of the box as embedded resources.
