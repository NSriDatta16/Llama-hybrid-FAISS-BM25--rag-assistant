How to interpret the tau statistics in the Mann-Kendall test

How should the tau number from a Mann-Kendall test be interpreted? I've read that for trends to be detected by the test they must be monotonic. If I have data across years, group them by calendar month and then run the Mann-Kendall test and get a value of .3 for Jan, does that mean that all the previous Jans had a lower average value year on year? And does the 0.3 have any real mean in terms of its value, by that I mean can I infer that each year that month's mean raises by 3%?
