If the form is never seen by the user, Top and Left aren't really applicable, are they? Since they're related to the visual position, and there isn't a visual position... Once the user has been shown the form at least once, you can capture the Top and Left into local variables before hiding it again, and use those local vars for storage of the position when the form is freed. Then you have an initial position for the next time the form is made visible.
