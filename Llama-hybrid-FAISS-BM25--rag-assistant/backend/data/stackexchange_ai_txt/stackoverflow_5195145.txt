If your instructor would have the moral to teach you programming the way it should be done then they'd encourage you to solve the problem like so, with four lines of code: #include #include // ... std::vector cards; // fill it in ... std::random_shuffle(cards.begin(), cards.end()); Using the standard library is the right way of doing things. Writing code on your own when you can solve the problem with the standard library is the wrong way of doing things. Your instructor doesn't teach you right. If they want to get a point across (say, have you practice using pointers) then they should be more attentive in selecting the exercise they give you. That speech given, here is a solution worse than the above but better than your instructor's: 52 times do the following: Choose two random none-equal integers in the range [0,52). Swap the values in the array corresponding to these positions.
