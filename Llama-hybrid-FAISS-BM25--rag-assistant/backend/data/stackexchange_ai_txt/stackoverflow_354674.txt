I wonder if the RTL/VCL calls you're making are expecting access to some thread-local storage (TLS) variables that aren't correctly set up whn you invoke your code via the timer queue? This isn't the answer to your problem, but are you aware that TTimer OnTimer events just run as part of the normal message loop in the main VCL thread?
