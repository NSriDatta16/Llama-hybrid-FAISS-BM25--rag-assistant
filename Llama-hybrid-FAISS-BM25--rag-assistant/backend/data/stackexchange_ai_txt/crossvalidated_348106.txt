Continuous or categorical data. Modeling depth, that is continuous through a range of values, but has a max depth that is discrete

I'm modeling depth to bedrock. These data are continuous through a range of depths, but have a max value that equates to as far as we could dig with our soil auger. So they are continuous through a range, but there is a max value that is discrete that appears on multiple samples. I have been doing exploratory data analysis with multiple regression and Random Forest. Should I being treating theses data as classes, or categories?
