SharePoint 2010 offers to save Pdf documents instead of opening in the browser

We just migrated my sites from 2007 to 2010. Now SharePoint 2010 offers to save Pdf document when clicking on the document in the document library. MOSS2007 was showing Pdf documents in the browser. I have checked other posts and Web Application has Browser File Handling set to "Permissive". Please advise what else I can do. Thanks, Robert
