We've always logged data to a separate database. This lets us query without impacting the application database. It also simplifies things if we realize that we need to disable logging or change the amount of what we log. But most modern logging libraries support embedding the logging into your application and choosing the destination by configuration - file, database, whatever. Logger gives you lots of ways to manage your logging, and although the default package doesn't have a database logger, it wouldn't be hard to write such an event handler.
