HTML table, horizontal scroll which tracks headings and vertical scroll- problem with text width

Ok firstly apologies if you recognise some of my earlier posts today. I have a piece of HTML i wrote, which seemed the only way to do this. Horizontal scroll which follows keeps the thead aligned with tbody as you move tbody. Vertical scroll which still keeps the thead in view. The only way i could do this was using two tables. This works and feel free to try it. However, i have a problem with the way in which the widths of columns are being determined by the size of the text inside them and not the width property i set. Can anyone help? I simply want the width of a column to mean the width of a column EDIT: the reason for the 1200 widths is because inside the overflow div the actual size is 8x 150px function MatchScroll(SourceID, TargetID, DoIfMoz) { if (DoIfMoz || navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") == -1) document.getElementById(TargetID).scrollLeft = document.getElementById(SourceID).scrollLeft; } t t tt t t ttttt ttttt tt 1 1 1 1 1111111111 1 1 1
