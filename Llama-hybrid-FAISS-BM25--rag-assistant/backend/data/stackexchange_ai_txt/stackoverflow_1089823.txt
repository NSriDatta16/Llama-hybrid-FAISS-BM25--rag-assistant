Is there a JToolBar replacement that offers more functionality?

I'm creating a simple Swing application, then I realized that JToolBar doesn't provide much functionality. For example, I want to add multiple dragable toolbars onto one JFrame, but but I can only have one floatable JToolBar per JFrame if I use JToolbar. I know that NetBeans is built with Swing, and the toolbars on NetBeans have more functionality then JToolBars. I haven't spent my time to take a peak at NetBeans source yet, but I"m wondering whether there's any other existing replacement for JToolBar out int the world.
