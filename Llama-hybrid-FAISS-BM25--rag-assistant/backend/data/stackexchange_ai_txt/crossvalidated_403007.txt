Ordinal regression is for ordinal responses , so you do not need such models. You can use logistic regression, the question is how to represent the ordinal predictors. That depends also on information you did not give us, such as number of observations (logistic regression tends to be rather data-hungry, see Minimum number of observations for logistic regression? .) In R you can represent the likert variables as ordered factors , that way they will be represented as orthogonal polynomials. But that will use four df for each variables, which is probably to much. As an alternative you can represent them as numeric variables, but use maybe quadratic polys to represent them. That way you get some indication of nonlinearity. Another viewpoint is here: Likert scaled covariates and binary logistic regression
