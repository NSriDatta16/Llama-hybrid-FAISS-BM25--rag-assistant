To fulfill the requirement of retrieving the content of the editor on a page at some later point in time you will need to: On user submission in your editor: Send the content of the editor to the server in a POST request. On the server, read the content sent in the POST request. Store it in the database in a format which you can either a) embed in an html document b) translate to a form you can embed in an html document. On the server when handling a request for a document that should show the submitted content: Read the content from the database. Write the content to the page using.

That depends on how your JavaScript editor is allowing users to add images to content. For example, is it uploading them to the server and then embedding an image tag with the uri of the uploaded image?
