The finalize() method may be invoked explicitly on the foo instance, or it may be invoked by the garbage collector when it tries to reclaim the storage occupied by that object. If bar is a valid instance, it sets the REFERENCE field to the foo instance. From the garbage collector's point of view, this increases foo 's reference count. If an exception is thrown inside the finalize() method (e.g. such as a NullPointerException due to bar being null ), then the finalization process simply terminates. N.B. As others have pointed out.. your example is definitely something to be avoided.
