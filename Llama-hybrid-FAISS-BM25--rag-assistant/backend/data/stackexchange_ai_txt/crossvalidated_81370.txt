The most obvious thing that comes in mind would be binary response models. In your case I would probably recommend applying logistic regression. It can be done using glm function (for Generalized Linear Models) in R. In this case glm(formula = Status ~ Age + Tenure + Function + Gender + Race + Grade Level , family = binomial(logit), data = yourdata)
