Features to encode the time-evolving nature of a time series

I am clustering time series data. Each entry is an univariate time series. Aim is to mine relevant features to classify the series. I looked up here , and other general references for this purpose. Most of the features used encode information about the entire time series. But in my case, based on the exploratory analysis, almost all time series are evolving with time, i.e. the means, spectral powers are all changing with time.(ex: The simple average is decreasing for half the entries over time, and increasing for the rest) How do I take these evolving features into account? The above-mentioned reference has one possible solution, using an ARIMA model . Is there a simpler way to do this, without involving model-fitting? Moreover, what about features like the spectral distribution, etc? One way is to create blocks of the time series, and say compute the mean for each block and use all of these as variables in the clustering. But here the partitioning size is subjective, and there is no single index to account for the resultant trend, making the clustering difficult. I'm doing the analysis in R, in case the algorithms that can be used are limited by the programming language.
