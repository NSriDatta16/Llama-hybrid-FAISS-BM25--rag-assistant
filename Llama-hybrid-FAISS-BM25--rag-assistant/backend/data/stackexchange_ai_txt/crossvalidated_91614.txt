As already noted by others, overdispersion doesn't apply in the case of a Bernoulli (0/1) variable, since in that case, the mean necessarily determines the variance. In the context of logistic regression, this means that if your outcome is binary, you can't estimate a dispersion parameter. (N.B. This does not mean that you can ignore potential correlation between observations just because your outcome is binary!) If, on the other hand, your outcome is a set of proportions, then you can estimate a dispersion parameter (which, although often greater than one, can also be less than one) by dividing the Pearson chi-squared statistic (or the deviance) by the residual degrees of freedom. Remember, logistic regression with a purely binary outcome is just a special case of the more general logistic regression model in which the binomial index can exceed one (and can vary across observations). Thus, the question of whether you're fitting a logistic regression model or not is unrelated to the question of whether your data are overdispersed.
