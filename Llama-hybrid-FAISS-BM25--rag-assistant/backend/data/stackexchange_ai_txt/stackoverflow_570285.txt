Concise foreach expression in one line

In Perl, one can often avoid using control blocks, like this: print "$_\n" foreach(@files); instead of: foreach(@files){ print "$_\n"; } How does this syntax work in the following, more complex case: die("Not a file: $_") unless -f $_ foreach(@files); It gives me a syntax error. I'm not trying to write obfuscated code, it's just an unimportant part in the program, and so I want to express it as concisely as possible. SUMMARIZED ANSWERS: I can accept only one answer as the accepted answer, but I like the following ones from Chris and Jon best. This one uses foreach as I intended, but without the syntax error : -f or die "Not a file: $_" foreach @files; And the following one is at least as good. I like that die is at the beginning of the statement because that's what the reader's attention should be directed toward: die("Not a file: $_") for grep {!-f} @files;
