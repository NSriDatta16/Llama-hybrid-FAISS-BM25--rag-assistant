There is no simple way to use a wizard control in ASP.NET MVC. Because ASP.NET MVC is not Web forms, so you should stop thinking webformy and start thinking the MVC way . A better thing to do would be to leverage jQuery and partials (Partial Views) to come up with a nice user experience which walks the user through some predefined steps.
