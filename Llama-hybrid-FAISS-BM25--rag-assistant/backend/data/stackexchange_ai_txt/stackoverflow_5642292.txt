problem surrounding my website with a border using div tags

I want a div border to surround my entire website but instead the border is not moving dynamically as i add elements to the page. Instead it just surrounds the first 2 elements, the text and the image but not my tabled menu, but if i delete the div tag surrounding my table then the border will surround the table. I need the div tags to organise my site though so can anyone help me please... The problem seems to come from the float tag in the content_col1 div tag but i need float to place div tags next to each other. Heres the HTML Welcome to the greatest local online grocery store the world has ever seen! Bakery Vegetables Sweets Meats Dairy Bakery Vegetables Sweets and here's the CSS #content { background: #eee; border: 5px solid #68accc; padding: 0px; } #content_topTitle { text-align: center; height: 35px; line-height: 35px; font-weight: bold; } #content_images { width:880px;height:200px; } #content_col1 { float: left; width: 130px; padding: 10px; }
