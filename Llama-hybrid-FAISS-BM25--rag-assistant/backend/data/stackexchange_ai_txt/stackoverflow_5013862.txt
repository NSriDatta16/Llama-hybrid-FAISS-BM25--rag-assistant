In the end, we resorted to creating a few extra classes (inheriting from TPersistent ) for the storage of the array properties; it turned out there was only a limited set of array types. Delphi's indexed properties turned out to be really useful: we could just specify one getter function, and define most fixed elements of the array as separate properties referencing that one getter, and an index. Those properties now get serialized as proper XML elements, with the proper name as well. Adding constructors and destructors to all classes using them took a few tedious hours, though. Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions!
