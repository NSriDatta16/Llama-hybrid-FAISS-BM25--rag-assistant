Parsing natural language with regex is impossible. Forget it. As a drastic example: How would you find the verbs (marked with asterisks) in this sentence? Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo* buffalo* Buffalo buffalo While you'll hardly come across extreme cases like this, there are dozens of verbs that could also be nouns, adjectives etc if you just look at the word. You need a natural language parser like Stanford NLP . I have never used one, so I don't know how good your results are going to be, but better than with Regex, I can tell you that.
