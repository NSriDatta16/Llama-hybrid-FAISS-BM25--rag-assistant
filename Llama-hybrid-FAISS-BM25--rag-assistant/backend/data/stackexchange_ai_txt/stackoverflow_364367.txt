Fastest way to move files on a Windows System

I want to move about 800gb of data from an NTFS storage device to a FAT32 device (both are external hard drives), on a Windows System. What is the best way to achieve this? Simply using cut-paste? Using the command prompt ? ( move ) Writing a batch file to copy a small chunks of data on a given interval ? Use some specific application that does the job for me? Or any better idea...? What is the most safe, efficient and fast way to achieve such a time consuming process?
