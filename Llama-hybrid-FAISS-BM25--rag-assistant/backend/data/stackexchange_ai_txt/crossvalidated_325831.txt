As far as I know, Granger causality on its own is not typically used in economics for model-building. Cointegration is more widely used, where time series tests like the ADF and Johansen tests are used to identify cointegrated relationships between variables. (Note that other tests may be used, some more rigorous than others). The two concepts are related: the presence of a cointegrated relationship implies Granger causality in one or both directions. For a cointegrated series, you may then model the relationship using a VECM on differences or a VAR on levels. (I'll leave it as general as that, since it depends on what exactly you're modelling and various other properties of the series.)
