I read Freedman (almost the entire book) and OpenIntro Statistics (more than a third). Both of these books are quite good. I eventually found the book that came close to what I was looking for: Learning Statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners by Danielle Navarro. It is freely available online (legally) and you can also order a print version for about US $30 (see the book page for details). The main pros of this book are: R implementations embedded in text as topics are introduced. R has built-in functions for most of the methods explained in the book. Where R doesn't have a built-in, the author has written her own function for it and made it available on CRAN under her lsr library, so your learning is quite complete. I personally found this to be the biggest plus point of this book. The book is more comprehensive than Freedman and OpenIntro. Along with the basics, it covers topics like Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcoxon test, Spearman correlation, trimmed means and a chapter on Bayesian statistics, to name a few. The motivation behind each topic is explained clearly. There is also a good amount of history behind the topics, so you get to appreciate how a method was arrived at. The book was written iteratively with feedback from readers and I believe the author is still improving upon the book. The only drawback is that the hard copy version is large and heavy!
