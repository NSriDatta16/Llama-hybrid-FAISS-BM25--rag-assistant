I guess you can then. Just for the record though, I leave my paragraph to explain why Oracle behaves like that if you have a simple unique index on two columns: Oracle will never accept two (1, null) pairs if the columns are uniquely indexed. A pair of 1 and a null, is considered an "indexable" pair. A pair of two nulls cannot be indexed, that's why it lets you insert as many null,null pairs as you like. (1, null) gets indexed because 1 can be indexed. Next time you try to insert (1, null) again, 1 is picked up by the index and the unique constraint is violated. (null,null) isn't indexed because there is no value to be indexed. That's why it doesn't violate the unique constraint.
