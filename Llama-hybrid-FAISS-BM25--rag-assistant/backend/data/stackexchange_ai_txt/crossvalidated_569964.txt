density function estimation using neural network

I firstly generate data from a bivariate normal distribution with mean (0,0) and var cov (2, 0.5; 0.5, 2) . Here is my code for it: n Now what I want to do is ignore that I know the data is normal. I would like to approximate the density function using a neural network and compare the estimated model and the true one. I try to search the literature and I found "Density estimation addresses one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, the problem of discovering structure from data in an unsupervised manner". in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13233.pdf I am wondering can the Neural Density Estimation be implemented on this problem?
