Negative examples for a Yes/No image classification neural network

I am trying to retrain a neural network using transfer learning that can classify whether an image has a certain object, say, a car. My positive sample dataset is quite small, only 2500~ images. It works really well with "regular" binary classification (2500 images of cars/2500 images of flowers and it has to differentiate between those two), but the problem is that I am not sure how to make it classify for all types of images, or how to make it 2500 images of cars/2500 random images and it would have to classify whether Yes - the image is a car or No - it is not a car. What would those random images be? Thanks.
