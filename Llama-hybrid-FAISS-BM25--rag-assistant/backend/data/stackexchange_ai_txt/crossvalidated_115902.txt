Neither the 5% type one error rate nor the 80% figure for power are universal. For example, particle physicists tend to use a "5 sigma" criterion that corresponds to a notional type I error rate that is roughly on the order of one in a million. Indeed, I doubt your average physicist has even heard of Cohen. But one reason why the two error rates you quote should be different would be that the cost of the two error types would not be the same. As to why the type I error rate is often taken at 5%, part of the reason (some of the historical background for the convention) is discussed here .
