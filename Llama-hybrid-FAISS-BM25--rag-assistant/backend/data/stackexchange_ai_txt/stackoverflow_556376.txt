I would advice against switching fonts(°) on hover. In this case it's just the menu items moving a bit, but I've seen cases where the complete paragraph gets reformatted because the widening causes an extra word wrap. You don't want to see this happen when the only thing you do is move the cursor; if you don't do anything the page layout should not change. The shift can also happen when switching between normal and italic. I would try changing colors, or toggle underline if you have room below the text. (underlining should stay clear from the bottom border) I would be boo'd if I used switching fonts for my Form Design class :-) (°) The word font is often misused. "Verdana" is a typeface , "Verdana normal" and "Verdana bold" are different fonts of the same typeface.
