Detect and apply restriction to objects/ paths using Intersection library

All, Further to my post here , @Phrogz suggested we look into Kevin Lindsey's library for our needs of identifying the borders and applying restrictions. Has anyone got any experience of using this library? THE PROBLEM: In our web application we have an object made of SVG paths. We are trying to implement the functionality of drag and drop of other objects inside this object, with restrictions needing to be in place that the objects cannot be dropped outside the this SVG object. Upon Phrogz recommendation, we looked into this but are struggling to make sense of how to pass the object. Do we pass the objects as path string or as SVG object. ERROR: At this moment, we are not getting any output, not even sure if its accepting the objects we pass through. This is quite an open question and Im particularly keen on hearing from individuals who might know a thing or two about Kevin's library/ how it works/ functionality. Cheers
