I recommend NEVER using the @ operator. It encourages bad code and can make your life miserable when something doesn't work and you're trying to debug it. You can of course disable notices in php.ini, but if I were you I would start using isset() more :) You can do something like this: echo ' '; You can read more about how horrible @ is, here: http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php Well, it's the actual error triggering that is expensive. Using @ triggers the error. Checking with isset() instead, does not. http://seanmonstar.com/post/909029460/php-error-suppression-performance
