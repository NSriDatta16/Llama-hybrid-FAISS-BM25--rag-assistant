Exclude system paths from django_coverage

I'm running django_coverage over a project with the command test_coverage . It's working, but it's including in the output and final calculation code in /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages . I'm not interested in knowing about the coverage of those modules, only the test coverage for my project. I see in the django_coverage documentation on BitBucket that there is a COVERAGE_PATH_EXCLUDES , but that seems to apply only to subdirectories of the project and not absolute system paths. Also, I see that the default for COVERAGE_MODULE_EXCLUDES is to exclude any imports with "django" in it, but I'm still getting output for /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/django . Any thoughts on how to fix this?
