simulation of an item response theory 2PL model

I would like to simulate a 2PL probit model. I want to set up some arbitrary item parameters $a=(a_1,...,a_J)$ , $b=(b_1,...,b_J)$ and abilities $\theta=(\theta_1,...,\theta_I)$ ( $J$ number of items and $I$ number of individuals), then fit a Bayesian model with flat prior distributions for those parameters. I could do it using the mirt package (function 'simdata'), but I want to do it by hand. So, I would appreciate it if somebody could respond to the questions: -how does 'simdata' does in order to obtain a dataset of responses? -assigning flat prior distributions to $a$ , $b$ and $\theta$ will necessarily yield posterior estimates close to the values of those parameters arbitrarily chosen? thanks in advance.
