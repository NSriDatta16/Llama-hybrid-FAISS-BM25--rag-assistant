I am no Redis expert, but from what I've gathered, both are pretty different. Redis : Is not a relational database (no fancy data organisation) Stores everything in memory (faster, less space, probably less safe in case of a crash) Is less widely deployed on various webhosts (if you're not hosting yourself) I think you might want to use Redis for when you have a small-ish quantity of data that doesn't need the relational structure that MySQL offers, and requires fast access. This could for example be session data in a dynamic web interface that needs to be accessed often and fast. Redis could also be used as a cache for some MySQL data which is going to be accessed very often (ie: load it when a user logs in). I think you're asking the question the wrong way around, you should ask yourself which one is more suited to an application, rather than which application is suited to a system ;)
