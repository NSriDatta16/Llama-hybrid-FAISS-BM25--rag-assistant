I don't believe that Magento's native attribute model supports sub-attributes, however you could use Tags as they are non-hierarchical. Not that I know much about art(!), but I would guess that some forms of art would cross the hierarchical boundaries anyway... One downside is that they won't be filterable in the Layered Navigation, but you could potentially write an extension to include tags in the Layers. You can manage the list of tags in Catalog>All Tags, and assign tags to individual products on the Edit Product screen under the Product Tags tab.
