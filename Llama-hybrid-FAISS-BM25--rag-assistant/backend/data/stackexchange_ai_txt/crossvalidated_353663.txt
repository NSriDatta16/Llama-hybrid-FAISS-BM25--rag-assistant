Common methods to calculate total distance from data with categorical, continuous and counting variables

I have a data set with categorical, continuous and counting variables. I want to be able to use a method that will give me a distance for each pairwise data point. From my understanding, each type of variable should be treated differently in order to get an equally weighted distance. http://www.econ.upf.edu/~michael/stanford/maeb4.pdf For continuous variables the standard Euclidean Distance can be used. $d_{x,y} = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^j\frac{1}{s_j^2}({x_j}-{y_j})^2}$ Where $s_j$ is the standard deviation of the $j^{th}$ element. For Counting variables, the distance can be calculated like this: $\chi_{x,y} = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^j\frac{1}{c_j}(x_j-y_j)^2}$ where $c_j$ is the $j^{th}$ element of the average profile For categorical variables: $d_{x,y} = \frac{{\sum_{j=1}^j}(2f_j)}{2j}$ where $f_j$ is equal to 1 when the variables match and zero when they don't. Given that all three methods listed above output distances with different scales, simply adding them together would put heavier weights on certain data types depending on the specific data set. My question is, what are some common methods to tackle the problem of calculating a total distance given these different data types?
