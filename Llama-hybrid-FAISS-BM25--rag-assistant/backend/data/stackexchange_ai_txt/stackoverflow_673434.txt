Is there a Python library for easily writing zoomable UI's?

My next work is going to be heavily focused on working with data that is best understood when organized on a two-dimensional zoomable plane or canvas, instead of using lists and property forms. The library can be based on OpenGL, GTK+ or Cairo. It should allow me to: build widgets out of vector shapes and text (perhaps even SVG based?) arrange these widgets on a 2D plane catch widget-related events zoom deeply into a widget to reveal additional data arrange widgets in a tree animate widgets fluidly It wouldn't hurt if it would also allow for some databinding or model/view concept.
