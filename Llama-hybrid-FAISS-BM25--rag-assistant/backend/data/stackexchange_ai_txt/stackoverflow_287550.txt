As with all security decisions, there are tradeoffs. If you hash the password, which is probably your easiest move, you can't offer a password retrieval function that returns the original password, nor can your staff look up a person's password in order to access their account. You can use symmetric encryption, which has its own security drawbacks. (If your server is compromised, the symmetric encryption key may be compromised also). You can use public-key encryption, and run password retrieval/customer service on a separate machine which stores the private key in isolation from the web application. This is the most secure, but requires a two-machine architecture, and probably a firewall in between.
