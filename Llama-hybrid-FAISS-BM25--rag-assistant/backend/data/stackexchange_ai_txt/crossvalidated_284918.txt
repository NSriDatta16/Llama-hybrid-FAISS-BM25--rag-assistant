I asked a similar question: Methods for testing a Bayesian method's software implementation and got this answer from @jaradniemi: Bayesians don't lose the relative frequency-based interpretation of probability. In particular, if you define this procedure: simulate from the prior, then simulate from the model using those values from the prior, and estimate the parameters using the same prior. Then your credible intervals should have the appropriate frequentist coverage, i.e. 95% intervals should include the true parameter in 95% of your analyses, over repeated replicates of the procedure. I think he's right. You're allowed to stray from the relative-frequency concept of probability as a bayesian, but you don't automatically lose it. And if you're generating data, you definitely haven't lost it. Regarding your question about conditional vs unconditional , while each individual credible interval would be conditional on the data, the relative-frequency based coverage would be unconditional since you're averaging over draws of the data. You can also search the web for "frequentist properties of bayesian methods" and get quite a few hits.
