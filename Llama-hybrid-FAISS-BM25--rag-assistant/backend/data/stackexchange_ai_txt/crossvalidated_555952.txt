How is UMAP a valid dimensionality reduction technique when it uses KNN, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality?

I have not a found a satisfactory, or really any answer, to the following problem that I cannot resolve myself. UMAP is touted as an excellent dimensionality reduction technique by constructing a high-dimensional topological graph, and then reconstructing said graph in low dimensional space. However, UMAP uses KNN to construct the high dimensional graph . How is this valid? If we're using UMAP to escape the curse of dimensionality by collapsing some of the feature space, why are we uses KNN to do this, a technique which suffers directly from the curse of dimensionality ? Any discussion/explanation would really be appreciated!
