I'm following the line hinted in @gung's comment. You should compare a model by its goal. The goal of a model is not a question os machine learning or statistic, in is question of the business domain and its needs. Accuracy is a very common and useful measure. However, if you are dealing with fraud the model "Everybody are OK" will have very high accuracy. That high accuracy will be misleading since the model is useless for fraud detection. If you are digging for gold (a scenario in which you have huge benefit from a true positive, not too high cost of a false positive) then recall is a good measure. If you are trying to decide whether to perform a complex medical procedure on people (high cost of false positive, hopefully a low cost of false negative), precision is the measure you should use.
