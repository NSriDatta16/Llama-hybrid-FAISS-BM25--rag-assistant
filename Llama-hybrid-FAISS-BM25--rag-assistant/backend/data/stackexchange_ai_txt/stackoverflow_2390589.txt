Multi Row Tables Always Vertically Center Content

I've basically got a table with 2 rows and it looks like this: --------- | | | | | | | | | |-------- My problem is that the second row auto centers vertically like this: |hey| | |hey|hey| |hey| | |-------- How so right now I'm adding paragraphs until it just becomes the size of the other: |hey|hey| |hey| | |hey| | |-------- How can I do this correctly using CSS?
