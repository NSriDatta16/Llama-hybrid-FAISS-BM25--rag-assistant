I think the key to how many answers you'll get is in how you define "model", and how strong your definition of "cannot be replicated" is. If you drop the "especially for time series that cannot be replicated", the answer is every social and physical science models time series. From biology's predator-prey models to engineering "inventing" the Kalman Filter. If "cannot be replicated" can mean "is difficult to replicate" or "cannot be replicated exactly", that opens a lot of doors, including psychology, etc. Or do you mean "intervention is impossible"? In that case, astronomy would be applicable. (Astronomers can't manipulate their targets, but they do have many examples to look at.) In terms of "model", does curve-fitting apply? That is, if a paper fits a curve to certain data is that a model? Or are you insisting on a kind of first-principles kind of models?
