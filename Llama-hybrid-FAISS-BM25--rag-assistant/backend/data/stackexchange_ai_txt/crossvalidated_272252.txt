Have you considered using a weighted moving average? I've used it in several applications where I needed a smoothed average. In a moving or rolling average, you have to remember all of the last N data points and add them up over and over again. With a weighted moving average, you only have to remember two values: the numerator and the denominator. It works like this: $A_1 = X_1$ $A_2 = \frac{A_1*F + X_2}{F + 1}$ $A_3 = \frac{A_1*F^2 + A_2*F + X_3}{ F^2 + F + 1}$ . . . $A_i = \frac{A1*F^{i-1} + A2*F^{i-2} + ... + A_i}{ F^{i-1} + F^{i-2} + ... + 1}$ This can be simplified by realizing that each successive numerator can be calculated as: $N[i+1] = N[i] * F + x[i]$ and each successive denominator by $D[i+1] = D[i] * F + 1$ then $A[i+1] = \frac{N[i+1]}{ D[i+1]}$ F is the weighting or discounting factor; $0 It sounds like something like F = 0.99 might work for you. A search on "weighted moving average" will turn up lots of examples and explanations.
