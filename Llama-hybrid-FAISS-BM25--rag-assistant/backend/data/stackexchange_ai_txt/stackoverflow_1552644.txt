A type that is thread safe can be safely accessed from multiple threads without concern for concurrency. This usually means that the type is read-only. Interestingly enough, Queue is not thread safe - it can support concurrent reads as long as the queue isn't modified but that isn't the same thing as thread safety. In order to think about thread safety consider what would happen if two threads were accessing a Queue and a third thread came along and began either adding to or removing from this Queue . Since this type does not restrict this behavior it is not thread safe.
