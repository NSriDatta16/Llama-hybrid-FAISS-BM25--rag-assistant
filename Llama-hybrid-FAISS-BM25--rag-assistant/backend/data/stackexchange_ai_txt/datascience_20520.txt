Using GridSearchCV for custom kernel SVM in scikit-learn

I would like to use scikit-learn's GridSearchCV() to do a grid search on custom parameters in a kernel I have specified. Specifically, the kernel is of the form SeqKernel(x, y, orig_kernel, cut_off, order) Here, orig_kernel is a kernel typically used in SVM learning (such as linear, polynomial, RBF, or sigmoid). I wish to perform a grid search over values of cut_off and order , with the additional caveat that only the pairs such that order $\le$ cut_off are considered. What would be the best way to implement this?
