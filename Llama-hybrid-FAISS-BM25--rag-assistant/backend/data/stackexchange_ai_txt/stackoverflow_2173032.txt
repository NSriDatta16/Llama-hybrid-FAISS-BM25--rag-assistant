How to get wxCurl to automatically follow redirects?

I have a project that uses wxCurl to retrieve a file over HTTP. However, if the server sends a 301 or 302, all I get back is an empty string. I heard there was a way to get cURL to follow the location: headers sent by the server. How is this done? Also, how do you set the User-agent header in wxCurl?
