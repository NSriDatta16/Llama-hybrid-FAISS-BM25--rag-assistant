Cannot find any coverage data (ASP.NET MVC2)

I am having some issues with getting Code Coverage working with an out-of-the-box ASP.NET MVC2 Web App VS2010 Ultimate, File > New Project > ASP.NET MVC 2 Web Application > Yes, Create unit test project with Visual Studio Unit Test. I then Rebuild All, Run All Unit Tests, Go to Code Coverage and get the following message: Cannot find any coverage data (.coverage or .coveragexml) files. Check test run details for possible errors. All the unit tests passed. (And I haven't touched a line of code yet) I did find the following on the web: http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=615377 which says to do the following: Test -> Edit Test Settings -> Local In the test settings dialog, click "Data and Diagnostics" Ensure "Code Coverage" are checked, and double-click on it Check of the dll's you want code coverage enabled for. But, when I go to Test > Edit Test Seetings, all I see is the grayed out menu item stating "No Test Settings Available". Any ideas? Edit: slowly gaining traction. See: How to create the vsmdi/testrunconfig file when importing a Visual Studio test project?
