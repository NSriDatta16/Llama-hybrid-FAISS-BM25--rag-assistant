I would say it's necessary for programmers to have expertise in at least one programming language and preferably two. The keyword here is "expertise", not mastery; I agree with the opinions of several posters that true mastery of most general-purpose programming languages is an elusive and nebulous level of excellence probably beyond the achievement of most software professionals. The issue is not so much lack of time or ability but rather a lack of comprehensive exposure to a very broad range of programming problems. You are ultimately limited by the type of projects that you can currently work on within your organization(s), etc. The need for expertise in one language is obvious. A decent level of knowledge and experience in at least two languages is useful to better understand the limitations of any given language, as well as to provide viable options for choosing an appropriate tool for a given project. Expertise in more than two languages may also be desirable, but I find it to be difficult in practice to any degree of depth. Generally one's ability to maintain a high degree of expertise in multiple programming languages declines rapidly after the first 2-3. Ultimately, the important thing is to establish and maintain expertise in whatever languages are most useful for the type of work that one is currently doing and/or expects to perform in the near future. Stay abreast of changes, try new tools out, and be prepared to adopt and embrace something fundamentally new whenever the need arises.
