I like the first method for two reasons. If they are storing their relationships in a Dictionary<> object already, they can just hand off the dictionary as is - no extra code required. If they are using their own custom storage then giving you KeyValuePairs in an IEnumerable is really easy with the yield statement Something like this: IEnumerable > GetMappedPairs() { foreach( var pair in _myCustomData ) { yield return new KeyValuePair{Key = pair.ID, Value = pair.Data}; } } Option number 2 is not easily understood by developers using your method so it would require documentation and comments to explain how to use it. Incidentally, you would probably be served best by declaring your method as a generic instead of hard coding KeyValuePair MyClass ( IEnumerable > pairs );
