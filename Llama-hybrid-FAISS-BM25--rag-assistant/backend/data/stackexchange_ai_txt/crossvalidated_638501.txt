I do not like the page you linked to at all. It confuses things. Regression to the mean occurs because two phenomena are not perfectly correlated. This can occur for various reasons. One example of regression to the mean is that, if you look at sets of parents and kids and their heights, then the very tallest parents will not have the very tallest children. Yes, the children of tall parents will be taller than average, but the kids of the tallest parents may be the 3rd or 4th or whatever tallest kids. Similarly at the short end. Why? Because while height is partly genetic, it's not completely so. Another is that the kids who score highest on the midterm may not score highest on the final. They will usually score higher than average, but the ranks and scores won't be identical. This is because, on nearly all tests given in schools, some of the grade is random, based on luck (e.g. guessing right on a multiple choice test) or other factors unrelated to ability (if you had a big fight with your romantic partner the night before the test, you may do worse). If two phenomena were perfectly correlated, then this would not occur. As to your question: RM cannot erroneously do anything, and it's not clear what "taking heterogeneity up or down" means. RM is a consequence of heterogeneity, not a cause of it. If everyone's scores were perfectly homongenous, then there would be no RM. If boys grew up to be exactly the same heights as their fathers, then, again, no RM.
