How can I split a dataset and use cross validation?

How can I split my dataset by using Greedy layer-Wise pre-training in Deep Learning Neural Networks? As an example, if I have a dataset with 60000 samples: (? % for unsupervised pretraining) (? % for supervised fine tuning) (? %validation) (? % test) How can I use cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization?
