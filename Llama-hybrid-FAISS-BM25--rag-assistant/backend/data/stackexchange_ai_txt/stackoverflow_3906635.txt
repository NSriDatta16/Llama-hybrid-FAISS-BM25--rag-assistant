Android Linkify TransformFilter is not transforming

I'm working with a CheckBox that needs to hace some links appearing as text, not urls. I'm using something like this: TransformFilter transformer = new TransformFilter() { @Override public String transformUrl(Matcher match, String url) { Log.d(" ", match.toString() + " ||||| " + url); return url.substring(1, url.length() - 1); } }; Linkify.addLinks(acceptCheckbox, Pattern.compile("\\(.*?\\)"), null, null, transformer); If I understand well, if the text in the checkbox contains "(something here)" it should output "something here" without parentheses. This is just a test before adding the link ie. (go to google-http://www.google.com) The thing is the links look like links but they are not modified (still with parentheses). Even if I put a schema or I hardcode the String in transformUrl method nothing happens. I tried with setting autoLink to none, setAutoLinkMask(0), and maybe some more but still stuck. Any idea? Thanks
