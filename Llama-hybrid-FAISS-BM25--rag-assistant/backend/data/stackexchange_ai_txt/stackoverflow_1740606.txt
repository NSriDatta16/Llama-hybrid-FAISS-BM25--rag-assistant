Well, they do; to some extent at least... See SQL Server Database Engine Tuning Advisor , for instance. However, creating optimal indexes is not as simple as you mentioned. An even simpler rule could be to create indexes on every column (which is far from optimal)! Indexes are not free. You create indexes at the cost of storage and update performance among other things. They should be carefully thought about to be optimal.
