Degree of belief in fuzzy modelling

I’ was reading a paper on fuzzy regression. In that paper, and many other papers on fuzzy regression, the authors use most of the time a $h$ to indicate a certain degree of belief. Unfortunately the authors do not clarify what the meaning is of degree of belief given for instance a coefficient. I have read some papers on the degree of belief, and it seems that it has several meanings in different areas (Bayesian, Fuzzy modelling etc.). I’m drowning in definitions, mathematical and philosophical debates. Q1: How to interpret, understand, the degree of belief in Fuzzy modelling? (Using the example $h=0$ for $y=1+3x$ and $h=.5$ for $y=1+4x$ In one paper the degree of belief $h$ whas compared to fit of the data (?!) Q2: Is there, in "classical" statistics, a similarity of degree of belief?
