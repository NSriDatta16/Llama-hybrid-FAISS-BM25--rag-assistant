Way to default the name of the generated XPS file?

If a user prints a report, and they happen to be using the Microsoft XPS printer , i would like the default the filename to something meaningful. i would have thought that the XPS printer would take the name of the print job, and use that as the default filename - but it doesn't. Is there some other, programatic, way to default the name of the generated XPS file when i print to that printer? i was thinking there might be something like: a registry key global shared memory API call like SetDefaultXPSFilename() extended attributes about a print job Example Automate Excel to create a spreadsheet: Excel xl = new ExcelApplication(); Workbook wb = xl.Workbooks.Add(); GenerateReport(wb); wb.PrintOut(); Now if the user's default printer is the Microsoft XPS Document Writer , then the user will get: i would like a way for that File name to be defaulted to something useful, such as: 20110729 - Chip Bank Settlement Sheet.xps The user will accept the default filename, and files will organized automatically, rather than the user typing: asdfadf.xps References eggheadcafe: XPS Default File Name MSDN: XPS Name when Sent to Printer Bump: 20110729 (12 months later)
