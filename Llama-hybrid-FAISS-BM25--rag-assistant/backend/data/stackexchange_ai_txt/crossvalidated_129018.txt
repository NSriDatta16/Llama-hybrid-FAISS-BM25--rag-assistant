The good news: the mean that you want to calculate is actually a ratio, and ratio estimation is a well studied topic in survey sampling. The bad news is that with only four observations, no probabilistically valid margin of error is possible. To compute a margin of error (bound on error), one starts with a standard error (SE). There are at least three methods for computing a standard error for a ratio estimate. None of the solutions will be good with only four observations. Not only is the standard error likely to be poor, but the estimate itself will be biased (Cochran, 1977, p. 160). A margin of error adds a multiplier to the standard error, so that the interval $\pm$ K SE) hopefully has good coverage probabilities, e.g. fails to cover the true value only 5% of the time. This is effectively a "confidence interval". However, the the actual distribution of a sample ratio with small $n$ islikely to be asymmetric and non-normal. So, even when $n$ is sufficiently large to get a good standard error, a larger sample size is needed to get a good interval: The first step towards getting a defensible margin of error is therefore: Take a larger sample. In what follows below, I consider just simple random sampling, but other sampling designs might be better, given that you know salaries for every worker (Cochran, p. 172). Some details : Denote $x_i$ = salary for sampled worker $i$ and $y_i$ = number of sales. Then $\overline{x}$ and $\overline{y}$ are the sample means for the $n$ = 4 observations. If $X$ and $Y$ are the totals in the population (you know $X$), you want to estimate the average salary per sale or: $$ R = \frac{X}{Y} $$ the ratio of sample means The natural estimate of $R$ is ratio of sample totals, which is the same as the ratio of sample means $$ \widehat{R} = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{\overline{x}}{\overline{y}} $$ In your case $\widehat{R}= 375/9= 41.67$, as you found. With a small sample size, this is likely to be seriously biased. Solutions for standard error . From your question, you appear to think that computation of a standard error involves the individual worker ratios $x_i/y_i$. This is not so for the methods below. Solution 1. Linearization The approximate variance of $\widehat{R}= \frac{x}{y} = \frac{\overline{x}}{\overline{y}}$ is: \begin{equation} \verb+var+ \widehat{R} = \left(1- \frac{n}{N}\right)\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \widehat{R}x_i)^2}{n (n-1)\overline{y}^2} \end{equation} If the population mean $\overline{Y}$ is known, it should be substituted for $\overline{y}$. This method requires "large" n (Cochran, 1977, pp; 32; 160-163). Solution 2: Jackknife The jackknife is one of several methods intended to reduce small sample bias (Cochran, p. 174; 178). Solution 3: Bootstrap The bootstrap (Efron, 1986) is another approach to getting a non-parametric standard error (Lohr, 2007, p 384). It works by re-sampling from the sample of four with replacement. There are a total of $4^4= 64$ possible samples, but in over 20% of them, at most two of the original four workers will appear. **Added:**This may well be the best of the three methods (and there are others; see Cochran's book), but, to repeat, none will work well with only four observations.
