Computing eigenvectors for PCA: what to do about the freedom to choose the sign?

After an eigenvector computation for PCA, I get the eigenvector $(a, b)$ where $a=b$. This means that if I choose $a=1$, then also $b$ would be equal to $1$, and if I choose $a=2$, $b$ would also be equal to $2$. So the vectors $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 3)$, etc. would all be valid as they are pointing in the same direction. I can use any of those vectors to compute my principal component in that direction. My issue is now as follows: What if I had chosen $a=-1$, then I would also choose $b=-1$. So the vector $(-1, -1)$ would also be considered valid. But, because of the negative, I would instead generate a principal component facing the opposite direction. This would completely change my PCA result. My question then is: How do we handle these negatives in PCA? They seem to produce a completely different result relative to the positive vectors.
