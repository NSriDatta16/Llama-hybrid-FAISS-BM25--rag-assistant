I have never tried solving the TSP with a neural network, but I have found that it solves very well, and very quickly, taking a genetic approach. I have done many neural network projects, though, and I would guess that since the TSP can, in general, have many solutions over a single network (of cities), that the neural network could be dragged back and forth between solutions, never really successfully converging on any one.
