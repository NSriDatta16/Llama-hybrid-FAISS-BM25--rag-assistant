How do I get the "referenced libraries" folder back In the eclipse sdk?

I use the eclipse Ganymede sdk for developing Java apps. I'm having a strange Issue. Everything was working fine until recently where the "referenced Libraries " folder went missing from the explorer. I used to upload the jar's I need Into the workspace. I uploaded the jars In a folder named "lib" and after refreshing the project folder In eclipse that folder "lib" containing the Jar appears. Now,the Issue arises,when I right click on the jar and select "add to path" the jar Instead of appearing In the "referenced libraries" folder just disappears. Note:the referenced Library was never there In the first place,I need to find a way to get the folder back. here's a snapshot of my eclipse framework : http://www.flickr.com/photos/38561743@N03/4122304046/sizes/o/
