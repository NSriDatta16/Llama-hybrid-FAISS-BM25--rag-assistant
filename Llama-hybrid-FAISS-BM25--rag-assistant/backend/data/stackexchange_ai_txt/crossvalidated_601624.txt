An intuitive way of thinking about the convolution operation in CNN is that the kernel screens the image for a specific patter. Each kernel/filter is looking for a different patter. If the pixel pattern found in a part of the image matches the kernel, we want a large activation as output at that position. Ff it does not match the pattern of the kernel, we want a small activation at the position. This is best-achieved using an element-wise matrix multiplication. A good example is the "sobel kernel" used for edge detection. https://towardsdatascience.com/magic-of-the-sobel-operator-bbbcb15af20d Here, the weights of the kernel are pre-defined in an actual CNN the weights would be learned and it is not directly obvious for which feature they are screening.
