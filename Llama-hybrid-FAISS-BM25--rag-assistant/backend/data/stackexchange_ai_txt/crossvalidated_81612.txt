How to explain the logistic regression model objects from the rms::lrm() function in R?

Recently I was trying to do logistic regression using the rms::lrm() function. But I had some trouble understanding the model objects from the function. Here is the example from the package: #dataset n g Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = y ~ treat * rcs(age)) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. Ratio Test Indexes Indexes Obs 1000 LR chi2 76.77 R2 0.099 C 0.656 0 478 d.f. 14 g 0.665 Dxy 0.312 1 522 Pr(> chi2) anova(g) Wald Statistics Response: y Factor Chi-Square d.f. P treat (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 5.62 10 0.8462 All Interactions 1.30 8 0.9956 age (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 65.99 12 Here are my questions: For the object g , What does the max |deriv| 3e-06 mean? What do the Discrimination and Rand Discrim. Indexes suggest? For the anova(g) object, What's the Factor +Higher Order Factors for the treat? Why there are two all interactions ? How to explain the nonlinear parts?
