You can use Ctrl + Shift + O to "O"rganize Imports (like Crembo mentions). Another neat trick is to go to Windows > Preferences, search for "Save Actions", and check "Organize Imports". Now whenever you save ( Ctrl + S ), Eclipse will automatically run the "organize imports" feature. I find this quicker, since it's quicker for me to hit Ctrl + S than Ctrl + Shift + O (one-hand shortcut versus two-hand shortcut).
