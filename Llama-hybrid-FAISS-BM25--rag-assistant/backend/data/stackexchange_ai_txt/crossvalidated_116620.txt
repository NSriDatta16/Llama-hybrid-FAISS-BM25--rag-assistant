Simply speaking, you normalize weights and heights to mean=1/2 std.deviation=1/6, then force them into [0,1] interval. The same thing could be achieved simpler if you'd normalize them to mean=0, std.deviation=1, and force them into [-3,3] interval. The problem with you approach is: suppose that one student has very high weight, but height below the average. He may be selected over all others. Another problem is, you have an arbitrary constant 3. Therefor, if you want "both decent height and decent weight", I suggest to normalize weights and heights to mean=0, std.deviation=1, then just select the student with highest max(weight, height). If the value is same for two students, select one with highest weight+height.
