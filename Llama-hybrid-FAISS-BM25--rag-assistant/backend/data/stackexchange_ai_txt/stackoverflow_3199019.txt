On the PHP end, you could preload the records into something like a memcache bucket. I strongly doubt, though, that the problem is the database query. It's much more likely that the json request is what takes so long. It's certainly possible to preload all the values (i.e. fetch them in one big request). You are not giving any details about your system, but it would probably simply be a big json request. I don't see any easy way to implement a progress bar for the Ajax request. Maybe a simple "loading" animation will do as well. You would probably have to use some sort of local storage to persist the data across pages for it to make sense. For that, see this question.
