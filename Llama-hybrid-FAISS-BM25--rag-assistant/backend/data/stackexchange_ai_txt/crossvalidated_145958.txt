As lanenok points out, for x3 you have some extreme values. This values will have a high leverage in your model and should be handled accordingly. Looking at your diagnostic plots, there's a lot of things that seem wrong in your model. The heterocedasticity is clear, with higher fitted values having higher variance. This yields your p-values wrong, since they are calculated assuming homocedasticity. You have also some observations which are clearly having a great influence in the model (Residuals vs. leverage plot). Those x3 extreme values seem to be the culprit here, but there could be more. A possible solution has been already suggested by lanenok which is log-transformation of x3. Robust regression would be another option. To solve the heterocedasticity problem, you could perform generalized least squares, which allows for heterocedasticity as long as you specify the variance structure of your model. (see the gls() function in nlme package) I would avoid fitting the 3-way interactions and then using step to "automatically" exclude non-relevant variables. Stepwise will yield missleading results regarding your "relevant" variables, their estimated coefficients and their p-values. See this post: Algorithms for automatic model selection
