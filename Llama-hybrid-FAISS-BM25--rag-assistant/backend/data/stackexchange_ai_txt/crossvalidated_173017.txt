What is the name of the 1/2 sum of square errors function?

What is the name of this function: $E = \frac{1}{2}\ \sum\limits_{n=1}^N \{ output_n - target_n\}^2$ Which is used in machine learning (e.g. error back prop). I have sometimes seen the name "MSE" for this, but there is nothing "Mean" here because MSE is calculated differently,
