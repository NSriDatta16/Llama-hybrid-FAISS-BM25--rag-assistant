Confidence interval for a folded normal distribution

(My background: physicist rusty on statistics, evaluating an experimental dataset). I'm studying a dataset with a random variable $X$, which is approximately normally distributed with standard deviation $\sigma$. I compute the sample average $Y =\sum \frac{X_i}{N}$ and standard error in the mean $\sigma_Y = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$, where $N$ is the number of experiments. The final step I need to do is to calculate the absolute value $Z = |Y|$ and evaluate the expectation value of $Z$, as well as confidence intervals. I need to consider a general case, since some error bars will be asymmetric ($Y \approx 0$), while others will be symmetric ($Y \gg 0$). Ideally, I'd like to understand what the confidence intervals should look like, so I don't need to keep sorting the dataset for every data point. Could someone give me some pointers? Thanks a lot!
