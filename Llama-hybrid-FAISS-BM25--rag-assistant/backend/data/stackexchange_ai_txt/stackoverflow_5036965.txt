You should be able to get a collection object containing the certs in your .pfx file by using the X509Certificate2Collection class... here's some C# example code: string certPath = ; string certPass = ; // Create a collection object and populate it using the PFX file X509Certificate2Collection collection = new X509Certificate2Collection(); collection.Import(certPath, certPass, X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet); Then you can iterate over the collection: foreach (X509Certificate2 cert in collection) { Console.WriteLine("Subject is: '{0}'", cert.Subject); Console.WriteLine("Issuer is: '{0}'", cert.Issuer); // Import the certificates into X509Store objects } Depending on the type of certificate (client cert, intermediate CA cert, root CA) you'll need to open the proper cert store (as an X509Store object) to import it. Check out the X509Store docs: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509store.aspx And the different members in the StoreName enumeration: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.storename.aspx From what I understand, you want to use StoreName.My for client certificates that contain a private key, StoreName.CertificateAuthority for intermediate CA certs, and StoreName.Root for root CA certs.
