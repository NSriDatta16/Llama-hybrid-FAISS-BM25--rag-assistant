There are TWO options for the inferential F-tests In SPSS. Multivariate does NOT assume sphericity, adn so makes use of a different pairwise correlation for each pair of variables. The "tests of within subjects effects", including any post hoc tests, assumes sphericity and makes some corrections for using a common correlation across all tests. These procedures are a legacy of the days when computation was expensive, and are a waste of time with modern computing facilities. My recommendation is to take the omnibus MULTIVARIATE F for any repeated measures. Then follow up with post hoc pairwise t-test, or ANOVA with only 2 levels in each repeated measure comparison if there are also between subject factors. I would make the simple bon ferroni correction of dividing the alpha level by the number of tests. Also be sure to look at the effect size [available in the option dialogue]. Large effect sizes that are 'close' to significant may be more worthy of attention [and future experiments] than small, but significant effects. A more sophisticated approach is available in SPSS procedure MIXED, and also in less user friendly [but free] packages such as R. Summary, in SPSSS, multivariate F followed by pairwise post hocs eith Bon Ferroniwith Bonferroni should be sufficient for most needs.
