How to combine these two PHP arrays?

I have two arrays in php that are part of an image management system. weighted_images A multidimensional array. Each sub array is an associative array with keys of 'weight' (for ordering by) and 'id' (the id of the image). array( 156 => array('weight'=>1, 'id'=>156), 784 => array('weight'=>-2, 'id'=>784), ) images This array is user input. It's an array of image ids. array(784, 346, 748) I want to combine them in to a single array of ids ordered by the weight of the image. If an image doesn't have a weight append to the end. It's not a particularly hard problem however my solution is far from elegant and can't help thinking that there must be a better way to do this. $t_images = array(); foreach ($weighted_images as $wi) { if ( in_array($wi['id'], $images) ) { $t_images[$wi['weight']] = $wi['id']; } } foreach ($images as $image) { if ( !$weighted_images[$image] ) { $t_images[] = $image; } } $images = $t_images; Question: Is there a better way to do this?
