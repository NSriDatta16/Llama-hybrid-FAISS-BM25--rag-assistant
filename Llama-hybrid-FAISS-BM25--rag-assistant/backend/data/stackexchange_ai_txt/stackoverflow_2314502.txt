Finding legacy calls within ASP.NET DLLs

I have an ASP.NET web application that leverages 5 DLLs. This web application and its DLLs are all very old, and occasionally we find some deprecated call or something that has been broken over time. Currently I am getting this error, which I believe is a .NET active directory call which no longer is present in the latest version. Method not found: 'System.String System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_Password()'.Method not found: 'System.String System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_Password()'. The problem is that call is not present in visible code; It must be coming from one of the DLLs. I do not have access to the source code for all the DLLs. Is there an easy way to search within these DLLs to identify which one the problem is coming from?
