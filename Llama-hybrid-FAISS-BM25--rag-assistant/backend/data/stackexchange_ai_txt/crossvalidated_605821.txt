Case study question on profit optimization

A famous restaurant selling burgers has closely studied the demand for burgers for past months including the times the customer requested a burger and it was already sold out. Further analysis of data showed that the demand closely follows normal distribution with mean 20 and a standard deviation of 5 and the rule of thumb is to make 1.5 times of mean number of demand (30 burgers) daily. The cost of making one burger is 100 dollars and the selling price per unit is 320 dollars (profit : 220 dollars per unit). The restaurant claims the daily average profit of 3300 dollars. The owner wants to know if this policy makes sense and if not how many burgers do they make for maximizing the profit. The progress I have made is this, if the demand follows a normal distribution, then for the number they are producing per day, they won't sold out 97% of times(z score = 2). But the question is how to maximize profit, which I couldn't formulate and need help with.
