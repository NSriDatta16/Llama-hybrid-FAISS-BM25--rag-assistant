I am not aware of any MCMC method which would be parametrisation invariant (maybe someone more aware of the literature could validate this). In practice, the performance of for example Gibbs may be highly dependent from the working parametrisation : parametrisation involving highly a posteriori correlated (or dependent) variables will perform very badly while the one involving independent variables will give better results. For an illustration of why this is the case see e.g. http://wangxiaois.me/blog/how-to/2015/09/03/Gibbs_Sampling.html . I should even say that before implementing a model in Jags or anything else, it is a good practice to check for alternative parametrisation (at least, this is a thing I try to do and that sometimes save me hours of computing).
