how to know the path,where the errors and warnings are stored in eclipse

My doubt is related to the storage of Error/Warning Messages . For example I wrote a C program in Eclipse IDE and compiled. The Error/Warning Messages are displayed in the problem tab. If this is the situation which file in my computer contains the Error/Warning Messages. I need to know the location of this file because I am doing a project related to IDE creation. Any suggestions or Ideas?
