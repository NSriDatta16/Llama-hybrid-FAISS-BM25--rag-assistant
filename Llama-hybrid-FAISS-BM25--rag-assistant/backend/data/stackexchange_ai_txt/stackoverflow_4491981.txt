jQuery and iframes and weird positioning: is there a workaround?

I've got a draggable thing outside an iframe, and a droppable target inside it. Here I've shown the iframe as containing a snippet of the HTML that is loaded by its src attribute. &nbsp; I use some jQuery (UI draggable/droppable) to do stuff: $("#iframe").load(function() { var $this = $(this); var contents = $this.contents(); contents.find('#droppable').droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { alert('dropped'); } }); $('#draggables img').draggable(); }); The draggables become draggable and the droppable is successfully a drop target. The problem is that the landing zone for the drop area is not where it is displayed on the screen. That is, the alert is fired when the draggable is dropped somewhere above the drop target, and not on the target itself. A few tests I did suggest that the difference between where the target is on screen and where jQuery thinks it is is related to the vertical position of the iframe on the page, but I can't find a direct correlation. Does anyone know whether this problem has been investigated by anyone anywhere and, perchance, solved? Failing that, can anyone suggest a way I may be able to load an external HTML file into my page without using an iframe and without the two pages' structures and styles interfering with one another? I'm considering loading the inner page directly and using javascript to draw page controls around it. TIA Altreus
