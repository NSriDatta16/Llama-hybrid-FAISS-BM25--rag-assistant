Pearson correlation for comparing models

I want to know if I can use Pearson correlation coefficient (i.e. whether my PS satisfies its usage or I need to look at other correlation measures) to study the extent of correlation between 2 vectors of data: PS: I have 10 ML models and 100 data sets, and build all models on all data sets. I want to see how correlated the model predicted average error (on all 100 data sets) between any two models are. There will be ${}^{10}C_2$ model pairs. The idea is that if model $i$ and model $j$ show similar average errors for each data set, then I should see a large correlation in average errors of these two models. Can I use Pearson correlation for this task?
