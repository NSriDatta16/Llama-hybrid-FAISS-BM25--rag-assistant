I thought I had an elegant solution to this, but alas, did not work as I expected. I was hoping (and maybe you can with more effort) to derive from the IgnoreAttribute class. I thought this would work: [Test, BugId("411")] public void TestMethod() { // your test } public class BugIdAttribute : IgnoreAttribute { private string id; public BugIdAttribute(string id) : base("Ignored because it is bug #" + id) { this.id = id; } } But it seems there's more to it than this. Sorry for posting an answer that is not actually an answer, but I think it's a good stepping stone for somebody who knows more about the internals of nunit than myself.
