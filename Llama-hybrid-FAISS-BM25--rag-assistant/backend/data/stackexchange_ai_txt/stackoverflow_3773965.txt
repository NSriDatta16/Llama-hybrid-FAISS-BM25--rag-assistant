It sounds like you are really asking two different questions. One being should I use a framework (Zend, Symfony, Cake, etc) for the development of a website? The other being whether or not to use something along the lines of an ORM (Doctrine, Propel, etc)? The answer to the first one is a resounding "yes". Frameworks are designed to keep you from having to reinvent the wheel for common/basic functionality. The time you spend learning how to (correctly) use a framework will payoff greatly in the long run. You'll eventually be much more productive that "rolling your own". Not to mention you'll gain a community of people who have likely been through similar situations and overcome issues similar to what you will face (that in and of itself could be the best reason to use a framework). I'm not going to suggest a particular framework since they all have strengths and weaknesses and is another topic in and of itself (however, I do use and prefer Zend Framework but don't let that influence your decision). Concerning whether or not to use an ORM is a slightly more difficult question. I've recently began to work with them more and in general I would recommend them but it all boils down to using the right tool for the right job. They solve some specific problems very well, others not so much. However, since you specifically mention security I'll quickly address that. I don't think that a ORM inherently "increases security", however it can force you into making better decisions. That said, bad coding and bad coding practices will result in security issues no matter what technology/framework you are using. Hope that helps!
