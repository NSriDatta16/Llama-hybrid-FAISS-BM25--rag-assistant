Soft Margin constraints in SVM

I have understood the constraints of Hard Margin SVM but stuck at Soft Margin SVM. The Objective Function along with constraints of Soft Margin SVM is given below. such that and The slack variable represents how far away is a point from the correct hyperplane. My question is how did we obtain the first constraint? Can't the optimization problem be solved without the first constraint?
