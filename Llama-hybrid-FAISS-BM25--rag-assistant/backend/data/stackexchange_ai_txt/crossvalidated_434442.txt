Assuming you have the original data and not just the summary of the fits, the general solution to this problem is to fit a model with an interaction , i.e. to go back to the data and fit the model $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 I(t>t_I) + \beta_2 (t-t_I) + \beta_3 I(t>t_I) (t-t_I) $$ where $I(t>t_I)$ is an indicator variable , i.e. =1 if $t>t_I$ and 0 otherwise. In this formulation, $\beta_0$ represents the mean before the intervention $\beta_1$ represents a discontinuous jump in the mean at $t=t_I$ (depending on your problem, you may choose to leave this out of the model) $\beta_2$ represents the slope before the intervention $\beta_3$ represents the change in slope before vs. after: that is, $\beta_2 + \beta_3$ is the slope after the intervention. A standard t-test against the null hypothesis $\beta_3=0$ is a test of the slope difference. You might look for a deeper treatment of this under the rubrics of regression discontinuity designs (usually when the predictor is not time), or changepoint analysis / interrupted time series analysis (when the predictor is time).
