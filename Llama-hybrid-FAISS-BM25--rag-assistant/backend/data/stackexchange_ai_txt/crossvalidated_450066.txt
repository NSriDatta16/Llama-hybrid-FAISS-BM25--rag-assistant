How do you know when you are 90% sure or 99% sure?

The problem is a follow up to my previous one, so a lot of contextual data can be found at: how to find 10th, 50th, 90th percentile of a uniformly distributed data for all cases? But this is a very different question, so I'm asking in a separate post. So basically we have a population that's consuming food at certain rate, and the population also decays and rises in a certain rate. Now we have a factory that produces rice between 3-7 lbs every week. We can open up another factory to double our production capacity. The question is: In the next 10 months, do we need a 2nd factory? If so, when do we need 2nd factory to start producing in order to be 90% sure that we will not have a shortage in the next 10 months? What about 99% sure? My additional questions are: Again, I'm not sure if this asking for confidence interval? Am I on the right track? But even confidence interval of 90% doesn't mean 90% sure right? How can I be 90% sure ? Below are the data/context from my other/previous post: Here are some key data to use for calculation : initial population is 100, and average food consumption per person is 5lbs of rice each week 1~2% of population dies off every month 20~40 is added to population every month average rice consumption per person increases by 0~2.5% weekly Assumptions: assume all random variables are independent assume all variables are uniformly distributed across the given range.
