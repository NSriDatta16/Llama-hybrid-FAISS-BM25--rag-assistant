How to make topographic map from sparse sampling data?

I need to make a topographic map of a terrain for which I have only fairly sparse samples of (x, y, altitude) data. Obviously I can't make a completely accurate map, but I would like one that is in some sense "smooth". I need to quantify "smoothness" (probably the reciprocal the average of the square of the surface curvature) and I want to minimize an objective function that is the sum of two quantities: The roughness of the surface The mean square distance between the altitude of the surface at the sample point and the actual measured altitude at that point Since what I actually want is a topographic map, I am really looking for a way to construct contour lines of constant altitude, and there may be some clever geometric way to do that without ever having to talk about surfaces. Of course I want contour lines also to be smooth. Any and all suggestions welcome. I'm hoping this is a well-known numerical problem. I am quite comfortable in C and have a working knowledge of FORTRAN. About Matlab and R I'm fairly clueless. Regarding where our samples are located: we're planning on roughly even spacing, but we'll take more samples where the topography is more interesting. So for example we'll sample mountainous regions more densely than a plain. But we definitely have some choices about sampling, and could take even samples if that simplifies matters. The only issues are We don't know how much terrain we'll need to map in order to find features that we are looking for. Taking a sample is moderately expensive, on the order of 10 minutes. So sampling a 100x100 grid could take a long time.
