HTML5 is a collection of different features that are each being adopted by the different browsers at different paces. So whether its worth using now depends on which feature you are interested in using and which browsers you need to support. The question that Pekka linked to references a number of sites that will give you an idea of which features are supported in which browsers. Also take a look at http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/ for more background. UPDATE : I don't see any reason not to use jQuery with HTML5 where appropriate. The JavaScript examples in http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3 use jQuery.
