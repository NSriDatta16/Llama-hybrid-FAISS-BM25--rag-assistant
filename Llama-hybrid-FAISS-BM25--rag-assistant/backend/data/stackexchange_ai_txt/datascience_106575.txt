Mapping values in Logistic Regression

When mapping probabilities obtained in logistic regression to 0s & 1s using the sigmoid function, we use a threshold value of 0.5. If the predicted probability lies above 0.5, then it gets mapped to 1, if the predicted probability lies below 0.5, it gets mapped to 0. What if the predicted probability is exactly 0.5? What does 0.5 get mapped to?
