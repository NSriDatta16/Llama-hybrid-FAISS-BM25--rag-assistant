Are there documented, organized collections of libraries for Common Lisp?

I am a college student at a school that teaches mainly in Java. One of the strong points of Java, which I quite enjoy, is the large collection of libraries. What makes these libraries especially useful is the extensive documentation and organization presented via JavaDoc. Are there any library collections for Common Lisp which also have these qualities, and is there a tool similar to JavaDoc which would assist in the building, maintaining, or expanding of these libraries?
