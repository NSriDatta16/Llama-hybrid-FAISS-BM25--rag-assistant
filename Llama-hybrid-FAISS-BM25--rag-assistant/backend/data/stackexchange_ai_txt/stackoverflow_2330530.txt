How are .libs created in your VS solution linked by another project?

If I have a project Foo that has a .lib as an output that's also used by projects Bar and Baz, how do I let Bar and Baz know where to find the library assuming MSVC? I have the project dependencies set up already, but how do I #pragma comment(lib, "????/Foo.lib") properly?
