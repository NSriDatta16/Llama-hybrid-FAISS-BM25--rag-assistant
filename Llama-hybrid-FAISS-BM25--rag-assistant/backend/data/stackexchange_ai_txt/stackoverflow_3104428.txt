Failed to queue test run: Unable to start the agent process(Visual Studio 2010)

While trying to run all the unit tests in my solution(Visual Studio 2010) I am getting a 'Failed to queue test run xxxx@MACHINENAME 2010-06-23 14:01:36': Unable to start the agent process' error. Does anyone know what causes this particular error to occur and how to resolve it so that I can run my unit tests? Thanks
