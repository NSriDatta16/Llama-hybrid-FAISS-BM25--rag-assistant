Ridge Regression/Lasso

I have a dataset where I am trying to identify what group of people (i.e the predictors) are most likely to do X. I have ~25 predictors, ~5k cases and a binary outcome Y. The predictors are categorical with many levels. I am mainly interested on what drives the outcome the most - it would be helpful to have coefficients that are interpretable as well. I have quite a lot of multicollinearity in my dataset so my plan was to do ridge/lasso + logistic regression. However, I have read some posts here where it is stated that the coefficients should be interpreted with caution (?due to bias), also the lack of p-values and CI is making me think this isn't the best solution for the question I am trying to answer. Should I go straight for a logistic model? Or is the smoothing provided by ridge useful in this case as it can highlight the predictors that are the most important?
