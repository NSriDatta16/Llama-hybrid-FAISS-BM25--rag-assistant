First, you need to use the appropriate name for the analysis function. That would be optimistic_median_analysis . Next, you have to take in a reference to the vector, iterate over each item and apply the optimistic_median function to it. double optimistic_median_analysis(const vector &v) { return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0.0, optimistic_median) / v.size(); } This would give you the average for each student, but it is unclear from your question exactly what output is required.
