The most helpful starting point for me was to reading the "Hello, Android" book from the Pragmatic Bookshelf: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/eband3/hello-android I've posted the link to the third edition ( edit: now published ) which will deal with Android up to version 2.1 (2.2+ to follow, I'd guess!). However, if you're already asking questions on JSF etc. this may be too basic - then I'd agree with most of the other answers and browse the web for more information. However, I found the book a quick read, and by running through a few of the sample apps included I was soon able to start work on one of my own. Basically, whatever gets you coding quickest with a reasonable understanding of what to do...
