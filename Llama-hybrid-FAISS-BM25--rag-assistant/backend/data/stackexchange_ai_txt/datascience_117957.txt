How to increase retention?

As you might already know there is a concept of retention. Let's say I have created a game and today hundred people have downloaded my game. Let's say tomorrow 47 out of yesterday's hundred people are returning to the game, i.e. they open the game and play it. This means that day one (D1) retention is 47%. Now let's say I want to increase my D1 retention from 47 to 60. Let's say I can mine a classification formula or a classification tree that when I give a D0 user data, that algorith can say if that player will return on D1. How can I potentially use that classification model to increase D1? Or let's put it another way, what is the proper way using data science to understand what to do to increase the retention?
