This is called multiclass classification , and the encoding needed for the target variable depends on what package and model you're using. You may be expected to one-hot encode (e.g. neural networks usually have an output neuron for each class), ordinal encode (e.g. most(?) sklearn multiclass classifiers ), or leave them as strings (most R models, I'd guess?).
