Adding to Stuart's excellent answer: Blobs can store anything, with sizes up to 200GB. If you needed / wanted to persist an entire directory structure that's durable, you can mount a VHD with just a few lines of code. It's an NTFS volume that your app can interact with, just like any other drive. In your case, a vhd doesn't fit well, because your web app would have to mount a vhd and be the sole writer to it. And if you have more than one web role instance (which you would if you wanted the SLA and wanted to scale), you could only have one writer. In this case, individual blobs fit MUCH better. As Stuart stated, this is a very normal and common pattern. And again, with only a few lines of code, you can call upon the storage sdk to copy a file from blob storage to your instance's local disk. Then you can process the file using regular File IO operations. When your report is complete, another few lines of code lets you copy your report into a new blob (most likely in a well-known container that the web role knows to look in). You can take this a step further and insert rows into an Azure table that are partitioned by customer, with row key identifying the individual uploaded file, and a 3rd field representing the URI to the completed report. This makes it trivial for the web app to display a customer's completed reports.
