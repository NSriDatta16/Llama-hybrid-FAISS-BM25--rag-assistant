magento orders list query

I want to select the list of all orders in Magento. This is required for me to show the list of all the orders from magento in another PHP application presently I'm working on. Also can some one write me the code using the Magento conventions such as Mage:: Im using Magento 1.4.2 version. Thanks, Mark
