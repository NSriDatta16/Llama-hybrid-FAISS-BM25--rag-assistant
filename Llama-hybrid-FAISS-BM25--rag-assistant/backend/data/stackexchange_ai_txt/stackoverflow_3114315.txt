You might be thinking of Bloom filters , which are used for exactly this case. They can give you false positives, in which case you have to search in the real table, but in most cases will tell you from the start if you don't have the item stored. Hash tables are usually the best option for storage; but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets, you'll have a sizable number of hash collisions where you'll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you're looking. If key comparison is expensive, it can quickly become a factor.
