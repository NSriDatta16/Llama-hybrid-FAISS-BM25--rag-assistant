Threshold for and Variations of Exact logistic regression

According to this UCLA tutorial exact logistic regression ( elrm::elrm in R) should be prefered to the logistic regression glm(... ,family = binomial) in R if the sample size is small AND/OR Some cells are empty My questions: What does small sample mean in this case (e.g. n If exact logistic regression performs better than logistic regression in some cases why don't we always use exact logistic regression ? I know that exact logistic regression is often more computationally expensive because of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain Algorithm. Is this the only reason? Are there also multinomial/ordered and probit versions of the exact logistic regression ?
