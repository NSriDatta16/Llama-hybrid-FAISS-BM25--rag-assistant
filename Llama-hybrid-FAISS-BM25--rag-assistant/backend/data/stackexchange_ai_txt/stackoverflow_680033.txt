Try specifying default arguments for the constructor ( null as a special value, perhaps?). Then add a bit of error checking at the beginning of the constructor that sets sensible defaults for your MovieClip. It's really hacky, but as far as I know there's not a better way to do it using the drag & drop animating UI (you can only do it through code).
