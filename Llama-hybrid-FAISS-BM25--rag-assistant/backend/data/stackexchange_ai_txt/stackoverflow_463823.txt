Another point in favor of Scheme: it's practical for a beginner to write a self-hosting compiler for it, like Kragen Sitaker's Ur-Scheme , his first compiler. There are few other 'tutorial' compilers powerful enough to compile themselves (though there are some pointers at the link). This brings more realism and interest to the problem.
