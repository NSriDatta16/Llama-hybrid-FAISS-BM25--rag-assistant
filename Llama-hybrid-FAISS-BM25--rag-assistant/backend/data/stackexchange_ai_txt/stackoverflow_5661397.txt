tcl database insertion and retrieval slow

I am new to tcl. I have connected to an SqLite Database. I have around 100,000 records which i want to insert into database after computation. I use the following command to insert records into database 100,000times. I am sure i am doing something wrong here. What would be the appropriate way to do this? For insertion: db eval {insert into table values(value1,value2,value3,value4)} For retrieval i have to do select operation at least 1000 times, things are terribly slow: db eval {select x as x, y as y from table} { set z [expr $z + $x + $y] }
