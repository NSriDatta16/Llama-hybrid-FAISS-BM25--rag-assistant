Unfortunately no. Even if that information is correctly captured in the SSDL (i.e. the Storage Schema Definition language) there is no public API in EF to go from C-Space (conceptual model) property to S-Space (storage model) column. If your model is simple you can perhaps infer that information, using the EF metadata workspace and some simple heuristics, but once things get even a little complicated, those heuristics will break down. Your only option at that point is to write code to interpret MSL (mapping or CS-Space ) files, and use that in conjunction with the MetadataWorkspace to go from C-Space to S-Space . EDIT: as pointed out by KristoferA you often have the attribute on the C-Space property, so you can go to directly to that. Unfortunately that is not always the case, and often it gets out of sync with the database.
