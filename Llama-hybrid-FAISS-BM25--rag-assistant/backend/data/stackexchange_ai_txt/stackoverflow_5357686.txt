I imagine this can be done with a DOM parser, but it may be easier to implement with a SAX or STAX parser (it will also have a smaller memory imprint!). http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParser.html http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbem.html With SAX, you create a handler that will receive events as the parser reaches certain points in the document. With tags that can be embedded, you could use your handler to maintain the state of the cursor. For example, when you see the first tag, you could have an int representing the 'level' of the tag. With STAX, you stream the events and only need to deal with the events that you are interested in. If you are interested in 'start element events', you can get them, and keep the state of the cursor similar to how you would with a SAX parser.
