Custom link on embedded youtube video

I'm looking to direct the user on the channell webpage instead of the video url that I'm embedding. I've read the api and I didn't see any way to achieve this. I tried enclosing the embedded video in a and I added this code: $('#youtube').click(function() { document.write('http://www.youtube.com/user/0plus1'); return false; }); And surprise it won't work. How, if it's even possible I can do this?
