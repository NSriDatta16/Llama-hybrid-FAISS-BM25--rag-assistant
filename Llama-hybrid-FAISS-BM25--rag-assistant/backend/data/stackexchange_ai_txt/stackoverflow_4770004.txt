How to move/rename file from internal app storage to external storage on Android?

I am downloading files from the internet and saving the streaming data to a temp file in my app's internal storage given by getFilesDir() . Once the download is complete, I need to move the temp file to my download directory on External Memory (usually an SD Card). For some reason though, File.renameTo() isn't working for this. I'm guessing there's a problem because it's two separate file systems, but I can still download directly to the SD Card and the file URIs are correct. Is there another simple and quick way to transfer that file from internal memory to external or do I have to do a byte stream copy and delete the original?
