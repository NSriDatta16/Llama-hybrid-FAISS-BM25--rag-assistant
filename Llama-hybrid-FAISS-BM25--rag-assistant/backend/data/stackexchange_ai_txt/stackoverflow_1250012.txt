Why not SingleThreadModel synchronizing the attributes?

I'm a little confused by the following paragraph: "The effect of implementing SingleThreadModel is virtually the same as synchronizing the service method. Both can bring a web app to its knees without protecting the session and context state." As STM synchronizes the service method, so isn't it quite obvious that it'll also synchronize the state of session and context attributes from multiple threads. So why is it not going to help in implementing the STM interface in the servlet class?
