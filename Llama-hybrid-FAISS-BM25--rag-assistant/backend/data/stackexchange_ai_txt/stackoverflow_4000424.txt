While I'm not aware of any maze games that feature a zombie at the end (though I imagine it would be a great companion to Plants vs. Zombies), you can achieve your goal by using NSView's built-in full-screen method -enterFullScreenMode:withOptions: and exit with -exitFullScreenModeWithOptions: . To enter full screen at launch, just use the NSApplicationDelegate method -applicationDidFinishLaunching: . As for UI arrangement, I'd just open MainMenu.xib in Interface Builder and delete the window, then drag an NSView ("Custom View") or just a NSImageView into the IB document and open it up. Create an outlet to the view in your app delegate / app controller and connect it to the view.
