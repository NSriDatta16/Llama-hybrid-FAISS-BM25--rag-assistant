Building PHP WYSIWYG Editor

I am building a web application in which the user may add a page, edit the layout, drag drop element, resize element, format the text, edit the element attribute etc. In the page the user may include (retrieve) dynamic data, like maybe data from database, data generated by php code, etc. I have played around with cakephp and jquery lately and tried to build this app. But I stumbled upon on how to appropriately display the php code. I tried to look into the cakephp core code and find about output buffering and tried to utilize output buffering to parse the php code and use regex to display it but it is more likely to reinvent the wheel if I write the parser my self What I am asking is: Ok, to be more simple and specific I just want to ask, how to save and load the page that was created by the user especially if the page contains php code. I just want to know is there any other method than write my own parser or maybe a library to parse a php code? Ok that's all for now, does anyone have any idea how to implement it? Or maybe any page / website that could be useful to take some reference from? Maybe a sample code from which I can take some reference Thanks
