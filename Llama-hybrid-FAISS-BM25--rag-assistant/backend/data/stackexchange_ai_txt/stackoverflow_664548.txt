There is no "right" answer for this. Just pick any naming convention you like (and everybody else who will use your db) and stick with it. There are plenty of well designed naming conventions on internet. Just search Google on "SQL naming conventions". In my experience people use totally different styles, but it's OK as long as whole application (or all projects in same organization) use the same conventions.
