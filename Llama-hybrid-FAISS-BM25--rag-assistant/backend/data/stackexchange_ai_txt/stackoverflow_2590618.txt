XPath query returning 'false' in SimpleXML

I have an xml fragment as such: Content Provider Mammoth Genre Games Channel Name Games Trailers Collection Strategy Custom 1 PC DRM Protected N Aspect Ratio 16:9 Streaming Type VOD which I garnered from the snippet of $meta_tree->asXML() . So given that, I need to have an xpath query for each element, so I'm using: $meta_tree->xpath("/meta_data[meta_cat='Content Provider']"); but this returns false. I have tried: /meta_tree/meta_data[meta_cat='Content Provider'] //meta_data[meta_cat='Content Provider'] meta_data[meta_cat='Content Provider'] (this returns an array, but the array is empty) I've been using AquaPath , which validates my query, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Anyone got any ideas? DJS. EDIT: As per Tolomak's suggestion, here's some more info. The element is a fragment of a larger doc, as follows (names have been replaced with *** to protect the innocent): ... ... see snippet above ... I retrieve the fragment above by: $dom = new SimpleXMLElement(... xml_string ... ); foreach($dom->content as $content) { $contentMetadata = $this->getMetadata($content->meta_tree) } public function getMetadata($meta_tree) { echo $meta_tree->asXML(); } ANSWER: problem was the default namespace. I have chosen to strip them out rather than deal with the namespace, unless anyone knows how to register the xmlns default namespace in SimpleXMLElement.
