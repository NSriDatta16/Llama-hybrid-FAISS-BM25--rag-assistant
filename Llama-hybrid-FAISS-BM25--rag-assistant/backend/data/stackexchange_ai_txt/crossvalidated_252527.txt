Principal component analysis with non-independent observation

I have observations with 6 individual-level characteristics from 2000 units in 56 groups (villages). I know that within groups, characteristics are strongly related as individuals influence each other. Does it still make sense to apply PCA to the 6 individual characteristics in order to single out the 2 most important components?
