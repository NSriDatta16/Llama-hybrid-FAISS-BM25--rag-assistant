Which are some formal approaches for predicting multiple binary time series?

I have 10000 roughly similar individuals . For each individual I've got a response (binary time series) , 200 explanatory features (also time series), and 10 static features that represent characteristics of the individuals. I want to predict the one-step ahead value of the response for all of the 10000 individuals. Training data looks like this: individual time response ts_feature_1 ... static_feature_10 1 01/01/2020 00:00:00 0 0.1 ... A 1 01/01/2020 00:01:00 1 0.4 ... A 2 01/01/2020 00:00:00 1 -0.1 ... B ... ... ... ... ... ... 10000 31/12/2020 23:00:00 0 0.1 ... C If I had 1 individual, I would cast the data as a supervised learning problem (classification) and apply machine learning algorithms. But I have 10000 individuals and I don't want to have 10000 different models. Instead I want 1 model that can model the 10000 individuals at the same time. I'm currently combining the 10000 datasets into an unique dataset and training a xgboost on this unique dataset but I couldn't find bibliography that formalizes this approach. Can you recommend a formal approach to solve this problem? If possible, please cite sources.
