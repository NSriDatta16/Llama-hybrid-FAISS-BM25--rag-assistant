Sphinxsearch is an open-source full-text search server, designed from the ground up with performance, relevance (aka search quality), and integration simplicity in mind. Sphinx lets you either batch index and search data stored in an SQL database, NoSQL storage, or just files quickly and easily â€” or index and search data on the fly, working with Sphinx pretty much as a database server.
