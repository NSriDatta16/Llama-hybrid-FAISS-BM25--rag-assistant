In a Bayesian MCMC model, if we plug the average of posterior draws back into the Likelihood, would it be estimating the Posterior Predictive?

Suppose we have a Bayesian model with data $y$ and a parameter to be estimated, $\theta$ . Then the posterior is written as: $$ p(\theta | y) \propto p(y|\theta)p(\theta) $$ Suppose that we used an MCMC to obtain draws of the posterior, $p(\theta | y)$ . Suppose we then take the average of these draws and then plug the average back into the likelihood, $p(y|\theta)$ , and plot it across the support on $y$ . Would this distribution be approximating the posterior predictive? Or is it approximating something completely different?
