How do you interpret the PCA Score from data that has previously been logarithmic transformed?

I want to make financial inclusion by using PCA. Before I did PCA, I had done a logarithmic transformation on the data because my data was positive and highly skewed (I saw this from Jolliffe's book and this website: https://en.proft.me/2016/11/15/principal-component-analysis-pca-r/ ) Now I want to use the PCA Score to be the independent variable in the panel data regression analysis. How to interpret the results of the parameter coefficients? Until now I could not find a suitable reference. Please help me
