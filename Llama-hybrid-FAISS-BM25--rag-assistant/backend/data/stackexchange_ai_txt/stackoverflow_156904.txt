Executable has lots of information in it. An executable, has many types / classes of data stored inside its physical file. eg's are Executable code instructions Resources Dependency information (which dlls this binary depends on) The symbols that are exported from this binary etc There needs to be some way to organize all this information inside the .exe file format such that the OS can easily find all the information and load the executable and get things working. For this purpose a common binary format (created by M$ of-course) called PE (portable Executable) is used in the windows world. All the information i just listed (and many more) are described in detail in different sections of the binary. .data section One such section is the .data section. The .data section contains all the initialized global and static data, while the .bss section contains the uninitialized global data. Why do you require a separate section for globals ? Well, a global behaves like a global because it is created in an area of memory that exists for the lifetime of a program and is not a temporary data structure like a stack which might be overwritten / reused. (like normal auto variables). Compiler Therefore these variables need to be allocated in some permanent address in the heap, which unfortunately cannot be known at the time of compilation. So the compiler places all the global and static variables in this .data / .bss section, and the instructions that refer to these variables refer to these relatively permanent addresses in the .data / .bss. Linker When the linker loads the executable in the real world, it decides where these sections have to be placed and creates FIX UPs for these temp addresses such that the instructions that refers to the globals refer to the now real virtual addresses in the programs memory. Now you know what the .data section / area is and why the globals needs to be allocated some space in that area and how that helps the program in real time. Googling PE format and linker and .data section etc would get you the links.
