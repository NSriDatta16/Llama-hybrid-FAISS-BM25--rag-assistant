one thing i've found is how you will compare these two eventually, and how the normalized time series will affect the behavior of that comparison method. Let's say I have a set of original valued time series, and the values range from around 70 to 200. When I use your second normalization method, it has a mean of 0 and sd of 1. Even though the time series is exactly the same if you plot it, but notice that in the normalized time series, the values only range from -3 to 3. So what I found out is that, when I use k means clustering to cluster the original valued time series, the result is very good, around 88% accuracy. But the same clustering task on the new, normalized time series, has a lower accuracy of 66%. So to sum up, the different properties of the numbers before and after the normalization may affect the behavior of the algorithm that you're using to compare them. Beware.
