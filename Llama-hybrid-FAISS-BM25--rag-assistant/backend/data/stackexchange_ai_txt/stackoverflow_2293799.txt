Override default text for derived Windows Form control

When you drag a new Button onto a Windows Form it is automatically assigned the text "button1". If you have a control that inherits button called "CustomButton" then that one is automatically assigned the text "customButton1" when added to a form. Is it possible to make this text default to something else? For example, can I have the text default to "click me!" when the control is dragged onto a form?
