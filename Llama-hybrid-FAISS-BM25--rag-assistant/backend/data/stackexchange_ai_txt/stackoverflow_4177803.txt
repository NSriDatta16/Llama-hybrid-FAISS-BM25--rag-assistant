Can HTML5 databases and localStorage be shared across subdomains?

I am attempting to share data across subdomains using Safari. I would like to use an HTML5 database (specifically localStorage as my data is nothing but key-value pairs). However, it seems as though data stored to example.com can not be accessed from sub.example.com (or vice versa). Is there any way to share a single database in this situation?
