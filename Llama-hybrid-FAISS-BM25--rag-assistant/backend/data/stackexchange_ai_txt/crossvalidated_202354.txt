In random effects models, why do we integrate out the random effect?

I think I've seen some papers that don't integrate out random effects when computing the likelihood function and have also seen some papers where random effects are integrated out. Does this have something to do with whether a model is Bayesian or frequentist? Why is it integrated out?
