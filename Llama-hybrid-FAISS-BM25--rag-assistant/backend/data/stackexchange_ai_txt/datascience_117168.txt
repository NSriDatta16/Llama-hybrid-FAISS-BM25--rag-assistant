How can I write a Python program, that recognizes clapping sounds in an audio file, and saves them to disk?

I would like to write a Python program that takes an audio file as input, recognizes clapping sounds in it, then extracts these sounds into a file. My idea is the following: Get (or create) a dataset containing many audio clips with clapping sounds in them, Train a machine learning model to recognize these sounds, Test the model on new audio files. How can I achieve point 2 ? I already have a dataset ready, so I just need to run a ML algorithm on them. I've seen several alternatives: Keras PyTorch Scikit-learn But I have no idea which to choose for this particular task and how I would go about writing a Python script that does the training and testing. Can someone please help?
