jQuery - preceding node - no common parent node

Using jQuery I would like to locate a preceding node from a given node. The preceding node and the given node may not have the same parent node! Please check the following fragment: Some text Some text Some more text just a text another text yet another text Supposing if the current given node is $("span#cursorPos1") , and what I would like to locate is the preceding bold text, then the result should be " more ". Here, the given node is in div#sec3 , and the target preceding node is in div#sec1 . If the current given node is $("span#cursorPos2") , then the preceding bold text is " yet ". Here, both the given node and the target preceding node are in the same div#sec3 . Basically, the hierarchy should not be considered at all. From a given node the selector should simply find the preceding match. Please let me know on how this can be done. Thanks Srikanth
