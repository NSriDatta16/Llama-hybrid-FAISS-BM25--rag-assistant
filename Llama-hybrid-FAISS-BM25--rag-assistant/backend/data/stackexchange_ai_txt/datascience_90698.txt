M5P Model Trees are the closest thing that I'm aware of. In these trees, the leaf nodes are linear models. The difference is that the leaf nodes learn a multi-dimensional linear model instead of single-dimensional. (If you had a single-dimensional model at the leaf, how would you know which feature to use in the regression? What is the advantage over multi-dimensional?) Of course a model tree is just a single tree, not a forest. But you could easily build a random forest composed of model trees.
