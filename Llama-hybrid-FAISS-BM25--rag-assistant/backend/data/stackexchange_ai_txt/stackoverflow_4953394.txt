A potential problem with the direction you taking is that you're only storing one set of ratings for each Listing. If user B wants to rate a Listing, he'll have to overwrite User A's ratings. Instead of putting the ratings inside the Listing, you'll need to break out your ratings into a separate Ratings table, and use a ManytoMany relationship between your Listings and Ratings. That way, you can have multiple users rate a particular listing, and then you can calculate and show the averages for each listing. See this discussion for reference. It might be better to use an existing ratings app than starting from scratch. They already have documentation so you can get them up and running quickly, and they handle the database design for you.
