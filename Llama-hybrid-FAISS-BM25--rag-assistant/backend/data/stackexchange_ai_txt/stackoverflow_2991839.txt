Manager property is not available for Full Text Search (SharePoint 2010)

I had created a web part on MOSS 2007 which displays a organizational chart by searching (Full Text) the user profiles. To identify the subordinates of a user, I used to search for users with the particular user in Manager property. The query looked like this: SELECT AccountName, PreferredName, Manager, WorkEmail FROM scope() WHERE ("SCOPE" = 'People') AND Manager = 'domain\parent_user' But, the same query does not run in SharePoint 2010 as Manager crawled property does not exists. So, I created a new crawled property and mapped it to People:Manager(Text) now, the Manager property is always empty. Even a full crawl after clearing the indexes also not helping. Can anyone please help me in getting manager information in Full Text Search? Thanks in advance! Update: I tried mapping the crawled property with ows_Manager(Text) property also, still the same result.
