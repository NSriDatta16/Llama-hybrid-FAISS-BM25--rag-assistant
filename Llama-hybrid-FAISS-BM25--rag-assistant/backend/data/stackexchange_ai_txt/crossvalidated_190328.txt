Fortuitously or otherwise, your example is of optimal size (up to 7 values for each of 15 groups) first, to show that there is a problem graphically; and second, to allow other and fairly simple solutions. The graph is of a kind often called spaghetti by people in different fields, although it's not always clear whether that term is meant as affectionate or abusive. (The term spaghetti was used by Gene Zelazny in 1985, but may well be much older yet.) The graph does show the collective or family behaviour of all the groups, but it is fairly hopeless at showing the detail to be explored. One standard alternative is just to show the separate groups in separate panels, but that in turn can make precise group-to-group comparisons difficult; each group is separated from its context of the other groups. So why not combine both ideas: a separate panel for each group, but also show the other groups as backdrop? This hinges crucially on highlighting the group which is in focus and on downplaying the others, which is easy enough in this example given some use of line colour, thickness etc. In other examples, marker or point symbol choices might be natural instead. In this case, details of possible practical or scientific importance or interest are highlighted: We only have one value for A and M. We don't have all values for all given years in all other cases. Some groups plot high, some low, and so forth. I won't attempt an interpretation here: the data are anonymous, but that is the researcher's concern in any case. Depending on what is easy or possible in your software, there is scope for changing small details here, such as whether axis labels and titles are repeated (there are simple arguments both for and against). The larger issue is how far this strategy will work more generally. The number of groups is the major driver, more so than the number of points in each group. Roughly speaking, the approach might work up to about 25 groups (a 5 x 5 display, say): with more groups, not only do the graphs become smaller and more difficult to read, but even the researcher loses the inclination to scan all the panels. If there were hundreds (thousands, ...) of groups, it would usually be essential to select a small number of groups to show. Some mix of criteria such as selecting some "typical" and some "extreme" panels would be needed; that should be driven by project goals and some idea of what makes sense for each dataset. Another approach that can be efficient is to emphasize a small number of series in each panel. So, if there were 25 broad groups, each broad group could be shown with all others as backdrop. Alternatively, there could be some averaging or other summarization. Using (e.g.) principal or independent components might also be a good idea. Although the example calls for line plots, the principle is naturally much general. Examples could be multiplied, scatter plots, model diagnostic plots, etc. Similar but not identical ideas Cleveland (1985, pp.74, 203, 205, 268) shows graphs in which summary curves for groups are repeated with data shown separately for each group. (Note: these graphs do not appear in Cleveland 1994.) Wallgren et al. (1996, pp.47, 69) use the same idea. Cleveland, W.S. 1985. Elements of Graphing Data. Monterey, CA: Wadsworth.
