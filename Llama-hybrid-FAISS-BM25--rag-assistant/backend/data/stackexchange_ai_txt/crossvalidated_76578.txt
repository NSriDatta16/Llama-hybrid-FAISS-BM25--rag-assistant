You don't select data to fit the model ordinarily; you select a model that is likely to fit the data. Have you read some standard texts on logistic regression?

Note that use of proportion classified correctly in this context will be very misleading, e.g., there are cases in which you get a higher classification accuracy by discarding all the covariate data.
