2... 1 cleartool descr -l project:myProject@\myPVob with some grep, you have the list of components (writable or not) and policies. If you want only the Streams: cleartool lsproj -tree myProject@\myPVob You can repeat that for a Stream (to get the sub-streams) cleartool lsstream -tree myStream@\myPVob For the foundation baselines of a Stream: cleartool descr -fmt "%[mod_comps]CXp" stream:myStream@\ideapvob For the activities of a Stream: cleartool descr -fmt "%[activities]CXp" stream:myStream@\ideapvob If you want to consult the files (i.e. the exact version of each files) referenced by a stream, the quickest way would be to create a UCM dynamic view on that stream: cleartool mkview -tag myView_myStream -stream myStream@\myPVob -stg myStorage With a dynmic view, you will not have any load rule (since it is a dynamic view). You only need to mount the VOB which you want to see cleartool mount \myVob And you can start browsing the files M:\myView_myStream\myVob\... For snapshot view, see " Proper ‘cleartool mkview’ for ClearCase Snapshot view creation " mkview -snapshot -tag myView_myStream_snap -vws \\mySharedPath\myView_myStream_snap.vws -host myHostname -hpath \\mySharedPath\myView_myStream_snap.vws -gpath \\mySharedPath\myView_myStream_snap.vws myRootDir For the load rules, see: Config specs and Load rules difference
