According to the IDesign Standard , you should Assert every assumption. On average, every fifth line is an assertion. using System.Diagnostics; object GetObject() {...} object someObject = GetObject(); Debug.Assert(someObject != null); As a disclaimer I should mention I have not found it practical to implement this IRL. But this is their standard.
