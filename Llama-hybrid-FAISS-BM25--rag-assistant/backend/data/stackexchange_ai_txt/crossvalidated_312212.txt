Same results from bayesian and frequentist hypothesis testing? References needed

Are there any articles or books on the sameness the Bayesian and frequentist inference? I'm looking for more than just a statement that 'in large samples and for uninformative priors the results are the same, period'. Like when p-value approach leads to the same conclusions as Bayes Factor (as a way of doing bayesian hypothesis testing) in a concrete, chosen by an author circumstance. Have you read something? Please share, especially if you wrote some :-) EDIT. I see my question might cause some misunderstanding, so let me explain my understanding of 'the same results'. The same results of Bayesian and p-value approach is that the Bayes Factor and p-value both indicate the same decision: accept/reject null hypothesis, i.e. BF is above 1 or 3 (depending which scale has been chosen) and p-value is above 0.05.
