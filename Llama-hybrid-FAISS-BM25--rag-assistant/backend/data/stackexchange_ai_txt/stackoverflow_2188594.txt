Asp.net 2.0 Page Load sequence and SqlPagePersister property

I have 2 aspx pages. Both of them use the same MasterPage and both of them inherit from the same base class 'BasePage' which is of type System.Web.UI.Page. I overrode the SqlPagePersister property on the BasePage. For 1 page this works fine, for the other it doesn't. The sequence of events im seeing is this: Page A: MasterPage Init Page Load Retrieval of SqlPagePersister Property Page B: Retrieval of SqlPagePersister Property MasterPage Init Page Load Why would 2 pages with an identical set up call these methods out of order and what can be done to fix this?
