Magento eCommerce Templates

I am trying to port a site design from OSCommerce to Magento and I am finding it quite difficult. The documentation is quite poor tbh. Has anyone done this or used Magento in anyway? Any good tutorials/guides out there, if not for porting then just for building a template from scratch? Any help would be great, I've already been looking at this for a day or so and am getting no where...
