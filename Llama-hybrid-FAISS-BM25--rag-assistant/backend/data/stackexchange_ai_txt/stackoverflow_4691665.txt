I was able to achieve what I wanted that is rotate a complete animation along the z axis by importing the swf file into library of a new Flash file. Then I dragged the movie (imported swf ) onto the stage, created the movie clip and then used the 3d rotation tool. This way the transformation of rotation got applied on the complete animation
