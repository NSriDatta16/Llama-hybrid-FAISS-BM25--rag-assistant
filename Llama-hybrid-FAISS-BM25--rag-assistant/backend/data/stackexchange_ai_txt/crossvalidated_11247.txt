EDIT in response to last comments. Here is my suggestion for how to run the contest. The contest holder should decide on a list of "test questions". The 4-item questionnaires will be scored on how well they allow the guesser to guess the voter's responses to these "test questions". These test questions will be made public, and there will be a call for submissions for 4-test questionnaires. There will also be a call for participants to compete in the "guessing" contest. No participant is allowed to compete in both contests. The contest holder decides on a list of the (e.g.) 10 most promising questionnaires. The questionnaires are randomly assigned to volunteers. The volunteers interview potential voters. The survey that a voter completes consists of (i.) the complete list of "test questions" (ii.) plus one of the competing 4-item questionnaires. The completed surveys are assembled. A test is created for the guessers to complete. Each test question corresponds to an survey that a voter completed. The test question gives the voter's responses to the 4-item questionnaire. The guessers attempt to guess the voter's responses to the "test questions" based on that information. Compute a "guesser score" based on how well each guesser did overall, and compute a "questionnaire score" by taking a weighted average for each questionnaire weighted by the guesser score.
