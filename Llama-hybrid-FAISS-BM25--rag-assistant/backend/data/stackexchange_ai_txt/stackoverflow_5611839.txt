Avoid title tag on hover of an image due usage on a lightbox alike gallery

I'm using this lightbox gallery http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyGallery/ since it gaves me the chance of inputting some html, as a difference of other lightbox galleries (what I need is to show some facts that i pull from a mysql query, and only with the pretty gallery I could made a image shown, as well as data below it... but to do so, I need to use some html... got my point?) With this gallery, I could do so... but just using the title tag... and that is a problem, as when I do some hover above the link/image, the title pop's out... with all the html tags (and besides it doesnt show nice, im not quite sure about the seo effects...) So now, what I would like to ask is: a) how could I disable the hover of the title & alt image, yet allowing it to "survive" for the gallery (I try to disable it with jquery... but no success!!!) b) I want to do things rightly... do you guys know any lightbox alike that could gave me "out of the box" customization for the caption below using html? (not through iframes, since im pulling data from the db, and im pulling THAT precise row) So basicaly, I firstly want to disable that sideeffect of the usage of the title tag in this lightbox... and in the meanwhile, I want to know the existence of any gallery that allows embedding html in a div rather in a title & alt tag!) Thanks in advance guys! Marlie.
