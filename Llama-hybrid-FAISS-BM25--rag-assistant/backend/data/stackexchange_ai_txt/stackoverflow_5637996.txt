mysql is a great tool storages is not some stuff that works automagically. For being working well - the great developer needs to implement great schema and great code. What I wanted to say: if you have some issues now - it doesn't mean that they will disappear once you moved to another database (paradigm, ideology, etc). Even if they moved away - the new ones will come. Nothing happens without hard working. And especially to big volumes of data and high loaded projects - there is no general advice and silver bullet. ps: I'm thinking of using a NoSQL solution like MongoDB and then using Redis to create any relationships between tables. MongoDB can maintain relations. This is one more argument to not move to the databases you are not well experienced in.
