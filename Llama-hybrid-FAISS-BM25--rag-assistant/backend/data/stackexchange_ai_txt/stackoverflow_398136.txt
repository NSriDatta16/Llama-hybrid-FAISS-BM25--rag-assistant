Document management under Linux

after years navigating seas of unorganized documents, I'm starting to look for a cheap/free way to classify our work docs structurally, in order to tidy things up and to better enforce the workflow.. So I'd like to be able to tag documents according to project, customer, components used etc.. For example, imagine these documents: "Business requirements", tags: projectX "Project layout", tags: projectX, appserverZ "Class diagram", tags: projectX, businesslogic "Quotation", tags: projectX, customerY ...and so on.. In this way I could filter the documents by their tags, so e.g. get all the docs for a given project, or all the quotations for a given customer, or all the projects using a given application server.. Something like M-files would be perfect, but I'd prefer a Linux-based solution.. :) (even not web-based if it's possible) I spent all the day trying out DMSes found on Freshmeat and Wikipedia, but I couldn't find one that worked like M-files.. :/ I'd appreciate any hint/pointer, many thanks!
