Here is a useful rule of thumb from what I have seen of typical Java projects: The bottom-most package in Java should be a file in Python What does that mean? If your Java project was organized: toplevel/ subproject/ Foo.java Bar.java subproject2/ Baz.java Qux.java Then your Python project should look like: toplevel/ subproject.py Things to notice re: organization: Do not use inner classes. Just put classes in the same module By convention, things that start with _ are "private" It's OK to have "public variables"
