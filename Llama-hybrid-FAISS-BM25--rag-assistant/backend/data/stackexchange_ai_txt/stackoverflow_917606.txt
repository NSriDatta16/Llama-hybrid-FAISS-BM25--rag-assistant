Not targeting your specific questions, but once-upon-a-time there was a team of developers and testers deploying a web application to a set of servers for testing and verification. When it was time for release the customer got the deployable files and deployed it as per specifications ... To a set of servers nothing alike our development servers. There was a massive influx of bugs, chaos ensued, the customer raged and the poor developers didn't get to sleep. My tip is one of the most obvious; make sure the development environment matches the production environment to avoid environment specific bugs.
