Well this is how i did it, and it worked fine. $(document).ready(function() { $(".clickitey").click(function () { if($("#mdpane:animated").length == 0) { $("#mdpane").slideToggle("slow"); $(".jcrtarrow").toggleClass("arrow-open"); } }); }); this is not doing what your code does ofcourse this is a code from my site, but i just like to point how i ignored the clicks that were happening during the animation. Please let me know if this is inefficient in anyway. Thank you.
