Webmail: HTML headers

HTML e-mails are a complex beast. Deciding what to send (as the sender) and what to display (as the recipient) is tricky and potentially dangerous. On the recipient side of things, we have webmail and we have regular e-mail clients . For my purposes, I consider 'webmail' anything that displays the HTML e-mail as part of something that in itself is HTML, and regular e-mail clients anything that displays the HTML e-mail in a different context (e.g. OS- and program-specific GUI). What should webmail do with HTML headers ( , , , ...) in an e-mail? Is there a spec somewhere, be that as an actual standard or de-facto-standard? My motivation for asking is that we use HTML Purifier to sanitise our HTML and if its Core.CollectErrors feature reports changes, they're reported. This 'reported' is both necessary... and frustrating. We strip out some of the reported errors as insignificant for our purposes, but HTML headers mark a massive hurdle: Someone could potentially use in their e-mail, which we would strip out. (HTML Purifier is intended for HTML fragments , not full documents) The desire to use things like in HTML e-mails certainly seems to exist , and there are plenty of e-mail clients that send -tags in an HTML header (e.g. Outlook), but how are things handled in the wild? Is it safe to strip them out silently (which for our purposes denotes a 'non-breaking change') and lay proverbial blame on the sending party if it does break? Is that reasonable ? Has someone ever decided this in the one or other way? My google-fu is weak. :(
