[Bias] simply represents how far your model parameters are from true parameters of the underlying population. That is incorrect and very badly written. Bias is the difference between the true value of a parameter and the average value of an estimate of the parameter. Represents how good it generalizes to new instances from the same population. That's even worse. Variance is the average of the square of the difference between an estimator and the average value of the estimator.
