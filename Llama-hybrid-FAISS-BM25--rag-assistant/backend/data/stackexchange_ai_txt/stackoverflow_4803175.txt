Get events from polyline or marker from a DirectionsRenderer

I'm using the DirectionsService and the route method to generate a DirectionsResult. I'm also using the DirectionsRenderer object to display results because it's very easy to use. I've no problem detecting directions_changed events, but I would like to know if it's possible do get events from the polyline representing the itinerary, or even, events from markers (small circles) generated after dragging the polyline. When using google maps (maps.google.com, "Get Directions"), you can drag the polyline, right click on it (or on markers), this has the effect to display a menu. So I guess there is a way to catch events from DirectionsRenderer (supposing Google use this object in that case). If anybody got an idea
