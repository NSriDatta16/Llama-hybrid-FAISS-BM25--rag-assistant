If you need other values from the tables as well, use: select max(a.col1), sum(b.col2), col3 from a, b, c where A.bID = B.bID, and B.cID = C.cID group by C.col3 On all columns not grouped by you need to use aggregate functions such as AVG: Average of the column. COUNT: Number of records. MAX: Maximum of the column. MIN: Minimum of the column. SUM: Sum of the column.
