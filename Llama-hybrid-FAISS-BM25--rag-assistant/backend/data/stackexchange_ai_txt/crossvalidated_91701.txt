logistic regression for modelling

I have these data plotted above. The explanatory variable represents intensity levels of ground shaking at different locations in an earthquake, and the response variable represents amounts of compensation awarded to damaged buildings. I want to fit a model to these data so that how much compensation is likely to be awarded can be estimated given an intensity level. Can I use logistic regression here? How should I go about building the model for these data? Thanks in advance.
