Short answer no, you should redesign. Long answer yes, but it's pretty crazy and will be a real pain to setup and manage. One way would be to roundrobin the main database's replication among the sites. Use a script to replicate for say 30 seconds from a site record how far it got and then go on the the next site. You may wish to look at replicate-do-db and friends to limit what is replicated. Another option that I'm unsure would work is to have N mysqls in the main office that replicates from each of the site offices, and then use the federated storage engine to provide a common view from the main database into the per-site slaves. The site slaves can replicate from the main database and pick up whichever changes they need.
