As you are dealing with countries, most likely you will have to use fixed effects. Intuitively, you can see random effects as follows: you draw the observations of a random sample, for example you have time series of the wear and tear of shoes of the same brand and type. It is unlikely that all shoes have the same wear and tear over time, however one wear and tear profile is not really a property of a particular shoe. On the other hand, GDP and other parameters are country specific. If you model GDP over time per country, even if you take a couple of good predictors per country, it is very unlikely that you will capture all of the variation of GDP. You explanatory variables will be correlated with the error terms, for example if one of your explanatory variable is unemployment, low unemployment will lead to a high GDP, but unemployment is not truly exogenous, high GDP might cause also low unemployment. In that case you use fixed effects.
