If you start at the MSDN doco for System.Collections , you can drill down into the individual collection types for more details about those "lists" and how to use them. For example, the doco for Hashtable says, "Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key." There's also a nice discussion of System.Collections.Generic in Understanding Generics .
