One alternative, which also leverages Pax Exam, is what we did in an OSGi testing framework (that tests OSGi framework implementations). Rather than duplicating the whole explanation of how it works, you can find that here: http://opensource.luminis.net/wiki/display/OSGITEST/OSGi+testing+framework It does not use Maven, and writing new tests is explained here: http://opensource.luminis.net/wiki/display/OSGITEST/Writing+a+framework+test Maybe some of the solutions can inspire you. All in all, there are many test frameworks out there for OSGi (just like there are for non-OSGi) but so far there has one been any one that "makes the rest obsolete".
