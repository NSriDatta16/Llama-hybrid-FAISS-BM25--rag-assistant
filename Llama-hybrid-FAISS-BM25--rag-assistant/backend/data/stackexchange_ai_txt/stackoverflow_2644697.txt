Well, there is no real elegant solution due to two facts: String s in Java are immutable Java gives you no real nice map(f, list) function as you have in functional languages. Asymptotically speaking, you can't get a better run time than your current method. You will have to create a new string using toLowerCase() and you will need to iterate by yourself over the list and generate each new lower-case string, replacing it with the existing one.
