Just from a cursory reading, and not knowing much about experimental design, RSM just seems to be the idea that you assume that the variables which you can adjust are related to the output via a function of some form, and you fit this function by doing experiments. It is the same sort of general model as you consider when fitting a preidctive model (like a neural network), but in RSM you are assuming that you can adjust the $x$-variables, which is not generally the case when fitting a predictive model. There is a book on experimental design with a really nice example showing how to use this idea to design a toy helicopter. This pdf seems to have a similar example. It might be a good idea to get a look at the example in order to understand what they are trying to do. You can call $y$ anything you want Yes, it means transpose. It appears that they care whether a vector is a row or a column, and "vector" means column by default. Yes, vector function means that it is a function which takes a $k$-dimensional (column) vector to a $p$-dimensional (column) vector. The notation $f(\mathbf{x})$ does technically mean the value of the function $f$ at $\mathbf{x}$, but it is very common to mix up the two notations. For example, people might say "the derivative of $\sin(x)$" instead of "the derivative of the sine function." $\beta$ is a $p$-dimensional column vector. You could have an error term whose mean wasn't zero, but then you could include that part of the error term into $f$, so assuming the mean is zero doesn't make the model any less general. See also: linear regression. Yes, $f'(\mathbf{x})$ means the transpose. But since $f(\mathbf{x})$ is a column, $f'(\mathbf{x})$ is a row (a $1 \times p$ vector) and $f'(\mathbf{x})\beta$ is matrix multiplication of a $1 \times p$ and a $p \times 1$, which results in a scalar, not a $p \times p$ matrix. No, $y$ is a scalar. The only place where you made a mistake is in the last step. Look at the examples that appear later in the same page, and you will see that $y$ is not supposed to be a matrix.
