I solved this by scrapping my setup.php file, and in my mysql4-install-0.1.0.php did the following: startSetup(); $setup->addAttribute('order', 'pr_email_sent', array('type' => 'text', 'default' => 'false' ) ); $installer->endSetup(); ?> Works like a charm now. Not sure what the difference is, besides the obvious... The lack of documentation in Magento is pretty uninspiring.
