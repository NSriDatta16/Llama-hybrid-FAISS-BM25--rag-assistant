Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, the Minimax algorithm is also part of the larger field of AI, but the approach is not based on ML. In fact these algorithms showed much more promising results in the earlier stages of AI research (Deep Blue was the first computer to win a grandmaster in chess and it did not use any ML). You can get an good idea of the various other fields included in AI by looking at the well-known book: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. In my opinion, I would not try to fit the concept of Data Science in the illustration above, since the definition is not well defined (or rather defined differently in various literature) and is actually quite broad. That being said, AI will probably be considered by most people as part of Data Science.
