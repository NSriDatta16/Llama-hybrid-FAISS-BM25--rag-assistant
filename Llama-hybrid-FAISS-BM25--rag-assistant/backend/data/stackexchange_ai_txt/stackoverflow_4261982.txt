NEW Answer: Facebook has started phasing out FBML and is strongly encouraging developers to switch to Requests 2.0. Using the new FB.ui({method:'apprequest',...}); in the JavaScript SDK is an easier way to do this. It also supports off-Facebook pages http://af-design.com/blog/2011/02/17/using-facebook-requests-to-promote-a-website/ OLD Answer: I found that passing the FBML as an attribute for fb:serverfbml worked.
