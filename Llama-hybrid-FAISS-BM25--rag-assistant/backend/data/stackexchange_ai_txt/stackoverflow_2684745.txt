Approaches to replace cursor in pure AS3 / Flare project?

I've got a pure AS3 (no Flex) project that uses Flare to display and interact with a data visualization. I just implemented some panning behavior, so you can click and drag the visualization around, and now I'd like to give the user a visual indicator that this is possible, by switching the arrow cursor with a nice grabby-looking hand icon. The user can click and drag at any time except when the mouse is over a clickable node (at which time the cursor swaps to a pointer - this behavior is already in place). So... 1) Do I need to create my own custom bitmap/sprite or is there a palette of built-in cursors I can use? (I'm not using Flex.) 2) Is there a way to simply replace the default arrow with the pan cursor project-wide, or do I need to attach the swapping to mouse events on display objects? Can I use the stage object to make this behavior apply everywhere? 3) How do I perform the swap? Do I use the Cursor object directly or do I need to get involved with the CursorManager? Any guidance, pseudo-code, or words of wisdom is greatly appreciated!
