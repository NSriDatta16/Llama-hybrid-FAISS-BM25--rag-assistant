Very good question, that each newbie in the field of machine learning/tuning will pose himself. I am working on a paper that tries to answer this question for some of the most well known ML algorithms (elastic net, knn, decision tree, svm, random forest or xgboost). As the paper will be only published next week on arxiv, currently I can only recommend you to have a look at mlrHyperopt in R, there are some predefined tuning spaces.
