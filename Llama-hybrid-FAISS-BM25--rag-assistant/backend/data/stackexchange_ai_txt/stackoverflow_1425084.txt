Adding page-specific Javascript to each view in CakePHP

In an attempt to keep my scripts maintainable, I'm going to move each into their own file, organised by controller and action: // scripts which only apply to /views/posts/add.ctp /app/webroot/js/page/posts/add.js // scripts which only apply to /view/users/index.ctp /app/webroot/js/page/users/index.js That's all cool, however I'd like for these to be automatically added by the Controller, since it obviously knows the name of both the controller and action. I figure the best place for this is in AppController::beforeRender() . (yes?) The only problem is that I don't know how to actually add this into the $scripts_for_layout variable. I thought that getting a reference to the javascript helper object would work, but I can't find it from the controller! class AppController extends Controller { var $helpers = array("javascript", "html", "form"); function beforeRender() { // ??? } }
