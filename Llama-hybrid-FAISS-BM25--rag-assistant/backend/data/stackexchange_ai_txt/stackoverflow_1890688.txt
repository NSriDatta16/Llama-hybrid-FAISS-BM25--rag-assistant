Can I embed other files in a DLL?

I'm writing a plug-in for another application through an API. The plug-ins are distributed a DLLs. Is it possible to embed other files in the DLL file like pdfs, images, chm help files etc... I want to be able to provide documentation with my plug-in but I'd still like to retain the ability to distribute the plug-in as a single file the user can just drag and drop onto the application to install.
