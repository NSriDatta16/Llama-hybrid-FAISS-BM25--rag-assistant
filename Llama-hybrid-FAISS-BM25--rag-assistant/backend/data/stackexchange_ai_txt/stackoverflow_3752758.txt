Configure Code Validation in Eclipse Galileo (3.5)?

In Eclipse Ganymede (3.4), you could navigate to: Window > Preferences > Validation ... and enable/disable various Validators. This feature seems to have disappeared in 3.5. Was this feature moved/renamed/refactored? Where can I find it now? I can't find any documentation pointing me to a new location. This is what I'm expecting: This is what my Preferences window looks like: I'm looking to disable several Validators, but the Seam Validator is my highest priority.
