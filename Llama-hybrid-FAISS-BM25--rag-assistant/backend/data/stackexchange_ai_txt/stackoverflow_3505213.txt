I'd do a simple check on consecutive consonants or vowels. If there are more than four of any in a row, than there is a high probability of nonsense. Furthermore, check for more than two repetitions of the same character. When looking at some nonsense text, I'm sure you'll find some pragmatic reciepes ;-)
