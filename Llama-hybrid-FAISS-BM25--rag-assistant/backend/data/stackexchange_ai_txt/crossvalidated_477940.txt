Binomial Logistic Regression Plot interpretation (r plot)

I have built a logistic regression model to predict the amount of people likely to receive a Nobel Prize in science given "university attended, gpa earned, city, age, # of publications, awards received, and years of experience in the field" as predictors. The problem (might be normal) out of 1800 entries only 2% have received the prize, thus making the 0 (no prize) excessively dominant. My current probability regression plot: Questions: 1- While this is understandable given the nature of the data set, is it normal ? 2- Can it be improved? alternatives ? suggestions ? Thanks
