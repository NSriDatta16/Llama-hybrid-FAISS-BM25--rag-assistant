How to sort XML document in linq by an attribute value?

I've tried to sort my xml file by attribute's value with no luck. data.Descendants("person").OrderBy(x => x.Attribute("id").Value); data contains: Abra 25 Cadabra 29 Hokus 40 Pokus 30 Answer given here does not work for me. I'm using MVS 2010 for Windows Phone 7. I would be grateful for any help. -- Update Thank You for quick responses! juharr asked a good question... i was expecting that OrderBy would modify data . Now i know i was wrong. I want to modify data and i've done as follows (thanks Matt Lacey): var people = data.Elements("person").OrderBy(p => (string)p.Attribute("id")); data.Descendants("person").Remove(); data.Element("persons").Add(people); but i still got nothing. Data is empty, it contains only I wonder what's wrong now. I manage to solve my problem by using this code: XDocument datatemp = new XDocument(data); var people = datatemp.Descendants("person").OrderBy(x => (int)int.Parse(x.Attribute("id").Value)); data.Descendants("person").Remove(); data.Element("persons").Add(people); Is any other way (more elegant) to modify data using OrderBy instead of creating datatemp ?
