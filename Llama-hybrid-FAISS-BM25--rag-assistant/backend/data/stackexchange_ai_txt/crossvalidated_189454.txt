How to test if a cross-covariance matrix is non-zero?

The background of my study : In a Gibbs sampling where we sample $X$ (the variable of interests) and $Y$ from $P(X|Y)$ and $P(Y|X)$ respectively, where $X$ and $Y$ are $k$-dimensional random vectors. We know that the process is usually split into two stages: Burn-in Period, where we discard all the samples. Denote the samples as $X_1\sim X_t$ and $Y_1\sim Y_t$. "After-Burn-in" Period, where we average the samples $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k X_{t+i}$ as our final desired result. However, the samples in the "after-burn-in" sequence $X_{t+1}\sim X_{t+k}$ are not independently distributed. Therefore if I want to inspect the variance of the final result, it becomes $$\operatorname{Var}[\bar{X}] = \operatorname{Var}\left[\sum_{i=1}^k X_{t+i}\right] = \frac{1}{k^2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^k\operatorname{Var}[X_{t+i}] + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^k \operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i},X_{t+j}]\right)$$ Here the term $\operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i},X_{t+j}]$ is a $k\times k$ cross-covariance matrix applies to any $(i,j)$ with $i For example, I have $$X_{t+1} = (1,2,1)'\\ X_{t+2} = (1,0,2)'\\ X_{t+3} = (1,0,0)'\\ X_{t+4} = (5,0,-1)'$$ then I could estimate the covariance matrix $\operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i}, X_{t+i+1}]$ with $$ \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=1}^3 (X_{t+i}-\mu_{t+i})(X_{t+i+1}-\mu_{t+i+1})' $$ Now I am interested in if the resulting estimation is significantly non-zero so that I need to include it into my variance estimation of $\operatorname{Var}[\bar{X}]$. So here comes my questions : We sample $X_{t+i}$ from $P(X_{t+i}|Y_{t+i})$. Since $Y_{t+i}$ is changing, I think $X_{t+i}$ and $X_{t+i+1}$ are not from the same distribution, so $\operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i},X_{t+j}]$ is not the same as $\operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i},X_{t+i}]$. Is this statement correct? Suppose I have enough data to estimate $\operatorname{Cov}[X_{t+i},X_{t+i+1}]$ (neighboring samples in the sequence), is there any way to test if the covariance matrix is significantly a non-zero matrix? Broadly speaking, I am interested in an indicator which guides me to some meaningful cross-covariance matrices that should be included in my final variance estimation.
