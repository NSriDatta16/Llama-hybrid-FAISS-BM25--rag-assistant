Where did this fragment of XML Schema come from? Can you post the signature of the operation being called, including the [OperationContract]? Same with the service contract. What is the signature of the Java proxy that you are calling? I'm concerned that this schema could validate some XML you might not want. For instance, did you notice that you could have a sequence of Field, Value, Value? That doesn't explain where 'Guid' is coming from, though.
