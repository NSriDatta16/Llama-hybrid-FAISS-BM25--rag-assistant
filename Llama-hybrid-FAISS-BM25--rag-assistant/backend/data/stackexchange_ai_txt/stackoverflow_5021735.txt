So heres what I ended up with thanks mainly to Al's direction: :hi User1 term=NONE cterm=NONE ctermfg=Magenta ctermbg=Black :set laststatus=2 :set statusline=%1*%F%h%m%w\ [Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M\")}]\ [Mod\ Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\",getftime(expand(\"\%\%\")))}]%=\ [%p%%]\ [%l/%L] Description: :hi User1 term=NONE cterm=NONE ctermfg=Magenta ctermbg=Black This command sets the background color of a profile called user1 equal to Black and the word color equal to Magenta. What we do is make the status line equal to this profile, so that we can change the color of our status bar. :set laststatus=2 This command makes the status bar visible constantly by putting it two lines about the bottom of the vim command. :set statusline=%1*%F%h%m\ [Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M\")}]\ [Mod\ Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\",getftime(expand(\"\%\%\")))}]%=\ [%p%%]\ [%l/%L] This is the command that actually shows what is going to be in the status bar. In this command we use several functions (eg. strftime,expand...) that are vim specific. We also use the %(letter) to denote specific vim variables. The rest of the text just prints out what you write to the screen with the \ and then a space after to represent a space. Now to describe the specific variables. %1* is the var the corresponds to the color that we did in the first command, this sets the status bar equal to those colors %F%h%m says display the full file name, the help file flag, and the modified flag [Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M\")}]\ says display [Time: (current time)] and display it at hours and minutes. If you want a different time format like maybe to include the year or something do a :help strftime. [Mod\ Time:\ %{strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\",getftime(expand(\"\%\%\")))}] says display [Mod Time: (mod time)]. Its in hours:minutes:seconds. %=\ [%p%%]\ [%l/%L] says right align and show the percent of the file you've been through and [(current line num)/(max line num)].
