I would suggest to atleast go with CV=3 for the evaluation of your model. Or you can just split your dataset into testing and training set in the ratio of 70:30 which implies that 70% of the data will be treated as training and rest as the testing set. For the feature selection using logistic regression you can use Lasso and ridge regularization as well.
