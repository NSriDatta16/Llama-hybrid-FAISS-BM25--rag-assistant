I'm sorry, but there seems to be some confusion here: Bayes' theorem is not up for discussion of the neverending Bayesian- Frequentist debate. It is a theorem that is consistent with both schools of thought (given that it is consistent with Kolmogorov's probability axioms). Of course, Bayes' theorem is the core of Bayesian statistics, but the theorem itself is universal. The clash between frequentists and Bayesians mostly pertains to how prior distributions can be defined or not. So, if the question is about Bayes' theorem (and not Bayesian statistics): Bayes' theorem defines how one can calculate specific conditional probabilities. Imagine for instance that you know: the probability of somebody having symptom A, given that they have disease X p(A|X); the probability of somebody in general having disease X p(X); the probability of somebody in general having symptom A p(A). with these 3 pieces of information you can calculate the probability of somebody having disease X, given that they have sympotm A p(X|A).
