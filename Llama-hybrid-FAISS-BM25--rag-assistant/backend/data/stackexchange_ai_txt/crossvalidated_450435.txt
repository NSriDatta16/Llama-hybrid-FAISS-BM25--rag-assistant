Probably take a look at this answer , and consider van der Waerden scores before running EFA in order to address skewness. In some respects, skewness can also result in false results due to extreme values in tails of your distributions, which can bias the covariance to the point of claiming there is non-zero covariance, when in fact after skew-zeroing the data the covariance could disappear altogether. I would also not get hung up on fit statistics for factor analysis or PCA, since the only thing you obtain are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, less the communalities and rotations which can be done. You mentioned a particular software package, but eigendecomposition of a covariance(correlation) matrix is not not a unique solution for which different software packages obtain the same results. Reconstruction of the covariance matrix using results from different software packages, is however, unique when sandwiching together the decomposed elements like $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{E}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{E^\top}$ from PCA or $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{V^\top}$ from SVD. In other words, you will get exactly the same covariance matrix from individual components spawned by different packages, but won't obtain the same component values from different packages. Goodness-of-fit statistics for PCA and FA are hinged to, in part, non-unique results, and when rotating, the results are more removed from uniqueness.
