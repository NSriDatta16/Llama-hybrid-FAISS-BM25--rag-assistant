It depends on the code being tested and how thorough you want to be. If methodA()'s outcome is effected by methodB() you could test just methodA(), however as duffymo says it's best to test both, and as robert says its best to code the test for methodA() as if you didn't know it was implemented through methodB() and the same for methodB(). Since both methodA() and methodB() are public, each should be tested separately. But it's best if the test for methodA() assures methodA() did its job and the test for methodB() assures methodB() did its job, so the tests shouldn't really be the same.
