Can't append HTML code into one div by using jQuery

I have one div id=userinfo And now I want to append something into this div, depending on the localStorage. if (localStorage==0){$("#userinfo").append(" Test ");} else {$("#userinfo").append(" Hello ");} But it failed, no matter I input this script into separate JS file or add them into the head of the html file. I tried exclude this with Google chrome developer tool's console, it works as expected. I've tried another way round change the script into: if (localStorage==0){alert("Test");} else {alert("Hello");} And add this into JS file, it works! So, now I'm stacked why my jQuery code not work?
