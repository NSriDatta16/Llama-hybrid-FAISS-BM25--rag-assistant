You could do something like what YouTube does - just have it sorted by largest count per category. For example - most viewed, most commented, most liked. In each category a different page could come first, though the rankings might likely be correlated. If you only need a single ranking, then you would have to come up with a formula of some sort, preferably derived empirically by analyzing a bunch of data you already have and deciding what should be calculated as good/bad, and working backwards to fit an equation that fits your decision. You could even attempt a machine learning approach to "learn" what a good weighting is for combining each of these numbers as in your example formula. Doing it manually might also not be too hard.
