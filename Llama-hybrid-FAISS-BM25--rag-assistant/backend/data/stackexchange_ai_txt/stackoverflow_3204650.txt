What context is this code being used? If it's a library other people outside your organization are using, you shouldn't touch this stuff unless you're releasing a new version and explicitly removing support for some OSs. In the latter case, you should remove all the relevant IFDEF code as part of making a new release, and should be explicit about what you are removing. If it's a library people inside your organization are using, you should ask those people what you can remove, not us. If it's code being used very narrowly (i.e. you control its use directly), you can, if you wish, safely remove any sort of compiler portability, since you are only using one compiler.
