NLP and Ruby to characterize quality of writing

I'd like to take a shot at characterizing incoming documents in my app as either "well" or "poorly" written. I realize this is no easy task, but even a rough idea would be useful. I feel like the way to do this would be via na√Øve Bayes classifier with two classes, but am open to suggestions. So two questions: is this method the optimal (taking into account simplicity) way to do this assuming a large enough training db? are there libraries in ruby (or any integratable JRuby or whatever) that i can plug into my rails app to make this happen with little fuss? Thanks!
