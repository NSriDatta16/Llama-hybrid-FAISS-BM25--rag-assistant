According to Web SQL's W3C page, the specification is no longer in active maintenance and the Web Applications Working Group does not intend to maintain it further ( http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/ ). Why don't you give HTML5's persistent storage a try instead? There's a great tutorial here that also features a chapter on local storage hacks before HTML5, so you may read it if you're not planning to dive into HTML5 just yet. You may also try Google Gears , as it features an interface to a local sqlite3 database in which you may store your offline data. As for the synchronization mechanism try persistanceJS . It should help you with both HTML5 and Google Gears options. EDIT Apparently persistanceJS has no support for rails just yet, but there's a tutorial on how to use local HTML5 storage with rails here , and there's a rails plugin to easily enable gears on rails apps here . Those should get you started.
