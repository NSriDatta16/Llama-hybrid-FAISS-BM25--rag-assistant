Ant + Vista 64 : "Unable to locate tools.jar" (jre/jdk conflict?)

I'm trying to use ant in a vista 64 environment to build some docbook/xml files. However, I can't resolve this error message. Anybody have suggestions? C:\Users\Robert Admin>ant Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find it in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\li b\tools.jar Buildfile: build.xml does not exist! Build failed Googling around, I see that this tools.jar message is the result of ant not being able to find the jdk. In fact, C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\li b\tools.jar is a JRE installed with another program (I'm guessing). Tools.jar is located here: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\lib I can't seem to tell Ant to look in the JDK path, only the JRE path which was already there. (Judging from the Ant documentation, it seems that JRE is insufficient).
