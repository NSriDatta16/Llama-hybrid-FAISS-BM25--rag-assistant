C# LINQ TimeSpan Average Days

I am learning LINQ and want a LINQ query that is the equivalent of the following code. The IEnumerable list contains a sorted list of dates: Oldest to newest. The code below derives TimeSpan s by subtracting the array's zeroth element date from array's first element date, the first element date from the 2nd, 2nd from the 3rd and so on. The TimeSpan.Days are then averaged elsewhere in the code. I trust a LINQ query would not require the construction of an array. The IEnumerable structure could be used as the data source. IEnumerable list; // contains a sorted list of oldest to newest dates // build DateTime array DateTime[] datesArray = null; TimeSpan ts; List daysList = new List (); datesArray = (from dt in list select dt).ToArray(); // loop through the array and derive the TimeSpan by subtracting the previous date, // contained in the previous array element, from the date in the current array element. // start the loop at element 1. for (int i = 1; i for averaging elsewhere. } Thank you, Scott
