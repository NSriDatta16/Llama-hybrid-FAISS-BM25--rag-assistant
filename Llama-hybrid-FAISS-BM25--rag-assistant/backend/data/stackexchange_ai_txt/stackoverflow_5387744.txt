In fact, yes! You no longer need to declare the actual iVar. In short, simply leave out this part: controlType varName; For now, you do still need to explicitly "synthesize". (As far as I can see, they could possibly automate that in the future. But for now you have to "synthesize" to create the setter and getter.) You do still have to release the memory - there's really no way that could be automated, as memory handling is "real he-man programming." For any new chums reading, don't forget the "self." part when using the property. Plus note that XCode4 even has a new automatic thingy. Simply drag from the interface builder, to your .h file, and it will do everything for you -- try it! In answer to your suplementary question: An IBOutlet DOES NOT PARTICULARLY NEED TO BE a property - you can just use a normal cheap iVar. On the other hand, if you wish, to you can use a property. Furthermore: you can even use the new trick (2011) of not bothering to declare the ivar, just use the property declaration, and shove an IBOutlet in there!
