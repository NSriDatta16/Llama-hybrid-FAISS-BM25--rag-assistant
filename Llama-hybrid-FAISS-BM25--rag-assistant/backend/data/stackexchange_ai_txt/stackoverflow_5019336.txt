You might want to have a look at the feature comparison table compiled by IBM (please see at the bottom of the page) detailing the relative options within AWT, Swing and SWT. The equivalent of a JPanel in SWT is a Composite , CLabel or Canvas depending on what you want to achieve. NB: The eclipse SWT API is a bit temperamental. @Gilbert_Le_Blanc is correct if you want the JLabel properties. I recommend the feature comparison table to see just what it is that you need.
