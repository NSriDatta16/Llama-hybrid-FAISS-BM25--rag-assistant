how to calculate a summary value and statistical error in time series

I have a set of data that comes for empirical measurements over a number of days. From the beginning of the experiment to the end of it, every five minutes temperature was measured inside (Ti) and outside (To) a box, and heat flux (Q) was measured between one of the walls of the box and the outside. For every time point I use these three measures to calculate the thermal resistance, which is R = (Ti - To)/Q Obviously each R has a measurement uncertainty due to Ti, To and Q, Obviously there is correlation between measurement, because each measurement is not independent of what has been measured before. Hence my questions are: 1) what is the most appropriate way to summaries how the R value changes over time in one single value? 2) given the kind of data I describe, what is the most appropriate way of finding an error value for the value in question (1)? The time series looks like this (it has one anomalous negative peak because of some other stuff that happened to the box at the time of the peak):
