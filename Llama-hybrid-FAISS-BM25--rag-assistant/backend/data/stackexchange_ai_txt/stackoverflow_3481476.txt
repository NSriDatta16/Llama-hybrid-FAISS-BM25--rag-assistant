Inserting Data into MySQL Table via PHP

I'm trying to add some simple user data into a database via a webpage written in PHP, but the following code (more specifically, line three) breaks the page. Am I using the wrong MySQL function? I'm pretty sure my query is formatted correctly. mysql_query("CREATE TABLE stats ( userAgent CHAR(20) )"); $userAgent = $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]; mysql_query("INSERT INTO stats VALUES ("$userAgent"));
