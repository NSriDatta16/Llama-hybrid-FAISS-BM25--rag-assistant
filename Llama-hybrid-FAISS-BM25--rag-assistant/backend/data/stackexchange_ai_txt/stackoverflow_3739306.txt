If we assume that seed is a list of ints rather than a string (or convert it if it is not) then the following should do what you want with a bit more elegance: def lfsr(seed, taps) : while True: nxt = sum([ seed[x] for x in taps]) % 2 yield nxt seed = ([nxt] + seed)[:max(taps)+1] Example : for x in lfsr([1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0],[1,5,6]) : print x
