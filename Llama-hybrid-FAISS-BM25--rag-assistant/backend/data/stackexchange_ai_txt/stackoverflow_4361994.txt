Create named routes for OmniAuth in Rails 3

After having watched Ryan's excellent Railcast Simple OmniAuth , I've managed to implement authentication in my app. Everything is working fine, but in my view I have links that look like this: I was wondering if there is an elegant way to create a named route to replace that with: or: OmniAuth already handles those routes... In my routes.rb file I only have stuff for callbacks and signing out: match '/signin/:provider/callback' => 'sessions#create' match '/signout' => 'sessions#destroy', :as => :signout So I don't know where I could create those named routes. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.
