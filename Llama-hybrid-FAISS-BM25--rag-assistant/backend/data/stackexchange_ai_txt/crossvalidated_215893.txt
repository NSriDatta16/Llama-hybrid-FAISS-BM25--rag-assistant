Both Lasso and Elastic Net are efficient methods to perform variable or feature selection in high-dimensional data settings (much more variables than patients or samples; e.g., 20,000 genes and 500 tumor samples). It has been shown (by Hastie and others) that Elastic Net can outperform Lasso when the data is highly correlated. Lasso may just select one of the correlated variables and does not care which one is selected. This can be a problem when one wants to validate the selected variables in an independent dataset. The variable selected by Lasso may not be the best predictor among all correlated variables. Elastic Net solves this problem by averaging highly correlated variables.
