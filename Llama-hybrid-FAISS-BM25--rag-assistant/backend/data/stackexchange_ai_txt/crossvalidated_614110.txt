Limitations in Correlation Analysis

Suppose I have the following dataset that shows the faculty composition of different colleges and the total number of drop outs that happened in an academic year. Here is some R code for this problem: set.seed(123) n $drop_out_rate number_of_dropouts/df$number_of_students)*100 I could be interested in trying to answer the following question: Is it possible that when colleges tend to be more engineering based are more correlated with larger dropout rates in general? (e.g. lets say I don't have access to the number of drop outs per faculty per college) A very basic way to explore this question could be to calculate correlations between faculty compositions and drop out rates: library(ggplot2) plot_list $drop_out_rate, method = "pearson") spearman_cor drop_out_rate, method = "spearman") # Create the scatter plot with a line of best fit p At first glance, this approach might be suitable to study correlations between total drop out rates and the composition of different faculties (e.g. engineering) - however, I think there might be some problems with this approach. One of the first problems that comes to mind is that this approach is not taking into account the effect of other variables when calculating correlations. As a humorous example, perhaps Science Students and Engineering Students hate each other - and when a college has more than x% Science Students and y% Engineering Students, this results in fights and these fights result in drop outs. Thus, the patterns and trends that would be observed during this analysis between pairs of variables might not necessarily be only attributable to those pairs. As such, I think it would be a better idea to fit a Regression Model to this data and then be able to find out the "average effect of each increase in faculty percent on drop out rate (adjusted over the other variables". But as such, what are the limitations of performing and making conclusions from this type of correlation analysis? Thanks!
