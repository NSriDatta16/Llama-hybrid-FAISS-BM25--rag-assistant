Installing PIL on Cygwin

I've been struggling all morning to get PIL installed on Cygwin. The errors I get are not consistent with common errors I find using Google. Perhaps a linux guru can see an obvious problem in this output: $ python setup.py install running install running build running build_py running build_ext building '_imaging' extension gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DHAVE_LIBZ -I/usr/include/freetype2 -IlibImaging -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/python2.5 -c _imaging.c -o build/temp.cygwin-1.7.2-i686-2.5/_imaging.o In file included from /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/3.4.4/include/syslimits.h:7, from /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/3.4.4/include/limits.h:11, from /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:18, from _imaging.c:75: /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/3.4.4/include/limits.h:122:61: limits.h: No such file or directory In file included from _imaging.c:75: /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:32:19: stdio.h: No such file or directory /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:34:5: #error "Python.h requires that stdio.h define NULL." /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:37:20: string.h: No such file or directory /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:39:19: errno.h: No such file or directory /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:41:20: stdlib.h: No such file or directory /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:43:20: unistd.h: No such file or directory /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:55:20: assert.h: No such file or directory In file included from /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:57, from _imaging.c:75: /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:7:20: stdint.h: No such file or directory In file included from /usr/include/python2.5/Python.h:57, from _imaging.c:75: /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:89: error: parse error before "Py_uintptr_t" /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:89: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `Py_uintptr_t' /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:89: warning: data definition has no type or storage class /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:90: error: parse error before "Py_intptr_t" /usr/include/python2.5/pyport.h:90: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `Py_intptr_t' ... more lines like this
