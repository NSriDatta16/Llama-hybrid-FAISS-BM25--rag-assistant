I have used a bunch of things during my Rails career over the last few years. Currently working on a pretty large Rails app on JRuby with very solid test coverage and our stack looks like the following. Unit Testing: RSpec coverage of models, helpers, libraries and controllers. Controller coverage tends to be very high-level JSpec coverage for a project that is using some pretty cutting edge JS and HTML 5 wizardry Functional Testing: Cucumber using Capybara and Culerity (we just converted from WebRat in order to get coverage of JS-heavy front-ends from Cucumber) Selenium that is now "legacy" and slowly being migrated to cucumber/capybara
