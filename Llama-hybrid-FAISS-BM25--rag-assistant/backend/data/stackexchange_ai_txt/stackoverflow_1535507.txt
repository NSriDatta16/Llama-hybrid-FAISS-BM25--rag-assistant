What you have to watch out for with svn:externals is that you need to explicitly specify the revision if you want something other than trunk. Google "pinning svn:externals" for the details. If you are using a fairly modern version, 1.5 or newer IIRC, then relative externals are at least supported. Older versions, like the one that I am currently using, requires us to explicitly pin the revision using the -rNNNNN option on the svn:externals property for every damned folder . We ended up using a modification of a perl script named svncopy.pl from tigris.org to do all of our branching and tagging. It's not that bad but I wish that we had known how much work it was before we decided to use them so heavily.
