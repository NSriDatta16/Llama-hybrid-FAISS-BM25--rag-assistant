Probabilities are mathematical constructs that can be determined within probability models. They don't exist in the real world outside such models. So the probabilities you are interested in could be determined if you had a detailed enough model for voting over time. Note that reality itself will not give you such a model, rather a model has to be set up and then data needs to be fed into it in order to estimate its parameters or (if you run a Bayesian analysis) update them taking into account the available information. Even if you have such a model and run the calculations, the model may be criticised for observed discrepancies compared to reality, or for implausible implicit assumptions. If you want to make the model even remotely realistic, you need to put in a lot of effort. If you can do it, what Peter Flom writes still holds, namely that you need to specify an event that allows for some random variation; normally the event that a result exactly repeats itself will have probability zero or extremely low. You may want to read M. Heidemanns, A. Gelman, G. E. Morris (2020) An Updated Dynamic Bayesian Forecasting Model for the US Presidential Election to get an idea of what it takes.
