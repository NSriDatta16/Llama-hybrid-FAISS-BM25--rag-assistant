Why would .append randomly fail in jquery?

I'm using jquery to add elements to a blank list. on the page I have: and I go through a loop like this in the script that's called from a dynamically created event handler. (It's "onDrop" of a list item having been sorted with a drag operation) var myListItemHTML; for (var i = 0 ; i This is item number'+i+' '; } $('#myList').append(myListItemHTML); and if I check after... if ($('#myList li').length == 0 ) { alert('Going to crash now since I'm expecting list items') } roughly 95% of the time the list is populated, but about 5% of the time I hit my alert that's going to cause an exception later. Has anyone run into this? Is there a callback or way to know when/if the append really happens?
