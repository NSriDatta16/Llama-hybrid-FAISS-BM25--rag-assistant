Another problem, in addition to those @Michael gave, is that when there is strong near-colinearity, small changes in the input data can lead to large changes in the output. I made up some data (taking wild guesses at the average lengths of legs and torso (in inches) and weight (in pounds) for adult humans). set.seed(1230101) lengthleg the first time through, I got coefficients of -5.93, 0.43 and 2.73. Rerunning everything except set.seed gave me -9.91, 1.12 and 2.18.
