Sending all the choices down to the UI would not be my first choice. One way would be to store the verbiage in a table. The Coverage table would have a language column foreign key to pick out which language you were dealing with. The value would be loaded into the object and you'd be done. The downside is that a locale change would require a round trip to the server, database, and back. Spring accomplishes this with locale-dependent views. Maybe you can try that as well.
