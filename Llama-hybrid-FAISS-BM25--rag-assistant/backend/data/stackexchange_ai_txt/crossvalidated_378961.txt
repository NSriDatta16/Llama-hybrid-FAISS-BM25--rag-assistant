Effect of variable type in prediction

Let's say I have a set of independent variables: x1 , x2 , x3 , etc. These are used to predict a dependent variable y using some algorithm (in particular Random Forest). How does the accuracy of the model depend on the type of those variables, say categorical variable or integer or character?
