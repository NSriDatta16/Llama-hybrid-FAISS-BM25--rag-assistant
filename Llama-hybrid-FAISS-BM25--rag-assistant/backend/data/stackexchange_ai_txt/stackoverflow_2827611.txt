GridView onTouch

I am trying to set up a GridView of buttons that responds to onTouch. For example, if I swipe my finger across the screen horizontally, vertically or diagonally then I want the buttons which were touched to be selected. I tried setting OnTouchListener's for the buttons, but this didn't work, only the first button in the drag event received the onTouch events. Next I tried creating an OnTouchListener for the GridView and then using the X,Y coords to determine which buttons where touched. This doesn't seem to work either since the MOTION_DOWN events are only passed to the GridView's onTouch() if I start the drag on the very edge of the GridView. In fact if I drag my finger horizontally across the grid, the onTouch events aren't fired at all unless I start the drag at the edge of the GridView. Does anyone know of a better way to do this? Thanks in advance. gridview.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() { @Override public boolean onTouch(@SuppressWarnings("unused") View view, MotionEvent event) { float X = event.getX(); float Y = event.getY(); switch (event.getAction()) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: System.out.println("Down: " + X + "," + Y); break; case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: System.out.println("Move: " + X + "," + Y); break; case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: System.out.println("Up: " + X + "," + Y); break; } return true; } }
