Missing data (multiple imputation)

Can I multiply impute missing data in some of the variables which were for some reason not measured at one time? For instance, for production I have time series data for 1961-2011: however, some of the predictor variables (rainfall, temperature, humidity and few more) which I suspect could have impact on rice production of Nepal were measured only after 1975. So the data for 1961-1974 are missing! Could multiple imputation help in this case, or is there any other option?
