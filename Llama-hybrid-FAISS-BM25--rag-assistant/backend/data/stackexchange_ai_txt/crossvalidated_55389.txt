Regression with percentage points

Suppose I want to find out how growth in average income affects the growth in income of the poor. For this I have 60 countries and for each country the income of the poor and average income for 6 years. I am unsure on how to perform a regression of this. I have been calculating the average annual growth in percentage for average income and income for the poor. From what I understand this gives me percentage points change instead of percentage change, thus it would be a simple linear regression. Yet I have seen some tutorials that log the percentage points, creating a log-log regression. Which of these two methods are correct? EDIT: Example values: Country A: Average income for the poor for 4 years: 1990:150, 1991: 260, 1992:300, 1993: 400 Average income for 4 years: 1990:340, 1991:600, 1992:710, 1993:1000 Compound annual growth poor: 38.67% Compound annual growth all: 43.28% Say I do this for 60 countries, so i will get for average annual growth of income of the poor (in percent): 21.10 , 16.23 , 12.34 , 23.25 , 11.12 , 13.55 etc and for average annual growth if income of all: 43.13 , 35.31 , 56.31 etc and I do a regression on them and get say y = 2.433 + 0.6 x . So if income of all increases one unit, the income of the poor increases 0.6 units. Is it correct to say than that a 1 percent change increase in average income of all will result in 0.6 percent change average income of the poor? Or is it percentage points change?
