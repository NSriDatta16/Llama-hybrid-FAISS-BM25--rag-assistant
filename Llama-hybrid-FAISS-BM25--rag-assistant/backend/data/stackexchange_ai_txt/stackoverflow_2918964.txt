What the method doSomethingAndTakeALongTime() is doing? is it for DB operation or just executing some business logic? If its not doing any DB operation, and you got your status fine then you can persist the object before calling that method. And if its doing some DB operation, then you need to wait for it. So, even if you put in thread you need to wait for that thread to complete (using thread.join() we can do that) the thing is, before you persist you must have completed all operation based on you ORM object right? so try to optimized the logic for the method to get it executed before you persist. thanks.
