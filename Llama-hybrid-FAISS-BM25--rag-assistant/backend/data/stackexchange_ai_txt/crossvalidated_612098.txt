Parameterizing a Gaussian distribution

I am reading this blog post where the author talks about diffusion models. Let's keep diffusion out of the conversation for now. The author showcased that we can parameterize a Gaussian distribution by a desired standard deviation sigma as shown below: I didn't get how the sigma value is inserted here. Can someone please elaborate this in detail?
