Supervised keyword extraction: results

I've considered the keyword extraction method as a classification problem (1 = author generated keyword, 0 = no keyword) and I've tried to automatically extract keywords from text document. I've done this using different kind of models. These are the results (the columns represent the human-generated keywords, and the row are the automatic extraction): Baselinmethod: 1 0 1 62 63 0 52 Naive Bayes: 1 0 1 29 9 0 85 SVM: 1 0 1 29 9 0 85 Decision tree: 1 0 1 29 18 0 85 Average number of keywords extracted Precision Recall Baseline method 5 49,6 54,4 Naive Bayes 1,52 76,3 25,4 SVM 1,52 76,3 25,4 Decision tree 1,88 61,7 25,4 Now I have to choose the 'best' model. Which model is the model according to you, and why? I would prefer the baseline method, because it can on average match between one of the two keywords chosen by the author in this collection, so the recall is the largest in comparison with the other models. Is this a good idea?
