JDBC check if a connection can warantee it will commit without errors

Is there a way of checking if a connection will commit without throwing an exception? I know deferrable foreign key constraints are only enforced at transaction commit. Does the JDBC (java 6) API provide any method to ask the database whether all operations since the connection began (or last commit) would be successfull? Regards, Pablo.
