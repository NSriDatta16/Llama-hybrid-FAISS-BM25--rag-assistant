In general cross validation is always needed when you need to determine the optimal parameters of the model, for logistic regression this would be the $C$ parameter. As a first start you can look into k-fold validation, if you are using R look at ( http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/training.html ) or python ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation )
