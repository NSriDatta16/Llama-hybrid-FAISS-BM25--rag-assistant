in TensorFlow 2.0, what is the different between LSTM and LSTMCell objects?

I am trying to implement an RNN in TensorFlow 2.0 (beta1). Looking at the layer functions (inherited from Keras) I found: tf.keras.layers.LSTM and tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell What is the different between the two? If you take a look at their arguments, they seem the same.
