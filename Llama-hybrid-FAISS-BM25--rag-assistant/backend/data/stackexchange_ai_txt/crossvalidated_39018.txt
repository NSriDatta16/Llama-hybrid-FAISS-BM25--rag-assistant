Which are the most effective clustering ensembles?

In supervised learning, there are some ensemble methods that overcome others significantly (adaboost or random forests to mention some). Few years later, also ensembles in unsupervised learning were proposed. Are there any techniques that outperform the others? What are your experiences with them w.r.t. their accuracy, easy manipulation and time complexity?
