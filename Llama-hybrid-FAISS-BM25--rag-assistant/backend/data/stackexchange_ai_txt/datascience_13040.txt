How to move forward on Regression problem

I'm an undergrad interested in machine learning, and I'm playing around with some data in order to get a better understanding of the field. DATA I'm working with the following data: To give you an idea of what you're looking at (sorry for the unlabeled axes) -- each data point corresponds to a basketball player's points per game (y-values) over a one-week period (x-values). END GOAL I want to predict progress throughout the year, so in order to test/train, I start with the first two points, fit a regression model, and then predict the third point. I then add the actual value of the third point to the set, re-train, and predict the fourth point, etc. ISSUES As you can see, the data is all over the place, and the predictions are just as messy (sometimes getting up to ~200 points per game, which is totally impossible). I've tested different degrees of linear regression (quadratic, cubic, etc.) and degree=1 is always the best predictor because of how wonky the data is. IDEAS I have thought of the following ways to get more accurate predictions: Smoothing the data, maybe using a moving average or some variant Set an upper limit for predictions Non-linear regression But outside of smoothing the data, I'm not sure if the rest are even possible in a regression model (upper limit) or applicable to this situation (non-linear). QUESTION Are any of the ideas I had above worth pursuing? If not, is there anything I should look into that might help me solve this problem? Thanks!
