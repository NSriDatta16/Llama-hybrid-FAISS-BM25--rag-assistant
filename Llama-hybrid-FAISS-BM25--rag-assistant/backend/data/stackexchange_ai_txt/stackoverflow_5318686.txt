Ideal If statement structure for two boolean values

I wasn't quite sure what to search under - but I was looking for an elegant way if possible to structure an if statement that uses two Boolean values that could easily output all four possibilities. Variables: bool a = true; bool b = true; I wasn't sure if there was a best practice in terms of checking both for negativity - then continuing on etc. Very hastily written example: if(!a && !b) { //Output (-,-) } else { if(a || b) { if(a) { //Output (+,-) } else { //Output (-,+) } } else { //Output (+,+) } } Sorry for all the gullwings ( { } ) I am a bit of a formatting junkie. Anyways - thanks for any suggestions!
