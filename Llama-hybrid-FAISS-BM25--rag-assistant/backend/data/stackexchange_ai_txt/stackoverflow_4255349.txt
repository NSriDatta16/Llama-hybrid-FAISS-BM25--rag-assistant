In the helper option is by default 'original' which will do exactly what you want, so just leave the option off, or set it to 'original' and you'll grab the original...as opposed to 'clone' which makes a copy. It should look like this: $(".element").draggable(function() { helper: 'original' //or leave this line off }); You can test it in the default demo here .
