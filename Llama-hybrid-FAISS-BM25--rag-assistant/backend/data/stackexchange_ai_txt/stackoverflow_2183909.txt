I've finally found the answer. Extensions are simply packed modules. In other words, you extend the features and functionality of Magento by writing a module. Then you have a choice to leave it as it is or pack it up ( System > Magento Connect > Package Extensions ). An extension (a packed module) is then published on Magento Connect .
