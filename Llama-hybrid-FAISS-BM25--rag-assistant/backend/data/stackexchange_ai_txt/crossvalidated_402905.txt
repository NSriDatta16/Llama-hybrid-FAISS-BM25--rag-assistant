How can I compute expected return time of a state in a Markov Chain?

I was watching a YouTube video regarding the calculation of expected return time of a Markov Chain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_Ll0-Ytu7U&vl=en I haven't understood the calculation of $m_{12}$ . How could he write $m_{12} = 1+ p_{11}m_{12}$ ? Why is $m_{12}$ on the both side of the equation?
