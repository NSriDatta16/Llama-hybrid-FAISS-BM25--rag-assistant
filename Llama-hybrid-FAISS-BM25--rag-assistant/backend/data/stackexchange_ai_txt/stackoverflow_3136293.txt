Read SPSS file into R

I am trying to learn R and want to bring in an SPSS file, which I can open in SPSS. I have tried using read.spss from foreign and spss.get from Hmisc . Both error messages are the same. Here is my code: ## install.packages("Hmisc") library(foreign) ## change the working directory getwd() setwd('C:/Documents and Settings/BTIBERT/Desktop/') ## load in the file ## ?read.spss asq And the resulting error: Error in read.spss("ASQ2010.sav", to.data.frame = T) : error reading system-file header In addition: Warning message: In read.spss("ASQ2010.sav", to.data.frame = T) : ASQ2010.sav: position 0: character `\000' ( Also, I tried saving out the SPSS file as a SPSS 7 .sav file (was previously using SPSS 18). Warning messages: 1: In read.spss("ASQ2010_test.sav", to.data.frame = T) : ASQ2010_test.sav: Unrecognized record type 7, subtype 14 encountered in system file 2: In read.spss("ASQ2010_test.sav", to.data.frame = T) : ASQ2010_test.sav: Unrecognized record type 7, subtype 18 encountered in system file
