How do I transform a file to .txt file using pandas?

I have to submit a machine learning project, and it has to be node in a .txt file. I know that if I am using pandas, and I want to transform a file from another format to .csv format I can use .to_csv(). Is there something similar for transforming the file into .txt() file using pandas?
