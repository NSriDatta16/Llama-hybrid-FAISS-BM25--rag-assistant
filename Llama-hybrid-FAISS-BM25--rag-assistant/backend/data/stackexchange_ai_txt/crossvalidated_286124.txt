KPSS test in Python with statsmodels

I would like to check in Python if a time series is stationary. I have the following variables: a=np.array([1.003012239,0.995837317,0.991792465,0.993738715,1.000136408,1.004957838,0.995088793,1.000531886,1.00143537,1.003889035,1.004658898,1.003711617,0.994557676,0.991662887,0.992302628,0.992792462,0.994133425,0.997536602,0.995960497,0.992017887,0.99488757,0.990362752,0.996352057,0.994968345,0.993520863,0.994104962,1.000447895,1.005445277,1.011772957,1.013039826,1.019727253,1.016825566,1.008725197,1.005445369,1.003563463,1.005377785,1.01072587,1.010346654,1.008413377,1.005546011,1.001052823,0.998857681,0.994767545,0.990747206,0.988371175,0.982914264,0.986643638,0.982919942,0.984692671,0.980432691,0.986828709,0.984054208,0.988766968,0.987441925,0.991099369,0.989995711,0.990568126,0.984789505,0.985196248,0.984891746,0.984746046,0.984661782,0.978884805,0.979713677,0.979167321,0.974811897,0.977393481,0.982376619,0.97924222,0.974481279,0.977585868,0.973161074,0.966899486,0.970482829,0.970259303,0.97105061,0.972169657,0.973376288,0.974506912,0.978655566,0.971687782,0.97439732,0.977876729,0.981506689,0.97899537,0.978846162,0.975741014,0.979691005,0.976921972,0.9839724,0.986569951,0.978874855,0.980391674,0.981838628,0.980304904,0.98427629,0.98774266,0.986387649,0.992338709,0.987040481,0.989676188,0.997811347,1.003985588,1.003828511,1.00396324,1.007250616,1.008406173,1.005581674,1.008912871,1.009220581,1.010317329,1.0099428,1.013983824,1.012932302,1.01400313,1.011387613,1.003332088,1.00726453,1.013002544,1.012628872,1.009568047,1.004751804,1.008003951,1.012936508,1.006705544,1.00645366,0.999519766,1.001680744,0.998888514,1.001962737,1.000795944,0.995407906,0.993319404,0.996602724,0.9995274,1.003011738,1.000375468,0.997955496,0.994060991,0.985310911,0.987984741,0.98652249,0.993117265,0.99242731,0.989948947,0.993996742,0.996215462,0.99363282,1.00173927,0.996364265,0.990249931,0.987877018,0.986972521,0.9903954,0.993379668,0.992358754,0.995775269,0.989837547,0.987029773,0.99539723,0.989888201,0.985175306,0.986251479,0.983693111,0.982366752,0.980083272,0.983644383,0.982121759,0.989413654,0.983920457,0.982002322,0.988705902,0.989947353,0.989635859,0.983320379,0.985445367,0.981808402,0.983196725,0.986474996,0.988462091,0.983237143,0.978854648,0.985174226,0.992534321,0.992219069,0.985587029,0.985277684,0.988620159,0.996753957,1.001169859,1.003130493,1.002978347,1.008847119,1.014419572,1.016437865,1.012990502,1.00795451,1.01642283,1.020446142,1.026619133,1.033643269,1.027428771,1.02605641,1.019056673,1.023166283,1.025069343,1.026171101,1.021452628,1.016972442,1.015802822,1.018750933,1.021877223,1.018550378,1.012927289,1.003718314,1.000746611,1.003299949,1.004840452,1.001959563,1.002812043,0.998036306,0.999988102,0.998475172,1.001151768,1.001170702,1.004929264,1.001012253,1.001263538]) b=np.random.choice(range(-1000,1000),10000) c=np.array(range(1,1000)) If I do the kpss test of statsmodels what I get is: print '======a======' print kpss(a) print '======b======' print kpss(b) print '======c======' print kpss(c) And the result is: > ======a====== > > Warning (from warnings module): File > "...", line 82 > warn("p-value is greater than the indicated p-value ", InterpolationWarning) InterpolationWarning: p-value is greater than > the indicated p-value (0.24205088752544565, 0.1, 15, {'5%': > 0.463, '1%': 0.739, '2.5%': 0.574, '10%': 0.347}) > ======b====== >(0.085996053575288708, 0.1, 38, {'5%': 0.463, '1%': 0.739, '2.5%': 0.574, '10%': 0.347}) > > ======c====== > > Warning (from warnings module): File > "...", line 80 > warn("p-value is smaller than the indicated p-value", InterpolationWarning) InterpolationWarning: p-value is smaller than > the indicated p-value (4.4456302303149693, 0.01, 22, {'5%': 0.463, > '1%': 0.739, '2.5%': 0.574, '10%': 0.347}) [ 0.99667882 1.32908899 > -0.35603091 -0.36207399 -0.06543494] How can I extract the information if it is stationary or not?
