Worrying about the browser history and back button is going to give you headaches and genital warts. There are facilities built in to handle this problem. Your logout link/button should point to a page containing this code, along with whatever else you want. [vb.net] Imports System.Web.Security Private Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _ Handles MyBase.Load Session.Abandon() FormsAuthentication.SignOut() End Sub [c#] using System.Web.Security; private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { // Put user code to initialize the page here Session.Abandon(); FormsAuthentication.SignOut(); } Code comes from this page and is valid but the page is hard on the eyes. A good Question/Answer regarding backbutton behavior can be found here . Update: pursuant to the conversation I am having with Matthew, disabling caching on individual pages that are sensitive or volitile can be done with code such as follows: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-1)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); I am curious to know if it works for you as it does for me.
