The issue here is called Ghosting. An out of the box SharePoint site stores many files (including masterpages and pagelayouts) in the 12 hive of the SharePoint website. When a request is made for these files, SharePoint is smart enough to do a disk read operation. It is possible to "Un-Ghost" these pages. Essentially, createing a modification to the page that is stored in the SharePoint conent database instead of the file system. A request for an Un-Ghosted page will result in a database round trip (selecting from the database, returning the bytes of the file etc). This necessarily results in a non-trivial amount of extra work. When you are talking about 100's or 1000's of users hitting the site, this database round trip becomes a performance issue. So a SharePoint custom site definition for a heavily used website will want to store as many files on the web server file system as possible (and cache the .... out of everything else). A site definition is not necessarily stored on the file system, but the process (aside from being way more complex) gives far more control of the storage location of any customised items. An example of two blogs talking about the issue. http://itfootprint.wordpress.com/2007/04/18/sharepoint-site-template-vs-site-definition/ http://my.advisor.com/doc/17614
