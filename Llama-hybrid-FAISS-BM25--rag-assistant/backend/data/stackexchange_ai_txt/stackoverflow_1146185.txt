Most 3D libraries generalize triangles. If you want a polygon with more than 3 sides, you subdivide it into triangles and draw those triangles. If you're interested in just the platonic solids, then you're going to have a pretty easy time, because you can easily get a triangluation of each face by first averaging the vertices of each face, and then using that center and two adjacent vertices of the face to give you a triangularization.
