What neural nets can emulate

I know that neural nets can emulate linear regression or logistic regression depending on the activation function used in conjuntion with a single output neuron. Now I read to my surprise that an autoencoder in conjunction with linear activations and mean squared error (MSE) as the cost function ends up performing Principal Component Analysis. Is there a more or less exhaustive list of popular models that can be captured by neural nets?
