Pay attention that if any View added to the window capture the event and doesn't forward it, the window object will never receive it. UIScrollView typically does that. In that case, you also need to subclass the blocking view to forward the event like this for example : in a UIScrollView subclass : -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (!self.dragging) { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; } [super touchesEnded: touches withEvent: event]; }
