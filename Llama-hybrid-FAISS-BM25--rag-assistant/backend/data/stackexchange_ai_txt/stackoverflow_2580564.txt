Pay attention to the actual error message. Look at the line: my $new = $_ 'backup'. @test .'.rar'; If you want to interpolate the contents of $_ and the array @test into a string like that, you need to use: my $new = "${_}backup@test.rar"; but I have a hard time making sense of that. Now, strftime returns a scalar. Why not use: my $ts = POSIX::strftime("%m-%d-%Y--%H-%M-%S", localtime); my $new = sprintf '%s%s%s.rar', $_, backup => $ts; Incidentally, you might end up making your life much simpler if you put the time stamp first and formatted it as YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS so that there is no confusion about to which date 04-05-2010 refers.
