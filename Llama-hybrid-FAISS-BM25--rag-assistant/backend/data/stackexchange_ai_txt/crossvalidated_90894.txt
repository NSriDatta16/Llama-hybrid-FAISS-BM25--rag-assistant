The reason you can use a $z$-test with proportion data is because the standard deviation of a proportion is a function of the proportion itself. Thus, once you have estimated the proportion in your sample, you don't have an extra source of uncertainty that you have to take into account. As a result, you can use the normal distribution instead of the $t$ distribution as your sampling distribution. To learn more about this, see my answer here: The $z$-test vs the $\chi^2$-test for comparing the odds of catching a cold in 2 groups . If you have more than 2 groups, you can use logistic regression, as you note. You do have to know the $n_j$s in each group however. If you just had a set of observed proportions, but didn't know how many trials had been observed to generate those proportions, you cannot run a proper test of whether the proportions differed.
