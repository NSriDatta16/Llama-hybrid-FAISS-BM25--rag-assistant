How can we find out the relationship between 2 or more dependent and independent categorical variables by not using chi square test?

I'm trying to build a logistic regression model(in python) in some datasets which are having mostly categorical data, to check the relation between each and every independent variable with that of dependent variable i'm plotting the graphs for each of them, which is time consuming. Is there any other easier way to check the relation between them other than chi-square test. Thanks,
