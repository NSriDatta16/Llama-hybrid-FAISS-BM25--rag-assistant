Possible to get Sharepoint 2010 working with IE6?

I work for a fairly large government organization where about 60% of the users are still on IE6. Microsoft is very clear that IE6 is not compatible with Sharepoint 2010, but as a quick fix until we can upgrade people to IE8, I'd like to see if there is a way to make some changes to get it working with IE6. Does anyone know if this has been done by anyone? Any suggestions on where to look/start?
