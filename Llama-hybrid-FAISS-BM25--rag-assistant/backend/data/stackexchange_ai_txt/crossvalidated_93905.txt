Can averaging all the variables be seen as a crude form of PCA?

This question just occurred to me out of the blue. PCA is a way to reduce dimensions. Another way that is often (perhaps too often) used is to take mean values of two or more variables. This is done a great deal to create "scales" or "ratings" that get published in the popular press about various political issues. Dimensions are naively "averaged" and this cumulative "average" is portrayed as a magical one-number-sums-all figure. Is this, nevertheless, a very crude relative of PCA? If so, what assumptions does it have? I can think of the following: Sphericity is perfect or near-perfect. All variables are perfectly orthogonal from all other variables. Variables are all perfectly scaled against each other. What else would there be?
