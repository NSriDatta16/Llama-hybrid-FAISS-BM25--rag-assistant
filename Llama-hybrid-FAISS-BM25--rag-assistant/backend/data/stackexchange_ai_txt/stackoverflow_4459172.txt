I see two problems. 1st: Make sure your compiler is using a far call instead of a near call otherwise you will jump to the wrong segment and execute unknown code and possably generating an invalid opcode... which is what seems to be happening. Try "call far [XMSControl]" in your code if your compiler defaults to near calls. 2nd: NTVDM.EXE runs code in virtual 86 mode and not true real mode. While it is true that windows XP supports 16 bit apps, it has LIMITED support. You may run into other problems with your database down the line because of that. For example you wont be able to access USB, so you can't print on a USB printer and will need to use an old parallel port style printer. Good luck findign one of those used at a garage sale...
