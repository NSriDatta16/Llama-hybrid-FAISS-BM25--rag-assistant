I think it's a pretty reasonable practice to check in every night. Sometimes I check in 3 or 4 times a day, sometimes 20 (every time my code is working, actually). If your code is always checked in, you should easily be able to just sync to a different branch without backing anything up. If you can't check in your changes by the end of the day, a very reasonable answer is to discard them. You are most likely in some hole that you will have trouble digging yourself out of, and the next day you will replicate the work in an hour and do it MUCH BETTER than you did the first time. Also, if you go that long with broken code, how do you test? Finally, if your code REALLY can't be checked into the build every day (it actually does happen in some situations, regardless of what I said in the previous paragraph), branch. No more backups.
