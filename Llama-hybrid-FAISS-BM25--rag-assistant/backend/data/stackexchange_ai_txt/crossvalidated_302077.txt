What would happen if we perform Time Series Decomposition on a data that only has trend and irregular components?

I am performing Decomposition of a Timeseries data. It appears that the data does not have a seasonal component and possess only trend and irregular components. However on still performing the decomposition analysis, seasonal component throws me values between 0.88 and 1.11 (which is close to 1). Please note I am performing a Multiplicative Decomposition analysis. Can some only tell me if this range of seasonality values indicates if a seasonality is present in the data?
