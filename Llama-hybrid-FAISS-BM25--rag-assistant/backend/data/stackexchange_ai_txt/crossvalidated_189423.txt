Confidence Interval for Sampling of Non-Normal Distribution

As everybody, when sampling a distribution, I was told that the population average can be estimated to be within the range of: $$\mu \in \bar{x} \pm Z_{\text{conf}}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$ where $Z_{\text{conf}}=1.96$ for a confidence of 95%. What I do not remember is whether this assumes the population data is Normally distributed, or just the sampling errors. Below is a simulation (in R) of sampling of an Exponential distribution (and I have tried others), and this formula seems to work very well for non-Normal distribution. But I just want to be sure. correct
