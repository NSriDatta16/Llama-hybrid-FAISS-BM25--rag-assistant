How to organize Enterprise scale Composite Applications (CAG)

All QuickStarts and RI examples in the CAG documentation are good but I lack the more Enterprise scale examples. Let's say we have 40+ modules, each containing a Proxy,Facade,PresentationModel,Model and Views. Each module also makes calls to a Module-specific WCF service which is to be hosted in IIS or in a stand-alone console host. Our approach have been to include the UI-module, service-module and related tests into one solution so they can be developed and tested separately from other modules. My problem is how the hosting of the services should be done when the services are in separate modules and how to actually run the separate module together with the rest of the application-modules when I press F5. Is there a best practise for this? I guess it has been done before?
