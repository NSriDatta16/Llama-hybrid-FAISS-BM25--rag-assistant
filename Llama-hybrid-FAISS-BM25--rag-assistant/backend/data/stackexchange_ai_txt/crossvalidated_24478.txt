Although formally you may do K-means clustering on nominal data after converting nominal variables into dummy variables, this is regarded inadequate approach. To use K-means meaningfully, you must have all variables at scale (interval or ratio) level. One of the ways to quantify a set of nominal variables is to apply multiple correspondence analysis. It can be seen as a dimension-reduction technique, like PCA, only for nominal data. You could use the resultant quantifications (the coordinates) as the input to K-means, if you like.
