Encapsulating functions in a second .java file?

I've been messing with Android for a couple of weeks, i found many tutorials to follow, but i didnt find anywhere some "Style rules" to make the code looks better. I would like to know if its possible (im sure that it is, but dont know how to make it xD) to use more .java files to organize the functions. I mean, right now, i have myApp.java where i coded all my application, but is starting to grow so much, so i would like to separate some functions into another .java file. As i told before, im almost sure that this is possible, but i dont know how to link that second file so, can anybody help me? Thank you in advance :)
