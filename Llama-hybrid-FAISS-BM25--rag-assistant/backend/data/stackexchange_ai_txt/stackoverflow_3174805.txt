haml documentation - where is it?

I've just started with Rails (having previously worked in Django). The hardest part is working out how to use haml. I have found the official haml documentation . However, there seems to be no coverage here of syntax - if/else clauses, for loops, etc. Other than Googling for examples, is there any official documentation of syntax in haml? Or am I missing something obvious?
