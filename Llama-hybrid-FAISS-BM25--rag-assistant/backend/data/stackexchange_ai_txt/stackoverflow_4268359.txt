OK... Some kind of break through although not a good one... If we NSLog the attributed string then we can see in there it has NSFont and NSParagraphStyle in. Although these are NOT NSFont and NSParagraphStyle in the code these are CTFontRef and CT Dictionaries of paragraph styles... These are not NS objects although in NSLog they output as these and therefore guess that is why we can not perform the "encodeWithCoder" selector on the object. IF in the code we just do "NSFont;" the compiler says "NSFont undeclared" so what can we do as we only have the CT functions? As my colleague said in the comments above if we set the ".text" property to just "NSAttrinutedString *string = [NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"test"] it saves fine and if we remove all the styling from the one we WANT to save it also works! THERE MUST BE A WAY OF STORING NSATTRIBUTED STRING WITH STYLING INTO CORE DATA... NO? Any ideas greatly appreciated. -JM
