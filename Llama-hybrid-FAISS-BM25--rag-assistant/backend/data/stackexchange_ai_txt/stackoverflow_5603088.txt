I think you're choosing the wrong e-commerce system if want to use your existing database in place of the one in Magento. Magento doesn't work like this. You can't have the Magento interface and not the guts of it. They are inextricably bound (some would say, tightly coupled). I would hire a Magento programmer and have him or her create a module for you to import your products into the Magento catalog. This module should be able to handle updates to your existing database. This can be done easily as the Magento catalog model uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model pattern. Then you can continue using your database.
