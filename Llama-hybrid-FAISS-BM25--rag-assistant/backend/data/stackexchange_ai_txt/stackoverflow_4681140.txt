Building a link to download ebooks directly from a website to Apple's iBooks Application

PragmaticProgrammers states the following on their website: Jan 11, 2011 Note: Apple has made it possible to download ebooks directly in to iBooks in the latest release of iOS. This week we updated our online store to support thisâ€”visit either the regular or cut-down mobile versions of our site on an iPhone or iPad. When you click a download link for an epub, your device will pop up an Apple dialog offering to load it into iBooks (or any other appropriate application). Your iPhone or iPad will need to be up-to-date for this to work. I searched on Apple's developer website and couldn't find any hint on how to build this. Does anyone here now how this works? Thanks for your help!
