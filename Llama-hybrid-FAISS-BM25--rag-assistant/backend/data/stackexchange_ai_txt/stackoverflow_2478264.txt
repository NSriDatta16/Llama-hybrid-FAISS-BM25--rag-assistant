The only way I could see this going wrong is if the boolean fragment doesn't have a name that makes sense and a name is picked anyhow. //No clue what the parts might mean. if(price>0 && (customer.IsAlive || IsDay(Thursday))) => first_condition = price>0 second_condition =customer.IsAlive || IsDay(Thursday) //I'm still not enlightened. if(first_condition && second_condition) I point this out because it is commonplace to make rules like "comment all your code", "use named booleans for all if-criteria with more than 3 parts" only to get comments that are semantically empty of the following sort i++; //increment i by adding 1 to i's previous value
