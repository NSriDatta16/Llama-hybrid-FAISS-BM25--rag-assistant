if you have interface MyInterface { abstract class MyAbstractClass { // ... } } and then you try class ConcreteClass extends MyAbstractClass { } You will get the error described. The fix is to either move MyAbstractClass to a top-level class (put it in it's own file - not strictly necessary for non-public classes, but keeps the code organized.) Alternatively, add the static modifier to the MyAbstractClass declaration.
