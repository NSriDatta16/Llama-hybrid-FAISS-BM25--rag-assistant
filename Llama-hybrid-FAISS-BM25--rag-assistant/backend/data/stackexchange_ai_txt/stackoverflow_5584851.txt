Simply multi touch programming for Android

I've scoured the internets trying to find an answer for this, but all the tutorials I've read seem to significantly over complicate my little problem. Basically, I have a ship on the left side of the screen that moves up and down if you drag your finger up and down on the left side of the screen, and fires a missile if you touch anywhere on the right side of the screen. public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { if (event.getX() event.getY()) shipY = shipY - 10; } if (event.getX() >= getWidth()/2) { if(!missile) { missile = true; missileY = shipY; missileX = shipX; } } return true; } Right now I can only fire the missile if I stop moving the ship. Thank you much!
