Machine learning when there are two "answers"

I have a problem that I am trying to use machine learning on. At a very high level, I am looking to do a transformation where in the training data I have x and it can map to either 1 or 10 . I also have y and it can map to either 2 or 20 . When I use LSTMs or RNNs on the data is seems to be giving me the average of 1 and 10 or 2 and 20. But what I want is for the network to choose one of the values and not average them. Is this not a good problem for machine learning or should I use a different model like random forest?
