PHP is basically "nothing shared". So, when you build your link, you control the state of the $_REQUEST variable using the query parameters (GET or POST) and the hidden parameters (cookies). The session ($_SESSION) is a convenient cookie/file storage to migrate common data between pages, but it is typically best to keep session lean and free of non-critical state details.
