Jquery carousel a la Google Chrome Web Store

I really like the carousel on the Google Chrome Web Store. It is beautiful, neat and very effective. Here is an example: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cnneehghmdakbiinndechnolpjocoecc I would really like to replicate it with JQuery on my website. What [stable and reliable] plugin can I use to implement that exactly as it is or, at least, something very very similar? I already know JCarousel but I would like something neater and nicer. Thanks, Dan
