I think, it should, yes. Also - no console applications and no "color palette mixers", but unit tests first. Only if the students behave well and write test cases with extremely high coverage, they MAY be allowed to have a quick look at how to read characters from keyboard. In my opinion, most bad coding practices (code smells, antipatterns) come from a total ignorance towards the theory and best practices. So - teach them F# first, forbid the use of console i / o and GUIs and only use unit tests. Second, teach them imperative / functional mixed style in an OOP context with full use and explanation of design patterns. Then - and ONLY then they can try to put clickybuttons somewhere, maybe as a reward. But theory and good coding practices first. Otherwise we create the next generation of "RAD" - victims that can't even use indentation correctly and mistaken ctrl+c / ctrl+v for software development.
