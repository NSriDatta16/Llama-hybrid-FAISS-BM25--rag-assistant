couldnt find any solution that would pass parameters to the smartwindow function, but in any case i managed a workaround by setting CSS styles for the html elements i was rendering inside the smart windows. how the dimensions for a smart window are calculated without specifying dimensions for elements within the window is still unclear to me (as it did not reflect standard styling) so in any case if anyone has a more elegant solution additions are still welcome.
