I'm curious as to why you've limited yourself to only five comparable sales. If you're trying to estimate the price of a single house, then finding the five comparable sales and just averaging them makes a lot of sense. This is the same as a K-Nearest Neighbors approach, which is the basic idea of a ton of machine learning algorithms. But if you're trying to do regression, you're trying to estimate the cost as a (linear) function of your covariates, or inputs. If you'd used all available data, you can make a much more robust estimate of what the parameters in your model will be, and your estimates will presumably be much better across the spectrum, not just for the single house you care about.
