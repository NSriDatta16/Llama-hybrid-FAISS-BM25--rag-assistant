I am not sure to fully answer your question but think that the following can help. What you can try is to a design multilevel model including a partial pooling of the $\lambda_i$ by considering for example: $$ \begin{align} c_i &\sim P(\lambda_i) \\ Î»_i &\sim Gamma(a,b) \\ a &\sim \text{Find a good prior here} \\ b &\sim findTheGoodPriorHere \end{align}$$ Or another possibility: $$\begin{align} c_i &\sim P(\lambda_i). \\ log(\lambda_i) &=\alpha + \theta_i \\ \mbox{with } \theta_i &\sim N(0,\sigma^2) \\ \alpha &\sim u_{R} \\ \sigma &\sim gamma(\epsilon,\epsilon) \end{align}$$ or any other suitable pooling, so that the margin posterior for the $\lambda_i$: $$ p(\lambda_i|(c_j)_{j=1:N}) \propto \int_{R}[ p(c_i|\lambda_i) p(\lambda_i|\beta) d\beta ] \cdot \prod_{j\ne i} [\int_{R^+} \int_{R} p(c_j|\lambda_j) p(\lambda_j|\beta) d\beta d\lambda_j] $$ (calling for generality $\beta$ the hyperparameter of $p(\lambda_j|\beta)$) are no longer independant each other (because the hyperparameter $\beta$ is common to all the $\lambda_i$) and does no more result in independent inferences/comparisons (while this needs a dedicated discussion e.g. Why don't Bayesian methods require multiple testing corrections? ). The important question is weither or not the partial pooling model is suitable for your design. Here ( http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/multiple2.pdf ) is a reference for such a consideration by Gelman (it does not use Bayes factor but to my knowledge, there is no limitation in using such a pooling model with Bayes factor)
