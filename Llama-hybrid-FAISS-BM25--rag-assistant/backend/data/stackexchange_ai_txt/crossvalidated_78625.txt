The typical way to talk about effect size for survival analysis is through Cox proportional hazards or accelerated failure time models (though others exist too). In Cox PH models, the hazard ratio is used to describe effect size. This is by far the most popular approach to my knowledge. In AFT models, the ratio of time-to-event describes the effect size. Both of these models make assumptions that are not necessarily correct. Said assumptions should be tested and if violated this should at least be mentioned (though it is often ommitted). The problem with other, more traditional measures is that parts of the information are lost. Some examples: odds ratios/relative risk/logistic regression: ignores when events occurred in time comparing mean time-to-event using t tests or linear regression: ignores censoring These powerpoint slides may be helpful for you.
