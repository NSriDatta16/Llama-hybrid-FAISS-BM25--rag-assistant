Why is generate-id() function returning the same id twice?

I have some XSLT that I didn't write but I have to maintain it. At some points it is using generate-id() to create an empty div which is then manipulated by a script further on. Problem is that the div is inside another div (i had thought this was a bit pointless, but acceptable anyway) and both are being given the same id! I tried this with Xalan and then again with the JRE transformer with the same result. I then tried to use the Eclipse/Xalan XSLT debugger and when i am stepping over the thing, it all works correctly... The XSLT looks like this: And the XML fragment is like this: Blah blah Blech blech. I appreciate this is a bit complicated - any clues? Please?
