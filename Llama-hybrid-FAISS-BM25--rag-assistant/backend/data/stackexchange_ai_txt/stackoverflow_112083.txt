Pointers are not some sort of magical stuff, you're using them all the time! When you say: int a; and the compiler generates storage for 'a', you're practically saying that you're declaring an int and you want to name its memory location 'a'. When you say: int *a; you're declaring a variable that can hold a memory location of an int. It's that simple. Also, don't be scared about pointer arithmetics, just always have in mind a "memory map" when you're dealing with pointers and think in terms of walking through memory addresses. Classes in C++ are just one way of defining abstract data types. I'd suggest reading a good OOP book to understand the concept, then, if you're interested, learn how C++ compilers generate code to simulate OOP. But this knowledge will come in time, if you stick with C++ long enough :)
