The interpretation of the regression coefficients is not very different from that of a classical linear model with interaction. For this it's useful to refer to the table of the group averages. $$ \begin{array}{l|cc} \phantom{} & {\rm Male} & {\rm Female} \\ \hline {\rm Healthy} & 77.9365& 96.2544 \\ {\rm VSD} & 133.7272 & 74.0369 \\ {\rm HC} & 119.5656 & 95.5758 \\ \end{array} $$ Thus PathologyVSD : is the average HU mean for the females of the VSD group minus the average HU mean of the females of the Healthy group, here estimated to be $-22.2175 = 133.7272-96.2544$ . PathologyHC : is the average HU mean of the females in the HC group minus the average HU mean of the females in the Healthy group. GenderM : is the average HU mean for Males minus the average HU mean for females all in the Healthy group. PathologyVSD:GenderM is the average HU mean of Males belonging to the VSD group minus the average HU mean of females in the Healthy group. PathologyHC:GenderM is the average HU mean of Males belonging to the HC group minus the average HU mean of females in the Healthy group.
