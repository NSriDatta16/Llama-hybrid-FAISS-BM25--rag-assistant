jQuery UI - Dialog Hide Effect in Firefox - Flickering

I have a function that calls .dialog on a dynamically generated element. The code: dialog: function(message){ $(' ').attr('innerHTML',message).dialog({ draggable: false, width: 500, hide: 'puff', resizable: false, bgiframe: true, modal: true, buttons: { Ok: function() { $(this).dialog('close'); } } }); }; (dialog is a function of an object named Global) When I close the dialog in IE, the effect works as expected. However, in Firefox the hide effect is all sorts of jagged and 'flicky'. I've seen other questions asked about the UI 'flickering' in FF, but they didn't quite seem to fit my situation. Please, give me some good news and tell me that I'm doing something wrong and Firefox DOES support these effects. This is one of the few times that IE has been successful while FF failed.
