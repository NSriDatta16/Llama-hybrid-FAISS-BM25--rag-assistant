Unable to simulate a touch on the iphone album

I've been trying really hard (with no success) to generate a touch event in the private "PLAlbumView" class (which is the class where the picture thumbnails are displayed). I've been trying to do that in order to test an End-To-End scenario on an iPhone application I've been working on that uses the camera. So far, I have tried mimicking the exact same events sent when I do the tap manually, but that just didn't work. In order to do that, I subclassed UIWindow and put a breakpoint inside the "sendEvent" method. I made sure both my events and the events generated manually were the same. These are the events I've been generating myself: timestamp: 110624 touches: {( phase: Began tap count: 1 window: > view: > location in window: {22, 93} previous location in window: {22, 93} location in view: {22, 25} previous location in view: {22, 25} )} timestamp: 110624 touches: {( phase: Ended tap count: 1 window: > view: > location in window: {22, 93} previous location in window: {22, 93} location in view: {22, 25} previous location in view: {22, 25} )} These are the Events generated when I click manually: timestamp: 110678 touches: {( phase: Began tap count: 1 window: > view: > location in window: {30, 116} previous location in window: {30, 116} location in view: {30, 48} previous location in view: {30, 48} )} timestamp: 110678 touches: {( phase: Ended tap count: 1 window: > view: > location in window: {30, 116} previous location in window: {30, 116} location in view: {30, 48} previous location in view: {30, 48} )} Is there something I am missing? Maybe there is something else I need to generate in order for the tap to work in that control? I have used this technique with other types of controls and it worked.
