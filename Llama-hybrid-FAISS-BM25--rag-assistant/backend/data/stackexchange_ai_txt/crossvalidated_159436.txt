Multinomial logistic regression on categorical data results in singular matrix

I have a categorical dataset from a biological sampling study consisting of six variables, see http://pastebin.com/ncLzw0Mt for the actual dataset. > head(mydata) Z_type Phylogroup Region Year_isolated Outer_hull Trypto_status 1 Z1 A1 A 2006 Slimy Trypto_light 2 Z1 A1 C 2002 Slimy Trypto_medium 3 Z1 A1 A 2009 Slimy Trypto_severe 4 Z1 A1 A 2003 Dry Trypto_medium 5 Z2 A1 C 2002 Slimy Trypto_medium 6 Z3 A2 A 2009 Slimy Trypto_medium Coming from question Categorical Predictors and categorical responses I want to use multinomial logistic regression (mlogit package in R), to see whether any of the other variables can be used to explain the Z_type. If I understand correctly, my variables are all individual specific variables and I assume that I don't want to use a intercept, so here is what I'm doing: library(mlogit) H This however results in a singular matrix: Error in solve.default(H, g[!fixed]) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 7.73263e-17 Does that mean that there is a correlation between some of the variables? I don't really see how that is the case. Are there any other ways, besides mlogit, to answer my question?
