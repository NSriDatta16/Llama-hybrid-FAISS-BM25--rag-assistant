POST variables sending correctly in FF3.6 but not in FF4 beta

Can anyone think of any reason why a $_POST variable might be correctly send on Firefox 3.6 but not in Firefox 4 beta. I have print_r($_POST) and this value simply doesn't show at all in FF4. Here is the input html: Last line of the POST array in FF3.6: [chkOrganiser] => 1 [buttonPreview_x] => 54 [buttonPreview_y] => 22 [buttonPreview] => preview ) Last line of the POST array in FF4.0: [chkOrganiser] => 1 [buttonPreview_x] => 58 [buttonPreview_y] => 20 )
