Many editors like Vim and Emacs have a feature that reindents code according to its built-in indentation standard. In Vim, you can type = with any motion. (Like =% at any block delimiter or S-v to select a region and then = to reformat.) The gq command can be used to reformat comments and other text. In Emacs, you can type M-x indent-region after selecting a region. (Such as with M- and M-> .) You can also reformat comments with M-x fill-paragraph .
