Both json (via the gson library) and protobuf are portable between platorms; but protobuf is smaller (bandwidth) and cheaper (CPU) to read/write json is human readable / editable (protobuf is binary; hard to parse without library support) protobuf is trivial to merge fragments - just concatenate json is easily passed to web page clients the main java version of protobuf needs contract-definition (.proto) and code-generation; gson seems to allow arbitrary pojo usage (there are protobuf implementations that work on such objects, but not for java afaik) If performance is key : protubuf For use with a web page (JavaScript), or human readable: json (perhaps via gson)
