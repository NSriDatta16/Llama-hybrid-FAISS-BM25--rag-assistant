Small steps. There's a reason it's called revision control , and not release control :) Commit as often as you like. Don't hold back. There should never be negative consequences to committing code on an "in progress" branch. Development shops that expect commits not to "break the build" are misusing the RCS. Likewise, ascribing any meaning whatsoever to a commit is dangerous policy, simply because it conflicts with the purpose of revision control. Meaning should instead be ascribed to tags, branches, clones, stashes, or whatever your RCS calls them. These things have meta data (perhaps as minimal as a name ) designed to convey the purpose. Revisions are simply a history of what you modified. The last thing you want to do is institute a policy to discourage developers from committing their code, for any reason.
