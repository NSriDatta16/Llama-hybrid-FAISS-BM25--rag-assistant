Generalized Bayesian estimator (rule) of θ

Question: Let $X_1, · · · , X_n$ be a random sample from $Poisson(θ)$ . The prior for θ is $G(α, β)$ Find the Bayesian estimator (rule) of θ under the SEL(squared error loss). Find the generalized Bayesian estimator (rule) of θ under the loss $L(θ, a) = (a−θ)^2/θ$ . Solution: My understanding: Assume the prior distribution $θ ∼ G(α, β)$ and suppose that we observe a sample of n Poisson data. Then, we can derive the posterior distribution via Bayes theorem as: $θ|x ∼ G(α + n \bar{x}, β + n)$ We have squared loss, $L(\theta-a)=(\theta-a)^2$ . Then the Bayes rule will be $E[\theta|x]=?$ Then I couldn't go further from here. I wanted to make sense of the theory from Wikipedia . But it didn't help. I appreciate your suggestions!
