How to resolve bindings during execution with embedded Python?

I'm embedding Python into a C++ application. I plan to use PyEval_EvalCode to execute Python code, but instead of providing the locals and globals as dictionaries, I'm looking for a way to have my program resolve symbol references dynamically. For example, let's say my Python code consists of the following expression: bear + lion * bunny Instead of placing bear , lion and bunny and their associated objects into the dictionaries that I'm passing to PyEval_EvalCode , I'd like the Python interpreter to call back my program and request these named objects. Is there a way to accomplish this?
