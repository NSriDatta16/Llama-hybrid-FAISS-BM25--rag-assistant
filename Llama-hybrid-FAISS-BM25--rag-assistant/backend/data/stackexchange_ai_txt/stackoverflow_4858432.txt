Creating a desktop application to design Master Page?

How would I go about creating a desktop application that would be capable of generating an ASP.NET master page, perhaps using drag and drop for the different allowed elements (image, text, video). I would take the co-ordinates and generate a master page that can be used later. Any ideas would be great, I know the question is a bit strange and vague.
