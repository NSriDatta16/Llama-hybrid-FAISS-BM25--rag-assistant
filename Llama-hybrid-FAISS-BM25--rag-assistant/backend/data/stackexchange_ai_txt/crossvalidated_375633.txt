Empirical Bayes is different to the "Fully Bayesian" solution, where (i.e. in empirical Bayes) you use the data to decide what parameters you want to use for your prior distribution. There are additional assumptions in Bayesian logistic regression compared to the frequentist setting, namely that you decide on a prior for you model parameters. The effect of adding a prior on your regression coefficients is similar to that of penalised likelihood methods in a frequentist setting (ridge regression, etc.).
