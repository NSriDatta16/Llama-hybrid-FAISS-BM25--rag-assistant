I am not intimately familiar with SVMs, but from what I recall from my studies they are often used with a "kernel function" - essentially, a replacement for the standard inner product that effectively non-linearizes the space. It's loosely equivalent to applying a nonlinear transformation from your space into some "working space" where the linear classifier is applied, and then pulling the results back into your original space, where the linear subspaces the classifier works with are no longer linear. The wikipedia article does mention this in the subsection "Non-linear classification", with a link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_trick which explains the technique more generally.
