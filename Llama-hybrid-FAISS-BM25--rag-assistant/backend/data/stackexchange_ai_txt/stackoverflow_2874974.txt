OAuth 2.0: Can a user-agent (client) avoid forwarding fragments?

In the OAuth 2.0 draft specification, user-agent clients receive authorization in the form of a bearer token via redirection (from an authentication server) to a URL such as HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: http://example.com/rd#access_token=FJQbwq9&expires_in=3600 According to Section 3.5.2 it is then the user-agent's job to GET the URL in question, but " The user-agent SHALL NOT include the fragment component with the request. " In other words, as a result of the example redirection above, the user-agent should GET /rd HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com without passing #access_token to the server. My question: what user agents behave this way? I thought redirection in Firefox, for example, would (logically) include the fragment in the GET request. Am I just wrong about this, or does the OAuth 2.0 specification rely on non-standard user-agent behavior?
