Generating random simulations of events

Whole-edited to make it more simple. Let's assume we have a concrete event: A baseball player's batting average is 0.32. I want to find a random number X, that this player will hit the ball in 1000 tries. A simple way of doing this would be to generate a number Y between 0-1, 1000 times, and check if each time he hits the ball or not (i.e. whether Y is than 0.32) I am trying to do this more efficiently (i.e. without running 1000 simulations). I just want to find the number of total balls he hits. I did a bunch of research and it seems we have a Binomial distribution , for which we have to generate an Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function (which will transform our random number Y between 0-1 to a number X which will be how many times the player actually hit the ball). I took a look at a bunch of papers and found a few methods. I think this guy lays it out well Efficient evaluation . Question: I still would love for someone to explain me how he gets his Normal Asymptotic Approximation , or maybe point me to a video/paper that better explains it, or otherwise explain me how his MatLab code in the appendix works. Thanks,
