I would go for a red-black tree, because it balances the tree on insertion to ensure optimal insertion/deletion/retrieval. An AVL tree is an option, but it's slightly slower for insertions because it's more rigid about balancing on insertions. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree
