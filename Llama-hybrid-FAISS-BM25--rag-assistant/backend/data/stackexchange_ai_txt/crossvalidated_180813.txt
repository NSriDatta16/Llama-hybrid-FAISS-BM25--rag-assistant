Is linear regression powerful enough for price prediction

I know linear regression is the workhorse of machine learning. I understand the internals of it and I am playing with some real data samples. Obviously using a simple line (polynomial degree = 1) is not very useful for most of the datasets, my understanding is that as I increase the polynomial degree I will Get a more accurate prediction Eventually will face the danger of overfiting Now, I have been playing with R and some datasets and this is what I got... stock Now, the red line is definately a muuuuch better fit thant the blue one, that said, two questions come to my mind The red line is almost always (if not always) ascending, meaning that technically any time would be good to buy shares, that does not represent the truth (from 1994 to 1995 there are ups and downs, not to mention 1997 to 1998) Does R automatically apply regularization to prevent overfiting. I am fully aware that this is a very simplistic example (normally I would use more features, not just the date, in order to predict the price. Would a more sophisticated tech such as neuronal network provide a better output here?
