How to aggregate/deal with time series data in multiple markets?

I have our company's daily revenue data in multiple markets. The essence of the project is to see how different markets compare to each other based on a few variables, namely the age of the market and its population. I've created 30 day rolling means for each market and plotted them, What my boss wants is a way to input the population and the age and get out a predicted revenue number. What would be the best way to go about doing this? Should I combine every markets data together and then create an ARIMA model using population as an external regressor? Would that work? Or should I create separate models for every market? Is ARIMA even what I want to do? Maybe just a linear regression with both variables and test for interaction? I'm relatively new to professional statistics, having just graduated college in May, and any help would be greatly appreciated! edit: the dataset looks like this: mkt days.since.launch date revenue mkt.population for each market there are a few hundred datapoints.
