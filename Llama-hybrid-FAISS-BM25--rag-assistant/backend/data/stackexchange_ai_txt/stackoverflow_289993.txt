Turbo C is based on 8086 microprocessor which has two byte word boundary . The atomic reading and writing is typically bound to CPU's architecture, so the compiler is adding some slack bytes to align your data structure. Calling #pragma pack(1) may be able to disable it, but not sure if it works on Turbo C.
