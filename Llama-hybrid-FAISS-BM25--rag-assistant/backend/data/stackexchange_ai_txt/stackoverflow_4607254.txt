There is no way to execute exactly every 48 hours with the classical cron, not even with more than one tab entry. Every 2 days is an average of 0.5 times per day. However, "1-31/2" as posted by others, runs 0.509851 times per day on average, in other words: approx every 47h 4min over a timeframe of 400 years. (Because it will run on both the 31st of an odd month, and the 1st of the following month.) Edit: "*/2" would run 179x/year, which is 0.49041, so that is not exact either. Hooray for the Gregorian calendar.
