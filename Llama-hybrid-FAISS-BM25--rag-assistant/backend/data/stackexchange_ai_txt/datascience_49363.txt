How to compare paired count data?

I am working with a machine learning approach that counts cars in images. I have a predicted dataset, which is the predicted output from the machine learning approach and a paired "true" dataset, which is the result of a human going through each image and counting the number of cars. The following is a sample of what the datasets look like (note that the actual dataset has 2500 paired samples): import pandas as pd d = {'true': [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], 'predicted': [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]} df = pd.DataFrame(data=d) true predicted 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 1 0 4 1 0 5 0 0 6 1 1 7 0 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 10 0 0 11 0 0 12 0 0 13 0 0 14 4 2 15 2 2 16 0 0 17 0 0 18 0 0 19 0 0 20 0 0 21 0 0 22 0 0 23 0 0 24 0 1 25 0 0 26 0 0 27 0 0 28 0 0 29 0 0 30 0 0 31 0 0 32 1 1 I am looking for a way to present the predicted approach to an audience so that they see if the predictions are statistically the same as the true observations and visualize any trends in the data (e.g. the predicted approach has a tendency to over or under predict). If these were categorical data, I would use a confusion matrix, however, I am not sure how to deal with these paired, discrete datasets that are heavily weighted with 0's. What approach can I take to statistically compare the predicted vs true datasets?
