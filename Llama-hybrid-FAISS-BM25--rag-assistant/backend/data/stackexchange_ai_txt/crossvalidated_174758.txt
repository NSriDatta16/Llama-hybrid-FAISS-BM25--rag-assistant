As you stated your question, it's a bit ambiguous. Based on my understanding of your question, it doesn't provide sufficient information to approach this problem in a Bayesian manner. Suppose $A$ is the event that the batter succeeds, and $B$ is the event that the bowler fails. You are given $p(A) = 0.3$ and $p(B) = 0.4$ and you are asked what $p(A|B)$ is. Without any more information or constraints (i.e., whether $A$ depends on $B$ or not), the best you can say is $A$ is independent of $B$ and conclude that $p(A|B)=p(A)=0.3$.
