vim image placement

For the last few days I've been forcing myself to switch from Textmate to Vim. for the most part, my efficiency is pretty much the same after some heavy Vim configuration. one aspect of my workflow I haven't found a replacement for is the drag and drop of files into Textmate, where images would be transformed into img tags and files would be transformed into require calls. How can I dynamically build an image tag, and an include/require statement?
