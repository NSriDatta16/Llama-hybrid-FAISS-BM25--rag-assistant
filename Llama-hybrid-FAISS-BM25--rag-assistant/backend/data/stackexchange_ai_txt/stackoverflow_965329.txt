A strongly typed dataset should not be considered as an OR/M tool. A (strongly typed) dataset is just an in-memory representation of the data in your database (1:1 representation). When you use an OR/M , you 'convert' the data that exists in your database, with in-memory business objects (which do not have to be a 1:1 representation of your DB model, can contain additional logic, etc...). Maybe you could have a look at the MS Entity Framework, but, as far as I know right now, NHibernate is still the better solution when it comes to features, performance, abstraction, and you have more control over it (but, then this comes maybe a bit with a cost (in development time). (No drag 'n drop design, but you can generate your datamodel from your mappings). (late response - network failure ... )
