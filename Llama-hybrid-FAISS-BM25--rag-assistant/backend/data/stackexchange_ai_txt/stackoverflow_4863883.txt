Hibernate: Mapping custom column names in stored procedure named query

I currently have the following named query that wraps around a stored procedure:- { call some_sp :param } The columns name_first and name_last are the exact column names returned by the stored procedure. I created a bean that contains the same column names so that I can map the queried result into that bean. public class MyBean { private String name_first; private String name_last; ... } The Hibernate code that calls the named query and map the result into the bean:- MyBean myBean = (MyBean) sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() .getNamedQuery("mySp") .setParameter("param", param) .setResultTransformer(Transformers.aliasToBean(MyBean.class)) .uniqueResult(); All of these work fine, but instead of relying on the column names from the stored procedure, I want to use my own column names in MyBean , for example:- public class MyBean { private String firstName; // instead of name_first private String lastName; // instead of name_last ... } How do I map my column names against the stored procedure's columns in my named query above? Thanks. UPDATE - I added my final solution below.
