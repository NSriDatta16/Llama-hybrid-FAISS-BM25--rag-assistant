is there any reason you need a fragment shader at all? (are you doing post processing on the video images?). You don't need to do any shader coding to get a video playing with OpenGL. I would use ffmpeg (libavcodec actually) to do the video decoding. Displaying a frame just requires an OpenGL texture and a call to glTexSubImage2D each frame to do the update. Using FFMPEG in C/C++
