According to me, learning data science involves weaving your way through these three: Business domain knowledge Math Technology Going through each of these in detail: Business domain knowledge - There is no 'given way' of going about gaining this. This will come to you as you solve a given problem and try to understand the business around it to be able to better understand the problem you are solving. Math - I believe 'Elements of statistical learning' by Hastie et. all is a very good place to begin. The same authors have a less math intensive version of the same book called ' Introduction to statistical learning' with R. Technology - This comes as a personal choice, how many tools and what kind of tools do you want to have under your skill set. R and python are most popular now, but you can see what suits you the best
