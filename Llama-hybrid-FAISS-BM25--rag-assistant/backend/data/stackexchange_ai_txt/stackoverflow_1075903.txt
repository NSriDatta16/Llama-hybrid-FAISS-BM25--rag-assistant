Regex replace between multiple paragraphs (.Net)

itâ€™s been a while since the last time I had to use regex, I am kind of in a hurry to accomplish something so I hope I can get a quick answer to this quick question. Say I have the following text: Start A B C End Start A B C End Start A B C End Foo A B C Bar I would like to replace the line breaks with pipes but only between the "Start" and "End" words so that my end result is: Start|A|B|C|End Start|A|B|C|End Start|A|B|C|End Foo A B C Bar Thank you very much.
