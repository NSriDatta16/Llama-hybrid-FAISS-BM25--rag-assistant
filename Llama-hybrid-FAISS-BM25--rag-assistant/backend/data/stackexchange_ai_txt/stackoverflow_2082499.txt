Allocating one block of memory is faster than allocating many blocks. There is the overhead of the system call and also searching for available blocks. In programming reducing the number of operations usually speeds up the execution time. Memory allocators may have to search to find a block of memory that is the correct size. This adds to the overhead of the execution time. However, there may be better chances of success when allocating small blocks of memory versus one large block. Is your program allocating one small block and releasing it or does it need to allocate (and preserve) small blocks. When memory becomes fragmented, there are less big chunks available, so the memory allocator may have to coalesce all the blocks to form a block big enough for the allocation. If your program is allocating and destroying many small blocks of memory you may want to consider allocating a static array and using that for your memory.
