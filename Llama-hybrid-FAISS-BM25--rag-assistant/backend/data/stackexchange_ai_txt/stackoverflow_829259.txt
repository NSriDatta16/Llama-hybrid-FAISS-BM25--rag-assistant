How to edit the SQL Agent Job from within SSMS 2005?

I am trying to edit or view the SQL Agent's job (I am the owner of this job) from SSMS 2005 and I can't find out how to do this. When I am double-clicking a job or entering job's properties I get empty "New Job" window. Is there some way to correct this behavior?
