The error is caused by an AJAX response not returning valid JSON. Get something like Firebug or Chrome like Alan suggested and watch the network view to see AJAX request being made as you step through checkout. On saveOrder (the last step, where you get the error) check it's content, instead of JSON I bet you will see a PHP error and stack trace. This is a clue to where the problem is but if you cannot understand add it to your question. Logically the error must be happening after ANZ charges the credit card but before Magento commits the transaction to it's database, because an error occurs the transaction is rolled back. To fix this problem you should think about contacting the author of ANZ eGate (Fontis) and ask for help in debugging.
