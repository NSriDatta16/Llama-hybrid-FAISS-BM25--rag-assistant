At this point, any objects that weren't locally cached in my Core Data store before will appear, but the ones that previously existed do not come along for the ride. Can you explain this a little? I am not sure what you mean by the ones that previously existed. Is it objects that didn't match the filter on your table that now do after the retrieval or are you saying that the previous objects disappear from the table? Also, how are you implementing the delegate methods for the NSFetchedResultsController ? Are you doing a simple table reload or are you inserting/moving rows? Update There are a couple of ways to do this but they would require some experimentation on your part. I would first play with the idea of "touching" the objects that were fetched. Perhaps updating a 'lastAccessed' date or something so that these objects will come across the merge as "updated". I suspect that is the easiest path. Baring that, another option would be to broadcast a notification of those objects back to the main thread (using their NSManagedObjectID as the carrier across the thread boundaries) so that you can manually update them; however that is less than ideal.
