how to disallow a div's 'left' property from exceeding a specified number

I'm using this tiny drag plugin to drag div.slider horizontally across it's div.container. I do not want div.slider to be able to go past the bounds(don't want it to exit) div.container. so when div.slider reaches the very right side of it's container div.container, i want it to not allow the user to drag it any further right, so that it stays inside of it's container. here's my jquery: $(".slider").mouseup(function() { var leftStyleValue = $('div.slider').css('left'); $('.display_value').html(leftStyleValue); if (parseInt($('.slider').css('left')) > 100) { $('#completion').text("YOU DID IT!"); } else { $(".slider").animate({left: 0 }, 500); } }); If i change "mouseup" to mousemove, then it wont allow you to even drag it since it's checking on every pixel move. right now, i can drag div.slider outside of div.container and when i let go of the mousebutton, since i'm not doing a mouseup on div.container, it does nothing. If you want to see the plugin code, go to the site above, copy the compressed plugin code, then go to http://jsbeautifier.org/ and see the uncompressed version.
