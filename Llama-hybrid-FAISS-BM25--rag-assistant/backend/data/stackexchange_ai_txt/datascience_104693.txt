I would recommend a classical AI approach . I suggest you implement a Minimax with depth limiting or A* with depth limiting. In these scenarios, you basically rebuild the game tree and try all moves and observe what happens ("OK, if I move this here, I gain advantage, if I move this there, I gain more advantage, etc....") If you are dead set on implementing a machine learning approach, Deep Q Learning is worth a shot. Here you attempt to teach a Deep Neural network on how to "rate" moves, so then you just rate all the moves and pick the best one.
