How to make Firefox extension auto install in nav bar?

I'm working on a Firefox extension. I'd like to make it auto-install in the far right position on the nav bar when a user installs it. As it stands, a user has to go to View > Toolbars > Customize... and drag the extension to the nav bar once it's installed. I'd like to eliminate this step. The extension is here: http://madan.org/tickertool The XUL for my extension looks basically like this and it overlays browser.xul: I've seen code here ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Code_snippets/Toolbar ) that supposedly does what I'm looking for, but this code is if your extension is just a single button and I can't get it to work for me. The answer to my question is likely some modification of this code, but I haven't figured it out.
