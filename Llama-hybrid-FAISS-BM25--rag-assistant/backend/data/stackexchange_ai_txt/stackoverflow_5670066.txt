On converting from cvs to mercurial

I've got a gigantic CVS repository that I'd like to convert to a few hg repos. This question is similar, but I'm using hg convert and I've got more than one directory in cvs that should go in a given hg repo. Here's an example: /sw .../dir1 .../dir2 .../dir3 .../dir4 .../dir5 I want dir1, dir2, and dir4 in my hg repo, but dir3 can rot with dir5 in a separate one that nobody will ever use. I've been converting the whole thing with hg convert --branchsort sw where sw is a sandbox checkout containing only the directories I care about. That nets me a 1.7GB hg repo with all 4 directories. The CVS repo is 2.3GB, but a sandbox is only 159MB. The hg repo has history going back to 1997, which is awesome, but some of the stuff in there is from products that have been discontinued. They don't need to be in a regular developer sandbox. So, is there a way to cherry pick CVS directories to go into my new hg repository?
