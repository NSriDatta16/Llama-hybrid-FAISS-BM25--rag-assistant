The relationship between probability in classification and real values in regression problems?

Say I have a problem of predicting the house price. Originally it is a regression problem. However I consider two classes (expensive houses and not) by set the threshold of 100.000$. Say I develop a logistic regression (model 1) to predict a house is expensive or not. The model outputs a probability. I also develop a linear regression (model 2) to predict the price of a house. The model outputs real numbers. Could I expect the output probability reflects the price of the house as well? If not what should be the relationship between the output of model 1 and model 2?
