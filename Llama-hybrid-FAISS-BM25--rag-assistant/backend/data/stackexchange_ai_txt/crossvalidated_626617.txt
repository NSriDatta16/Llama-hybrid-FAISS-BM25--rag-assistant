difference between c-statistics and AUC for prediction performance

I have two types of outcome from a big dataset and I performed prediction models and checked the prediction performance using 10-fold cross-validation, so: for binary outcome: lasso logistic regression, then I calculated AUC after 10-fold cross-validation for time-to-event outcome: lasso cox model, then I calculated AUC, using R package " Hmisc " and function rcorr.cens . here is the code line just to show: AUC = 1-rcorr.cens(x, Surv(time,status))['C Index'] now my question is that: for each model, which of AUC or c-statistics is appropriate? should I report AUC or c-statistics or both? why? this code gives me the AUC, is it correct? 1-rcorr.cens(x, Surv(time,status))['C Index'] and changing to rcorr.cens(x, Surv(time,status))['C Index']` gives me the c-statistcis, is it true? thank you for your help.
