Different ways to store web data Locally

Is there anyway to have a client side small database that syncs with server side database whenever there is a change in data? So I am looking at writing a javascript program to store a bunch of student application forms. But the internet connection is gonna be unstable as the personnel using it will be moving around campus to collect form data on his tablet. I have looked at localstorage, but it does not have any database features. I am really looking for technologies that can do local database entries and make asynchronous syncing easy (like what dropBox did was awesome except that it is not a web application) I hope my question is clear Thanks
