Read other people's code. That is the best way to learn better design principles. Read people's code at your work, read people's code on forums, take a look at open source projects... and never stop coding, because the best teacher is the mistakes you make along the way... Check out the book, Pragmatic Programmer, from Journeyman to Master . This is a great book to help fill that gap in knowledge you are looking for.
