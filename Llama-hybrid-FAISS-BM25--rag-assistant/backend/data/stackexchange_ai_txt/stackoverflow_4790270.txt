In your second !File.eof() loop, you are not reading from the file. Isn't the variance the sum of the squares of the differences between values and the average? Your loop doesn't look at the values from the file at all. Also, using integer variables for the sum, average, and variance is likely to lead to inaccuracy; you might want double for those instead.
