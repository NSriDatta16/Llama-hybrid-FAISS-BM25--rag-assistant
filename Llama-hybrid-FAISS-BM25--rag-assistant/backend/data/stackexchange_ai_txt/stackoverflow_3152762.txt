Average on what, given you are already using FIRST and LAST? And why only a scope for LAST too please? Anyway, the average is on DateDiff("n",FIRST(Fields!Date.Value), LAST(Fields!Date.Value, "grp_Order")) or other expression rather then the Code.MinutesToHoursMinutes function, no? So in the average text box: =Code.MinutesToHoursMinutes(Avg(`DateDiff("n",FIRST(Fields!Date.Value), LAST(Fields!Date.Value, "grp_Order")) ... or something similar.
