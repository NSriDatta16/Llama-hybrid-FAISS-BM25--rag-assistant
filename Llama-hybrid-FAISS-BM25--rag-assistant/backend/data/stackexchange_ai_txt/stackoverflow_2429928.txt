How to access Gmail for storage in custom CRM using a SQL Server database?

I have a client who wants his custom-written CRM to be able to access his sales people's emails so that, effectively, a history of email conversations between customer and salesperson is stored inside the CRM's database. The CRM is written in Visual Basic 2008 and the database is SQL Server 2008 . The only email these people use, in the shop and on the road, is Gmail . Each sales person has their own Gmail address. That's how they operate. If they're on the road and respond to a customer's email inquiry about a product, they would like that email conversation to be stored in a table in the database. I think that's the part I can't wrap my head around. How do I get access to the email data (knowing the user id and password) and doing so from Visual Basic 2008? A free or close to free solution would be preferred.
