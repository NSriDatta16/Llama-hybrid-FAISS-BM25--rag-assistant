Eclipse Ganymede for OS X contains no HTML formatter. Alternatives?

In Eclipse 3.4 for Windows, the Source -> Format option for formatting Java code was extended to format HTML code. However, for OS X, this option is disabled. Additionally, there are no formatting options in the Preferences. I've downloaded all the Web Tools for Eclipse and the option is still unavailable. Which plugin/feature allows for HTML formatting on Eclipse OS X, if there is one? Otherwise, what is a good Web-based alternative? Thanks, Adam
