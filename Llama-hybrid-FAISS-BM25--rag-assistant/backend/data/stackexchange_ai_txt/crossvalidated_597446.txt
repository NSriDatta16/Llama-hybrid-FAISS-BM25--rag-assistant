Feature importance with categorical data

I am facing a problem with my PhD Thesis in Archaeology. After analysing the percentages of an animal (variable: Observation) by grouping them by each variable in the following columns (e.g., Median % of Cattle in Urban sites), I am interested in knowing which of these features is more important, rather than simply exploring different distributions. The problem is that all the variables (except the observation) are categorical, so I do not know precisely how to proceed. The question I am interested in answering is: 'Which is the most important factor in choosing this animal? Region, Geography, site type?' I started reading a bit about decision trees, random forests, etc. but I am unsure whether I can use these types of analyses or how should I reshape my data in order to use them. Any advice would be appreciated, I know this is probably a vague question, but unfortunately I am not a statistician and I am a bit stuck with this issue. Thank you in advance!
