The answer might at least partly be hidden in your answer: The predicted random effects are all non-negative. Adding them to the linear predictor of the fixed effects will push up the average prediction to the desired level. So what could be the reason for the non-centered distribution of the eBLUPs? I think it is hidden in the extremely unbalanced data situation: 604 of the 1000 ids provide just one single measurement, which can easily lead to numeric conflicts between random and fixed effects. In such situations, I often run as a sensitivity analysis a normal mixed-model. If we do this with your data, we get: mod_2 The fixed effects now look as expected by the descriptive analysis and very different from what the GLMER found. Now, the eBLUPs are even centered (while of course still far away from a normal): summary(unlist(ranef(mod_2, drop = TRUE))) # Output Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -0.15513 -0.12844 -0.09218 0.00000 0.14878 0.50347 Depending on your exact research questions and goals of your analysis, you could try generalized estimation equations GEE, in R: library(gee) fit_gee % arrange(id), family = binomial, corstr = "exchangeable") summary(fit_gee) # Output Coefficients: Estimate Naive S.E.
