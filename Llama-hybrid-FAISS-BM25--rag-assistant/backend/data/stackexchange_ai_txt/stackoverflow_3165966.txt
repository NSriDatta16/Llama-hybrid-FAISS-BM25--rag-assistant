From the question comments: I'm testing on Nokia E63. Also I'm using the Symbian^3 SDK. E63 is a S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (S60 3.1) device. Though much attention has been given to binary compability between platform version, you should really be using a S60 3rd Edition SDK such as 3.0 or 3.1.
