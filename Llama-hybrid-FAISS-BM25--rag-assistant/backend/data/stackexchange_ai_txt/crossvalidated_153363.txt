Question about the true nature of errors

In frequentist statistics, in regression analysis, errors, like random variables, have a distribution. Errors, like parameters, can be estimated and the residuals of the model are their estimates. So it seems that errors have a nature between the definition of random variable and the definition of parameter. So what is the true nature of errors? What are they exactly? Can they be considered as bayesian parameters even in frequentist statistics?
