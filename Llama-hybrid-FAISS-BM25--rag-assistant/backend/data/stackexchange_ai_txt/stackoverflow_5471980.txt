Qt project structure - advice needed

I'm currently working on a project based on Qt4/QtCreator. I'd like to ask You for advice on how to organize my application. There are 3 seperate tools, each has it's own view. All views are integrated in main window as non-closable tabs. I've prepare 3 views: Tool1View, Tool2View, Tool3View Each tool is suppose to perform some task triggered by user actions. But these are not database related operations (list/add/modify...) - at least the user is not going add/modify/list records in gui elements. I am thinking to implement each tool in 2 classes: First class ToolXView implementing the widget and all tasks related to gui changes. Second class ToolX implementing application logic. Member functions of this class are triggered by View class. Whenever this class has to update GUI elements it cals specialised functions in View class. So no direct calls to widgets are made from here. View class and logic class will be linked with each other to allow 2 way communication. Now I'm wondering if this is a good way to go. Please advice me based on Your experience. I'm planning to encapsulate pointer to logic class as a property of a view class and pointer to view class as a property of logic class. This way I plan to integrade them. Should I use signals/slots to provide comuncation or just call member functions ? I'll have to store some data in QtSql database. Should I provide a seperate class for database access. Or just implement sepereate member function inside Logic class ? How do You name Your classes. Is this scheme good or should I change it ? Thanks for help. I appreciate your comments.
