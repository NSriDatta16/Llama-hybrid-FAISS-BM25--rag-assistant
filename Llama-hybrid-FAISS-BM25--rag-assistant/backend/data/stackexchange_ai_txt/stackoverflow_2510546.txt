Enabling JavaScript GZIP compression in IIS?

we're looking to compress our gargantuan JavaScript files with GZip to speed up the page loads of our site. I know this can be done through IIS, but I can't seem to find a simple step-by-step guide on how to implement it. If someone could point me towards such a guide, I'd really appreciate it. I've never done this before, so it would need to be quite basic. We're running IIS7.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2 . Your time is much appreciated.
