How Soon Should I Start Getting My Program Ready for Windows 7?

Microsoft already has a Windows 7 Beta Customer Preview Program on their MSDN site where they encourage us to: "Evaluate and jump-start your development efforts on Windows 7 Beta". Do you feel it is worthwhile to spend my time now re Windows 7, or should I wait a few releases, or even until after Windows 7 is released? What are the advantages and disadvantages to starting this early?
