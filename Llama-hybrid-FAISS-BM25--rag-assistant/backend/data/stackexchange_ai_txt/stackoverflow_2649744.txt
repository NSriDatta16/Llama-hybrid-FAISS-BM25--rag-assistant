the best way is to store 2 columns - rate_count and rate_total. then when you get a new rating you just issue an update like this : update rating_table set rate_count = rate_count + 1, rate_total = rate_total + $rating where id = $id then to get the average you retrieve rate_count and rate_total. as long as rate_count is >0, rate_total/rate_count will give you your average rating.
