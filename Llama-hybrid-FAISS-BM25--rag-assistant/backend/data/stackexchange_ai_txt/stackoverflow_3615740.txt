Why MySQL Full text index doesn't work?

After trying everything I could, I finally created this test table: CREATE TABLE test_table ( id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, title text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), FULLTEXT KEY title (title) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 With the following test data: INSERT INTO test_table (id, title) VALUES (1, 'Evolving intelligence bayesian filtering power behind'); I would expect the following query to return 1 row: SELECT * FROM test_table WHERE MATCH (title) AGAINST ('intelligence'); But it returns an empty set. I have another database in the same mysql instance where full text searching works as expected. But for every new database I have created, full text doesn't work. I have rebuilt the indexes, repaired the tables, even inspected the index with myisam_ftdump. I'm out of ideas. Do you have any idea about this problem? Thank you in advance.
