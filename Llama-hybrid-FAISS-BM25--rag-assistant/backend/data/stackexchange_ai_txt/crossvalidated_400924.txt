The method you are looking for are Auto-Correlation and ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages). Pandas has a nice and easy implementation of auto-correlation plots that will help you to identify and visualize any temporal correlation in your data. Next, read up on ARIMA as there are various approaches depending on your data and domain such as: adjusting for temporal trends, adjusting for seasonality, adjusting for scale etc. One last point, rather than "I want to add lagged values of target variable" it is more common to conceptualize this as shifting the independent variables ( $X$ ) backwards in time ( $t$ ) i.e. ( $X^{t0}, X^{t-1}, X^{t-2}, X^{t-3}$ etc) rather than shifting ( $y$ ) forward in time. Update: You can include lagged versions of $y$ as independent variables. Note that if you take a 14 day lag, you will effectively remove the bottom 14 rows of your data - bare this in mind if your sample size is small. To alleviate this issue you can try feature engineering such as moving or running averages of $y$ . Also, be sure to check for collinearity if you are adding multiple lagged version of $y$ .
