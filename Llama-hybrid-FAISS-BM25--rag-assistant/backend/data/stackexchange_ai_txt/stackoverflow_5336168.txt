Chirag answer is what I would do, but correct me if I am wrong... Wouldn'it be better to add the flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT: Intent i = new Intent(getBaseContext(), ActivityB.class); i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT); ActivityA.this.startActivity(i); that's hat I currently use in my application and would be sure that's a good idea. Kind regards
