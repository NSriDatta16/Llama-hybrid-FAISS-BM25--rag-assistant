I agree with Diodeus Make two images, one normal and one blurred. Use jquery.animate() to swap opacity between them and trigger them with js that check the position of your "slider button" when you drag it in one or other direction. And do not forget to preload the images, so the effect will run smoothly. In flash it is easier because you have a "blur" effect, while in CSS you do not.
