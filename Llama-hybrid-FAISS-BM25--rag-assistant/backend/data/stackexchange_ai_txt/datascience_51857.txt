Problems finding an LSTM model for classification

I am doing a study for the classification of musical genres using deep learning techniques. The work consists of making a classification using an LSTM model. I am using GTZAN as a data set, and preprocessing them using Librosa. This way I obtain the spectral characteristics, specifically: Spectral centroid. My input data has the following size: X_train (750, 20, 1249). My model is: model = Sequential () model.add (LSTM (units = 512, return_sequences = True, input_shape = (X_train.shape [1], X_train.shape [2]))) model.add (LSTM (units = 32, return_sequences = False)) model.add (Dense (units = 10, activation = 'softmax')) model.compile (loss = losses.categorical_crossentropy, optimizer = Adam (), metrics = ['accuracy']) model.summary () I get these results: I scale also my data using MinMaxScaler. I appreciate any help. Thank you.
