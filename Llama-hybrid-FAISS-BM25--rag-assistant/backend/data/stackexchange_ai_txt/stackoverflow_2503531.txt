It seems you are looking more for auditing features. Oracle and several other DBMS have full auditing features. But many DBAs still end up implementing trigger based row auditing. It all depends on your needs. Oracle supports several granularities of auditing that are easy to configure from the command line. I see you tagged as MySQL, but asked about any storage engine. Anyway, other answers are saying the same thing, so I'm going delete this post as originally it was about the flashback features.
