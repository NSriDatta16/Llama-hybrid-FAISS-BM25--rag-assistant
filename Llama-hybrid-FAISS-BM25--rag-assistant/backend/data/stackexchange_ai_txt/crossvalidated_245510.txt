Is it possible to do an adequate prediction on tiny sample?

I have a financial time series, x , it's length is n=8 observations only. Each observation corresponds to the quarterly costs (numerical value) of a firm. I need to predict future costs and find 95% confidence interval on the next quarter. x From the plot you can assume in this series that there exists a seasonal component. My intuition is: to split the quarterly value on the month one, and then apply some method (for example non-linear regression) to predict future costs. For simplicity let's split under assumption of the uniform distibution. For instance, x1 In this case I'll have $n=24$ observations. Of course you can say it's impossible to do an adequate prediction on such a tiny sample. Question. Could you please share your point of view on the problem?
