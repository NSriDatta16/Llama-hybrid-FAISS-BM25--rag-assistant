Is summing daily forecasts a sound method for generating weekly/monthly forecasts?

I'm new to time series analysis, and I am wondering if this is a sound method for generating weekly and monthly predictions. In my case, I need to generate daily, weekly, and monthly predictions. If I generate daily predictions for a quarter out, could I simply sum those daily predictions to get the weekly and monthly predictions? For example, to generate next week's prediction, could I sum the daily prediction for the 14th-20th? This seems to especially make sense to me when considering weekly seasonality (namely, weekend dropoffs). Sorry if this a silly question. I gave it a bit of thought, and it seems like a reasonable method. I have been trying to use Facebook Prophet, which seems to work better with daily data out-of-the-box, so I am curious. Thanks!
