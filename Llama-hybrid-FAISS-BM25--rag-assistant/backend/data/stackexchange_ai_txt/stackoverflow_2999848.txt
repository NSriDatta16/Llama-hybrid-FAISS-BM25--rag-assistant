What is the best practice to cache images on Android?

In my application I use SoftReference to cache images, it is working fine with active internet connection. And now I need to cache images, so I could use it in offline mode. What is the best way to implement it? Use complex solution with SoftReference and database? or maybe SoftReference and local storage (sdcard)? I would appreciate your advices. Thanks.
