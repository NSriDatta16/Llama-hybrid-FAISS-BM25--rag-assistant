Both visually and statistically your time series is very stationary. It looked like you used the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test to test whether your time series is stationary and it is. Several of the unit root test testing for stationarity have similar parameters associated with a tau statistics (similar to a t stat). And, you want the tau statistics to be very negative, meaning that your time series mean-reverts (in the opposite direction of the previous change) very quickly. In conjunction with a very negative tau statistics, you want an associated very low P value at least less than 0.05. This indicates that this variable does mean revert very quickly, and that there is a very small chance (0.05) that it does that purely by chance. In your case, with a t stat of -8.5 and a P value
