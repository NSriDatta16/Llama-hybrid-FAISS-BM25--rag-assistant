Deploying .net 4 apps on .net 2 machines

Our organisation only runs .net 2.0 on desktops. It would be nice to upgrade all machines to .net 4.0, but that is not going to happen. I wish to use .net 4.0 features. Is there a way to statically link .net 4.0 runtime libraries into my .net 4.0 executables so they will run on a .net 2.0 environment?
