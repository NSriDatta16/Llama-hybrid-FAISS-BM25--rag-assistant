ASP .Net MVC 2 custom Helper Grid not posting Model to controller action

I've created a custom helper that renders a grid and receives the strongly typed view's model as a parameter. Basically my view looks like this: But when I click on the submit button, all the values on the model are null. This is what the controller looks like: [HttpPost] public string UpdateValues(AssignmentResultsVm assignmentResults) { //..... do something } How can I make this work? Thanks in advance.
