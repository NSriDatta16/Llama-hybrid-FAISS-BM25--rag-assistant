What is the name of the probability distribution of ROC-AUC when training machine learning models?

When training ML models like neural networks they are random initialized. That has the effect that the results (ROC-AUC for example) are influenced by random effect. When I train them multiple times they form a probability distribution which can not be less than 0 and not be more than 1 (in case of ROC-AUC). What is the name of this distribution? I tried to draw some examples below. Thanks Philip
