First step would be to create a proxy. Use the Add Service Reference dialog box in Visual Studio and provide the WSDL address: http://www.hotelscombined.com/api/LiveRates.asmx?WSDL . Second step is to call the service: using (var client = new LiveRatesSoapClient()) { var response = client.HotelSearch(new HotelSearchRequest { ApiKey = "THE_API_KEY_GOES_HERE", Checkin = new DateTime(2009, 7, 2), Checkout = new DateTime(2009, 7, 3), DisplayCurrency = "usd", Guests = 2, HotelID = 50563, LanguageCode = "en", Rooms = 1, TimeOutInSeconds = 90, UserAgent = "???", UserID = "???", UserIPAddress = "???" }); } Note that depending on the WSDL some property names might be different than the ones I provided in my sample as I don't know the WSDL but Intellisense should help you. There's a nice tutorial you might read.
