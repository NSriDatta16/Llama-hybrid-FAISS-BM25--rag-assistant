Plot ROC curve in R with the PRROC package

After many hours of research, trial and error and frustration I hope someone here will be able to guide me in the right direction. I am fairly new to R and statistics and can not wrap my hand about the workings of the roc.curve() function of the PRROC package in R . My goal is to plot a ROC curve in the standard fashion provided by the PRROC package like this: Picture: Example ROC curve I now want to plot the ROC curve for the fitted logistic regression model with the testdata. My problem is, that I only get AUC values either 1 or 0 according to the order I put in my data in the curve is rectangluar. Can someone see my mistake? Any help is greatly appreciated.
