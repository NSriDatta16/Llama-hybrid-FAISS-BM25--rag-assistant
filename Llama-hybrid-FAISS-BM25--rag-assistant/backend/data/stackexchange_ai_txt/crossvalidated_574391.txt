With Stationarity How can ARMA Modelling have any Validity?

I have recently been thrown into the deep end with time-series econometrics. The first thing I have learned is that in order to avoid the spurious correlation trap, I need to ensure that all the variables I am working with are stationary. I have just finished coding the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. My take on stationarity and the ADF test is that if a variable can largely (and spuriously) be explained/predicted by itself lagged, then it is not stationary. The next 200 pages of my book are devoted to ARMA (and other lagged correlation type models) time series modelling, and its use in predicting time series variables. But reading the rest of the book seems futile, I have to first prove (via ADF test) that a variable does not display significant autocorrelation (is stationary), and then I must engage with this modelling approach which is built on autocorrelation. This all seems contradictory, what am I missing in my understanding of time series econometrics?
