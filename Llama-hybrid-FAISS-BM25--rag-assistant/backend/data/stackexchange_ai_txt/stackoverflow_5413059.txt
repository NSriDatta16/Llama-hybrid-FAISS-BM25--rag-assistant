Hey. First of all, I was always using .elements() not .elements ... but it is JS, so it may be invoking function that is assigned to object property..? Anyway, maybe this edit menu is not internal window of the app, but it is system level menu, that is invoked, when you do the drag? If that is true, try: UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().elements().withName("copyButton").tap(); But as I see in apple reference your version with calling app.editingMenu() should be fine... Maybe try calling buttons by position, and you will see which respond: UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().editingMenu().elements()[0].tap; UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().editingMenu().elements()[1].tap; UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().editingMenu().elements()[2].tap; You should find position of correct one this way. When you have it's position you can check its properties by button.logElement(); . With this inf you you should be able to switch back to .withName method instead hardcoded position.
