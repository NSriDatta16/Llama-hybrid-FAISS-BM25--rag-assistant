There is an updated version of the very nice and slim Open Terminal Here posted by vgm64 and d0k . The change was made by james david low . He published the new version on his site . Just download OpenTerminalHere.zip, extract it, move the bundle to your Library/Scripts folder and drag it from there to your Finder toolbar. What is special about it is that it always opens a new tab if a Terminal.app window is already open. Very useful! I also noted that the style of the button of the application better fits the Snow Leopard Finder.app style than cdto posted by redacted did.
