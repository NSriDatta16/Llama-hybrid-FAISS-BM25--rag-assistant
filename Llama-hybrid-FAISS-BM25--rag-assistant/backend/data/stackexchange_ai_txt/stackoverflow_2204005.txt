Short Answer You can't, worry about something else. Long Answer This sounds like yet another form of premature optimization . (YAFPO?) You should design your schema using third normal form (3NF). Once designed, you should populate your tables with data and begin profiling. If a particular query is deemed too costly then you should look into denormalization on a case by case basis. Technical Answer (for the nitpickers who will inevitably object to: "you can't") You will reach a limit at some point based on your choice of RDBMS and/or storage engine. Likely ceilings will be memory consumption or open file descriptors.
