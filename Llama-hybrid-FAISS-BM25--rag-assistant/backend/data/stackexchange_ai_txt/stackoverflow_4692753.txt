I think this kind of division of page to custom/usercontrols may prove to be useful even without reusing the parts. This gives you: Encapsulation - you can hide the boring plumbing and fragile internal state from higher level code, leaving you a much cleaner set of controls to work with and more business-oriented code on page level. Separation of concerns - you can make pieces which are simple, yet logically whole. Readiness for reuse - may never become useful but it does make you feel more powerful ;) But be aware that this can backfire if your components are not properly named and grouped, badly designed, you use lots of dynamic loading, do not provide good API or nesting goes too deep. I have seen it happen in a legacy app and it wasn't helpful that way. If done well, worth it. With inexperienced/sloppy team members, better don't.
