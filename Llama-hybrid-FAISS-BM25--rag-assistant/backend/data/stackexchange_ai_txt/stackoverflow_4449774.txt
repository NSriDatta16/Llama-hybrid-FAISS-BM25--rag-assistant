This might not be what you're looking for, but if your table has some way to order the data (e.g. by date), then you can just do incremental computations and store the results. For example, if your data has a date column, you could compute the average for records 1 - Date1 then store the average for that batch along with Date1 and the #records you averaged. The next time you compute, you restrict your query to results Date1..Date2, and add the # of records, and update the last date queried. You have all the information you need to compute the new average. When doing this, it would obviously be helpful to have an index on the date, or whatever column(s) you are using for the ordering.
