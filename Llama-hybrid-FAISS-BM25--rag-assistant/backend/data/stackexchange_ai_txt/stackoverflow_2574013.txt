UIControlEventTouchDragEnter doesn't seem to work for catching a tap that slides into a control

I wanted to allow for a method to get called, if a finger was dragged from outside into the bounds of a control. I thought UIControlEventTouchDragEnter would do it, but it doesn't seem to. Does anyone know if there is a way to trigger an action based on a tap sliding into a control? This is what I was trying, but got no calls to my -fingerSlidIn: [aButton addTarget:self action:@selector(fingerSlidIn:withEvent: ) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchDragEnter]; Thanks!
