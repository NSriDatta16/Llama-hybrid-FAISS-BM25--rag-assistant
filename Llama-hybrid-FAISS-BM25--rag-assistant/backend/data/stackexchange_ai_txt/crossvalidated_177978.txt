In addition to Peter's advice sometimes for count variables a quadratic fit is good, mainly because it is difficult to choose knot locations in a spline function when there are many tied values. As said by @DJohnson it is not appropriate to pre-group an ordinal variable as this is making pre-judgements about the dose-response relationship and making the peculiar assumption of piecewise flatness. But I have reservations related to her comment of hoping the buckets were created post hoc. This would create a bias that inflates type I error and hurts confidence interval coverage.
