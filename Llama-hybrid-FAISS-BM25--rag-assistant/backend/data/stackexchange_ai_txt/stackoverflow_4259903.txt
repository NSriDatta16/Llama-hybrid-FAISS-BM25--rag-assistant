ASP.NET runs in a reduced trust environment. If your event log source does not already exist, then registry keys will have to be added in order to create it. But that won't work in the reduced-trust environment. You should create an installer class for the event source you're using, then "install" the web site during deployment. The fastest way to do this is to create a "Component" to do your event logging, drag an Event Log component onto the design surface, set the properties, then choose the command to create an installer. At deployment time, you'll just have to run "installutil" against your web application's DLL. The event source will be created before your web application starts.
