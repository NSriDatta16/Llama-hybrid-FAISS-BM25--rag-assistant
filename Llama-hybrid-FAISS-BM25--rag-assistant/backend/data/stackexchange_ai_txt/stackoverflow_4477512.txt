Use jQuery [docs] and jQuery UI [docs] . I'm almost done with converting to jQuery, I'll post a jsFiddle link when I finish it. Here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/pswRh/ After you learn jQuery and jQuery UI, it's very easy to make an element draggable, and – optionally – disable dragging it with a specified child element. HTML CSS (optional) #myDiv { width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 1px solid; background: blue; color: white; } JavaScript $('#myDiv').draggable({ cancel: '#textInput' }); And voila! You've just made a draggable div, but you can still type in the input field, since it won't drag the element. Alternatively, you can specify a handle. That way, you can only drag the div with the specified child. HTML, CSS same as previous JavaScript $('#myDiv').draggable({ handle: '#pic' }); Specify multiple elements separated by a comma (i.e. '#el1, #el2, #el3' ).
