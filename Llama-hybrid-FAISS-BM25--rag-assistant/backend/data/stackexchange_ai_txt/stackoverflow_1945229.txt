How to set up gcov for code coverage analysis in iPhone SDK?

I've recently begun unit testing an app I write for the iPhone. I have the basics of creating my own tests down, even if it seems a little sub-optimal. I am, however, having real trouble setting up code coverage analysis using gcov. I followed the instructions here: http://www.cubiclemuses.com/cm/articles/2009/05/14/coverstory-on-the-iphone/ , which are repeated very similarly in other places. I've tried using Google's AppleScript from their toolbox for Mac to do it just in case I was entering something wrong in Xcode. I've used Apple's iPhoneUnitTests sample as a base project, and simply running Google's AppleScript to enable code-coverage testing against the CalcTests target to get a well-sourced, automated example of it not working. No matter what scenario I use, my own code, Apple's, manually setting the proper variables or letting Google's AppleScript do it for me, all I get are these errors in the debug console once the tests are finished running: profiling:/Users:Cannot create directory profiling:/Users/jpo/Downloads/iPhoneUnitTests/build/iPhoneUnitTests.build/Debug-iphoneos/CalcTesting.build/Objects-normal/armv6/CalcViewController.gcda:Skip profiling:/Users:Cannot create directory profiling:/Users/jpo/Downloads/iPhoneUnitTests/build/iPhoneUnitTests.build/Debug-iphoneos/CalcTesting.build/Objects-normal/armv6/Calculator.gcda:Skip profiling:/Users:Cannot create directory profiling:/Users/jpo/Downloads/iPhoneUnitTests/build/iPhoneUnitTests.build/Debug-iphoneos/CalcTesting.build/Objects-normal/armv6/CalcAppDelegate.gcda:Skip profiling:/Users:Cannot create directory profiling:/Users/jpo/Downloads/iPhoneUnitTests/build/iPhoneUnitTests.build/Debug-iphoneos/CalcTesting.build/Objects-normal/armv6/main.gcda:Skip The gcda files are not created, and thus I have nothing to analyze. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
