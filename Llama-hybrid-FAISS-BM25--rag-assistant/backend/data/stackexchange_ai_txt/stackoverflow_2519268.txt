You can certainly program SCMs via APIs. Check out SVNKit for Java and Subversion, or JGit for Java and Git. Mercurial doesn't appear to offer such an API. Whatever you do, wrap up your implementation in a suitable API, so you can swap one SCM for another, or maybe bin the concept of an SCM at some stage in the future. It may well be a pragmatic solution to your problem, however, and worthy of more investigation.
