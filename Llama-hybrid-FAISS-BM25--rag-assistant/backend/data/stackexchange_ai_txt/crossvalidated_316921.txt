Random Forests - Regression or Classification?

I have a question relating to use of Random Forests: My dataset's output are integers (0 to 19), and is unbalanced. The histogram below shows the distribution of the data. I am open to using either Random Forests regression or classification, however, I am uncertain how to evaluate the results. Regression produces continuous predictions - how can I compare them to the discrete true values? And given the 19 classes, is it wise to use classification instead of regression? I'd really appreciate any help or advice.
