Why are intervals for means narrower than intervals for individual observations?

I am looking at problem 5.01 relating to Galton's data on adult heights of fathers and sons , from Chapter 5 of Statistical Modelling: A Fresh Approach link to this book: http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/index.html Can anyone explain me why Confidence interval is so different that coverage interval? Prob 5.01. The mean of the adult children in Galton’s data is > mean( height, data=Galton ) [1] 66.76069 Had Galton selected a different sample of kids, he would likely have gotten a slightly different result. The confidence interval indicates a likely range of possible results around the actual result. Use bootstrapping to calculate the 95% confidence interval on the mean height of the adult children in Galton’s data. The following statement will generate 500 bootstrapping trials. trials = do(500) * mean(height, data=resample(Galton) ) (a) What is the 95% confidence Interval on the mean height? A. 66.5 to 67.0 inches. B. 66.1 to 67.3 inches. C. 61.3 to 72 inches. D. 65.3 to 66.9 inches. (b) A 95% coverage interval on the individual children’s height can be calculated like this: qdata(c(0.025,0.975), height, data=Galton) 2.5% 97.5% 60 73 Q: Explain why the 95% coverage interval of individual children’s heights is so different from the 95% confidence interval on the mean height of all children?
