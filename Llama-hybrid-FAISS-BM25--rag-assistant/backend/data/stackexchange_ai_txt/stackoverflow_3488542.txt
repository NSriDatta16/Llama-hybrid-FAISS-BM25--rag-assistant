It is a side-by-side configuration problem. Your program contains a manifest that states what DLL it needs from the SxS cache. And Windows can't find it. Start by looking at the Windows event log, it will tell you what DLL couldn't be found. This is more typically a VS2008 problem, its DLL version of the CRT libraries are stored in the side-by-side cache. Like msvcrt90.dll. Maybe you didn't quite manage to get the code converted to your new build environment. Which is odd, embedding the manifest is an explicit build step. Do check that you don't have a .manifest file in your build directory. This hoopla got retired in VS2010 btw. VS2010 Express could be your 3rd attempt.
