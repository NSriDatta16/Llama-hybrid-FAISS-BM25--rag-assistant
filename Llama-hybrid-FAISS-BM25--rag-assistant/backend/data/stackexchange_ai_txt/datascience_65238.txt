sampling is useful in machine learning because sampling, when designed well, can provide an accurate, low variance approximation of some expectation (eg expected reward for a particular policy in the case of reinforcement learning or expected loss for a particular neural net in the case of supervised learning) with relatively few samples. in some cases - eg learning starcraft - it is unfeasible to evaluate all possible trajectories for a given policy model and, as such, it is impossible to compute the expected value even for a single model (and this is for a single point in parameter space!). in these cases, sampling is the only feasible approach.
