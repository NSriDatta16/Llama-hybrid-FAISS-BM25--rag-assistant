Accomplishing this takes a mix of good patterns and knowing what fights not to fight. CSS is best if it's factored out, efficient, and cleanly formatted. No overthinking necessary here, CSS is a beautiful language, I like to keep it simple. For example see my answer here: MVC 3, CSS, Razor and Visual Studio 2010 Javascript can definitely be organized by using some kind of object based pattern: http://www.klauskomenda.com/code/javascript-programming-patterns/ . I use something close to "Custom Objects" from that link. With YUI we have built in namespaces, with jQuery we can add them: Is it possible to create a namespace in jQuery? . As far as separating out content, separate objects and related functionality in their own javascript files and include them on the pages where they're needed. For optimization, you can compile all the scripts on any page down into one script. YUI 3 has a great dependency loading mechanism - use that. For jQuery, you can use one of the many dependency loaders: Javascript loaders with jQuery As far as HTML, I think MVC is the most popular patter these days. Using any modern mvc framework will lay things out for you well. (Ex. rails, any java ones, asp.net mvc, pylons, etc.)
