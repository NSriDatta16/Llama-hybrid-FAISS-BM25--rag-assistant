Change Windows Mobile 5.0 Emulator RAM Size

I can't change the memory size for a Windows Mobile 5.0 emulator. This is what I have tried. In Visual Studio 2008 Professional, I can try to change the RAM size of an Emulator by going to Tools->Options->Device Tools->Devices. From there I select a device (I am working with USA Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC R2 Emulator) and click the Properties button -> Emulator Options button. I check the Specify RAM size box and change it to 256 and hit OK -> OK -> OK. This does not change anything. When I launch that emulator from Visual Studio, and then from inside the emulator go to Start -> Settings -> System -> Memory, it shows the following 2 totals: Storage: 31.42MB Program: 36.99MB From the emulator window if I go to File -> Configure..., it shows the RAM size still set to 128, and yet according to the emulator OS there is less than 128 anyway. I know I had this working before I switched from XP to Windows 7. I have tried clearing the saved state, before and after making the changes. I have tried doing a soft and a hard reset with the emulator.
