Why is the "gptr" type of basic_streambuf char_type* rather than const char_type*?

The basic_streambuf member to set the three "gptrs" of the streambuf, setg , is declared as: protected: void setg(char_type *gback, char_type *gptr, char_type *egptr); I am wondering: why was the type of each gptr made char_type* instead of const char_type* ? Is it safe to use const_cast here to use const char pointers for these gptrs?
