A game like Angry Birds is definitely possible using cocos2d. You should definitely use box2d or Chipmunk. I would recommend box2d, since I found it easier to understand. The basic idea is that you create a box2d body for each sprite, e.g. the birds and the pieces of the structure are all separate bodies. The basic idea is to create a layer that is bigger than the screen that contains everything and then move that layer around. To allow scrolling by touch, you would need to track how far the touch moves in the touch start/moved/finished methods and move the layer accordingly. You also might be able to use the CCFollow action to simulate a camera following the bird through the air. Edit for your other questions: Sprite animations are handled using CCSpriteSheet . You can see more in the programming guide . You detect where you are dragging the bird by using the touch location, which is fairly straightforward when you write your touch methods. Again, refer to the programming guide . I'm not sure of the best way to stretch the band. One way would be to use several sprites (one for each side of the band, one for the 'pouch' in the middle) and strech/rotate them as needed.
