Fast answer: Magento enterprise is supposed to take care of this by allowing you to run staging sites and then sync content such as prices and products via the admin interface. I have not have total success with it, but the idea is there. When it comes to code, you may still be able to use the environments without much difficulty. For instance, changing the appearance of your site or adding new plugins may not require any modification of the database and should therefore be safe. When adding new tables or modifying params, you'll need to keep track of any changes that are made and run a script mirroring those changes against the production site. So that leaves catalog changes as the likely problem spot. I would advocate just making those changes to the live site (as they are standard data) and checking the configuration of the items before making them visible. You could also wipe out the specific tables for products (but not sales) and reload them from the test database, but this would take your site offline for a while whenever you sync. If this misses your point, please post more detail about a problematic change that needs to be populated. Thanks, Joe
