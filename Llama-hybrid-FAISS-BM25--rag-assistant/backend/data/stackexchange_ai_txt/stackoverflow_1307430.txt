Visual Studio 2008 Find dialog takes >2s to appear

For some reason my Visual Studio Find dialog, which usually shows instantly after I press Ctrl+F, has started to take more than 2 seconds to show. During this time Visual Studio is entirely unresponsive. 2 seconds for a small window to show is outrageous :) Restarting VS or rebooting the machine didn't help. Has anyone seen this before? How can I fix this? OS : Vista x64; Defrag : Weekly, at night
