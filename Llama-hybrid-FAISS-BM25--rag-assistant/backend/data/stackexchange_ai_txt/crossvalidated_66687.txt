Why does SPSS create false means in my clustered bar chart?

I'm pulling my hair out on this one, so hope somebody can help me out. I'm using SPSS 19 on a dataset structured like this (dummy data): Time1 Time2 Time3 Group ----- ----- ----- ----- 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 1 1 2 7 0 1 3 4 0 etc... I can easily manually or using SPSS calculate the means for the different follow-ups (Time1, Time2 and Time3) first for Group 0 and then for Group 1. But then I create a clustered bar chart by choosing 'Clustered bar char', dragging Time1, Time2 and Time3 to the Y-axis, dragging my Group-variable to the X-axis. Which creates a chart like this: Legend shows my three followups (Time1 etc), X-axis shows my two groups (0 or 1). While it apparently looks fine and dandy, I can clearly see that the mean values are simply wrong compared to the mean I can calculate myself, or the ones reported when I compare mean using a T-test! I mean the very last bar shown in the example should show the mean of Time3 for the last Group, right? That's what I'd figure, but the mean is not correct. :( Is there something basic I just don't understand about the clustered bar charts? Any help or hints are very appreciated.
