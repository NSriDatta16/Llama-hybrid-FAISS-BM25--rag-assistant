I've seen your similar question on Data Science stack exchange and held off answering because I work with Keras/Tensorflow rather than PyTorch. As that question hasn't been answered, I'll answer for how this works in Keras. Hopefully this will be some help, if you don't get a specific answer for PyTorch. The time series features are often called channels in neural network terminology. In Keras, by default the channels go last so your input shape should be (num_of_samples, 30, 1) , however when creating Conv1D layer this is controlled by the parameter data_format . The default value is "channels_last" , but if you want/need to use the shape (num_of_samples, 1, 30) , you can set the data_format to "channels_first" .
