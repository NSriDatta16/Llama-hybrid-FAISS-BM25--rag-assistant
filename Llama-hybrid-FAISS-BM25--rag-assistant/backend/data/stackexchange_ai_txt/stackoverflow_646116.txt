Open Source & Cross Platform Multiplayer/Networking Libraries?

While raknet seems fairly interesting and really appealing from a feature-point of view, its licensing terms seem to be possibly troublesome for GPL'ed projects that may be leveraged commercially, something which is explicitly forbidden by the terms of the creative commons license. While there's also opentnl , it doesn't seem to be as actively maintained anymore nowadays, in fact downloading the latest stable tarball even fails during compilation because it doesn't seem to support gcc >= 3.0 (?) Of course, there's still also enet , but this one cannot be really compared to the abstract features that are supported by raknet/opentnl. So, apart from any non-trivial dependencies such as ACE, Boost or Poco, are there any viable alternatives for embedding a fairly compact, well-maintained UDP-networking library? Thanks
