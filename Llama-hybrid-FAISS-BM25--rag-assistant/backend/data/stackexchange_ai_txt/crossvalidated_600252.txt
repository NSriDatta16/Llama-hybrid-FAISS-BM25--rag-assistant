Should explained be 100% in PCA if the number of components is same as number of features?

I have a financial timeseries data with 13 features. When I apply PCA with n_components = 13, the explained variance doesn't sum up to 100%. My intuition was if n_components is same as the number of features, the explained variance should be 100%. Under what circumstances, is it possible to have less than 100% explained variance if n_components = number of features? Edited: The first 5 components explain 22% of variance and rest of the components don't add much value.
