localStorage Getting NULL?

I'm not sure why, as i've done this before and it worked fine, and i'm thinking it might be because of a browser issue/bug: localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar') alert(localStorage.getItem('foo')); I'm in Firefox 3.6.6 and it alerts "bar" but if I do: //localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar') alert(localStorage.getItem('foo')); I get NULL. It should return bar still as it's in my storage. Also, this is just a web page that it's running on.
