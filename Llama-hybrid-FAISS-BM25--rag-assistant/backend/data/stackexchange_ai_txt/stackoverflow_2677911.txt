Fixed filesystem location One possibility would be to install them in a sub-directory of Program Files , as already suggested by @Martin Beckett. Variable filesystem location, fixed entry in Registry If you don't want to install them at a fixed location, you could also store their location in the Windows Registry. You'd install some keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE that your applications could read to find out where the DLLs are located. Then the DLLs can be loaded at run-time. P.S.: Preventing orphaned DLLs You could go one step further and use the Registry, or some other storage (a file, say), to store information about which of your applications uses which of your DLLs. For example: FooCommon.dll Whenever one of your applications is un-installed, it removes itself from this map. Any uninstaller can then safely delete a DLL that is no longer in use by any application. That method is akin to reference-counting, and the idea is to prevent orphaned DLLs from accumulating on users' filesystem.
