Is there a great WYSIWYG html editor component that had Drag n' Drop *like* the Google Waves editor?

Is there a component out there that can be used that provides some of the great capabilities that the Google Waves editor provides (or Google Docs editor)? If it only works on a certain browser, that is fine. If it is part of GWT or some other framework, that is fine. I know that this will probably require Google Gears. I would prefer just a javascript library. It must/should have: Drag and Drop of images or files into the area The ability to have toggle for sections that were changes (version history) Basic support for PRE, Links, OL, LI. (Stack overflow editor, is close) It must have auto-save support It must have a sane API and system for uploading/communicating with server It does not need: Spell check Real-time character by character collaboration Full playback of editor history I have seen FCKEditor and tinyMce. These editors are way too clunky and complicated.
