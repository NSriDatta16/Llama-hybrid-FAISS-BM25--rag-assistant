Your API appears to be flawed. You should not be returning ResultSets to clients. By doing so, you are forever forcing your clients to rely on a relational database backend. Your data access layer needs to hide all of the details of how your data is actually structured and stored. Instead of returning a ResultSet, consider returning a List or allowing the client to supply a Stream that your data access component can write to. This will make unit tests trivial for the clients of the API and will allow you to swap storage mechanisms at will.
