I found this question in MySQL official forum. It seems that MySQL engineers know the problem but aren't fixing it. http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?22,49710,49710#msg-49710 I'm not sure I'm in the position to negotiate a change in the InnoDB storage engine, however if you ask me as a user and a MySQL developer I'd say: yes, change this as soon as you can. The free space info does not belong in the table comment. .. Mike Lischke, Senior Software Engineer MySQL Developer Tools Oracle Corporation, www.oracle.com .. - some applications will break when we move the info from the comment to Data_free. And users will need to learn a new way to check the free space. Thus, the change can only take place in a new major version.
