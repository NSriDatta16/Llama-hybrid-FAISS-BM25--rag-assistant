According to the Intent doc, you have several intents fired related to USB Storage: ACTION_MEDIA_SHARED Broadcast Action: External media is unmounted because it is being shared via USB mass storage. ACTION_UMS_CONNECTED Broadcast Action: The device has entered USB Mass Storage mode. ACTION_UMS_DISCONNECTED Broadcast Action: The device has exited USB Mass Storage mode. You can write a broadcast receiver to know when the device will be connected via USB. Hope this helped.
