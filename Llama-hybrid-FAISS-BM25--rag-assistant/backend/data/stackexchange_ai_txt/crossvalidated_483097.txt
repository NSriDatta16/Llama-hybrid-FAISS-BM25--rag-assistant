Mixed Joint Probability

In the wikipedia definition they give the example of a logistic regression problem to predict $P(Y=y\,|\,X=x)$ where $Y$ is binary (discrete) and $X$ is a continuous random variable. Then the mixed joint density is: $$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(Y=y\,|\,X=x)f_X(x)$$ How come it is ok to refer to the probability of $X=x$ when $X$ has a continuous density function, i.e., when $P(X=x)=0$ ? Am I missing something here?
