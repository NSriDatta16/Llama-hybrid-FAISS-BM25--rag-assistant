You can calculate difference in days between releases (time between each update) and then use exponential smoothing / arima models / plain average and any other time series technique. Average works according to Central Limit Theorem without assumptions of a distribution, but with an assumption that the process does not change in time. Croston model can be applied directly but I doubt it would be good. Maybe Holt-Winters exponential smoothing on days between releases will give good results. The best is to choose the model separately for each manga based on cross validation or plain validation (reduces time and complexity of code for time series). You can also try calculating only difference of work days. On Kaggle the winning solution of predicting sales for a top-5 retailer in the US had a very complicated manipulation of data based on holidays. ( Walmart winning solution ) Your days will be dependent on number of days in a month. And like on Kaggle you can also use simple models for ensembling multiple models or even as a standalone models before choosing based on validation. The Kaggle solution also contains lots of time-series models that you can try on "days between" data. In Croston the data is called "intermittent demand" but it can have multiple "issues" at one day where you can have only one.
