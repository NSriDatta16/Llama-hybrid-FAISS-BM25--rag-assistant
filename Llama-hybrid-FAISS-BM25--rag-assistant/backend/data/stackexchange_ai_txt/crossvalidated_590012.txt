You are referring to a Best Arm Identification Problem in the Multi-Arm Bandits setting. In this setting, you have a set of arms (one of your 10 predefined strategies) and you aim at identifying the best arm (the best strategy, i.e. the one having the highest yiedls) as fast as possible (i.e. in the smallest possible amount of samples) and with a probability at least equal to $1-\delta$ , for $\delta\in(0,1)$ . There are many algorithms that have been proposed to solve this problem. A provably (asymptotically for $\delta \to 0$ ) optimal algorithm is proposed by Garivier and Kaufmann , but there are plenty of other algorithms (see Audibert et al. or Jamieson et al. ). See also this related question.
