The physics concept which optimization "momentum" maps best to is drag. For example, if $\beta = 1$ , then there is no damping, and you get something very close to the classic laws of motion ( $x_t = x_{t-1} + v\cdot dt, v_t = v_{t-1} + \frac{F}{m} \cdot dt$ ). On the other hand, if $\beta = 0$ , it's as if there's a drag force $F'$ acting in the opposite direction of $v_t$ , just strong enough to "cancel out" the previous velocity, so that $v_t = (v_{t-1} - \frac{F'}{m} dt) + \frac{F}{m} dt = \frac{F}{m} dt $ . Since $F' \propto v_{t-1}$ , it seems appropriate to call this drag, since drag does scale linearly with velocity in many cases.
