A draggable popup control in wpf

I need a draggable popup control in wpf and was wondering if any of your guys could help me out..I did see the following post: Drag WPF Popup control but that isnt how its supposed to work...? When i click and drag it always resets to a specific point and moreover the commenters said that this is not an efficient approach...? Does anyone have any alternatives? Thanks!
