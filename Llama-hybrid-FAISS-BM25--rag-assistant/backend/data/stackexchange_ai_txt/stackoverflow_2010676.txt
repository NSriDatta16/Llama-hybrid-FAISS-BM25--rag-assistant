Be aware that Shark does not work with Java running in 64-bit mode. With OS X 10.6 java runs in 64-bit by default. If you give java the "-d32" flag when it starts, it will run in 32 bit mode. Combine this with the "-agentlib:Shark" flag, and then start Shark. You now should be able to profile your Java program using OS X 10.6 and Shark. If profiling Java in 32-bit mode is acceptable, then this might be of use to you.
