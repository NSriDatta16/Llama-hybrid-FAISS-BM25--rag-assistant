Bayesian approach to removing outliers from a normal distribution

A lot of what I've seen for Bayesian approaches to removing outliers is for a linear model, not a normal distribution. Is there a way we can take a Bayesian approach to remove outliers from a normal distribution? I used Turing to get the means and standard deviations of a theoretical distribution and want to remove outliers by comparing our data set to the model generated by a MCMC. I have been told to avoid Z-scores because they are not Bayesian.
