Newb SQL question: Is there a "foreign key" equivalent for referencing columns, or is it logical to store column names as strings in another table?

Disclaimer: I'm an SQL newb, just discovering the great possibilities of sqlite embedded in applications. I'm designing a small database for an application that primarily handles data storage for plotting. Say I have several instrument data tables (one for each type of instrument) with a column for each data field, such as pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. I would like to join these data tables, pull out the column names, and assign a more human-readable column "description" made available to the user for selecting the independent/dependent variables for plotting. Getting the column names in sqlite is easy enough, but I'm not sure if I should store the resulting names (and longer descriptions) as another table in the db or in a list of some sort in the application. If it were another table in the db, I think I would have to store the column name as a string... unless there is some way to reference a column in SQL? I'm not sure if there is a foreign key equivalent for columns, or if this is just a sign of bad database design needing restructuring. Thanks for any suggestions, stack overflowers.
