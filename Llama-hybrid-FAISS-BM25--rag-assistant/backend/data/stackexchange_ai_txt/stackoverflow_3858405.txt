SQL Server Analysis Services

I have a pending project that may or may not be a good candidate for leveraging SQL Server Analysis Services. The project is based around business metric calculations. Does anyone have some good recommended reading for a crash course in SQL Server Analysis Services that'll let me catch up to speed on what the capabilities and uses are to help me decide if it is worth digging in to further? Thanks
