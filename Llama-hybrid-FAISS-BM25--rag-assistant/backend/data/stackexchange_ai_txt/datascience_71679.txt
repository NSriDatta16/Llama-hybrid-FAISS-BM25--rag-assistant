Change distribution of a vector

I have the following vector my_vector=[0.059; 0.223;0.197;0.176; 0.173; 0.171; 0.0421; 0.209; 0.556;0.252;0.198; 0.255; 0.130; 0.176; 0.110; 0.0845; 0.270; 0.192; 0.199; 0.348] I want to change the vector in such a way that the output derived vector will have the highest possible distribution change. This means the distribution of the two vectors should be highly different (say have large KLD values) but their distribution should be still from the same family (say the F-test or two-sample Kâ€“S test will not reject the hypothesis that they are from the same distribution). How could I generate the new vector from the base vector while I meet the constraint (having "highest" "possible" change in distribution)? I need a machine learning (data-driven) method to achieve such a goal. Thanks in advance for any help and recommendation.
