In XPath/XSLT 1.0, to select a namespace-qualified element by name, you have to use a prefix. In XSLT 2.0, you can use the xpath-default-namespace feature, which allows you to set the default namespace for XPath expressions, so you don't have to use prefixes anymore. See XSLT 2.0: xpath-default-namespace for more details. You can use this attribute on any element in your stylesheet, and it takes effect for all descendant elements unless overridden. (Qualify it with xsl: when you want to put it on a non-XSLT element, i.e. a literal result element.) In XPath 1.0, you can also select elements by local name rather clumsily using, for example, *[local-name() = 'path']/*[local-name() = 'mytag'] . In XPath 2.0, for greater succinctness, you can use namespace wildcards, as in *:path/*:mytag , as described here . This was a somewhat controversial addition, since it seems to encourage and/or justify the same dubious use of namespaces that your system is apparently employing.
