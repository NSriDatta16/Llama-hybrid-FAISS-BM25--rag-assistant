[...] so little time optimizations count. No, they don't. The only true optimisation is the one that helps YOU read and/or write code faster. You should not sacrifice simplicity or readibility for performance - it will slow you down in long run. Passing things by reference can be especially misleading. You may run into weird problems later, when some var will change mysteriously. You modify function input, which is not the way things normally work. Every time you do thing the unusual way you have to remember about them. Your memory and attention is limited though. Computer's is not. Don't overoptimise. Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. -- Brian W. Kernighan UPDATE In this case your whole function escapeCSV is slightly pointless. You should use fputcsv , which is core PHP library written in C, thus is by far faster and memory efficient.
