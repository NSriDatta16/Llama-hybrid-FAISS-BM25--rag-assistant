Make sure that if you use the onCreate you don't count too many starts. If you call onCreate (in stead of something like "onConfigurationChanged") when the device is changed from portrait to landscape, or if someone slides out the keyboard, then you'll get too many 'hits' on your counter! You can find a sharedpreference example here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref And check for calling the oncreate here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html#HandlingTheChange
