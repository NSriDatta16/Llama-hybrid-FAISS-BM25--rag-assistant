CakePHP url path data in with pagination on first search (what am I doing wrong?)

I have a search form. The form values are passed to query and results are displayed as expected. I am using Cakes built in pagination methods. On the initial search, I need the url to reflect the search path values as when I use the sort() or Next >> pagination methods. When I use sort() or Next >>, my url is formatted with the paginator structure like: // pagination to Next page note Page 2 ...plans/search/55/22/1/0/33758/page:2 When I do the first search I get url: ...plans/search/ Here are the appropriate fragments of my search action: function search( ... // query and other action code here unrelated to pagination ... // start of applicable array and pagination code $url = array('controller' => 'plans', 'action' => 'search'); $this->paginate = $options; // $options is my query $this->set('searchdetails', array_merge($url, $searchdetails)); //$searchdetails isi any array of the values entered in the search input boxes. Joining my url and search details. $this->set('plans', $this->paginate('Plan')); I tried to break down the above to ONLY include what is applicable to my problem. NOTE: I am running a default "order" through this action in my query and its working fine, but is not reflected in the url. I need to know how to update the url to reflect the initial search input results. I have ALL of the array data passed to my view just fine. I tried recreating the path with a rather large method I wrote, but it did nothing but complicate my problem... Is there a simple Cake type solution for this? Or is this just not in Cakes cards currently? Please set me straight on this.
