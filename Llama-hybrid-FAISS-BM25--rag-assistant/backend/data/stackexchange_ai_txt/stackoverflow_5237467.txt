Comments appear in the BeautifulSoup parse tree like any other node. For example, to find the comment with the text some comment text and then print out the previous element you could do: from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup, Comment soup = BeautifulSoup(''' paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 ''') def right_comment(e): return isinstance(e, Comment) and e == 'some comment text' e = soup.find(text=right_comment) print e.findPreviousSibling('p') ... that will print out: paragraph 2
