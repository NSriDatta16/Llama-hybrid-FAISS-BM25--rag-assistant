Numerous discussions on the Gibbs sampler for mixtures can be found on this forum: Gibbs Sampling for Gaussian Mixtures Does Label Switching of Mixture model impact the inference of the whole mixture Conditional distribution in this Gaussian Mixture Model Bayesian mixture model joint posterior R packages are available as well https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sBIC/vignettes/GaussianMixtures.pdf https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/vignettes/mixtools.pdf https://rdrr.io/cran/ClusterR/man/GMM.html https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesm/index.html Our book Bayesian Essentials with R (new edition of Bayesian Core ) with Jean-Michel Marin contains a whole chapter on mixture models , with R codes available on my webpage . The first edition of our Monte Carlo Statistical Methods with George Casella also enjoys a full chapter on this topic.
