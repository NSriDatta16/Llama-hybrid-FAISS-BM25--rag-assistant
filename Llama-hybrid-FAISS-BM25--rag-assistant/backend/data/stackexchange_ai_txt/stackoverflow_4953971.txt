How to stop code execution while waiting for Wifi and Bluetooth adapters to enable in Android?

I had to manually turn on the network adapters in my program, and on Android this takes a while for the hardware to power up, up to a second. //turn on network adapters wifiManager.setWifiEnabled(true); bluetoothAdapter.enable(); while(wifiManager.getWifiState()!=WifiManager.WIFI_STATE_ENABLED | bluetoothAdapter.getState!=BluetoothAdapter.STATE_ON) ; //no code here, just waiting for adapters to enable //continue execution getDeviceInfo(); The above method I'm using now is not elegant at all, the CPU is locked-up in the while loop. Any ideas how to implement this in a better way?
