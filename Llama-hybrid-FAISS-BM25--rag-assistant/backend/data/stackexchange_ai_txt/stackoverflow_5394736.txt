Magento URL rewrite option

I want to modify the Catalogsearch of magento. So i followed this inchoo article - http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/advanced-search-in-magento-and-how-to-use-it-in-your-own-way/ and i got it worked. So my url became - www.site.com/catalogsearch/custom/ But instead of this - want the last controller part(/custom/), its parameters should be seo friendly(like /style/Barbera/ instead of ?style=Barbera). So i want something like this. www.site.com/catalogsearch/custom/style/Barbera/year/1980/ and Controller needs to parse this parts style/Barbera/year/1980/ into style=Barbera year = 1980 and should quesy against adavced catalog models. Please is anyone experienced with this custom url rewrite options to the controller with all its parameters. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
