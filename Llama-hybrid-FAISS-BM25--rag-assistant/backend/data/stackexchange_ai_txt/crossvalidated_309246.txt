Firstly, since your series is consists of visits in the form of 1 5 30, therefore applying time-series modeling techniques such as ARIMA, ETS, etc won't be of much use as these require a continuous series to be inputted and their output is a forecast for the very first day of 144th week which is useless in this situation. Secondly, The following are a couple of my suggestions: Generate new features from the data for the number of visits, visits on various days of the week, longest break between two visits, average number of visits per week and much more. Think about the features that may be useful for a human forecaster to make this sort of a prediction! For this kind of a data, It will be better to employ Multinomial Logistic Regression or Neural Network models where the input layer will consist of all the generated attributes and the output layer will be a set of probabilities for the 7 days of the 144th week. The day with the highest probability for each visitor_id will the likeliest day for a future visit in the 144th week.
