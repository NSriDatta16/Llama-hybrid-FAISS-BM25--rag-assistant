embedding dll requirement in program

I am writing a C# Windows application program and I'm using an add-on for creating chart in it,but when I run this program on another windows which has .net framework but not that package it does not work and give me exception. I want to know how can I correct this problem even with setup file? and if the answer is setup file then how should I do that? thank you
