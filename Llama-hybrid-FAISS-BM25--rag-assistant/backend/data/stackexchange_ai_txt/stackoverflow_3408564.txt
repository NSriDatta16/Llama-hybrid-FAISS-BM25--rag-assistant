PChar is a pointer to char, but it receives special support from the compiler to allow pointer arithmetic to make C-like string manipulations easier in Delphi. PByte is just a plain old typed pointer, and does not receive any special attention from the compiler to allow pointer arithmetic. In Delphi 2009, a new compiler directive was introduced ($POINTERMATH ON/OFF) which allows you to add compiler support for pointer arithmetic to your own pointer type declarations.
