My suggestion depends on how much data is missing and why it is missing. But this has nothing to do with PCA, really. If there is very little data missing, then it won't much matter what you do. Replacing with the median isn't ideal, but if there is not much missing, it won't be much different from a better solution. You could try doing PCA with both median replacement and listwise deletion and see if there are major differences in the results. Next, if there is more data missing, you should consider whether it is missing completely at random, missing at random, or not missing at random. I would suggest multiple imputation in the first two cases and some of the time in the third case - unless the data is highly distorted by its NMAR status, I think multiple imputation will be better than listwise deletion (Joe Schafer of Penn State has done a lot of work on missing data - I recall some work of his showing that multiple imputation worked pretty well even in some NMAR cases). However, if the data are MCAR or MAR, the properties of multiple imputation can be proven. If you do decide to go with MI, one note is to be careful because the signs of the components in PCA are arbitrary, and a small change in the data can flip a sign. Then when you do the PCA you will get nonsense. A long time ago I worked out a solution in SAS - it isn't hard, but it's something to be careful about.
