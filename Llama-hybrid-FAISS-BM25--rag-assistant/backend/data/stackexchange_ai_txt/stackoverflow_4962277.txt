Magento: Get customer detail fields before redirecting to payment gateway

I'm currently in the process of attempting to create a Authroize.net SIM payment method which redirects the customer to a secured site to fill out CC info. I'm needing to collect information from the checkout process such as the customer billing and shipping address, total, tax, shipping (and shipping method), and grand total. Were do I obtain these fields?
