Xcode iOS organizer submit to app store yields "The archive is invalid" error

I just switched from Xcode 3 to 4. When I attempt to upload an app that I have archived to the organizer, I receive this error: The archive is invalid. /var/folders/.../app.ipa does not exist. This happens after I log in to itunes connect, select the application to update and select next. I am not sure where to begin trying to figure out what is causing this error. Please let me know if I am leaving out anything that would be useful for diagnosing. Thanks
