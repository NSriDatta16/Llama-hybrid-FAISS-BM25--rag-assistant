It sounds like you're asking why we always solve the dual SVM problem instead of the primal. The answer is regularization. Without the regularization term, the primal QP would have $k + 1$ variables and $N$ inequality constraints, where as the dual QP would have $N$ variables, $N$ inequality constraints and $1$ equality constraint. So you're correct that it should be faster to solve the primal QP, assuming $k However , once you add the regularization term, this is no longer true. With the regularization term, the primal QP has $N + k + 1$ variables and $2N$ inequality constraints but the dual QP has $N$ variables, 1 equality constraint and $2N$ inequality constraints. Moreover, those $2N$ inequality constraints are actually box constraints on the variables, so only half can ever be active at the solution.
