rails escape_javascript in .net

For rails developer please check my last paragraph. Is there an equivalent of escape_javascript in rails for .net specifically .net mvc2? I am going to return some JavaScript which needs to be escaped since I am getting the code from another view using RenderPartialViewToString http://craftycodeblog.com/2010/05/15/asp-net-mvc-render-partial-view-to-string/ You can see what escape_javascript does here Why escape_javascript before rendering a partial? if your not familiar with its functionality. Rails developers: It feels like this function should be easy to implement or port for rails so can someone explain what it does more than just escaping qoutes?
