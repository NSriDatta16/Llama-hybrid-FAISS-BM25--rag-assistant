To add some information to my own question, I could imagine that the predictor $X$ is length, and response $Y$ is weight. In this case, length perfectly predicts the average weight. However, the random error at each length is high. We could imagine a second predictor Country {Asia, Europe, America...} and it satisfies that at a given length, people from Europe or America has averagely a higher weight than people from Asia. Therefore, by adding this extra variable, we could stratify the current model into two models (Europe+America vs. Asia), and each model with smaller random error. So my suggestion is that when we judge how good the model is, we should not only look at the p-value and CI for the fitted variables included in the model, but we should also look at how much variance was actually explained by the model (e.g. R_square) (in this case the $R^{2}$ might not be very informative due to the replicates at given x). Adding more predictors could further decrease the random error in the model.
