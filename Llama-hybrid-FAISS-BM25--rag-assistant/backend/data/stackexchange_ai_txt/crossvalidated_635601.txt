This explanation is taken from Andrew Ng's Coursera course "Machine Learning Specialization": SparseCategoricalCrossentropy : Expects the target to be an int corresponding to the index. For example, if there are 10 potential target values, y would be between 0 and 9. CategoricalCrossentropy : Expects the target value of an example to be one-hot encoded where the value at the target index is 1, which the other N-1 entries are 0. An example with 10 potential target values, where the target is 2 would be [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].
