If you want some solid advice I'd recommend buying Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries which gives you all you need to know from the actual framework design team. ...the goal when naming namespaces is creating sufficient clarity for the programmer using the framework to immediately know what the content of the namespace is likely to be... .( | )[. ][. ] And importantly Do not use the same name for a namespace and a type in that namespace Fragmenting every 1/2 types into namespaces would not meet the first requirement as you would have a swamp of namespaces that would have to be qualified or used, if you followed the Visual Studio way. For example Core - Domain - Users - Permissions - Accounts Would you create MyCompany.Core.Domain.Users MyCompany.Core.Domain.Permissions MyCompany.Core.Domain.Accounts or just MyCompany.Core.Domain For Visual Studio's way it would be the former. Also if you use lowercase file/folder naming you're looking at renaming the class each time, as well as making one big namespace tangle. Most of it is common sense and really down to how you would expect to see the namespaces organised if you were a consumer of your own API or framework.
