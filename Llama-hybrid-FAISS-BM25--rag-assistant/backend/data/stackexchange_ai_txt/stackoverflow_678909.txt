Yes, ideally GetHashCode() should return the same value for the same data, but there are a lot of classes in the .NET framework that rely on the default behavior of having different values for different references. That being said, GetHashCode() returning the same value should NOT be used as an indicator of equality on any class. This function is designed to assist in in-memory storage of hashtable (and similar) structures, where there is use for an approximate equality or close value function. In your case, your only real option is to write your own. If this is for use in something like an IDictionary, then you'll need to just create a concrete class that implements the IEqualityComparer interface. In short, there is no general, one-size-fits-all method of determining data equality on a reference type, as the meaning can (and will) change for various types.
