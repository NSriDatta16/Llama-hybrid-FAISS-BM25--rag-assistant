I don't see the problem with embedding Python with, for example, Boost.Python. You'll get everything you ask for: It will be embedded, and it will be an interpreter (with enough access to implement auto-completion and such) You can create a new interpreter per-script and have completely separated python environments ... and as transparent as it's possible I mean, you'll still have to expose and implement an API, but 1) this is a good thing, 2) Blender does it too and 3) I really can't think of another way that leverages you from this work... PS: I have little experience with Python / Boost.Python but have worked extensively with Lua / LuaBind, which is kinda the same
