Trying to calculate industry averages for female employees

I have a dataset that lists employers in a particular industry, the number of employees they have and the breakdown of employees as male or female. I'm trying to get a number that reveals something about the industry's percentage of female employees - and that we can use as a comparison to gauge the diversity of specific employers or specific subsets of employers in the dataset. What's the best way to do this? Do I total all the female employees in this dataset and divide by the total employees in the dataset to get a percentage? (for example = 33% of workers in this dataset/industry are female) Or do I take an average of the percentages of female employees from all the companies across the dataset? (So, for example, if company A has 22% female employees, company B has 36% female employees, and company C has 40 % female employees - the average of the percentages is 33%) Ideally, I want to get a number that creates an illuminating comparison. So if company A has 22% female employees - I want to be able to show how they measure up.
