My own rule of thumb here is: Always keep data in a native datatype. This helps comparing, sorting, finding and grouping - especially in a database - and makes your storage less prone to query errors. Moreover, you're not required to use another predicate ( AND isdate ) when accessing the data. Hence, I think your approach is correct. Your colleague's approach seems not to be a matter of high education, but one of a personal approach. I've seen workers with PhD who could well listen to a well-reasoned argument, and freshmen who made grave mistakes and would not listen to a polite advice.
