Testing is absolutly necessary. What must be consitent too is the implementation. If you implement something in a way that have not been in your tests... it's there that the problem may happen. Problem may also happen when the data you test against is not related to the data that is going to be flowing through your application. So Yes, code coverage is necessary. But not as much as real test performed by real person.
