How to display categories and end-less sub categories using PHP & MySQL?

I was wondering what is the best way to display 100's of categories using PHP & MySQL? For example, it would not be wise to create a folder for each category or sub category. And how would I create my php page to display categories and end-less sub categories? And how would my url look like exactly for example with multiple sub categories? http://www.example.com/a/b/c/d/e Would it look like something like? http://www.example.com/cat? How would my database look like? Here is how my MySQL databse looks like what should i add or remove? CREATE TABLE categories ( id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, parent_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, category TEXT NOT NULL, url TEXT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX parent (parent_id) ); a good tutorial or a detail example would help out a lot.
