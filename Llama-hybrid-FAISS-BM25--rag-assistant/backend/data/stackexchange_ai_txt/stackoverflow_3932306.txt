Using git-svn without appending git-svn-id

Can I use git-svn without having the git-svn-id: entries appended to my commit message? I have found the svn.noMetadata option comes with a warning (emphasis mine): This gets rid of the git-svn-id: lines at the end of every commit. If you lose your .git/svn/git-svn/.rev_db file , git svn will not be able to rebuild it and you won't be able to fetch again, either. This is fine for one-shot imports. The git svn log command will not work on repositories using this, either. Using this conflicts with the useSvmProps option for (hopefully) obvious reasons. Is there a danger of data corruption by just relying on the .rev_db file or is the warning just placed to signal that there is the danger of losing the mapping?
