The standard approach (in microeconomics) is to model agents as maximizing (subjective) expected utility. Depending on the utility function, they will then choose differently. The expected utility for the two options in this example is (w=wealth, c1= first option, c2=second option, u(.) a utility function): E_c1[ u(w) ] = u(w+10000-500) E_c2[ u(w) ] = 0.5*u(w+25000-500)+0.5*u(w-500) Whichever is greater is what the agent would choose..it depends on the utility function. There are many you could choose from (but they need to satisfy certain properties, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem ). In general they are classified into risk neutral, risk averse and risk loving for linear, concave and convex utility functions respectively. How risk averse/risk loving an agent is depends on how concave/convex the utility function is. An intuitive measure of risk aversion is actually how expected profit you'd be willing to give up to secure a sure thing, if you opt for the first choice here, that would be 2500. In the econ jargon that's your "certainty equivalent" of the lottery u2. If the certainty equivalent is less than the expected value, you're risk averse.
