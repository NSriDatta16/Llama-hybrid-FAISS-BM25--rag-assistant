I'm not sure for which property you need the confidence interval, but here we go: In case you need confidence intervals for the validation results (i.e. classifier has accuracy of p ± Δp), for proportions you can calculate binomial confidence intervals. In case you ask about confidence intervals for the predictions: For an ensemble voting class labels (random forest), you could construct similar intervals for the proportion of trees that voted for the class which is predicted. You could also do something like bolstered error estimation : perturb your input data and measure the distribution of predictions to which the perturbed input is mapped. You'd need to have a good idea of the noise structure on your input, though.
