When should you call it PCoA vs. PCA

I'm reviewing a paper. In it the authors use a genetic distance metric to created a distance matrix between subjects, then they run classic MDS on this distance matrix. Throughout the MS they call this a principal components analysis (PCA). I was trained to call this principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) or classic Torgerson's multidimensional scaling. Can anyone clarify which terms are correct, and if more than one, which is preferred?
