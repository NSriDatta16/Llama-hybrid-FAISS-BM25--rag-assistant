It's not particularly elegant as I just threw it together, but I guess this is pretty much what you need? You just want to keep trying your requests until you get a "ActionNotTakenFileUnavailable", so you know your filename is good, then just upload it. string destination = "ftp://something.com/"; string file = "test.jpg"; string extention = Path.GetExtension(file); string fileName = file.Remove(file.Length - extention.Length); string fileNameCopy = fileName; int attempt = 1; while (!CheckFileExists(GetRequest(destination + "//" + fileNameCopy + extention))) { fileNameCopy = fileName + " (" + attempt.ToString() + ")"; attempt++; } // do your upload, we've got a name that's OK } private static FtpWebRequest GetRequest(string uriString) { var request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(uriString); request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("", ""); request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.GetFileSize; return request; } private static bool checkFileExists(WebRequest request) { try { request.GetResponse(); return true; } catch { return false; } } Edit: Updated so this will work for any type of web request and is a little slimmer.
