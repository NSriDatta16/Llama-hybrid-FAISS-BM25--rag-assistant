How to implement onBackPressed() in Fragments?

Is there a way in which we can implement onBackPressed() in Android Fragment similar to the way in which we implement in Android Activity? As the Fragment lifecycle do not have onBackPressed() . Is there any other alternative method to over ride onBackPressed() in Android 3.0 fragments?
