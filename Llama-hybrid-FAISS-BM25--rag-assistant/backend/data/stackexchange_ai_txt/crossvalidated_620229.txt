Rank Neurons Importance of the latent space of an Autoencoder using PCA

I am trying to extract only the important neurons from the latent space of an Autoencoder to be converted later to a pattern for a model pattern recognizer. PCA Loadings helps in finding the highest correlation coefficient on the neurons of the latent space. Thus, the output of the PCA is not used, only the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to extract which neurons correlate more to the highest eigenvalues and pick only those neurons. For Example, Cifar-10 dataset. Extracting the latent Space of the Autoencoder. Then do PCA and extract the loadings. Pick only the neurons with high correlation to the principal components, with explained variance above 90%. My Questions: Before doing PCA on the latent space, do/do not normalize the data? Is this approach of employing PCA wrong to start with? There are multiple PCA variations like SparsePCA, KernelPCA, and RobustPCA. Is one of variation might be more beneficial for this task?
