1) You can try to use delegation instead of inheritance, as described here . 2) Also, some documentation (including the link above) seems to imply that the problem with the multiple inheritance is because of pseudohashes. Perl 5.10 changed the implementation of "fields" pragma to something other than pseudohashes - if it's an option, try the approach you used in Perl5.10 and it just might work (I don't have acces to 5.10 so can't experiment, sorry) P.S. Regarding "I can find no documentation about this whatsoever..." - at least one mention of this in "official" documentation is a quote from the Camel book ("Programming Perl", O'Reilly's Perl series), 3rd Edition, chapter 31.3. "use base": "Multiple inheritance of field classes is not supported. The use base pragma raises an exception if more than one named base class has fields."
