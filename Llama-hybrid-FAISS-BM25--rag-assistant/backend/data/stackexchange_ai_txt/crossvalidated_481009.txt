Propensity score estimation with a variable that has more than 2 levels

Imagine in this tutorial variable catholic had 3 levels ( 0 = not Catholic, 1 = semi-catholic, 2 = fully Catholic ) instead of 2 levels that are shown in the tutorial . Under this new condition, how could we estimate propensity scores for matching purposes ( not a logistic regression for sure )?
