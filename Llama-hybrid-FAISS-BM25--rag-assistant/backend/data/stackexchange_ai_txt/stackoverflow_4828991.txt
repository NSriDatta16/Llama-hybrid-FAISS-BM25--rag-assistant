Below is an sample query and the expected output: Strvalue = " 1=1 AND fSPRNumber LIKE "%"12"%" AND rRequestedFor.rOrganization.fName LIKE "%"abcd"%"" Expected: All the values within the double quotes, after the LIKE, to be extracted and then processed. E.g.: "%"12"%" "%"abcd"%"" I should be able to do this for any number of AND and/or LIKE clauses in the query. Also, suggest if there is simpler way of doing it.
