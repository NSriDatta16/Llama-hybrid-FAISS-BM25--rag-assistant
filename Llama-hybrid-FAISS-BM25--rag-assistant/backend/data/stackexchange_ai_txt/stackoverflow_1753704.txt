The WCAG says "Make web pages appear and operate in consistent ways," and goes on to describe how a change of context should only be initiated by a user request or it should be easily disabled. In HTML4 and in HTML5 , the process by which a link opens in a new window is described, and in both cases user agents may suppress this if so configured by the user. However, these are really descriptions of mechanism — when the browser should and shouldn't open a window — not policy.
