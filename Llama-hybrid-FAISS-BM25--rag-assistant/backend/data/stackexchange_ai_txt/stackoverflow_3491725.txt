I don't see any especial difficulties with your second version. The first version has an FType column in the Organisations table and the Landlords table, which doesn't seem to be necessary as it will be the same for all rows. Having multiple versions of each entry in the same table, with the latest end date as NULL for the current version also seems fine; you could create a view 'Current_Landlords' where only the current row is displayed; such a view would be updatable. Some indexes might be necessary to help it out.
