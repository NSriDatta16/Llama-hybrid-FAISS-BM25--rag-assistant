You can look up Silhouette widths. These are indices of cluster validity, and can help you identify which data points have a poor fit, or which clusters are less cohesive. They also give out a silhouette plot, which is basically the silhouette widths for all data points. There are several different indices available for cluster validity. If you are conversant with R, lookup the package cluster , cluseval (not sure of the capitalization here). You can visualize using PCA. You can plot what is called a Biplot ( BiplotGUI in R) or a MDS plot, and assign say different colours to data points belonging to different clusters to get a rough visualization of the cluster. But these are not very robust methods, since a lot of information is lost in dimensionality reduction.
