NUnit provides you with a framework for unit testing: i.e. testing your code in discrete "units" so that you can, amongst other things, be aware when new changes break existing code, or that you have provided a certain level of code coverage. But it does not provide performance testing per se. For that, you will need another type of tool. If you have a webapp, you might like to take a look at The Grinder or others to be found here: http://www.opensourcetesting.org/performance.php
