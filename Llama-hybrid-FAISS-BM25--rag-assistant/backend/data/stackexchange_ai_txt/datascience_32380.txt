In general, features are engineered so as to retain optimum relevant information present in the dataset with succinct representation and then features are adapted so that an algorithm can accept it as input. Feature engineering generally involves methods like binning, PCA, etc. Adapting those features to pass to algorithm is another step which is a very small part of the feature engineering step. Adapting example: for an image, we may have to reshape the image like below so that x[0] points to the image x = image.img_to_array(img) normalise(x) // feature engineering x = x.reshape((1,) + x.shape) // Adapting for algorithm With this understanding, if features are generated once for a dataset, it may be used for any relevant algorithm with corresponding adaption.
