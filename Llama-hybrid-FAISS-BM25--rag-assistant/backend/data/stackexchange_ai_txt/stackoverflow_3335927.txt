ReportLab does not text wrapping out of the box, so I am assuming you are either using a para in the table cells, or you are breaking your lines manually with simpleSplit. If you text is one line string then you can use from reportlab.pdfbase.pdfmetrics import stringWidth textWidth = stringWidth(text, fontName, fontSize) If your text was multi-lines, assuming you are working in a rectangular area with defined width, then do from reportlab.lib.utils import simpleSplit lines = simpleSplit(text, fontName, fontSize, maxWidth) lines is a list of all the lines of your paragraph, if you know the line spacing value then the height of the paragraph can be calculated as lineSpacing*len(lines) If this proved to be longer than your page then using whatever template you are in (preppy, django, ninja, etc) finds a good breaking point for your text and ends the current row and starts a new one. I hope this helps Meitham p.s. you could always send your questions to the reportlab mailing list and they usually very quick in answering these questions.
