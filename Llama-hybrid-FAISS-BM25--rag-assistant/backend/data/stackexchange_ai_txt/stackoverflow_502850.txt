Usually a clever implementation of B-Trees From the above linked wikipedia article: A B-tree of order m (the maximum number of children for each node) is a tree which satisfies the following properties: Every node has at most m children. Every node (except root and leaves) has at least m⁄2 children. The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node. All leaves appear in the same level, and carry information. A non-leaf node with k children contains k–1 keys The advantages of which are that data can be accessed in logarithmic time, as with most search trees (such as standard binary trees), but the timing properties are better in the average case.
