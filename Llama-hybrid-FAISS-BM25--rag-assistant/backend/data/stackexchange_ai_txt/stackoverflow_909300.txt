Maybe you could consider persisting the individual objects (rather than persisting the collection as one big block). If so, you might want to use the NFileStorage project I created on codeplex; nfilestorage.codeplex.com (this one is not specifically made for the CF, so cannot tell if its compatible with that one)... Good luck, Gert-Jan
