As you do not mention training data in your question, I assume none exists. Thus I suggest to investigate word embedding such as GloVe . Note that this is just an example, there might be other, more up to date or better fitting word embeddings. Given such a word embedding, you could then compute the distance between one keyword / tag to another (the query keywords) and use the distance to identify the closest match.
