C++ Elegant solution to partition problem

I would like to see the most elegant STL like extension to the partition algorithm in the STL: given a vector of ints, partition the vector so that the positive integers appear to the front of the negative integers AND return a map where map[i]=j means that integer at index i is now at j. Obviously the first part (without the second requirement) is something like partititon(vec.begin(), vec.end(), IsEven) I can't see a way to do this without actually reimplementing partition and building the map along the way.
