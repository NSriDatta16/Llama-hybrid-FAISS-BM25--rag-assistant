In ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE-Should we distinguish between independent and dependent variables?

Do we need to differentiate which variable is independent or dependent when doing univariate analysis of variance to test whether the means are equal or not? Because, according to my understanding, the ANOVA test can be performed when the group variable is deemed an independent variable. My colleague believes that as long as we have one continuous and one categorical variable, we can conduct an ANOVA to determine whether the means around the levels of group/categorical variable are statistically distinct. From my perspective, however, we must ensure that the group variable or categorical variable is independent variable. For example, if one variable is Cholesterol and the other one is BMI levels, then as clinically the Cholesterol can affect BMI levels, so ANOVA can not be conducted here and simple logistic regression should be employed instead. Please give me some suggestions.
