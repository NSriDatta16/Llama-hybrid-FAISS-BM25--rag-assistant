What are approaches to, accuracy and value of forecasting in/for highly volatile environments?

More details in my Quora question here: http://qr.ae/x4s5Z . Please note that this question is not about value , approaches and methods of forecasting in general, but specifically about forecasting in/for highly volatile environments , such as financial market and economy, in general. Moreover, I'm curious about sense and value of highly ambiguous (inaccurate) forecasts, as illustrated by the TSLA stock price forecast chart, presented in my question. I'm less interested in financial aspect of this, but much more in data science aspect, hence posting this question to the Cross Validated site. Thank you!
