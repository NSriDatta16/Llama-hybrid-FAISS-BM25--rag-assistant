The standard error is just the standard deviation of the parameter samples, but you may want to make sure that's what you want to use. Since you're conducting Bayesian analysis you shouldn't do classical hypothesis testing with your results (since those tests are meaningless in this context). Instead, use the sample of parameters to perform Bayesian hypothesis testing, which is actually much easier and more intuitive. As an example, if you're wanting to find the probability a parameter $\theta$ is positive (i.e., $\Pr(\theta>0|D)$), simply calculate $$\frac1N \sum_{i=1}^N I(\theta^{[i]} > 0),$$ where $N$ is the number of sampling iterations, $\theta^{[i]}$ is the $i$th sample of $\theta$, and $I$ is an indicator function. In R, this is equivalent to sum(theta > 0) / N . This is one of the main benefits of Bayesian analysis (which comes at the "cost" of needing to specify priors over variables). Rather than relying on asymptotic distributions of parameters to perform hypothesis tests that may not be a good approximation, you estimate the actual distributions of parameters (which depend on prior assumptions and the data) and use those to conduct inference directly.
