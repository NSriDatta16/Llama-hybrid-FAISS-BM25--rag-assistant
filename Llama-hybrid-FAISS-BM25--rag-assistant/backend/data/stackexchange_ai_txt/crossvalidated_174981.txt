What should I do when logistic regression model doesn't perform well on test sample?

For logistic model, I divided dataset into two parts training sample (70% of 360 data point (observation)) and test sample (rest 30% of 360) randomly. After that I built logistic model on training sample and area under curve(AUC) is coming around 82% and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test is also throwing the positive result (H0 accepted p-value = .675) with 11 variables out of 67 but same model when I checked on test sample i found AUC around 71% and HL test showing positive result. Could you please tell me what will be reason behind the AUC drop form 82% to 71% ? and what will be the solution for this?
