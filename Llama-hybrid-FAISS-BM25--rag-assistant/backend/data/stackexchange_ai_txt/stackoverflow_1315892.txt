Trying to run a simple app with UITextField - Simulator is crashing

I have two UITextFields in the App as IBOutlets and I have made a connection from File's Owner to these ... When I run Build and Go, the iphone simulator crashes ... and in the console (after debugging) ... its showing me following ... 2009-08-22 18:11:40.869 Control_Fun[1138:20b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '-[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] loaded the "Control_FunViewController" nib but the view outlet was not set.' However, I am not having any outlet (IBOutlet) explicitly defined as view ... is this something hidden? When I Control Click File's Owner and drag it to the UITextFields, it giving me three options in the gray pop-up menu to connect to 1. nameField (declared as IBOutlet property in the header file) 2. numberField (declared as IBOutlet property in the header file) 3. view (where is this coming from?) Thanks
