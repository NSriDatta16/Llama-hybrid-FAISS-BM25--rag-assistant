There is no standard way of loading a CSV file in vanilla XQuery 1.0, although most implementations have an unparsed-text function or similar. If not the contents of the file can be passed in as a parameter. The CSV file can be parsed using the tokenize function: declare variable $names = tokenize(unparsed-text("banned.csv"), ",") And the actual query is quite straightforward. Assuming your document is a a fragment containing just a list of nodes then the query is simply doc("users.xml")/user[not(name=$names)] If however the XML file contains a lot of other data then you may find XSLT's templating facilities more useful.
