Getting stats on cookieless session page using VS2008 load testing feature

I'm load testing a web page using visual studio load testing tool, but I have problems displaying results. The problem is cookieless session. Everytime new user comes to a page, page URLL changes and I'm not able to calculate average page response time. What can be done about it?
