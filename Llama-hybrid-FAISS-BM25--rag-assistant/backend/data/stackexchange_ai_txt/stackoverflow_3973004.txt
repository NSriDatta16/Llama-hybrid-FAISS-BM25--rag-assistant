You could Google Maps' My Maps to actually find the closest store. Create an account with Google, use their API to upload your stores, and then you a) geocode the address the user enters b) do a spatial search inside your map c) you will get a JSON response that contains the stores that satisfy your search criteria Google has a paragraph about how no more than 2,500 geocoding requests should be made in a day from one account. So an alternative might be using the Yahoo Maps API for geocoding. It is not quite as smart as Google's, but their daily request limit is much higher.
