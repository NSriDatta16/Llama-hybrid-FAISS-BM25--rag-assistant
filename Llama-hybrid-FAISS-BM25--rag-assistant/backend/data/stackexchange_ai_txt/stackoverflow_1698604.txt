Is there a 1-to-1 ratio of motionBegan and motionEnded events?

I'm implementing shake gestures as described in this answer however if I shake my phone for longer than a second, motionEnded doesn't get called. Is there not a 1-to-1 ratio of motionBegan and motionEnded events guaranteed by the OS, or is this a problem with the responder chain and events are getting sent elsewhere?
