Is it possible to have a default class in multi class classification?

In the general text classification problem, training a machine learning model to detect if a text belongs to one of N number of classes always yields a value in N. Even if the text that was passed to the model is very far outside any of the N classes (like say you trained it on categories for movie genres, but someone passed a recipe to the classifier), it will always choose one of N as the output even though the text passed to it doesn't belong to any of the classes. Is there a method to have an additional class for 'unknown' so that if the model output is one of the N types but matches it with very low probability then assign it to the default or unknown class? EDIT: we are using LinearSVC from sci kit learn
