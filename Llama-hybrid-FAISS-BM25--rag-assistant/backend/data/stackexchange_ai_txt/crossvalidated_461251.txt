Say, initially, each person passes the virus on to two new people (this is an extreme simplification, not everybody passes the virus on to the same amount of people, but it is how the simple SIR model works works). That is $R_0 = 2$ Then the number of cases grows for each new generation like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. However the number 1.15 that you refer to is the growth in time . Those increase in cases per generation 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 may happen slowly or fast. They can be the same $R_0$ but different grow rates. The initial grow rate relates to $\beta - \gamma$ and the reproduction number relates to $\frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ . (Note that if the grow rate is positive then the reproduction rate is above 1.) For example, the reproduction rate for HIV/aids may be between 2 or 5. However, it is not like the reproduction occurs at a daily frequency and instead it may take months or years before an infected person get's to infect those 2 to 5 other people. For a disease like the common cold, flu or sars, the reproduction may be between 2 or 5 as well, but now it will take about the order of a week that a person infects those 2 to 5 other people. In the (average) time period that somebody is infectious $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ there will (initally) be $R_0$ newly people infected and $1$ person recovered. So the growth rate (the exponent) will be: $$K = \frac{R_0-1}{1/\gamma} = \beta - \gamma$$ Then the (initial) growth is like $e^{Kt}$ and in one day you get an increase of $e^{\beta-\gamma}$
