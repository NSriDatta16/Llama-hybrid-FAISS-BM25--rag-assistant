Given an irreducible Markov Chain. Prove you can reach any pair of states in $N$ steps with greater than 0 probability

Question: Given an irreducible Markov Chain. Prove you can reach any pair of states in $N$ steps with greater than 0 probability So essentially given any pair of states a start state and end state in the Markov Chain that's irreducible it's possible to reach the end state from the start state in $N$ steps with probability greater than 0 where $N$ is a number of steps where you can get from any start state in the Markov Chain to the end state in the Markov Chain with probability greater than 0. $N$ should be independent of the states of the chain s.t. the probability of getting from a start state to and end state has a probability > 0 within $N$ steps The definition of irreducible Markov Chain can be found here .
