jQuery treeview with sortable

I was just wondering if anyone knows of any way to get the bassistance treeview plugin to work with jQuery UI's sortable plugin? Particularly in terms of being able to drag and drop the element from it's nested ul to the parent ul or vice versa. Two other requirements are that I have the ability to prevent dropping onto specified elements (for example: element with class="no-drop"), and the ability to reference a function after the drop event. If there is no real feasible way of doing this with those plugins, does anyone happen to know of another plugin? Kind Regards, Remy
