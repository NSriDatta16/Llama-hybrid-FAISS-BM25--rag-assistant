Update Field based on another table's values

Is there a more elegant way to write the following Microsoft SQL Server 2008 command? UPDATE TableB SET TableBField2=0 WHERE TableBID IN( SELECT TableBID FROM TableB JOIN TableA on TableB.TableAID=TableA.TableAID WHERE TableBField2 In plain speak, what I'm doing is updating a table based on the value of a field in a joined table. I wonder if my use of IN() is considered inefficient.
