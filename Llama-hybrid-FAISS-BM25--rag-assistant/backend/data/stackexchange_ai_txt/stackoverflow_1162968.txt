The distinction seems to be dependent upon what, exacty, is being unarchived the View or the ViewController. So if the ViewController is being instantiated and pushed then I should only expect viewDidLoad to be called? and on the other hand if my ViewController has an IBOutlet (and an object VC object representing it that has been dragged into my Nib) then I can expect initWithCoder and awakeFromNib to both get called? This is where you're going astray. It's not whether or not the ViewController has an IBOutlet. It's whether or not the ViewController is instantiated in a NIB that determines if -awakeFromNIB is called. From your description, I take it somewhere in your code you have something like this: MyViewController *vc = [[MyViewController alloc] init]; // (or initWithNibName:bundle:) [navController pushViewController:vc animated:YES]; [vc release]; If so, then the NIB is not instantiating MyViewController. Your code is. As so -awakeFromNib is not going to be called. You're not awoken from a NIB. What you may have meant to do is to expand the Navigation Controller in your NIB (switch to the list-view; the middle button in the View Mode set of buttons in the upper left). There you'll see the root View Controller. By default it's a UIViewController. If you wanted the root controller to be MyViewController, you should change its class. In that case you'd get an -awakeFromNib call because it would be the NIB that created this object. You should then of course get rid of any code that's also instantiating it and putting it on the NavController.
