Say you retrieve a Car from the webservice. You can store it in a WebserviceCar, which has a property car. Now, if you want to store that Car in the database, put it in a DatabaseCar, which also has a property car. If you want to put it in Salesforce, put it in a SalesforceCar object, which has a property car. This way, you have one object which has the common fields and several objects which have storage-specific information.
