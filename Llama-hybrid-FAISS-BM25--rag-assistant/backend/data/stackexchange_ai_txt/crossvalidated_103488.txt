While I second Hastie et al.s ESL. They do assume some statistical background. Like the OP, I had absolutely no background in statistics and that made some parts of the their discussion on SVMs difficult (especially the bit on tying it with some sort of regularized logistic regression). A much simpler option is James et als. Introduction to Statistical Learning . This is a simplified version of ESL. The best thing about the book, however, is that it is a very good and rapid introduction to R. I have found the relevant lecture notes in the following MIT-OCW a good launching pad to understanding SVMs: Prediction: Machine Learning and Statistics. Though, unforunately, this too assumes some basic statistical knowledge. It also assumes some mathematics background.
