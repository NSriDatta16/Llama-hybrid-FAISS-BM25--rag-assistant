Assuming you haven't modified a before calling test() , a has a value of zero, because objects with static storage duration are zero-initialized when the program starts. d[0] has a value of zero, because the constructor invoked by std::vector d(1) has a second parameter that takes a default argument; that second argument is copied into all of the elements of the vector being constructed. The default argument is T() , so your code is equivalent to: std::vector d(1, int()); You are correct that b has an indeterminate value. f.a and *c both have indeterminate values as well. To value initialize them (which for POD types is the same as zero initialization), you can use: Foo f = Foo(); // You could also use Foo f((Foo())) int* c = new int(); // Note the parentheses
