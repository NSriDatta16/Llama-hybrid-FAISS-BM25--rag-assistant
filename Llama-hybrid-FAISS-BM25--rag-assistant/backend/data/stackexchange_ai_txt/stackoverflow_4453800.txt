your GettingStarted model doesn't have to inherit from ActiveRecord::Base but it does, you are getting error because Base is expecting a table in your db called GettingStarteds, or something. If you want to keep the content dynamic, meaning saving it in the db so you can change it, then you are pretty close, you could use a natural language model like 'steps' and the steps have an order associated with them, then you can look up the step based on its order in the getting started controller. you can also use a vanilla workflow with a steps controller, and then rename the route in the routes with the :as => option if the steps are static you might want to explore some of the static page model libraries available like high voltage https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage
