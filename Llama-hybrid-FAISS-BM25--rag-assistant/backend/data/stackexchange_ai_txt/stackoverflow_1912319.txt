iPhone OS debuted shortly before Leopard, and it has been Objective-C 2.0 from the get-go. Aside from the lack of Garbage Collection on iPhone, the key difference is that the Objective-C runtime on iPhone is always Modern Runtime, as opposed to the Legacy Runtime for 32-bit Mac apps. ( See this Apple doc .) One of the important results of this distinction is that instance variables are non-fragile (meaning that when you change the instance variables of a class, you don't have to recompile its subclasses) and it can synthesize variables for properties.
