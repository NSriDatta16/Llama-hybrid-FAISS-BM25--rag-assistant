Dragging with inertia in AS3 for dummies

I'm trying to create an inertia effect for dragging that's constricted to the x axis. I know this questions was asked before here but I couldn't understand the answer! I'm currently using startDrag and stopDrag. I'm assuming I should add something to the startDrag function that captures the speed in which the user is moving the mouse, but I'm not sure how this is done. I guess then I'd add something to the stopDrag function that kicks in and makes the object keep moving at that speed and then come to a stop. Any suggestions?
