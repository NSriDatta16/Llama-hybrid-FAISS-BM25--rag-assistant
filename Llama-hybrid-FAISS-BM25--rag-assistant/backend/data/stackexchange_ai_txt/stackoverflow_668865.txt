As derobert said, on Unixy systems it's often not the end user who installs the software, so asking for the installer/admin to agree to the license may not be what you want (depends on the purpose of the software and the license text, I guess). Click-through (or shrinkwrap which is slightly different but essentially the same principle) licenses have been a point of contention for years, as while there is an 'acceptance' by the user it's hard to prove that it was the user who accepted the license, and that the user actually read what was presented to them before using the software. Take for example getting your lcoal mom+pop computer repair store to install/upgrade Windows; they usually click through the license pages so they can install all the other crap software they bundle onto the PC and the actual owner doesn't get a chance to read or agree to the license. It's worth looking up the legality of that type of license in your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the users you intend to target. I wouldn't rely on package management to do this for you either. I'd definitely have it as part of your application code. You could get a post install script for pretty much any package manager to run the click-through program if needed, but I think it's better to run it as a per-user thing.
