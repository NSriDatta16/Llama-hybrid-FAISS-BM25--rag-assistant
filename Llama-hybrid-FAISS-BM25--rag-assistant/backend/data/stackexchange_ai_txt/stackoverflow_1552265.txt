This is very easily done in WPF: Set WindowStyle="None" on the Window (note: this is required, you cannot have Transparency and the standard windows chrome) Set AllowsTransparency="True" on the Window Set a Background on the Window using a brush with transparency, such as Background="#AAFFFFFF" Here's a quick sample: Hello World! Now obviously, since you've disabled the standard Windows chrome, you will need to supply your own button to close/minimize/maximize/drag the window. You can do this pretty easily yourself or you could look into purchasing something like Blendables which comes with a "Chromeless Window" control that you could use.
