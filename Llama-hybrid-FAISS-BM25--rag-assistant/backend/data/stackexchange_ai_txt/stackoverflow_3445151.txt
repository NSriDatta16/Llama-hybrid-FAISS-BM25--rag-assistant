How can I highlight every single word in jquery so that I can provide a definition for each word?

What I am trying to do is allow the user to scroll over any word on a web page and when the mouse goes over the word it is highlighted (I know I can use hover for that). However I do not know how to select individual words, from the paragraph. The ultimate goal is to allow the user to click on the word and a definition appears over the word, but I think I can figure that out once I can hover over individual words.
