From doing some more digging, I found out the answer to my own question. When you create a View Based Application, you'll notice that if you double-click the MainWindow.xib, one of the objects in the Document Window is a View Controller which is already connected to the [ProjectName]ViewController class (a class which was automatically created when you selected the View Based Application). Hence, by dragging in a View Controller from the Library to the Document Window in MainWindow.xib, you are in essence INSTANTIATING that object (although it's archived in the nib file). Therefore, there is no need to instantiate it manually in the application delegate. Simply add that view controllers' view to the window and you're done.
