It is not true that Gaussian state space models (GSSM) are unindentifiable. First, inference on GSSM is inherently Bayesian. It can be shown that Kalman filter recurrences are identical to the equations used to update prior mean and covariances under a Bayesian perspective. Second, a sufficient condition for a GSSM to be identified is that its observability matrix is full rank. Take a look at chapter 5, page 143 of the book by West and Harrison .
