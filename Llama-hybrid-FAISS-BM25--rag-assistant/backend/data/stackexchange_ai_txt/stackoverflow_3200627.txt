html5 fileapi binary data

Can you get the binary data from a file without the fileReader class? I'm trying to upload files and I have it working in firefox & chrome/webkit but safari 5 doesn't have filereader. There has to be a way to get the binary data as gmail has drag and drop that works in safari 5.
