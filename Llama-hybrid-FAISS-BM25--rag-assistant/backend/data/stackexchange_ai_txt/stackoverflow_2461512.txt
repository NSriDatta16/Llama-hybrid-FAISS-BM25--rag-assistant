How to intercept capture TAB key in WinForms application?

I'm trying to capture the Tab key in a Windows Forms application and do a custom action when it is pressed. I have a Form with several listViews and buttons, I've set the Form's KeyPreview property to true and when I press any other key than tab, my KeyDown event handler does get called. But that's not true with the Tab key - I don't receive WM_KEYDOWN message even in WndProc. Do I need to set each control inside my form - its TabStop property - to false? There must be a more elegant way than that. Thanks.
