You just need some back-of-the-envelope calculations, I think. Let "hundreds of Mb" be 400MB. Let "several hours to several days" be 48 hours. (400 * 1024 * 1024 bytes) / (3600 * 48 seconds) = 2427 bytes/sec Obviously, you can just watch your system or use real numbers for the calculation, but using the rough estimate above you're logging about 2KB/sec, which is pretty trivial compared to the average hard-drive limits. So, no, the overhead doesn't appear to be very big. And yes, there's more efficient ways to do it, but you would probably spend more time and effort that it's worth for the miniscule savings you get unless your numbers are very different from what you stated.
