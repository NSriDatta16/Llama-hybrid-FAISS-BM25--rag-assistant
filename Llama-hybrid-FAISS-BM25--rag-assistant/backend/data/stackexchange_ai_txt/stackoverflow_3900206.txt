Given that this is almost certainly a homework question... The first thing you need to think about is how you would do this if you didn't have a computer in front of you. If I asked you "is 8 a multiple of 2", how would you go about solving it? Would that same solution work if I asked you "is 4882730048987" a multiple of 3"? If you've figured out the math which would allow you to get an answer with just a pen and paper (or even a pocket calculator), then the next step is to figure out how to turn that into code. Such a program would look a bit like this: Start Read in the first number and store it Read in the second number and store it Implement the solution you identified in paragraph two using the mathematical operations, and store the result Print the result to the user.
