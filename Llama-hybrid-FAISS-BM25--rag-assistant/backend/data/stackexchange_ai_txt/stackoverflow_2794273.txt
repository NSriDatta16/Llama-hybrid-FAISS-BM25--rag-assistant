Floating Point Questions Given that Matlab 's main (only?) data type is the double precision floating point matrix, and that most people use floating point arithmetic -- whether they know it or not -- I'm astonished that nobody has suggested asking basic floating point questions. Here are some floating point questions of variable difficulty: What is the range of |x| , an IEEE dp fpn? Approximately how many IEEE dp fpns are there? What is machine epsilon ? x = 10^22 is exactly representable as a dp fpn. What are the fpns xp and xs just below and just above x ? How many dp fpns are in [1,2) ? How many atoms are on an edge of a 1-inch sugar cube? Explain why sin(pi) ~= 0 , but cos(pi) = -1 . Why is if abs(x1-x2) a bad convergence test? Why is if f(a)*f(b) a bad sign check test? The midpoint c of the interval [a,b] may be calculated as: c1 = (a+b)/2, or c2 = a + (b-a)/2, or c3 = a/2 + b/2. Which do you prefer? Explain. Calculate in Matlab: a = 4/3; b = a-1; c = b+b+b; e = 1-c; Mathematically, e should be zero but Matlab gives e = 2.220446049250313e-016 = 2^(-52) , machine epsilon (eps). Explain. Given that realmin = 2.225073858507201e-308 , and Matlab's u = rand gives a dp fpn uniformly distributed over the open interval (0,1): Are the floating point numbers [2^(-400), 2^(-100), 2^(-1)] = 3.872591914849318e-121, 7.888609052210118e-031, 5.000000000000000e-001 equally likely to be output by rand ? Matlab's rand uses the Mersenne Twister rng which has a period of (2^19937-1)/2 , yet there are only about 2^64 dp fpns. Explain. Find the smallest IEEE double precision fpn x , 1 , such that x*(1/x) ~= 1 . Write a short Matlab function to search for such a number. Answer: Alan Edelman, MIT Would you fly in a plane whose software was written by you? Colin K would not hire me (and probably fire me) for saying "that Matlab's main (only?) data type is the double precision floating point matrix". When Matlab started that was all the user saw, but over the years they have added what they coyly call 'storage classes': single, (u)int8,16,32,64, and others. But these are not really types because you cannot do USEFUL arithmetic on them. Arithmetic on these storage classes is so slow that they are useless as types. Yes, they do save storage but what is the point if you can't do anything worthwhile with them? See my post (No. 13) here , where I show that arithmetic on int32s is 12 times slower than double arithmetic and where MathWorkser Loren Shure says "By default, MATLAB variables are double precision arrays. In the olden days, these were the ONLY kind of arrays in MATLAB. Back then even character arrays were stored as double values." For me the biggest flaw in Matlab is its lack of proper types, such as those available in C and Fortran. By the way Colin, what was your answer to Question 14?
