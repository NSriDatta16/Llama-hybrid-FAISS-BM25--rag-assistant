Does training with a more difficult task improve model performance on easier tasks?

Say I have a time series deep learning model where I am trying to predict whether an event will end tomorrow and I am using binary classification to do this. If I change the target (or add another one) and predict the duration to the end of the event, which I think is a harder task, or if I use multiclass classification to predict whether the event will end tomorrow, in 2 days or in 3 or more days, will this improve the predictions for the next day's (tomorrow's) events?
