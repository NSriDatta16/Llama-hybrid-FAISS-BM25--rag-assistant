Will the R-Squared be lower if I run the same model on a dataset with all the data vs a dataset with the quarterly averages?

Let's assume I have a dataset with quarterly data on loans. Let's say I have 100,000 of these loans, spread out in 20 quarters. If I run a regression on all the loans, I will have 100,000 data points. If I instead take quarterly averages, the number of observations will be greatly reduced. Would one expect to have a lower R squared in the dataset with 100,000 versus the dataset with the averages on the quarterly data?
