If you make the assumption that some samples are missing at random, you can: Conduct a paired test, leaving out the data for people that you don't have Conduct an unpaired test for the whole data Then you get 2 p-values, and you have to Multiple adjust, that is, e.g., with a Bonferroni correction. Multiply the p-values by 2, if, after that, you reject one of them, you can reject your original null-hypothesis Issues with the approach If the data is not missing at random, and in the worst case, the effect that you are testing for is inverted between the paired data you have, and the paired data you don't have, your statistic will be wrong If you don't want to make this assumption, I don't see how you can leverage the pairedness of your data, since you don't know why the data is missing. That is, you will have to conduct an unpaired test
