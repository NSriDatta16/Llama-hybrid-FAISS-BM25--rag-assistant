I think you've confused what the lognormal distribution is. If Y follows a lognormal distribution, then log(Y) follows a normal distribution. You seem to be thinking, incorrectly, that if Z follows a normal distribution, then log(Z) follows a lognormal distribution, which is not the case . It's an easy mistake to make. In time series analysis, you often assume that the variable you're tracking, call it Y, changes multiplicatively. That is, $Y_{i+1}=Y_i * e ^ \delta$. When taking the log of both sides you'll see that $\log Y_{i+1} = \log Y_i + \delta$. This is why we talk about log increments. Now we assume that $\delta$ is normally distributed, which would make $e^\delta$ follow a lognormal distribution.
