Horizontal (per-row) forms in a Django formset

What's the Django way of presenting a formset horizontally, i.e. one row per form? The as_table method generates multiple forms vertically (with the labels). I need the form fields in table rows (one row per form) and the labels should be on top. I don't see anything out of the box. Is this discouraged for some reason? I should clarify that I actually want a table, because of a UI table widget I'll be using. And that table should have the labels in the . So my desired structure is: column1 column2 form1.value1 form1.value2 ...
