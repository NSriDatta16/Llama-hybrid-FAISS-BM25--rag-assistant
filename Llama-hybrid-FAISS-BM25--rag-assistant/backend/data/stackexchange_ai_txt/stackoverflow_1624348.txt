A simple solution would be to check for the WiFi Coverage Status public boolean GetWiFiCoverageStatus() { if((WLANInfo.getWLANState() == WLANInfo.WLAN_STATE_CONNECTED) && RadioInfo.areWAFsSupported(RadioInfo.WAF_WLAN)) { // this.connectionString += ";interface=wifi"; return true; } else return false; } This would ensure that a connection is build only if the device is connected to an Access Point. Edit: Second thing you should check is this Knowledge Base Entry (HTTP 413 Request Entity Too Large) Third addition: Did you use ;deviceside=true in your connection string? without a MDS backend you have to use this appendix to ensure a normal TCP/IP connection
