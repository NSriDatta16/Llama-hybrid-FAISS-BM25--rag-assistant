Layers can not receive mouse events themselves. You would have to do the event handling in the view or view controller containing the layer. If a mouseDragged: event originates on a layer (see -[CALayer hitTest:] and -[CALayer containsPoint:] to test this), adjust the layer's position accordingly. You will probably want to disable implicit animations to have the layer follow the mouse pointer immediately (rather than lagging a little behind because of the animation of the position property): [CATransaction begin]; [CATransaction setDisableActions:YES]; layer.position = ...; [CATransaction commit];
