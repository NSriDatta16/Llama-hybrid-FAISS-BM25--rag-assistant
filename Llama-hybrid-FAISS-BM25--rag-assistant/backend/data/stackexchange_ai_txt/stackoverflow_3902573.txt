Linking with new version of libpcap library

I would like to install and use latest version (1.1.1) of the libpcap on CentOS 5.5 machine. I configured, compiled and installed new libpcap library by: [dima@localhost libpcap-1.1.1]$ ./configure [dima@localhost libpcap-1.1.1]$ make [dima@localhost libpcap-1.1.1]$ sudo make install But when I'm trying to link with libpcap shared library (using -lpcap linker flag) my application is linked to the old version of the libpcap library (verified using pcap_lib_version() API call. What I need to do in order to link with new libpcap library? Thanks in advance
