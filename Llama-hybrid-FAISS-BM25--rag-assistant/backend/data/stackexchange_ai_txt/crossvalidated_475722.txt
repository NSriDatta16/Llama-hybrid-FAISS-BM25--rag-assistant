The accuracy decreased when I used L2 regularization method

I am training a 6 layer Deep Neural Network with: Inputs are images in size 60 * 80. I am using relu activation function, Cross-Entropy for loss function, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. I used the weight-decay parameter(i.e. L2 regularization method). I don't face overfitting but the accuracy was 61 % and now is 26%! Can anyone explain the reason? (I assigned hyperparameter of regularization to 0.01. I changed it but no improvement in the accuracy!)
