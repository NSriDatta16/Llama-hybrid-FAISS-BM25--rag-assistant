fitting a non-linear term in a logistic regression

I am running a logistic regression and I have run a box Tidwell test which seems to suggest that two of the IVs that I have in my model are non-linear. I have attempted to fit restricted cubic splines to the terms using Frank Harrell's HMISC/RMS packages. However, for one of the terms I get the following error message: In rcspline.eval(x, nk = nknots, inclx = TRUE, pc = pc, fractied = fractied) : could not obtain 5 interior knots with default algorithm. On reading some other questions on this site, it seems that the use of restricted cubic splines is inappropriate for this variable. If this is the case, are there alternatives that allow me to account for the non-linearity? I should mention that the predictor in question is a count variable (number of arrests) extremely positively skewed and discrete. I have tried transforming the variable using cube root transform, but this has had no effect and I still attain the same error message. The variable in question has the following count distribution X 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 23 24 25 26 28 30 46 72 53738 8059 2547 999 411 198 100 64 47 30 15 11 6 6 4 9 3 1 3 6 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1
