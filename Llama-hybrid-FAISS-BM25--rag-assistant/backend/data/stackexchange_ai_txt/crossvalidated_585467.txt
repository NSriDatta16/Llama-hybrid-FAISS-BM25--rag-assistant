You mention interest in genomic problems, with 1000s of genes but 100s of samples. Brad Efron's "Large Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction" might be a good fit. The back of the book blurb starts out with: We live in a new age for statistical inference, where modern scientific technology such as microarrays and fMRI machines routinely produce thousands and sometimes millions of parallel data sets, each with its own estimation or testing problem... He uses an Empirical Bayes approach to show links between Frequentist and Bayesian perspectives on what to do when testing 1000s of hypotheses or making 1000s of estimates or predictions at once. Efron has posted the table of contents and prologue here: https://efron.ckirby.su.domains/other/2010LSIexcerpt.pdf and provides R code and datasets here: https://efron.ckirby.su.domains/LSI/datasets-and-programs/datasets.html
