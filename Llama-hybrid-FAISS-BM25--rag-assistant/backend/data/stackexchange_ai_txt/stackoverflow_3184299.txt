Since SAP in itself is a commercial (non-free) product, so any integrations of other applications (like Magento or any CRM) with SAP will unlikely be available at free of cost. As far as SBOeConnect is concerned, it provides one of the best supports as compared to other products related with SAP & Magento. Hope it helps.
