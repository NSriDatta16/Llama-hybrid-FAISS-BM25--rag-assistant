.NET supports side-by-side assemblies, so you can have multiple versions of the same app arround. The GAC is like shared DLLs, but still you can register multiple versions of the same assembly at the GAC and another assembly can request a certain or a greater-than version if I remember well. In JavaEE you do have several class-loader levels btw and you can do some tricks simulating similar versioning
