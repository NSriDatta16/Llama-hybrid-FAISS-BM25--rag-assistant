Precompiled headers can be machine specific up to Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (from here ): Precompiled header files store the “state” of a compilation up to a certain point, and that state information can be reused in subsequent compiler invocations to significantly increase build throughput. For the past 15 years, our compiler has persisted precompiled headers to disk and reloaded them directly into virtual memory with 99.999% reliability and considerable performance gains. The tradeoff, however, was a degree of fragility in our architecture. Since the PCH file itself contains internal pointers, it must be loaded at the exact same address in virtual memory where it was created .
