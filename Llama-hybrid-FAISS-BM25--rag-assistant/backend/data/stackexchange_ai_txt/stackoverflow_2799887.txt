How to scrape the first paragraph from a wikipedia page?

Let's say I want to grab the first paragraph in this wikipedia page . How do I get the principal text between the title and contents box using XPath or DOM & PHP or something similar? Is there any php library for that? I don't want to use the api because it's a bit complex. Note: i just need that to add a widget under my pages that displays related info from Wikipedia.
