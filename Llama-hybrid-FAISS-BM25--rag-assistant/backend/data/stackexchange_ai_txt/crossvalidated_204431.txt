Bird eye view of unknown data set

Pardon me if this question does not fit this site (or SE engine in general) but I do not know where to post it. Suppose that you have unknown data set which you want to explore. What functions/methods/techniques should I use to get birds eye of the data? I guess it depends on the data. I'm particularly interests in the ordered integers (but feel free to post other types also). Few examples that comes to my mind are: histograms, barplots, (moving) mean (aka average) median mode variance standard-deviation. What else? Thank you.
