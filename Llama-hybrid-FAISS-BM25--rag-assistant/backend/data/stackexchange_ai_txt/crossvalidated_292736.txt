I'll use the notation from the KFAS vignette and the KFAS paper . If you had, say, two known angular frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, you could set the state transition matrix to $$ T_t = T = \left[\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & \cos(\omega_1) & \sin(\omega_1 ) & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -\sin(\omega_1) & \cos (\omega_1) & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \cos(\omega_2) & \sin(\omega_2) \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -\sin(\omega_2 ) & \cos(\omega_2) \end{array}\right], $$ and, if you had a univariate response, the observation matrix to $$ Z_t = Z = [1 1 0 1 0]. $$ In the case of a multivariate response, where all the dependent variables share the same mean, you could set the observation matrix to $$ Z_t = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1\\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{array}\right] [1 1 0 1 0]. $$ The first state element would represent a time-varying intercept, and the rest would represent (suitably transformed) time-varying phases and amplitudes. For example, if you have monthly data, and you expect there is a quarterly cycle, that is once every three months, so you would set one of your angular frequencies to be $$ \omega_i = 2 \pi \frac{1}{3}. $$ More information for this type of state space model can be found in Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Models .
