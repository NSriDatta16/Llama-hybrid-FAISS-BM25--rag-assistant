I would be very careful because XML is not a data storage device. XML is a meta-language, a language for creating languages. XML is frequently misused as a data storage device, but that frequency does not provide credence to a faulty understanding of the technology. I have heard somebody attempt to argue this claiming that meta-language means a language of data about data, which is still not a data storage device. A language created to represent a description upon the structure of data is not a language of the data itself, and while an instance of the language may be a structure created of data the language itself is not. If your intent is not to create a language or to represent a language for a class of data I would not recommend using XML as the result will be bloated, slow, and you will not likely use any of the assisting technologies that make XML truly powerful. As alternatives others have mentioned YAML and JSON, which are considerably lighter. I would recommend trying one of those. If the meta data, and its structure/relationships, is more important to you than the data itself then I would stick with XML because because the potential for processing and manipulation is incredibly extensible.
