Algorithm to sum/stack values from a time series graph where data points don't match on time

I have a graphing/analysis problem i can't quite get my head around. I can do a brute force, but its too slow, maybe someone has a better idea, or knows or a speedy library for python? I have 2+ time series data sets (x,y) that i want to aggregate (and subsequently plot). The issue is that the x values across the series don't match up, and i really don't want to resort to duplicating values into time bins. So, given these 2 series: S1: (1;100) (5;100) (10;100) S2: (4;150) (5;100) (18;150) When added together, should result in: ST: (1;100) (4;250) (5;200) (10;200) (18;250) Logic: x=1 s1=100, s2=None, sum=100 x=4 s1=100, s2=150, sum=250 (note s1 value from previous value) x=5 s1=100, s2=100, sum=200 x=10 s1=100, s2=100, sum=200 x=18 s1=100, s2=150, sum=250 My current thinking is to iterate a sorted list of keys(x), keep the previous value for each series, and query each set if it has a new y for the x. Any ideas would be appreciated!
