Do I need to know Emacs Lisp in order to use GNU/Emacs

Recently, I began studying GNU/Emacs. Was very easy to use program. Studied its structure. Tuned nice color for me. Configure it to class on C programming. Everything seemed normal. But now the question arose of GNU/Emacs lisp. Should I really spend time to study Emacs Lisp if I did not develop itself Emacs and will only use it like ide for C/C++ development, mail, jabber and etc... The fact is that when I edit my .emacs I understand that I write. But I write mostly ready-made scripts or if its something they are very simple. Thank you.
