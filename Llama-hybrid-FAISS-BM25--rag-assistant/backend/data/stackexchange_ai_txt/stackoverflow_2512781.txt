winforms big paragraph tooltip

I'm trying to display a paragraph in a tooltip when I hover a certain picture box. The problem is, the tooltip takes that paragraph, and spans it on one line, all across my screen. How can I make it so that it takes a smaller, more readable area? or, maybe you have another technique to achieve the same thing, but without the tooltip function?
