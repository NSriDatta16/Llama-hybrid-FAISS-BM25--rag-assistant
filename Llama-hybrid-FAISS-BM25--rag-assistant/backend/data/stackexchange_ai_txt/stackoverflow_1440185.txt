For querying purposes , it does not matter. You may consider alternate ordering sequences, based on the following: possible use of the index for other queries (including some with ORDER BY .. one of these columns) to limit index fragmentation (by using orders that tends to add records towards the end of the table and/or nearby non-selective parameters) Edit: on second thoughts, having the most selective column first may help the optimizer, for example by providing it with a better estimated row yield and such... But this important issue may be getting off topic, as the OP's question was whether the order of the join conditions mattered.
