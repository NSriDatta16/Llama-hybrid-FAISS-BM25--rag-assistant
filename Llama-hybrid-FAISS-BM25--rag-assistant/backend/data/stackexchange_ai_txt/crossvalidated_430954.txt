Example of a non-measurable maximum likelihood estimator

If you have a measurable parameter space $(\Theta, \mathcal{F})$ and a parametric family of probability measures $(P_\theta)_{\theta \in \Theta}$ on a measurable space $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B})$ that have densities $(f_\theta)_{\theta \in \Theta}$ with respect to some dominating measure $\mu$ , then you might define the maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \to \Theta$ as $$ \tag{1}\label{1} \hat{\theta}(x) = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\theta \in \Theta} f_\theta(x) $$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ . This is an abstract version of how MLEs are introduced in some statistics texts and classes, but there are a few issues. For one thing, a global maximum might not be attained, or there might be multiple global maxima, so \eqref{1} isn't necessarily well-defined. Moreover, if it happens to be well-defined, then is it measurable? Certainly all examples of maximum likelihood estimators one sees in applied statistics courses (at least that I've seen) are measurable. Of course you can get around these issues by defining MLEs in a different way: for example, you might call a function $\hat{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \to \Theta$ a maximum likelihood estimator if it is a priori measurable and there exists a set $N \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $\mu(N) = 0$ and $$ \tag{2}\label{2} f_{\hat{\theta}(x)}(x) = \sup_{\theta \in \Theta} f_\theta(x) $$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X} \setminus N$ . However, oftentimes \eqref{2} isn't how maximum likelihood estimation is introduced, and I'm more interested in the question of measurability of functions $\hat{\theta}$ satisfying \eqref{1} or \eqref{2}. Questions. Are there any explicit examples in which some reasonable interpretation of \eqref{1} is well-defined (at least off a $\mu$ -null set) but not measurable? Alternatively, can a function $\hat{\theta}$ satisfying \eqref{2} (again, at least off a $\mu$ -null set) exist when no such measurable function exists? What about if $(\Theta, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B})$ are standard Borel spaces? If there isn't a constructive example, then is there a proof of the existence of an example? There are various results that give criteria under which there cannot be examples of the kind I'm looking for, thereby restricting the class of spaces and densities that might possess such examples. Example 1. Lemma 2 in Jennrich (1969) implies that if $\Theta$ is a compact subset of a Euclidean space and $\mathcal{F}$ is its Borel $\sigma$ -algebra, and the function $\theta \mapsto f_\theta(x)$ from $\Theta$ into $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous for every $x \in \mathcal{X}$ , then there exists a measurable function $\hat{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \to \Theta$ such that \eqref{2} holds for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ . Example 2. Theorem 3.1 in Wagner (1980) (the Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem ) implies that if $(\Theta, \mathcal{F})$ is a Polish space with its Borel $\sigma$ -algebra, $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B})$ is any measurable space, for each $x \in \mathcal{X}$ , the set $$ F(x) = \big\{\theta \in \Theta : \text{$f_\theta(x) \geq f_\psi(x)$ for all $\psi\in\Theta$}\big\} $$ is nonempty and closed, and for every open $U \subseteq \Theta$ , the set $$ \big\{x \in \mathcal{X} : F(x) \cap U \neq \emptyset\big\} $$ belongs to $\mathcal{B}$ , then there exists a measurable function $\hat{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \to \Theta$ such that $\hat{\theta}(x) \in F(x)$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ (i.e., \eqref{2} holds for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ ). Thus, under the additional assumptions of Example 1 or Example 2 there always exists a measurable maximum likelihood estimator. Example 3. Theorem 7.50(b) in Bertsekas and Shreve (1996) implies that if $(\Theta, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B})$ are standard Borel spaces, and for every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ , the set $$ \big\{ (x, \theta) \in \mathcal{X} \times \Theta : f_\theta(x) > c \big\} $$ is an analytic subset of $\mathcal{X} \times \Theta$ , then the set $$ I = \left\{ x \in \mathcal{X} : \text{$f_\theta(x) = \sup_{\psi\in\Theta} f_\psi(x)$ for some $\theta \in \Theta$}\right\} $$ is universally measurable. Moreover, for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a universally measurable function $\hat{\theta} : \mathcal{X} \to \Theta$ such that \eqref{2} holds for all $x \in I$ , and for all $x \in \mathcal{X} \setminus I$ , $$ f_{\hat{\theta}(x)}(x) \geq \begin{cases} \sup_{\psi \in \Theta} f_\psi(x) - \varepsilon, & \text{if $\sup_{\psi \in \Theta} f_\psi(x) Example 3 doesn't necessarily guarantee the existence of a measurable maximum likelihood estimator (for instance, since there are universally measurable sets which are not Borel), but it is arguably in the same spirit as Example 2.
