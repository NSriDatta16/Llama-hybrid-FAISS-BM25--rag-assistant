Rails Restful actions Index Put

I have frequently run into the situation where I want to update many records at once - like GMail does with setting many messages "read" or "unread". Rails encourages this with the 'update' method on an ActiveRecord class - Comment.update(keys, values) Example - http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/7495 This is great functionality, but hard to map to a restful route. In a sense, I'd like to see a :put action on a collection. In routes, we might add something like map.resources :comments, :collection => { :update_many => :put } And then in the form, you'd do this... ... This doesn't work on many levels. If you do this: :collection => { :update_many => :put }, rails will submit a post to the index action (CommentsController#index), I want it to go to the 'update_many' action. Instead, you can do a :collection => { :update_many => :post }. This will at least go to the correct action in the controller. And, instead of { :controller => :comments, :action => :update_many } do |f| %> It will work OK this way Still not perfect - feels a little like we're not doing it the 'Rails way'. It also seems like :post, and :delete would also make sense on a collection controller. I'm posting here to see if there's anything I missed on setting this up. Any other thoughts on how to restfully do a collection level :post, :put, :delete?
