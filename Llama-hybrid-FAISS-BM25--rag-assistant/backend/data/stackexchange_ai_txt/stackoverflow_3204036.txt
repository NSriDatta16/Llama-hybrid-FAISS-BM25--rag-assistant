Hyperlink in Android

I have a question: How can I place a hyperlink WITHIN a text-block of normal text? I have some text and in the text I mention a URL and I want this URL to be in a different color, underlined and click-able. I know hyperlinks in android can be placed with "Linkify".. and i have referred android docs page Consider the same above paragraph with "android docs" i want to display in android.....
