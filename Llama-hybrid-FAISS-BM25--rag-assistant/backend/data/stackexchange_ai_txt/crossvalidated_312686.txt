I suspect the reason is primarily theoretical, while there may be mathematical implications as well I think these are more pronounced in the BG/NBD model than the Double-Gamma model. Consider that Fader & Hardie's research has built upon work by Ehrenberg, who began with modeling repeat transactions ... well technically it began with modeling customer buying patterns but it takes multiple transactions to generate a pattern. We see the language in the papers - the initial transaction is seen as 'trial' rather than repeat and is considered to be of a different nature. (see the initial statement of problem in this paper: http://www.brucehardie.com/notes/006/creating_dor_summary_2004-05-04.pdf ). It is a different problem to predict initial customer acquisition (in which a success is defined as a trial purchase) than to predict incremental customer transactions from already-acquired customers (in which success is defined as an additional repeat transaction).
