Neural network function approximation - line intersection

I have approximate my 2D function f(x) = y with a simple feed forward neural network. The result is quite OK. I am able to compute derivatives at points from neural network. However, is it possible to compute an intersection point of NN approximation function with a line, given by two points [Ax, Ay] and [Bx, By] ?
