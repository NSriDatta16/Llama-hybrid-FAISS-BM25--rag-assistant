Assuming the adapted case (how many individuals for a given probability), then this sounds a lot like an occupancy problem or coupon collectors problem . The general solution is not easy to compute, but in this small case an exact distribution can be computed Exact computation: you could compute a Markov chain for the 80+1 states where the occupancy of at least one is below 2, and the end state where all are at least 2. Estimate: A simple way would be to estimate by considering only the rare groups B and AB which are the bottleneck and approximate them with a Poisson distribution or beta-binomial. The two methods give very similar results ### create a transition matrix T = matrix(rep(0,81*81),81) for (A in 0:2) { for (B in 0:2) { for (AB in 0:2) { for (U in 0:2) { row = 1+A+B*3+AB*9+U*27 T[row,row+(A Other approach For larger problems (more states and larger number of occupancy) the distribution may be approximated with a Gumbel distribution, which relates to the distribution of the minimum of several variables (and the problem is equivalent to the minimum of the variables being above some value). Or for intermediate problems the minimum distribution can be approximated by assuming independence and multiplying the survival functions (one minus the cumulative distribution function). In the code above this is simplified by regarding only the blood groups AB and B.
