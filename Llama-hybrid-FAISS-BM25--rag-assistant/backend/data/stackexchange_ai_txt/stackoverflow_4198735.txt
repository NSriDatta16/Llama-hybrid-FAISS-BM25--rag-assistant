easy visualization of usage statistics (web app)

I have some usage queries for my web app's database, the results of which I want to display graphically. Is there an easy-to-use API that exists for this purpose? I want to show things like average query-time per user (a small user-base), average query time per day, and things like that. I think it would be cool to show these on a two-axis graph. I am displaying this data on my site, so a jQuery/Javascript/HTML solution for rendering information into graphs would be ideal.
