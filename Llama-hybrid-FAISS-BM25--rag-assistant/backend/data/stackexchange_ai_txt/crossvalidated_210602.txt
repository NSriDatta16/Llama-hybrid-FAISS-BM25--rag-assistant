Is there any conventional small, medium and large effect sizes for ordinal logistic regression?

I was performing a power analysis of articles published in a journal of management using the pwr package in R. However, it seemed to be impossible to compute power for small, medium and large effect sizes for multiple ordinal logistic regression. I have tried using G*power , but it only seemed to be useful when we have simple logistic regression output. Thus, I have tried to simulate to calculate the power based on the answers by @GregSnow and @gung here: Simulation of logistic regression power analysis - designed experiments . How can I get power for small, medium and large effect sizes in multiple ordinal logistic regression?
