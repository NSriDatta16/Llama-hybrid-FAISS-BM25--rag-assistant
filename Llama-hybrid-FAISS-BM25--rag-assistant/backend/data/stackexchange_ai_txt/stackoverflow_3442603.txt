"The biggest roadblock to a great plan, is the dream of a perfect plan." I agree - designing the perfect system which can be elegantly resilient to every possible future change, is fruitless. Every successful project is a tradeoff: building flexibility where you're confident it will be needed (or where it's easy to do anyway); and building somewhat quick-n-dirty code where you believe flexibility/change is unlikely. If you analyze the system well and the client has a good idea of their needs/requirements (not always a given), you'll get that balance right at least most of the time. However, the idea that the whole system will be replaced every 3-5 years by some newer technology is also a fallacy. For every client who wants the latest, newest, sexiest system, there's 5 clients that are afraid to part with (or can't afford to replace) their legacy COM/VB/MS-Access/whatever system that is a morass of spaghetti logic built-up haphazardly without regard to maintainability, flexibility, or extensibility. You don't want to be the one building that system; if you are, then you're doing your client/employer a disservice.
