Nicholas Zakas did some researches on the subject and talks about this on this Google Tech Talk . It seems that you can get an interesting performance enhancement. I'm not sure about the exact number, but the sure thing is that optimizing name lookups will improve the speed of your code. Of course if you're dragging 10 years of legacy code behind you that is working just fine, don't worry about optimizing... but if your application is slow, I'd consider optimizing the code. If you decide to go with refactoring, try to pinpoint what you can optimize. I recommend using the the javascript profiler of firebug to do so. You can even try optimizing a minor part of your code, see the performance boost that you get and then figure out if it's worth optimizing the rest of your app.
