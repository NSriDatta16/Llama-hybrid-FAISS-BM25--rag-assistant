I believe you will need to use the same sampling interval for both sets of data. A simple way to reconcile the two frequencies would be to compute a quarterly sum or average (whichever makes sense in this application) for the monthly order volume data. However, I assume that you want to predict monthly order volumes, so that would render this approach unfeasible. Plus, it means throwing away information, which is rarely desirable, if you can avoid it. Another possibility might be to estimate monthly values from the quarterly data by doing a time series model for each of the macroeconomic variables, and then use interpolation to get the monthly value estimates. Here is a link that discusses how to do that in Python. https://machinelearningmastery.com/resample-interpolate-time-series-data-python/
