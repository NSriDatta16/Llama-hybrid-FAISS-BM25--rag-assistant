Computing the covariance matrix in PCA

PCA method finds the covariance between data vectors, where each data vector includes observations of different variables (dimensions). So if the data matrix has variables in columns and observations in rows, then we find the covariance of rows. Right? Does it make sense to do PCA by finding the covariance between different dimensions instead? In the above dataset representation, it means to find covraince between columns. I am asking this, because I found in some standard libraries, the algorithm performs the latter instead.
