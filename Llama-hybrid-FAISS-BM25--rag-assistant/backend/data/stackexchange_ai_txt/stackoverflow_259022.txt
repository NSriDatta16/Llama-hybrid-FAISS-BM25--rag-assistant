I have ended up writing a new logging framework from scratch that addresses this flaw. I created a local queue that will get the log/trace messages and then do the filter and send them to the server. The queue then will be backed by Isolated Storage so even if the client goes off line permanently for that session the messages will be sent when it is back online.
