Have a workaround for the 1,000 file limit in a directory on windows mobile 5?

I need to download more than 1,000 files into a windows mobile 5 directory located on the storage card. If i copy the files onto the storage card via my desktop there is no problem. But when i try to download the files from the handheld device I get a disk full error, even though there is plenty of room due to the 1,000 file limit. Has anyone run into this and found a workaround? I'm going to try zipping all of the files then decompressing on the device but not sure that this will work.
