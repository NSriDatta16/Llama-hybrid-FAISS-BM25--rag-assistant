You would be in full violation of copyright (assuming the app owner has one) law if you used their images in your application without their approval. Using the name is not as cut and dry. You can't use the same image of the name, just like you can't use "Android" in the custom typeface. However, I believe a name needs additional protection (like a trademark) to prevent using the same word like "Windows" or "Google." Finally, a company or organization may choose to release a statement governing the rules of some types of images and or words of their product which give you specific rights to use their copyrighted work. Just like what Google has done with Android in their attribution policy and branding guidlines, which you can read about here and here .
