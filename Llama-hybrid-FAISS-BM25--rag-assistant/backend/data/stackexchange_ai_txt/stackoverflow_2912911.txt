Creating a database is usually a database administrator task. Unless it is a local database, maybe an embedded one, the user would need to know where and how create the database on the remote server, and she can have no clue about it. Where to store the database files? Which disks are available? And there could be many more parameters to set (memoery buffers size, etc.), users to be created and so on. And also you need very elevate privileges to be able to create a database, not something you give to average users or applications. Thereby usually you ask the database administrator to create your database/schema, he will give you the credentials you need to connect, and then your application (or its setup) will create and initialize the needed objects (tables, etc.). Creating table (and other object) is usually as simple as running "CREATE TABLE...." statements. Just remember SQL takes one command only, if you need to run several commands you have to send them one after another yourself, although there are Delphi components which are able to split a script in commands and run one after another.
