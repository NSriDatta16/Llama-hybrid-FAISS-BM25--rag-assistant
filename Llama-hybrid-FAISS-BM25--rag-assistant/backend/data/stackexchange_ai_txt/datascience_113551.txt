corresponding class labels of two unsupervised learning algorithms

I am working on a time series clustering problem. I made two models (hierarchical tree) with different pre-processing techniques using this class in package dtaidistance: clustering.LinkageTree(dtw.distance_matrix_fast, {}) I am now studying the differences between the algorithms and I am facing issues when generating the classes since class 1 in model 1 is not class 1 in model 2. My question; how to correspond the classes between both models ? Desired output:
