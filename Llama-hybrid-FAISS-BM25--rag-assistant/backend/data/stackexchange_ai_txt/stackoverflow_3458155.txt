Magento Checkout - Unsecure Image

I was having a problem with my Magento checkout whereby the browser was reporting that the page wasn't fully encrypted. I had a look and realised that one of the images was using http:// This is the code I was using to display the image: getSkinUrl('images/search_button.png') ?> As a temporary solution I have hard coded the full path to the image ie: https://mysite.com/skin/frontend/default/mytheme/images/search_button.png Does anyone how I can call the image dynamically but have it use https on the checkout and other secure pages?
