It would be better to say "construct" a confidence interval instead of "estimate" a confidence interval. The confidence interval is the interval estimate of the unknown population parameter. I believe @Shang Zhang is suggesting you estimate the variance of the sample variance and use this to construct an asymptotic confidence interval. Here is a thread that derives the variance of the sample variance, "Variance of sample variance?" . You could use this to invert a Wald test to construct a confidence interval for the unknown population variance. That is, $$\mbox{Var}(S^2)={\mu_4\over n}-{\sigma^4\,(n-3)\over n\,(n-1)},$$ where $\mu_4=\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]$ is the fourth central moment of $X$ . The resulting confidence interval would be $$s^2\pm1.96\cdot\hat{\text{se}},$$ where $\hat{\text{se}}=\sqrt{{\hat{\mu}_4\over n}-{s^4\,(n-3)\over n\,(n-1)}}$ . If the sample size is small or the sample variance estimate is small (or both), using a log link function will help to maintain the coverage probability of the interval, i.e. $$\text{exp}[\text{log}\{s^2\}\pm1.96\cdot\hat{\text{se}}/s^2],$$ where $\hat{\text{se}}/s^2$ is the estimated standard error of $\text{log}\{s^2\}$ based on the delta method.
