is it possible to do feature selection for unsupervised machine learning problems?

I started looking for ways to do feature selection in machine learning. By having a quick look at this post , I made the assumption that feature selection is only manageable for supervised learning problems: Still, I have to ask: are there methods to do feature selection without having a known variable that will be used for a classification/regression problem?
