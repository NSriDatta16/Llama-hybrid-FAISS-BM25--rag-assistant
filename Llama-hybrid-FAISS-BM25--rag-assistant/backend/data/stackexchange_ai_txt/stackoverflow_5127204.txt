QUnit is a JavaScript unit testing framework, used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins, but capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (both on the client and on the server). Its home page desribes it as follows: QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself ! QUnit is especially useful for regression testing: Whenever a bug is reported, write a test that asserts the existence of that particular bug. Then fix it and commit both. Every time you work on the code again, run the tests. If the bug comes up again - a regression - you'll spot it immediately and know how to fix it, because you know what code you just changed. Having good unit test coverage makes safe refactoring easy and cheap. You can run the tests after each small refactoring step and always know what change broke something. QUnit is similar to other unit testing frameworks like JUnit, but makes use of the features JavaScript provides and helps with testing code in the browser, eg. with it's stop/start facilities for testing asynchronous code.
