Variance in set of different random variables

Imagine we have sample of values a_1, a_2,...a_n, with a_i value originating from a normal distribution with mean mu_i_a and variance var_i_a, thus each value is single realization of different random variable. Then we have another sample of values b_1,..b_n, with value b_i originating from a normal distribution with mean mu_i_b and variance var_i_b. How can we compare dispersion of first sample (that is, values a_i,...a_n) with dispersion of the other sample (that is, values b_1, ... b_n). A practical example, which can be related to this situation, imagine that we have average yearly salary for each state in USA in 1990 (mean +/- SEM for each state) and the same in 2010. The question is, how to measure if the state-specific mean salaries became more or less dispersed across time. For example, some politicians take measure to decrease salary inhomogenity across USA states, how to quantify if their measures have been succesfull? This is edited version of previous question, so to make the question more clear.
