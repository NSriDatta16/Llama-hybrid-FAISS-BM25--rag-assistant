InvalidCastException from selecting ListBoxItem's Contents

My ListBoxItems contain multiple TextBoxes like this: When an item is clicked, I would like each TextBlock to be saved to IsolatedStorage under corresponding keys. Right now the closest I've gotten to this method is this: private void mysList_SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e) { ListBoxItem lbi = (ListBoxItem)myList.SelectedItem; appSettings["name"] = (string)lbi.Content; } But, when clicked I get an InvalidCastException. As I understand it, it's basically due to me trying to convert all four textboxes into a single string (or something like that). So how do I save each TextBox's text field independently within the ListBoxItem to an IsolatedStorage key/value? Thanks again in advance.
