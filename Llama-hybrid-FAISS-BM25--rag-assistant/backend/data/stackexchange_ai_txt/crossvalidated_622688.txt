How can you predict the impact on the average of a dependent variable from its predicted odds ratio with independent variable?

If a regression analysis shows that 1 unit increase in independent variable A will increase the odds of a user conversion (dependent variable) by 2 times, is there a way to infer the change it can have on the average conversion rate too? Is it as simple as multiplying the average conversion rate with the predicted odds ratio so that if the avg. conversion rate is 20% then: predicted conversion rate following 1 unit increase in variable A = 0.20 * 2 = 0.40
