State-of-the-art methods for forecasting time series array

Suppose I have a set of measurements taken at regular intervals, and I want to predict future values of one of those measurements. There are relationships between the variables being measured. For example, some variables may tend to rise together, or one variable might tend to fall when another rises. What are the state-of-the-art methods for this type of forecasting?
