can you analytically solve this bayesian hierarchical model - bernoulli trials

Is it possible to analytically solve (i.e., use a conjugate prior) the hierarchical model shown in the image below to obtain the posterior distribution. The data are composed of bernouli trials sampled from different groups. The image is taken from http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2011/08/extrasensory-perception-esp-bayesian.html My data are similar to the data discussed in the blog post but I have a ton of data. I figure that if there is an analytical solution, it would be much more feasible to apply a bayesian hierarchical model to my data. Plus, I am simply just interested in peoples' answers.
