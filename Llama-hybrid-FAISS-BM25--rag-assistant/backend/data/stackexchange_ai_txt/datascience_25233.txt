Procedure-1: Convert them into percentage and then take average of outcome of both. so for example for person A, judge-1 rated 5 out of 7 and judge-2 rated 7 out of 10, converting judge-1 score to percentage i.e., $5/7 *100$ = 71%(rounded 71.45) converting judge-2 score to percentage i.e., $7/10 *100$ = 70% Now take average of both i.e., $71+70 / 2$ = 70.5%, now you can convert it back on to a scale from $1-10$ : This person A's overall rating is 7(rounded 7.05 ) out of 10. Procedure-2: You can normalize the rating of both the judges by using this formula, $$z_i=\frac{x_i-\min(x)}{\max(x)-\min(x)}$$ where $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$ and $z_i$ is now your $i^{th}$ normalized data. As a proof of concept (although you did not ask for it) Procedure-3: You can convert the 0-7 rating to 0-10 and then take average of both. Once you get the outcome then you can rank them accordingly. Do let me know if you have any doubts.
