Calibrating random forest regression

I'm trying to learn how to calibrate random forests for regression. I have found many informative sources on how to do this for classification but none for regression. The CORElearn R package has a random forest classifier with local weighting of basic models. But nothing for regression. I am basically trying to correct the bias random forests present when attacking a regression problem. A problem that I have seen worries many people but I have not seen explicit solutions to yet. Any new thoughts on this?
