It seems there are always workarounds of some form or another to be found in order to make the default model binder happy! I wonder if you could create a "pseudo" property that is used only by the model binder? (Note, this is by no means elegant. Myself, I seem to resort to similar tricks like this more and more often simply because they work and they get the job "done"...) Note also, if you were using a separate "ViewModel" (which I recommend for this), you could put this code in there, and leave your domain model nice and clean. public class Employee { private decimal _Salary; public string MvcSalary // yes, a string. Bind your form values to this! { get { return _Salary.ToString(); } set { // (Using some pseudo-code here in this pseudo-property!) if (AppearsToBeValidDecimal(value)) { _Salary = StripCommas(value); } } } public decimal Salary { get { return _Salary; } set { _Salary = value; } } } P.S., after I typed this up, I look back at it now and am even hesitating to post this, it is so ugly! But if you think it might be helpful I'll let you decide... Best of luck! -Mike
