If you're fitting a binomial GLM with a logit link (i.e. a logistic regression model), then your regression equation is the log odds that the response value is a '1' (or a 'success'), conditioned on the predictor values. Exponentiating the log odds gives you the odds ratio for a one-unit increase in your variable. So for example, with "gender", if Female = 0 and Male = 1 and a logistic regression coefficient of 0.014, then you can assert that the odds of your outcome for men are exp(0.014) = 1.01 times that of the odds of your outcome in women.
