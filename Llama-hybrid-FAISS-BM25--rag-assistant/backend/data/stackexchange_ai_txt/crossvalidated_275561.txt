A frequentist analysis cannot give you the probability that a particular hypothesis is true (or false) because it has no long run frequency (it is either true or it isn't) so we cannot assign a probability to it (except perhaps 0 or 1). If you want to know the probability that a particular hypothesis is true, we need to adopt a Bayesian framework (where it is straightforward, we just need to consider the prior probabilities etc.). Frequentists can find optimal strategies for acting on null hypothesis tests ( Neyman-Pearson framework) but they can't translate that into a probability that the hypothesis is true, but only because of their definition of a probability.
