What's the best SQL scheme for this project?

i want to make a php app that let people submit photos/videos/sounds Now, everything uploaded a record will be added to SQL database with file infos in this way: Photos_table : File_Name | Picture_Type | Picture_Width | Picture_height Videos_table : File_Name | Duration | Codec Sounds_table : File_Name | Bitrate | Duration | Codec The App will displays all recent items of all kinds. Is it good to do like the previous scheme, or making all infos in ONE table like this : File_Name | Picture_Type | Picture_Width | Picture_height | Duration | Codec | Bitrate I mean what's the fastest way to gather the infos, i just think the first scheme is more organized than the last one. Thanks
