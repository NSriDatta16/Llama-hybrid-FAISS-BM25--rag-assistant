Blackberry/iPhone Development Sim on Windows

I'm looking for a free solution just to learn how to develop applications for Blackberry and iPhone on Windows that includes a Blackberry and iPhone simulator . The closest program I came across to this was DragonFireSDK but its not free. Any suggestions?
