Store your data in the fastest container you've tested and use a bloom filter to test if something is in the container. I mated a bloom filter with a hash table in a previous project and it sped things up 400 times on hash tables with an average of roughly 10k items. The bloom filter has a few interesting properties: If the answer is no from a bloom filter, it's 100% reliable. If the answer is yes, you have to check the other data structure to make sure the item is actually present. Make sure you pick a good hash function :)
