Model that shrinks a set of coefficients towards their common mean

I am interested in estimating the odds of a certain disease based on a medium sized group of correlated biological markers (roughly 20 markers). The model will also include several confounding variables as covariates (i.e. sex, age, BMI, education). Typically this is done with logistic regression - either in a large model including all predictors, or in several separate models (one for each biological predictor including the confounders). The problem with the latter approach is that it neglects to account for the correlation amongst those markers. An approach I have seen in the literature is to 'shrink' the regression coefficients for the biological markers towards a common mean. This makes sense in my case - these biological markers are related and I would assume their effect sizes would be roughly similar. A large effect size for a single marker is unlikely to be valid. The problem is that I have no idea how to implement this! My exposure to Bayesian methods is limited (although I have used R package brms), so if someone would be able to point me in the direction or provide any insight, that would be excellent!
