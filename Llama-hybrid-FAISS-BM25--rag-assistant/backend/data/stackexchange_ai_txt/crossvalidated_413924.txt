Feature selection and interpretation for black box classification systems

I just did terribly in an interview. One of the questions that came up was (paraphrased): Say you have a binary classifier, a neural net or a random forest, and a dataset with huge dimensions. What would you do to select the features that are most important and how would you explain how these features affect the outcome. i.e. the relationship. The model is too deep and complex to analyse the weights and such.
