Studying and choosing between different neural network structures

I would like to develop a model that uses convolutional neural networks for image classification. From the many different network structures described in papers and articles online, I would like to choose, as a starting point, the one that better suits my problem and dataset. I know that there is no certain answer and the best structure is highly dependent on each problem, but I imagine that there is some method behind building such a network beyond pure chance and testing. What properties and hyperparameters should I pay attention to when reading papers and comparing structures? In order to acquire this intuition about different models, is it better to read more literature or focus on experimenting with different models? Though I have special interest in convolutional neural networks, this question also applies to studying the architecture of neural networks in general.
