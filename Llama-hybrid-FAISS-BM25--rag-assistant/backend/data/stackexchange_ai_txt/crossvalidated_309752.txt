There are several R packages that will do up or down sampling for you using ROSE or SMOTE, but I personally have not had great luck with sampling methods. A different approach is to do the logistic regression as-is but then correct the intercept term as specified in: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/baby0s.pdf Unbalanced base rates are a fact of life, and are part of the problem you are trying to model.
