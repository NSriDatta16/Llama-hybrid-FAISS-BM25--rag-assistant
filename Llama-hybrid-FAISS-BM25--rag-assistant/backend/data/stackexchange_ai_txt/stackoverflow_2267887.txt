The issue could be really simple: you seem to forgot the newline after "a=sendrecv". :-) Anyway, here's an advice: For testing purposes you are probably better off using a tool rather than jumping right in and writing parts of the protocol. You can use sipp for this purpose, it makes a great tool for testing SIP networks. Other than that you could of course just sniff the network traffic between two working SIP devices and see how it differs from your traffic. EDIT: I missed this one before: You should omit a=fmtp:97 mode=20 , as the session description is invalid this way: You may only use the format parameter attribute for codecs that are mentioned in the media line. Codecs are identified via the payload type number (0=PCMU, 8=PCMA, 18=G723, ...). Some codecs don't have officially assigned numbers, for these the dynamic range 96-127 should be used: user agents are free to assign a number in this range via an rtpmap attribute. So, unless you specify which codec you mean by 97, there is no way for the other user agent to know which codec the format parameters should be applied to.
