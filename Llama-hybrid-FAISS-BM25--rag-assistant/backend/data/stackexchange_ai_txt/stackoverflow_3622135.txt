Break from for loop

Here is my code: def detLoser(frag, a): word = frag + a if word in wordlist: lost = True else: for words in wordlist: if words[:len(word) == word: return #I want this to break out. else: lost = True Where I have a return, I've tried putting in both return and break and both give me errors. Both give me the following error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Any Ideas? What is the best way to handle this?
