Another tricky preg_match

Just need to see if a paragraph contains a "stop word", the stop words are in an array below. I had the formula as: $pattern_array = array("preheat", "minutes", "stir", "heat", "put", "beat", "bowl", "pan"); foreach ($pattern_array as $pattern) { if (preg_match('/'.$pattern.')/i', $paragraph)) { $stopwords = 1; } } Which works well enough but for short words like 'pan' a word like 'panko' is identified as a stop word. So the regex would be something like it has to have a space before it or be the start of a new line and either end in a full stop/space/comma/(other non character objects). Also how could I tell php to exit the loop as soon as a stop word is identified? Thanks guys, slowing learning regex as I go!
