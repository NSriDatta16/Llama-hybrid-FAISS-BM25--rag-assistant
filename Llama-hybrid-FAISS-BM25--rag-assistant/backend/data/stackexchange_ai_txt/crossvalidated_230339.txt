You asked for alternative approaches. Here is one you might find useful. Let's begin by stating the obvious: you are implicitly assuming the five probabilities are equal. The expected total in the showcase equals the sum of those probabilities, whence it is five times any one of them. Yet the expected total is the average value of all possible totals, weighted by their chances of occurring. Since by design the possible total is always $3$, its average must be $3$. Therefore each probability is $3/5$. The power of this reasoning about expectations becomes clear when you generalize the question to $k$ cars in the showcase to be chosen (with equal probabilities) out of $n$ cars backstage.
