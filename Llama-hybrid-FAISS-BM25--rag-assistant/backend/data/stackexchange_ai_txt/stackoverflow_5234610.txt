How to handle page maintenance with spring MVC

Does anyone have expirience with maintenance page using spring MVC? What I am currently doing is I have one shell script which copies index.html and css to web app root folder, and when they are done with copying the maintanence site is displayed. In meantime I do changes I delete classes and upload the new ones and then delete html and css files and everything is back to normal. This works on tomcat server, but when I tried this on jboss server, I get 404 page which is trying to point to index.jsp which naturally doesn't exist. Is there a way to handle this more elegantly? I'm sure there must be, can someone share their expirience with this? thank you
