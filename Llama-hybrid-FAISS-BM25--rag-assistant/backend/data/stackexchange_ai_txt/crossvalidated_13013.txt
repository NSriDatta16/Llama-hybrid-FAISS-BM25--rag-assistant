First define the variables: Participant gender: between subjects predictor variable (two levels male, female) Gender of friend count: repeated measures predictor variable (two levels male friend, female friend) Friend count for a given gender: count based outcome variable Choose an analytic approach If the dependent variable had been a normally distributed variable, I'd suggest running a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA . If you log transformed the counts (e.g., log(count + 1) ) the assumptions of ANOVA might be a reasonable approximation for your purposes, although this arguably is not best practice. Alternatively, you could use something like generalised estimating equations ( I have some links to tutorials ) with a link function more suited to counts. Test the homophily effect With all the above approaches you will be left with two binary main effects and an interaction effect. The significance of the interaction effect will indicate whether the average of m-m and f-f friend counts are significantly different from the m-f and f-m counts. Examination of the raw data or the sign of any parameter would indicate the direction of your effect (which you have already seen in the sample data is a homophily effect rather than a heterophily effect )
