This is really very broad and I think these are really 2 or 3 different questions. I'll address the first one very briefly. Java utilizes garbage collection, or autmatic memory management. That is, arguably, the biggest difference between it from a language like C++. There are clearly some potential for increase in productivity in that you don't have to worry as much about memory, although in reality you do need to pay attention to your references. Perhaps you could refine your question a bit.
