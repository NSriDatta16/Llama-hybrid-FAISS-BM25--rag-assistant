Equilibrium distribution of Markov chain

The transition matrix is $$P =\begin{bmatrix} \frac12 & \frac12 & 0 & 0 \\ \frac12 & \frac12 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac13 & \frac23 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac13 & \frac23\end{bmatrix}$$ Now the question is how can I find all equilibrium distribution of this chain. I have got $2$ which are $(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 0, \frac13, \frac23)$ In order to find the other equilibrium distribution I tried $wP = w$ and I got $5$ equation upon which solving them I got $w_1=w_2, w_2=w_2, w_4 = 2w_3$ and $w_3=w_3$ , so I conclude that any probability vector of form $(a , a, b, 1-2a-b)(a,b \in \mathbb{R})$ can be equilibrium distribution but when I tried with few numbers for $a$ and $b$ it not giving me the same probability vector that I started with. I can't see what I am doing wrong
