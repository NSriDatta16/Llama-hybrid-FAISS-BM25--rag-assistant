Magento Catalog Price Rules

My catalog price rules consistently fail.. They've failed ever since 1.4.1. I've upgraded to 1.4.2 because some people said that it was fixed, unfortunately for me it wasn't. Cron runs. Cron job monitor reports various tasks being scheduled and successfully running. Everything except catalog price rules. What is the matter with this thing? I set my System -> Cron settings to: Generate schedules every: 60 Schedule ahead for: 1 Missed if not run within: 60 History cleanup every: 120 Success history lifetime: 120 Failure history lifetime: 120 Update#1. I'm looking at my cronmonitor.php file and I see catalogrule_apply_all was pending as of 1AM. I also see a lot of jobs that were missed. Update#2. At 2am catalogrule_apply_all disappeared from cronmonitor and I think the history was cleared, so I don't see anything under missed. I'm pretty sure that it was missed. So, now, how do I prevent it from being missed?
