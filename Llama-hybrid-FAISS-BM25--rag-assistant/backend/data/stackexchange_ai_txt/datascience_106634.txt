What are popular deep learning models for tabular data of texts?

I have a tabular dataset where every column is of type "text" (i.e. not categorical variable and essentially it can be anything). Let's suppose that the task is classification What are some popular methods to classify such data? I have this idea to transform each row to a document where values are separated with a special character (much like CSV). Then I could train a language model like BERT. I guess the special character can be a word by itself so it could signal the model the notion of columns. Is that approach popular and worth the shot? What are other approaches are known to be successful for my task?
