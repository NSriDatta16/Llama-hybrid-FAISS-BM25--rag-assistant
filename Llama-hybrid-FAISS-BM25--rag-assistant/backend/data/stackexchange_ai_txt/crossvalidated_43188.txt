Monte Carlo study to estimate bootstrap CI

I am asked to conduct a Monte Carlo study to estimate the coverage probabilities of the standard normal bootstrap confidence interval, the basic bootstrap confidence interval, and the percentile confidence interval. I am using the following code: ------------ START --------------------- B I need to "wrap" this into a function that generates a vector with bootstrap confidence intervals so that I can further determine the proportion of times that the confidence intervals miss on the left, and the proportion of times that the confidence intervals miss on the right. I am a novice to R programming and played around with some "for loops" without success. Can you direct me to where I need to go.
