What is the scientific term/keyword for "big data time series"?

There are business articles from 2014 and 2015 that the time series analysis of the big data is the next big thing. However Google returns almost no scientific articles under the query "big data time series". I am sure the the research happens in this direction but what terms should I use to find this research? Big Dependent data? Large time series? Temporal big data? Streaming big data?
