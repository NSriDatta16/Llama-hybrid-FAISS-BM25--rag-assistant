statistical use of "relation" vs "relationship"

When describing statistical models such as regression outputs, both terms the relation and relationship seem to be often used interchangeably. Examples include Summaries of papers in Wasserstein et al. 2019 including "...an observed relationship..." and "..local descriptions of relations between models and the obtained data...". Harrell's 2010 useR tutorial uses "relationships" and his blog uses both terms in the same post (e.g., Road Map for Choosing Between Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning . As an example with a simple linear regression with predictor variable $x$ , response variable $y$ , slope variable $b$ , and intercept $a$ , $y \sim a + b x$ , how would one describe the results? $b$ describes the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ ? or $b$ describes the linear relation between $x$ and $y$ ? I understand both terms have slightly different terms in common English (e.g,. this post on english.stackeschange.com , but have not been able to find statistical definitions for the two terms. Is the use of the two terms nuanced across sub-fields?
