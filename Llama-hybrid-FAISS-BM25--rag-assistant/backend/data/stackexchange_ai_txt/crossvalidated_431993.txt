About the need of splitting data in stacking

I learned stacking of machine learning in a book, hands-on machine learning 2nd edition (2019). The picture was cited from hands-on machine learning 2nd edition (2019). In the above situation, training set was split into 2 subsets. And the base predictors was trained on subset 1. Then the base predictors output values from the subset 2 and the blender was trained on this values. My question is.. 1. Why should the data used for training in the base predictors and the blender be different? And the author said "Next, the first layer’s predictors are used to make predictions on the second (held-out) set (see Figure 7-14). This ensures that the predictions are “clean,” since the predictors never saw these instances during training." 2. What does 'clean' mean in this sentence? I read a post of this link , but still i can't understand.
