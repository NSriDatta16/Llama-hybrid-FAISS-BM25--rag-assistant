openDatabase isn't a method on Context. It is a static method on SQLiteDatabase. Looks like you could change your code to db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(...). I would recommend reading the "Using Databases" section at this link: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db . The recommended way to create a database is to extend SQLiteOpenHelper, overriding the constructor and onCreate methods.
