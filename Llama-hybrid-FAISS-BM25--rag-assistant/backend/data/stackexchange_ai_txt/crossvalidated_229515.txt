Depends on where you NULLs are coming from. If NULL means that no previous contact was made, it makes sense to assign it a value like 1000, which assumes that in the three years that you have been tracking, no contact was made. You can decide this value as suits your case. In Case NULL means data is unavailable, I'll suggest replacing NULLs with the average 'previous_contact' value.
