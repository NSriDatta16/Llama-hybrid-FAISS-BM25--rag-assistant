Determining the effect of two coefficients combined when the model includes an interaction term

Imagine I'm trying to model traffic stops with a logistic regression. race = relevel(as.factor(c(rep("white", 3000), rep("black", 3000))), ref = "white") income = relevel(as.factor(c(rep("low", 1500),rep("high",1500), rep("low", 2000),rep("high",1000))),ref = "high") stop = c(rbinom(1500,1,0.5),rbinom(1500,1,0.4),rbinom(2000,1,0.8),rbinom(1000,1,0.5)) mod = glm(stop ~ race + income + race:income, family = "binomial") summary(mod) #Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) #(Intercept) 0.38600 0.01212 31.841 Further imagine I wanted to report the marginal effect of being a low income Black individual with regards to probability of being stopped, something like "compared to a high income white individual, a low income Black individual has a 1.29 OR of being stopped." If there were no interaction coefficients in the models, I could just add the coefficients: sum(coef(model)[c("raceblack",'incomelow')]) #[1] 0.252 I also learned from this Q&A that I can use general linear hypothesis testing. library(multcomp) glht(model, linfct = "raceblack + incomelow = 0") # General Linear Hypotheses #Linear Hypotheses: # Estimate #raceblack + incomelow == 0 0.252 My question is, since the model includes an interaction coefficient, should I also include the interaction coefficient when calculating the marginal effect? sum(coef(model)[c("raceblack",'incomelow','raceblack:incomelow')]) #[1] 0.3945 glht(model, linfct = "raceblack + incomelow + raceblack:incomelow = 0") # General Linear Hypotheses #Linear Hypotheses: # Estimate #raceblack + incomelow + raceblack:incomelow == 0 0.3945
