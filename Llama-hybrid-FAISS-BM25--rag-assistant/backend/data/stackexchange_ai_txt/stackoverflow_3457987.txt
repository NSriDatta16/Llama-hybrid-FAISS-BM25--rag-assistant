Can I check for HTTPS in Magento PHTML files?

I am installing Clicky code on a Magento website. I would like to use their HTTPS tracker only on HTTPS enabled pages of Magento. How can I do this? I tried but that doesn't work. Any suggestions on identifying HTTPS pages will be of great help! Thanks.
