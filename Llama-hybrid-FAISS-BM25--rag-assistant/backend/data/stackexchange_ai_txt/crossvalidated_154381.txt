Clustering by fitting many linear SVMs and clustering their weight vectors?

Let’s say I have a bunch of discrete sequence data, with each sequence belonging to some individual (there are ~1000 individuals and many more sequences). With a great deal of success, one can train a linear soft-margin SVM that includes some “bigram” and “history” features (among others) to predict the next outcome given a partial sequence. A different SVM is trained for each individual on the subset of sequences they are responsible for. If I wanted to cluster the individuals based on the tendencies that show up in the sequences, would it make sense to cluster the SVM weight vectors (or cluster the SVM parameters in some other way)? I am open to the idea that this is stupid or unlikely to be helpful. I am also open to the idea that there is a widely-used, better way of getting the result I want. I guess more broadly, if you have many instances of the same model, each making predictions for an individual, does it make sense to cluster the individuals based on their model parameters? Even pointers towards vaguely related papers would be helpful.
