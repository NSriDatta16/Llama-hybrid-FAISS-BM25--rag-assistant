The following code should do the task. With assumptions that files are not too large. You may have to do some modification to deal with edge cases (like double space, etc) # Get numers from file num = [] with open('1.txt') as file: num = file.readlines() # Get text from file text = [] with open('2.txt') as file: text = file.readlines() # Parse text into words list. data = [] for line in text: # For each paragraoh in the text sentences = l.strip().split('.') # Split it into sentences words = [] for sentence in sentences: # For each sentence in the text words = sentence.split(' ') # Split it into words list if len(words) > 0: data.append(words) # get desired result for i = range(0, len(num)/2): print data[num[i+1]][num[i]]
