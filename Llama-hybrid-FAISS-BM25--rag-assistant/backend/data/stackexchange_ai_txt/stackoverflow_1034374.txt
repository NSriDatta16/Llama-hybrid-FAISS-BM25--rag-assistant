Drag and Drop in MVVM with ScatterView

I'm trying to implement drag and drop functionality in a Surface Application that is built using the MVVM pattern. I'm struggling to come up with a means to implement this while adhering to the MVVM pattern. Though I'm trying to do this within a Surface Application I think the solution is general enough to apply to WPF as well. I'm trying to produce the following functionality: User contacts a FrameworkElement within a ScatterViewItem to begin a drag operation (a specific part of the ScatterViewItem initiates the drag/drop functionality) When the drag operation begins a copy of that ScatterViewItem is created and imposed upon the original ScatterViewItem, the copy is what the user will drag and ultimately drop The user can drop the item onto another ScatterViewItem (placed in a separate ScatterView) The overall interaction is quite similar to the ShoppingCart application provided in the Surface SDK, except that the source objects are contained within a ScatterView rather than a ListBox. I'm unsure how to proceeded in order to enable the proper communication between my ViewModels in order to provide this functionality. The main issue I've encountered is replicating the ScatterViewItem when the user contacts the FrameworkElement.
