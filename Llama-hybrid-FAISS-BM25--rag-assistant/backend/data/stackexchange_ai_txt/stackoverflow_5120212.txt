Figure out memory usage using SNMP on Windows

Currently i use the following to figure it out: For total memory: .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.2.0 For used memory i walk the following oid (gives me usage of each process): .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.5.1.1.2 and sum them all. However, this is very inaccurate, because it shows much less usage than if i use WMI or the performance monitor. Am i missing something? I do not want to use third party SNMP agents (like SNMP informant, which works correctly btw). I wanna figure it out using what's standard in windows.
