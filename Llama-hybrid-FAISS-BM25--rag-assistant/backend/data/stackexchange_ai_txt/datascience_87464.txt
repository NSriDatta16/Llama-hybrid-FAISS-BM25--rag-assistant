Classic sport match prediction

So, I am currently learning machine learning and data analysis. I have created for my self a problem that is: Who will win a match of soccer Now, I have narrowed it down as being a Binary Classification problem as I only want to figure out who will be the winner of a match. For this I have some data containing the following data points: Team One Team Two Duration Goal (Team One) Goal (Team Two) Winner Now, this is where the trouble begins (for me at least) I am unsure which features to choose for my model and also kind of off as to how to manage the data. Say that I have two teams playing (Liverpool vs Chelsea) now I do have around 5000 data points for all matches played however only around 82 points where it is Liverpool against Chelsea. Which dataset should I use? Also sometimes their position in the dataset changes meaning that sometimes Liverpool is Team One and sometimes Chelsea is Team One does this matter or should I process the dataset to always match one team at a certain position? In general, what is the best way to train my model? Should I use the small dataset containing only the matches between these two teams or should I go for all matches in general? I am sorry for the beginner question I really hope someone can help me out :)
