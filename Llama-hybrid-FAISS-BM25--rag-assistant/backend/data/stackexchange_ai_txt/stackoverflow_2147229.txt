This is a problem known from DRM applications - you want to make the data available to the user agent of your choice but not to the user operating the user agent. But, since the user agent is usually on the user's side, as Jon and Oded point out, a determined hacker will find a way to break the encryption. It's a cat and mouse game. You are trying to find a solution to exactly the same problem that people implementing DRM want to solve. Software-only user agents are easier to hack than hardware-assisted user agents, but in either case time works for the hackers. The latest development is the latter - embedding all the cryptography in hardware - like the HDMI's HDCP method (High-bandwith Digital Content protection Path) where they have essentially made the decrypted digital signal inaccessible to the user by letting it pass along black-box hardware from its point of decryption until it is made so available, but at the intended destination - TV screen. The key for HDCP to succeed however was implementing it in hardware. Most hackers have learned to deal with software. But since I would say there is 1 good hardware hacker per 100 good software hackers these days, the mouse hopes no cat will be around to catch it. Sorry for too much theory, it is essential to your problem though, I believe. If you are still willing to play the game, encrypt your XML files and make sure the decryption key is not available to potential hackers on a silver plate - i.e. obfuscate it, can't do much else.
