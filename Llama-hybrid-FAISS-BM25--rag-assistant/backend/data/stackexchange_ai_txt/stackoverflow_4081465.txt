There is ropevim . It is available on pypi as well The autoimport (adds missing imports) and organizeimport (reorder imports) features work well, but it is a little invasive at times (it will create a .ropeproject folder in your project). Rope code completion is also quite good so I use standard code completion with tab, and when it's not enough, I use ctrl-space to use ropevim autocompletion. Here are some of my mappings with ropevim: " Rope AutoImport and OrganizeImport nnoremap :RopeOrganizeImports 0 nnoremap :RopeAutoImport " Rope AutoComplete let ropevim_vim_completion = 1 let ropevim_extended_complete = 1 let g:ropevim_autoimport_modules = ["os.*","traceback","django.*","lxml.etree","lxml.*"] imap =RopeCodeAssistInsertMode() " Rope Menu menu Python.Create\ Package :RopeCreatePackage menu Python.Create\ Module :RopeCreateModule
