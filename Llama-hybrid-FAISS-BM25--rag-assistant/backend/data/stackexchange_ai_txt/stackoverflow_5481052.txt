You are looking at the basic concept of Process Migration . During what is known as strong migration, a process can be stopped on one machine and the entire state of the process migrated to another machine (including the program counter and all existing stacks). Before you go thinking that this is completely insane, think about this from a JVM perspective. Since you're application is already being run in virtual hardware; it isn't hard to stop the application and pick it back up where it left off since it is completely virtualized. If you would like another example, look at VMWare ; an entire machine can be paused and migrated to another machine and started again. It's very interesting stuff and usually relates mainly to Distributed Computing where you might have hundreds of agents that need to migrate from machine to machine as some go down for maintenance. I realize that I didn't give an example of this through JBoss; but giving a background on what exactly you're looking for can give you a much better insight into what to look for going forward.
