Let me question the idea of having HTTP header first. A more correct (WS-centric) approach is to set SOAP Header, not HTTP header. Consider this: SOAP messages can be delivered not only by HTTP, but by JMS, SMTP or custom transports. By requiring to have user-agent HTTP Header, you unnecessary tie you code to only one transport, albeit currently prevailing. This is the reason BTW why JAX-WS have no notion of HTTP headers except in handlers. And (of course) StackOverlow knows how to create SOAP headers.
