What you are doing is essentially PCA , even though you did not use this term. It is exactly PCA if your $X$ is centered; if not, then it is a sort of "uncentered PCA". In any case, to get from $A$ to $UD$ you need to right-multiply it with $V$: $$AV=UDV^\top V = UD.$$ So to apply the same transformation to $B$, you simply right-multiply it with $V$ too. If you only need the first $k$ columns, then you right-multiply with $V_k$ which is the matrix of the first $k$ columns of $V$.
