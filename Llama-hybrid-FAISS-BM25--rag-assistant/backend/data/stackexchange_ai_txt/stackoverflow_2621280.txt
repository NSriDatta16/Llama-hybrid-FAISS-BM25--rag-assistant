It's one of the modules mentioned in @murze's and @Jacco's answers in combination with the PATH_INFO mechanism that is used to "simulate" mod_rewrite-style URL rewriting. Using pathinfo, you can do the following: http://testserver/index.php/path/to/foo/bar/1/2/3/ This will invoke index.php and serve the remaining URL fragment as PATH_INFO . This is used, as I said, to set up a central front controller with "beautiful" URLs without mod_rewrite. Now in your case, the same thing happens, only that http://testserver/path/to/foo gets translated - either through mod_speling , the negotiation module or a third module whose name I forgot - into http://testserver/path/to/foo.php The rest of the path gets faithfully passed to that file. So it's intended behaviour, albeit weird and unexpected.
