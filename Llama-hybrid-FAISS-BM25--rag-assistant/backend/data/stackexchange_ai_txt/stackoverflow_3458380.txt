One way would be changing the way you store your points, because as you already noticed, it's hard to get what you want out of it. A much more useful structure would be a dict where the id maps to a list of points: from collections import defaultdict points_dict = defaultdict(list) # make the new dict for point in point_list: id = point["id"] points_dict[id].append(point['geom']) def avg( lst ): """ average of a `lst` """ return 1.0 * sum(lst)/len(lst) # now its simple to get the average for id in points_dict: print id, avg( points_dict[id] )
