iphone: UIwebview curl effect

I would like to make a standard view container which will give me the curl animation effect on multiple views. Something like uiscrollview and paging, only with a different animation(curl). I will be using UIwebviews as my separate pages. The problem: I do not know how to trap swipes in UIwebviews, But I see that UIscrollview implments this (swiping a uiwebview in a uiscrollview will bring me to the next view). I am therefore assuming that the implmentation of UIscrollview is trapping UIwebview swipes. How can i achieve the same functionality? I also need the UIWebview to keep functioning (as when embedding it in a uiscrollview)
