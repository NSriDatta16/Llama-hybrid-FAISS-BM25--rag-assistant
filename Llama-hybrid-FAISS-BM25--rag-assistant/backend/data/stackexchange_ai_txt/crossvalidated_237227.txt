Your approximation $$(D|\mathcal{M}_k)=\int p(D|\Theta_k,\mathcal{M}_k)p(\Theta_k|\mathcal{M}_k)d\Theta_k \\ \approx \sum_{i=1}^M p(D|\Theta_k ^{(i)},\mathcal{M}_k)$$ is alas incorrect when the $\Theta_k^{(i)}$ are generated from the posterior by MCMC. They should be generated from the prior ! (There is a $1/M$ missing as well but this is a typo.) This error can be found repeatedly in the literature, as we exposed in a Bayesian Analysis paper with Jean-Michel Marin discussing similar proposals by Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006). The core notion is that there is no simple efficient way to estimate the posterior probability of a model based solely on separate simulations from different priors. Reversible jump MCMC operates because it jumps between models and jumps at random.
