PHP Regex - Find url and text in html anchor tags

Hi there I was wondering whether someone know how to remove both the url and the link text from all anchor tags in a big paragraph of text. once remove if I could store them in an array for later use. Im sure this is possible but I really struggle with regex. Hopefully there is someone out there who has came across this before or who has some good knowledge on this. Thank you
