In this concrete example of applying sklearn knn (with kd_tree) on Iris Data Set, how many partitions are there?

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier provides an option kd_tree for algorithm parameter class sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, weights=’uniform’, algorithm=’auto’, leaf_size=30, p=2, metric=’minkowski’, metric_params=None, n_jobs=None, **kwargs) A k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. >>> from sklearn import datasets >>> iris = datasets.load_iris() >>> iris.data.shape (150, 4) In this concrete example of applying sklearn knn (with kd_tree) on Iris Data Set , how many partitions are there?
