Creating JPG thumbnails from PDF causes problems with new version of ImageMagick

I'm using Imagemagick to create thumbnails images of pdf files with this command: convert 'input.pdf[0]' -resize "100x140>" -colorspace 'rgb' 'output.jpg' 2>/dev/null Some of the PDFs are in CMYK color space, hence the specification of the expected -colorspace as rgb. This was working fine until I updated to the latest versions of Imagemagick(6.6.7-1) and ghostscript(9.01_0), now it looks like the conversion to rgb isn't working any longer, here is an example output: (The background should be white, not black) It seems though that the problem comes from the -resize option because if I remove it the output is correct. To get the expected output I now do two passes, the first to convert to rgb and the second to resize the image, but that's not very elegant. Is there a better solution?
