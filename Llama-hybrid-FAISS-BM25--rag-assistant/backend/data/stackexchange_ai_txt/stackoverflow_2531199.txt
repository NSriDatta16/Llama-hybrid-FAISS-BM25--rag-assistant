I saw this problem on a qualifying exam not long ago, and it smells like a homework problem. I will therefore make only two suggestions: Study binary search, with careful attention to the precise nature of the loop invariants. Jon Bentley's book Programming Pearls has a good explanation Try generalizing the invariants for binary search. Draw a picture with various special cases: Every number in DB1 is smaller than every number in DB2 Vice versa DB1 equals DB2 Every number in DB2 is twice the corresponding number in DB1 This is a fairly hard problem; you'll have an easier time if you go straight for a proof of correctness.
