The average of your sample of 1338 records is a single value, $\bar x$ . That $\bar x$ is, itself , a member of a distribution of averages of all possible simple random samples of 1338 records. You don't have access to any other members of this distribution, so you can't plot it. You can't resample it. It's out there, somewhere, in the world, waiting for someone else to gather exactly 1338 records and take an average. You did that thing, and obtained a single observation from that distribution. Your $\bar x$ . Even though we only have one observation from that distribution (of all possible $\bar x$ from samples size 1338), with some minimal assumptions about the distribution of $x$ (individual records), we can figure out a whole lot from the single observation of $\bar x$ that we have. Specifically, in relation to your question, we can compute the probability of having obtained a sample with that mean, (your actual, measured $\bar x$ ), if we hypothesize a potential mean for the whole population mean $\mu$ . Fortunately for you, someone else has made just such a hypothesis . Specifically, the administrator is concerned that the actual average charge has fallen below 12000. In other words, the administrator has hypothesized that "I hypothesize that the actual average is perhaps below 12000! We should gather evidence to test that hypothesis. SCIENCE!" This means that we can compute the probability of obtaining something as large as our measurement of $\bar x$ or larger in the event that the actual average actually were less than 12000. If this probability is low, then our $\bar x$ provides some evidence that the actual average is not, in fact, less than 12000 (because, if it were, then how did we obtain this totally improbable $\bar x$ ?) That probability is $p$ from your t-test. Note that your sample distribution doesn't factor into it. The central limit theorem comes into play when one wants to prove that the t-test works for situations like this. If you're not writing a proof, then you don't really need to use it. If you are curious as to just how close to a normal distribution the distribution of the sample mean is: This is a beta distribution with $\alpha=\beta=0.1$ It's pretty not normal. It's about the opposite of normal. But let's suppose that our population is distributed this way. If we plot the distributions of the sum of a simple random sample of $n$ observations from our population distribution (not to scale): Even for a sample as small as 16, the results are looking pretty normal-ish. Of course, we're usually trying to approximate the tails, so the shape of the middle there might be a little misleading, but this is converging really fast.
