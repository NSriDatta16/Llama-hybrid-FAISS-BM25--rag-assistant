The fastest way to do this is to build the content first with strings. It is MUCH faster to work with strings to build your document fragment before working with the DOM or jquery at all. Unfortunately, IE does a really poor job of concatenating strings, so the best way to do it is to use an array. var cont = []; //Initialize an array to build the content for (var i = 0;i bunch of text '); $('#container').html(cont.join('')); I use this technique a ton in my code. You can build very large html fragments using this method and it is very efficient in all browsers.
