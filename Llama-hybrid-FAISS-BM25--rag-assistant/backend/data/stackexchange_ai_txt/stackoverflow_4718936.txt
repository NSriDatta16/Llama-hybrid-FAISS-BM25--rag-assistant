If I where you, I would compare open source packages like magento and ubercart against hosted ones like our own SolidShops.com. Check out my blog post about magento (and open source ecommerce packages) versus hosted ones . I've outlined when to go best with open source / hosted depending on your situation. We've built SolidShops.com specifically for web designers that need an easy and flexible platform for building small to medium sized stores. It's hosted so you won't have to install, update, secure, backup, ... a thing Design is 100% flexible if you know html and css and it's a breeze to set up.
