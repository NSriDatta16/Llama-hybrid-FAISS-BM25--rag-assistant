How to find the bound of a time dependent variable?

I am working on modeling my problem statistically and I need to Know the bound or range of my variable. It is a time series variable position(t) where position(t+1) = position(t) + a.X - (1-a).Y a is a variable uniformly sampled between 0 and 1. X and Y are other variables that are given. I want to know the range position at all times that is what are the bounds of it in terms of X and Y.
