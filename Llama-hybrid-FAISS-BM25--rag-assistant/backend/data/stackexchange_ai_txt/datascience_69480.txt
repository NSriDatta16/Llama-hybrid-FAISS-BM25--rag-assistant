One solution could be to train a single embedding space, StarSpace is one such implementation. That single embedding space would contain all users, documents, and tags. Then it is a nearest neighbor search to recommend any combination. Given a user, find the nearest documents. Given a tag, find the nearest tags â€¦ For new entities (i.e., users, documents, or tags), split the individual entity into parts. For example, a document will have tokens or tag will be associated with documents that have tokens. Then find the average embedding of all the parts. That location in the embedding space is the approximately semantic meaning of new entities. Overall, this is a complex, open-end problem, thus there are many possible ways to create useful solutions. The next best solutions depend on what has already been done and what the next feature that would add the most value to end-users.
