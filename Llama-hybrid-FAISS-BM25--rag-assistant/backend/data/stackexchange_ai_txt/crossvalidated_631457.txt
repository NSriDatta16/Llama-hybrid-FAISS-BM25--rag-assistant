Does moving average smoothing affect future forecasts of a time series?

I'm trying to make a multivariate time series forecast using endogenous variables. My features show a lot of spikes (noise), and as I was researching some steps to handle it, I found moving average smoothing to be an option. But I have a question. If we use MA to smooth out the noise and build a time series model, then its forecast will also be a smoothed out result (without noise and spikes), right? But in ideal conditions, I would like too see some uncertainties in the forecast in order to be conservative in my results. Can someone help me understand what is the right approach to this?
