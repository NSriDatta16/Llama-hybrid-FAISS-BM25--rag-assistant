I like JRL/Wikipedia's answer. It's sometimes desirable to fill a column with NULL when you don't want to default it to an actual value. I mean, there are times when an empty string could be used instead of a NULL when you're working with a varchar. But what about a bit or date type? If a bit column is used then defaulting it to 0 or 1 may not really be sufficient. And what should the default date be for a date type? There's one more reason to use NULLS in some systems. SQL Server 2008 introduced the concept of sparse columns that have optimized storage for NULL values. They are best to use when you have a column that is likely to be mostly empty (or mostly NULL to be precise).
