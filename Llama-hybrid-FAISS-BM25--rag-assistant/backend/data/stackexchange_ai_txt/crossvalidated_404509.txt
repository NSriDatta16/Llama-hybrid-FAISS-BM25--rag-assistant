limit and stationary distribution of a Markov chain

Consider a Markov chain on the non-negative integers with transition probabilities $1/2$ if $y=x+1$ and $1/2$ if $y=0$ . Find $\lim_{n \to \infty} P(X_{n}=0)$ . Is this limit the same as the stationary distribution? What's the relationship between the two?
