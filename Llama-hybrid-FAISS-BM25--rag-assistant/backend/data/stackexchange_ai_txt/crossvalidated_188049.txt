The question is about a model for $V$ the volume of water used by an individual guest. The problem is not to, 'estimate the population mean and assign a confidence interval from a sample of $n$ individuals'. The $n$ in the solution formula only makes sense if thought of as a quantile of the standard normal distribution. In this case with $n \approx 2$ we have $ 118 - 2 \cdot 65 = -12$. This would mean impossible values of $V$ being generated for more than one in forty guests, on average. Making the normal a very poor model.
