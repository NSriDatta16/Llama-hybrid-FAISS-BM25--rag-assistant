Logistic regression with repeated measures?

I would like to make a prediction for a (new) subject to have a certain outcome given the historical data and the model: glm(outcome ~ age + treatment + history, family=binomial, ...) however in the historical data that will be fitted by the model, I have some sort of repeated measurements on some of the subjects (and I don't know if repeated measures is the appropriate term to be used here, hence using lmer etc is doubtful); example: subject_ID age treatment history outcome S_1 33 T_1 H_1 0 S_2 27 T_2 H_2 1 S_2 27 T_3 H_2 1 S_3 56 T_1 H_11 0 etc... In this example subject_2 (S_2) has two rows because he had simultaneously two different treatments at the same time. could a logistic regression still be used or should cases like subject_2 be removed from the analysis?
