Instead of sending the selectedindex as a query string parameter you could send the ID for the object or similar, something that uniquely can identify the object. Then in the details page you could fetch the correct object from the same datasource that the main list box get its data from (in your case "itemList" which could come from e.g. IsolatedStorage). If itemList is instantiated and kept only within the main page then you won't be able to fetch the item by ID from the details page. So in that case you'd need to move the itemList to some static or app level storage. HTH
