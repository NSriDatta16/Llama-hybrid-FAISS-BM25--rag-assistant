I'm the author of this doc. I called it a factory for consistency with JDK classes like DocumentBuilderFactory and TransformerFactory. Previous revisions of the example returned a default implementation if setInstance() was never called: public static CreditCardProcessor getInstance() { if (instance == null) { return new SquareCreditCardProcessor(); } return instance; } I changed it to avoid a compile-time dependency from the factory to its implementation. The class has setInstance() because it's simpler than the system properties the JDK uses to select an implementation at runtime. Since we're trying to motivate dependency injection it may seem unfair to show a fully-featured factory, even if that means being unfaithful to the original GoF pattern.
