Visualize high dimensional field arrows?

I have a big list of tuples (a, b), where both a and b are 9-dimensional vectors from the same space. This essentially encodes states of a system and some transitions. I would like to visualize the field described by these tuples, as arrows pointing from a->b, either in 2D or 3D. One of my problems however is that this is not a well-behaved vector field (not continuous) but I have reasons to believe that it can probably be laid out nicely, even in 2D. Does anyone know of a toolbox (for matlab/python) or program that can do this? This would presumably first involve some kind of dimensionality reduction on a and b and then plot little arrows from one point to another. Thank you for your help!
