If you can make the assumption that tuples with identical second elements appear in contiguous order in the original list x , you can leverage itertools.groupby : import itertools import operator def max_first_elem(x): groups = itertools.groupby(x, operator.itemgetter(1)) y = [max(g[1]) for g in groups] return y Note that this will guarantee preservation of the order of the groups (by the second tuple element), if that is a desired constraint for the output.
