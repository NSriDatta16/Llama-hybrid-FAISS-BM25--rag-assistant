nhibernate fetching entire tree

I need help fetching tree hierarchy from db using nhibernate 3.0 QueryOver.Of (() => entAlias) .JoinAlias(() => entAlias.ChildEntities, () => childEntityAllias, JoinType.LeftOuterJoin) .TransformUsing(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) I am getting only the two level of the graph (parent and its childrens) but not the childrens of children etc. The same is if I try to fetch parents of the leaf. I get only the parent of the leaf, but not parent of the parent of the parent... of the leaf. where level = n. Ho to do this type of query. no mather if Icriteria, linq, HQL or else.
