I think Tomas' answer addresses some of the misconceptions you seem to have with your question. First of all the binomial distribution assumes an infinite population where a sample of size N is selected. You do not formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and yet you do an integration that appears to assume a uniform prior on the proportion. Tomas shows you how to do the inference in the Bayesian framework using a Beta conjugate prior. In the frequentist framework you can ask what is the maximum likelihood estimate for p given a sample of size n from a binomial distribution where all n observations are failures? The likelihood function is L(p)=(1-p)$^n$,. ln[L(p)]= n ln(1-p) d/dp{ln[L(p)]} = -n/(1-p). -ln[l(p)] s maximum at p=0. If p=0 is not an acceptable answer because you know that p>0 and must be at least p$_0$ then thmaximum likelihood estimate under the constraint would be p=p$_0$. In the frequency approach parameters are not given probability distributions. So the question in your title can only be answered using the Bayesian approach. You can integrate the posterior distribution for p in the region p
