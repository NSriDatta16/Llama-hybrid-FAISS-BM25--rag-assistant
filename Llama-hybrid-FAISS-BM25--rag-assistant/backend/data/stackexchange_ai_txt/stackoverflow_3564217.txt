Auth timeout problems with CakePHP

This is really bugging me. Has been for years. No matter what I do with core.php or php.ini, my logins timeout after about an hour - usually. Some deployments of identical code and configuration timeout after a respectable amount of time. This is what I have at the moment on one site - timed out after about an hour: session.gc_divisor 1000 session.gc_maxlifetime 86400 session.gc_probability 1 Configure::write('Session.timeout', '28800'); Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', false); Configure::write('Security.level', 'medium'); And another - lasted all night: session.gc_divisor 100 session.gc_maxlifetime 14400 session.gc_probability 0 Configure::write('Session.timeout', '315360000'); Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', false); Configure::write('Security.level', 'medium'); Now, before you get excited and say, "Well, the answer is there in the Session.timeout value", let me tell you that this site usually times out after about twenty minutes!
