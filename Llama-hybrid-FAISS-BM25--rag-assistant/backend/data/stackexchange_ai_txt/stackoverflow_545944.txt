Sometimes, you have to estimate the expected conclusion, and then populate the test case from a run of the program. It's not so much of a mortal sin, as long as you're convinced it's correct. Those tests will then let you know immediately if a code change breaks the code. Also, if you're testing a subset, it's not that big of a stretch of trust. And for coverage? Cover every branch at least once (that is, any if or loop statements). Cover every threshold, both sides of it (for integer division that would be -1, 0, and 1 as denominators). Then add a few more in for good measure.
