The API makes no guarantees because these are based on the standard model of a trie. The best case is in O(1), with the average case being O(log n) and worst case O(n). From the documentation: This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains). These aren't the functions you asked for, but think about how Java will traverse the TreeSet.
