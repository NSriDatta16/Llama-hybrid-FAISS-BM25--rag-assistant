Logistic regression vs Recommendor system

I am trying to check my understanding with respect to recommendor systems. Here is my reasoning, option (a) is linear regression/neural net set up while option (c) and (d) appears to be standard application of recommendor system. Regarding option (b), I believe logistic regression would be a better model. However, can we make a claim that in case we have only 1 user then it is "ALWAYS" best to use logistic regression than a recommendor system. If not then please give a counterexample.
