No automated forecasting method can produce good forecast for all data. If that was the case, the field of statistics would be for want of a better word dead. The package forecast picks the best exponential smoothing model for the given data. It works best with the certain class of time series data, which is not the case for your data. The precise reason for the failure is evident if you try this ( ets is the workhorse behind the forecast ): > ets(weight,"AMM") Erreur dans ets(weight, "AMM") : Nonseasonal data Since you do not supply time series attributes, the forecasting algorithm cannot pickup cyclic component, so the end result is the flat line.
