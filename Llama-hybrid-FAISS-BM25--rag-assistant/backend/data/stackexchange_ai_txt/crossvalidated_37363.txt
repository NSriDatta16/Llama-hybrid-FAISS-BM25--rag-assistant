I don't like the notation used in the paper but they assume the error term is normal with mean 0 and constant variance. What they derive in section 2.2 is the conditional distribution of X(t) given the previous k observations for a kth order AR process. The result is really rather simple. The model is as follows: X(t)= a$_1$ X(t-1) + a$_2$ X(t-2)+...+ a$_k$ X(t-k) + e$_t$ where e$_(t)$ is normal mean 0 and variance σ$^2$. In this formulation the AR coefficients are given and the time series points X(t-j) for j=1,2,..., k are all given. So all the terms except e$_t$ are fixed values. So this means that you are just adding a constant to a single normal random variable. So the conditional distribution of X(t) given X(t-1)=x(t-1), X(t-2)=x(t-2), ..., X(t-k)=x(t-k) is normal with mean a$_1$ x(t-1) + a$_2$ x(t-2)+...+ a$_k$ x(t-k) and variance σ$^2$.
