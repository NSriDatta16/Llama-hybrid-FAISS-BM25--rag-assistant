Calculating pooled p-values manually

For reasons I won't go into I need to calculate parameter estimates from several imputed datasets. Based on this CV post about Rubin's rules I have determined how to manually calculate both the pooled coefficient and standard error. However the method for the p -value eludes me. If it were up to me I would make do with the pooled coefficient and se, but I know my boss will want the p -value. Here is the toy analysis. First the imputation. require(mice) set.seed(123) nhimp Create a matrix of extracted estimates from the model applied to each of the five complete imputed datasets. 1st column are the coefficients, 2nd column are the variances, 3rd column are the p -values. (mat Now for the pooled estimates. The pooled estimate of the regression coefficients is easy: it's just the mean of the coefficients (first column (pooledMean Calculating the pooled estimate of the standard error is a bit more tricky, but still relatively simple. Total variance is the sum of within-variance and between-variance*degrees-of-freedom-correction. Within variance is the average of the imputation specific point estimate variances (withinVar Between variance is the variance of the coefficients (variance of first column, or sd of first column squared. (betweenVar The degrees of freedom correction is (m+1)/m where m is the number of imputations (dfCorrection Now we can calculate total variance (totVar The pooled standard error is just the square root of the total variance (pooledSE Now is the part I don't know: how to get the pooled estimate of the p -value (pooledP Put them all together (pooledEstimates These should be exactly the same as the pooled values for these parameters returned by mice fit The manually calculated pooled coefficient and se are the same as those yielded by the pool() function; but not the p -value. Can anyone explain simply the way mice calculates the pooled p-value? This post explains how to do it with software but I need to calculate it manually.
