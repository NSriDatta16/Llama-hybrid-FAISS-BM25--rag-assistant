No module named "" error when loading the pickle file

I created a model and I saved it in a pickle file using the Algorithm SVR(Support Vector Regression) import pickle pickle.dump(model,open('carb patients data/Pickles/svr.pickle', 'wb')) In jupyter notebook it gives an error can't pickle _thread.RLock objects So I converted that jupyter file in to a .py file and downloaded it and executed using the Python Idle. Then it got saved in that particular location. But when I try to load my pickle file from another Jupyter Notebook it gives an error called, No module named 'sklearn.svm._classes' The code how i tried to load the pickle file, from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, flash, jsonify import numpy as np import pickle as p import json from sklearn import ensemble app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/api/', methods=['POST']) def makecalc(): data = request.get_json() prediction = np.array2string(model.predict(data)) return jsonify(prediction) if __name__ == '__main__': modelfile = 'Clustering Patients/carb patients data/Pickles/svr.pickle' model = p.load(open(modelfile, 'rb')) app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0') Any thing I have done wrong or is it an issue in the Jupyter Notebook? How can I load my saved pickle file?
