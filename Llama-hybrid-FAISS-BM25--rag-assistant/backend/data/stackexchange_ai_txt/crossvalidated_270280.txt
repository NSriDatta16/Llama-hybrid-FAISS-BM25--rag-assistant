How to fix spikes and missing values in times series?

I have some data representing times series about houses costs in specific areas. Some of the values along the times series (30 points = 30 months) are missing or are totally wrong (huge spikes). What I am doing right now is to calculate the average and the standard deviation to eliminate first zeros and spikes and replace them with a smooth interpolation from the extremes of the holes. It works fine in some cases but not always. Is there any better way to fix these problems? UPDATED An idea may be the "1-D median filtering" (Media filter)
