Well, one potential problem you could have it too many connection pools! Connection pool will be based on the exact connection string - if two connection strings differ only by a space, they'll be considered different, and one connection pool will be created for each. So make sure all your connection strings are absolutely identical. Also, one connection pool will be created per Windows identity - so if you use server=myServer;Database=MyDatabase;integrated security=SSPI then for each separate Windows user that will connect, a connection pool is being created. See the relevant MSDN documentation for this (fourth paragraph from the top): Connections are separated into pools by connection string, and by Windows identity when integrated security is used. So in a heavy loaded production environment, it might be a better idea to use a single "application user" and have just a single connection pool: server=myServer;Database=MyDatabase;user id=MyAppUser;pwd=MyAppUserPwd If you make sure all client machines are all using this exact same connection string, only a single connection pool will be created.
