Here's a tutorial: http://java-x.blogspot.com/2006/12/implementing-jms-with-spring-message.html I have no idea what you're talking about when you say "home and remote interfaces". You said Spring POJO, but home and remote interfaces are EJB 2.0 artifacts. The important question to answer is: Are your message driven component EJBs (MDB) or Spring POJO (MDP)? If they're EJBs, I totally understand why you need home and remote interfaces. If not, I would say this could be a pure web app, packaged in a WAR, without the EJB XML. You also need a JMS queue to be set up. Have you done that properly? WebLogic 8.1 means JMS 1.0.2. That's an OLD version of WebLogic and JDK. Why aren't you using WebLogic 10 and JDK 6?
