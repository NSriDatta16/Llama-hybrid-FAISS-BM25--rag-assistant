see http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-cancel In the case of the demo, this line: cancel: 'a.ui-icon',// clicking an icon won't initiate dragging Needs to change to: cancel: 'a.ui-icon, #trash li', // add selector for items in trash I haven't tested, but it should work Demonstration Is that what you want? Also added #trash .gallery li img {cursor: default;} to the css.
