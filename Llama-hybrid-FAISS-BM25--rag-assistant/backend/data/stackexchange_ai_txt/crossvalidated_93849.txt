From logistic regression coefficients to marginal distributions of the dependent variable

I have the coefficients for a logistic regression model with $25$ independent variables of mixed continuous and categorical types. Considering one particular categorical independent variable with $2$ levels so that in the linear model we have a term $x_{i1}$ taking a value of either $0$ or $1$ and an associated coefficient $\beta_1$, is it possible to infer from the value of $\beta_1$ what proportion of $y_i$ in the data used to train the model had a value of $1$?
