Strong name verification failed for the instrumented assembly - Ninject

We've just started using Ninject in a Visual Studio project. When I run the tests with Code Coverage enabled I get the error below: Strong name verification failed for the instrumented assembly 'Ninject, Version=2.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=c7192dc5380945e7'. Please ensure that the right key file for re-signing after instrumentation is specified in the test settings. In Test > Edit Test Settings > Local > Data and Diagnostics > Code Coverage It is enabled. I've selected the dll's which I wish to cover. We've set re-signing to the strong key that we're using for the project. However I'm still getting the error Does anyone know how to get around this?
