$\hat R$ doesn’t mean that your model converged. Is is one of several criteria that can be used to judge convergence. Usually you should not any of the criteria alone, but look at several different criteria. As noticed by Aki Vehtari et al (2019), there are cases where it fails. Moreover, when MCMC sampling you’re not only concerned about convergence but also about having enough samples to be able to draw conclusions from the data. Using $\hat R$ alone is not the best idea.
