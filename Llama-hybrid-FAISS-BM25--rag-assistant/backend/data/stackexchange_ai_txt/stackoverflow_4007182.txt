(Bi-)linear and (bi-)cubic resampling are not just ugly but horribly incorrect when downscaling by a factor smaller than 1/2. They will result in very bad aliasing akin to what you'd get if you downscampled by a factor of 1/2 then used nearest-neighbor downsampling. Personally I would recommend (area-)averaging samples for most downsampling tasks. It's very simple and fast and near-optimal. Gaussian resampling (with radius chosen proportional to the reciprocal of the factor, e.g. radius 5 for downsampling by 1/5) may give better results with a bit more computational overhead, and it's more mathematically sound. One possible reason to use gaussian resampling is that, unlike most other algorithms, it works correctly (does not introduce artifacts/aliasing) for both upsampling and downsampling, as long as you choose a radius appropriate to the resampling factor. Otherwise to support both directions you need two separate algorithms - area averaging for downsampling (which would degrade to nearest-neighbor for upsampling), and something like (bi-)cubic for upsampling (which would degrade to nearest-neighbor for downsampling). One way of seeing this nice property of gaussian resampling mathematically is that gaussian with very large radius approximates area-averaging, and gaussian with very small radius approximates (bi-)linear interpolation.
