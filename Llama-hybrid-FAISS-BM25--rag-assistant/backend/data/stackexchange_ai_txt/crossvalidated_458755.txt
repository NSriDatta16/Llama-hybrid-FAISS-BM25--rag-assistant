I would second user2974951's comment (+1). Deep Learning entails stacking or layering within a methodology. Points 1, 2 & 4 have been fully answered by Karolis (+1). Regarding point 3: There are works that combined SVM and DNN. (e.g. Tang (2013) Deep Learning using Linear Support Vector Machines where it shows very promising results in replacing with L2-SVM an softmax activation function, or Jiu (2017) Nonlinear Deep Kernel Learning for Image Annotation where multiple kernel learning is presented within a deep learning framework.) In addition to that kernel methods like Gaussian Processes have also seen a resurgent when effectively stacked on top of each other (e.g. see Damianou & Lawrence (2013) Deep Gaussian Processes for fully recurrent way of stacking GPs or Dunlop et al. (2018) How Deep Are Deep Gaussian Processes? for a more in-depth discussion).
