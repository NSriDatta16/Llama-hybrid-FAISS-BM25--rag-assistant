The code should operate without error, since the admin functions without implementation will not be called. The only thing that is really being wasted is bandwidth to transmit the admin code that is not used. However, let me caution against security through obscurity. If the user were to view this code and see that there are admin functions that they cannot access, they might get curious and try to download the "admin.js" file and see what these functions do. If your only block to keeping admin functions from being performed is to stop including the file, then some crafty user will probably quickly find a way to call the admin functions when they should not be able to. If you already do server side authentication/permissions checking for the admin function calls just ignore my previous paragraph :-)
