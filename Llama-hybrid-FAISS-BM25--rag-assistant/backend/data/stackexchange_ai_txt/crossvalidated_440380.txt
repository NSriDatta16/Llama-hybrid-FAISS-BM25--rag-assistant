What does it mean when we say the estimators need to be independent when using Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning?

In collective learning (ensemble methods) we need the estimators to be Independent/ uncorrelated from one another. Do I understand correctly, that this means we need to draw the data samples without replacement?
