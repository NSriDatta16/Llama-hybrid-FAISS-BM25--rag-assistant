I believe it is not so much the sparsity, but the high dimensionality usually associated with sparse data. But maybe it is even worse when the data is very sparse. Because then the distance of any two objects will likely be a quadratic mean of their lengths, or $$\lim_{dim\rightarrow\infty}d(x,y) = ||x-y|| \rightarrow_p \sqrt{||x||^2 + ||y||^2}$$ This equation holds trivially if $\forall_i x_i=0 \vee y_i=0$. If you increase the dimensionality and sparseness enough so that it holds for almost all attributes, the difference will be minimal. Even worse: if you normalized your vectors to have length $||x||=1$, then the euclidean distance of any two objects will be $\sqrt{2}$ with high probability. So as a rule of thumb, for Euclidean distance to be usable (I'm not claiming useful or meaningful) the objects should be non-zero in $3/4$ of attributes. Then there should be a reasonable number of attributes where $|y_i| \neq |x_i-y_i| \neq |x_i|$ so the vector difference becomes useful. This also applies to any other norm-induced difference. Because in the situation above $|x-y| \rightarrow_p |x + y|$ I don't think this is a desirable behavior for distance functions to become largely independent of the actual difference, or the absolute difference converging to the absolute sum! A common solution is to use distances such as Cosine distance. On some data they work very well. Roughly speaking, they only look at attributes where both vectors are non-zero. An interesting approach is discussed in the reference below (they didn't invent it, but I like their experimental evaluation of the properties) is to use shared nearest neighbors. So even when vectors x and y have no attributes in common, they might have some common neighbors. Counting the number of objects connecting two objects is closely related to graph distances. There is a lot of discussion on distance functions in: Can Shared-Neighbor Distances Defeat the Curse of Dimensionality? M. E. Houle, H.-P. Kriegel, P. Kr√∂ger, E. Schubert and A.
