You should take a look at Bespin . You have a good description here: http:// mozillalabs.com/bespin/2010/01/15/bespin-embedded-0-6-released-now-in-two-great-flavors/ It has a full support for being embedded. See the embedding doc : https:// bespin.mozilla.com/docs/embedding/index.html You can write a custom syntax highlighting plugin pretty easily if needed. You can probably fork and adapt one of the built-in syntax highlighters. The editor itself and its plugins are written in Javascript. The project is aimed at being a complete web-based & collaborative code editor, so intellisense-like features should make their way in soon if they're no alreay present.
