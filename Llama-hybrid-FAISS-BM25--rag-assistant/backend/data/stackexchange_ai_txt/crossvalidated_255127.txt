Can I generate adjacency matrices from directed graph images?

I have some images of very simple directed graphs with just a few nodes and edges. I know there is lots of tools, which print out graphs with a adjacency matrix is an input, but I need to do it the other way around. For example Das and Chanda 's paper covers this technique, but on a more advanced level. Their approach covers quite complex graphs, possibly even hand-written. However the graphs I am targeting are much simpler and all machine generated. For example if I get this image as an input: I would expect the following adjacency matrix as an output: +---+---+---+ | | A | B | +---+---+---+ | A | 0 | 1 | | B |-1 | 0 | +---+---+---+ Does someone know a tool that is capable doing this or can provide me some resources on how I can develop such a tool myself? I was thinking about a convolutional neural network for simple object recognition, which in this case would be the nodes and edges. Do you think this approach might work or would it be overkill?
