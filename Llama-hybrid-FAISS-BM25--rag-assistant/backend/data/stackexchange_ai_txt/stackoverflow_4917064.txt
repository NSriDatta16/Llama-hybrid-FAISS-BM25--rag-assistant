Checkout the string.Intern method, that could help you out: http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/strings.html http://en.csharp-online.net/CSharp_String_Theory%E2%80%94String_intern_pool However looking at your requirements, I think you are over engineering it. You have 1000 strings at 20 chars = 1000 * 20 * 2 = 40,000 bytes, that's not much memory. If you really have a large amount, store it in a DB with an index. That would be much faster than anything the average programmer can come up with.
