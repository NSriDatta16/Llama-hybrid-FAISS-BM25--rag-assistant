1) There is wide agreement that logistic regression doesn't work well with rare event data. The logistic distribution is Gumbel or double exponential distributed and simply isn't heavy-tailed enough. One workaround is to use poisson regression, which does fit rare event data. 2) I'm not sure what you mean by "is PCA acceptable?" One issue with rare event data that standard, Gaussian, linear PCA definitely won't deal with well is sparsity. A number of papers have made recommendations regarding more robust PCA approaches. One of the best is Xie and Xing's robust Cauchy PCA which also reviews many other robust solutions. http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6506 Regardless, I still think you should clarify what you mean by "acceptable?"
