How can one easily set up sproc parameters in a strongly-named DataSet in Visual Studio 2005?

I don't usually work with this type of data layer so I'm not familiar with all the terminology and it's difficult to search for answers. I have an XSD file in Visual Studio 2005, and I'm looking at the GUI editor. I created a table adapter by dragging a stored procedure onto the form. That stored procedure is basically a SELECT statement with a few parameters. It seems that this has automatically populated the SelectCommand properties for the table adapter. Now I want to bring in a stored procedure to populate the UpdateCommand properties. The only way I know of to do this is to open the properties pane for the table adapter and expand the UpdateCommand properties. From there I select StoredProcedure as the CommandType and I select the stored procedure from the CommandText dropdown. At this point one would imagine it might import all of the parameters by analyzing the stored procedure, but when I go to the parameters collection, it's empty, and I seem to have to set up all 30 or so parameters by hand. Surely there must be a faster and less error-prone way to do this. I imagine I'm missing something very fundamental. What is it?
