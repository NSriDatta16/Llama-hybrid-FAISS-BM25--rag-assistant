This is not the way web sites are usually built, so in a sense you are swimming upstream. It may have seemed the shorter path when you began, but you will probably find that you must do a lot more work as a result of your initial decision. That said, be sure to start with all the divs hidden and then display the selected one. I also recommend Cowboy's BBQ plugin which will help you deal with back button as well as reload: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
