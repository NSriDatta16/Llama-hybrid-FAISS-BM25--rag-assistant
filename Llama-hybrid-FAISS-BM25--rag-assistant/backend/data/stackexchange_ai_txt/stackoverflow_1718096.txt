As long as you don't move/rename files, you can use the TSVN command "create patch" on your working copy, save the patch file. Then in your office right-drag the patch file to the working copy, choose "apply patch" and save the modifications. Exporting the working copy of course works too, but depending on how big your working copy is, creating and applying patchfiles would save some space.
