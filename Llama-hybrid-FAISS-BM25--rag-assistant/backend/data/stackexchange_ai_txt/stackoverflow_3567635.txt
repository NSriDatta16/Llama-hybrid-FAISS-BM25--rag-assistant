Finding value in a SQL table

I have a simple question here (I know it is so simple but I just got stuck...) I have a table tag_id, search_id 1,1 2,1 4,2 2,2 5,2 I would like to get the search_id by giving the tag_ids example: tag_id 1,2 would return search_id 1 tag_id 4,2,5 would return search_id 2 tag_id 2,6 would return no result. I should have pay more attention when I was in college... thanks in advance!
