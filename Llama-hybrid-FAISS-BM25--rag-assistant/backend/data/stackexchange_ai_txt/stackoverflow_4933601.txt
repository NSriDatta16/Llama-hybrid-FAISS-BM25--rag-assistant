You've noted that your working set goes up after new/malloc . This is because they ask the OS for memory. You've also noted that it does not go down after delete/free . This is because they don't return memory to the OS. On a normal, sane system, this is not a problem. The unused memory space for your process will end up in swap, untouched and out of RAM. On this special box, you'd be better off to override operator new with a direct call to HeapAlloc and operator delete with a call to HeapFree . Do enable the low-fragmentation heap for Server 2003; it's already the default for 2008.
