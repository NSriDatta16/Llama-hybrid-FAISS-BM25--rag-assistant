The way to estimate the marginal risk ratio after BART is the following: Under each treatment level, compute the posterior of the marginal risks by averaging across the rows (i.e., compute the column means to get a vector of marginal risks, which is the posterior for the marginal risk under each treatment level). Divide each member of the vector for $X=1$ by the corresponding member of the vector for $X=0$ . This new vector is the posterior for the risk ratio. If you want predicted individual risk ratios, you can just divide the $p_1$ matrix by the $p_0$ matrix. Each row is the posterior of the predicted individual risk ratio for each unit. Note that the average of the predicted individual risk ratios for each draw of the posterior is not equal to the marginal risk ratio because the risk ratio is not collapsible (and taking the log doesn't make it so). You don't need to take logs because you estimated the risks directly, and the risk ratio is just a function of the risks.
