Is there a YSlow-like tool for IE7?

I love YSlow for Firebug / Firefox , but I've hit a situation where I want to profile an HTTPS site, that doesn't physically work outside of IE6/7 (e.g. no IE8, no Firefox, no Chrome) Fixing the site to work in all browsers is officially Step #1, but to do some analysis and benchmark the existing site (which will help in reporting overall goal achievement) I really need to be able to profile the existing site. In particular the info I'm looking for is: Overall page speed Static content (what images, css, js files) are cached, minimized, gzipped Counts/locations of slow CSS (e.g. usage of CSS Expressions) Cookie info Image sizes Duplicate scripts/css File sizes etc. Without a specific do-all tool, are there specific tools that will help me solve part(s) of the puzzle. e.g. I have Fiddler2 set up... which will give me HTTP(S) sessions, headers, requests, filesizes, gzipping, etc. I have a bookmarklet or two that will tally up duplicate scripts/css I have the IE7 developer tools installed so that I can view the HTML and inspect things Using the above I can extract most of the info and then tally up my own "score"/checklist of things that need attention however it is a fair amount of work. :-( Does anyone have some better tools for this? Is there a YSlow-like tool for IE7??
