How to mitigate class declaration being far from its owner namespace declaration in a file?

So, I've seen how useful namespaces can be to organize declarations into their respective groups, but now comes an issue with this. The difference between making a library in C and a library in C++ is in C you must prefix your declarations with what they belong to, for example a library we'll dub MyMath might have a vector class, well the name might be MM_Vector. In C++, you would have a namespace MyMath with a Vector class declared as a part of it. Now the difference here is in C, just by going to the class declaration you immediately know how to use it. In C++, you would have to check which namespace a particular class belongs to (really only a problem in files where the declaration isn't near the namespace declaration, which can be common if there are constants and enumerations declared between the two). While I prefer using a namespace for organization, in my opinion this is still a valid argument as an annoyance. What have people done to reduce this annoyance?
