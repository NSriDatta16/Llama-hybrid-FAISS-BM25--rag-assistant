Smart table drag and drop WPF C#

I am trying to add a drag and drop behaviour for a textblock in a smart table application. I used a window in order to mimic the textblock i wanted to drag. The problem is that on the emulator on my PC the drag works, but on the table it doesn't. From what i could figure out this is due to the fact that on the table the object (the window that mimics the drag object) loses focus. The application is made in WPF with C#. Any ideea on how i might fix this?
