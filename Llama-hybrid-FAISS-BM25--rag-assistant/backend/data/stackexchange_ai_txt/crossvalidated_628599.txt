Well, most people have and do take averages of something else. Since these are college students, they probably know their GPA. Hmmm. Your GPA is 3.415? But no course gives that grade. Fans of just about any sport will take averages of something. Goals per game, hits per at bat, whatever. Ask what sport they like. Lionel Messi averages 0.79 goals per game. You can't get 0.79 goals! And so on.
