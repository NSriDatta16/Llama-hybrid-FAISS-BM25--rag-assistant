How to read groups of integers from a file, line by line in C++

I have a text file with on every line one or more integers, seperated by a space. How can I in an elegant way read this with C++? If I would not care about the lines I could use cin >>, but it matters on which line integers are. Example input: 1213 153 15 155 84 866 89 48 12 12 12 58 12
