See the oninput event, and my write up about it here . oninput fires for all forms of text input - including cut, paste, undo, redo, clear, drag and drop and spelling corrections. It's a HTML 5 event which isn't supported in Internet Explorer 8 and lower (but it is in the latest IE 9 preview). However, Internet Explorer supports a proprietary event on all DOM objects - onpropertychange . This fires whenever the value of an input element changes. I didn't notice you'd tagged with jquery â€” since you did, it's probably worth mentioning that I wrote a plugin to implement the oninput event cross browser. You can find it here .
