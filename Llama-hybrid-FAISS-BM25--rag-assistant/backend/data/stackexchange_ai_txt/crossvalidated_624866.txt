Null model for cross-correlation

I have two time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ . The cross-correlation at lag $\tau$ is defined as $$ C(\tau) = \frac{\langle X_t \; Y_{t-\tau}\rangle - \langle X_t \rangle \langle Y_{t-\tau} \rangle }{\sigma_X \sigma_{Y}}. $$ I want to compute a null model for $C(\tau)$ at each lag $\tau$ . For normal correlation ( $\tau = 0$ ) I would generate many times the surrogate series $\tilde{X_t}$ and $\tilde{Y_t}$ by shuffling the original series and then computing the null model $\tilde{C} = \frac{\langle \tilde{X_t} \; \tilde{Y_t}\rangle - \langle \tilde{X_t} \rangle \langle \tilde{Y_t} \rangle }{\sigma_X \sigma_{Y}}$ . For cross correlation I could do the same but I have two problems: Shuffling destroy 0 lag correlation but I'm not sure what happen at different lags. So is this really a good null model when $\tau\neq0$ ? Since I am testing multiple lags, do I have to correct for the multiple comparison problem ?
