Probability Distributions

I was going thru a course on probability and probability distributions for data science and in that they were describing the various probability distributions with mathematical formulae. I was wondering how does a data scientist or a statistician use probability distribution in real life? Could someone please provide couple of real life examples on how these are used? Wanted to understand the application of these as just reading theory did not give me the intuition on how to use them. Many thanks.
