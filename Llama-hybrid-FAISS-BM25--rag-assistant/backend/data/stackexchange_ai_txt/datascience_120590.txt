To reduce the number of features from the raw data to 64 input neurons, you can perform dimensionality reduction . There are various methods to do this, here are some common ones that are easy to implement. Principle Component Analysis Autoencoders (basically another neural network that you can train unsupervised) Random projections (Make a 784x64 random matrix and multiply)
