Turns out that character encoding is not the issue. The HBO.com web site returns different content based on the USER-AGENT: header. So if you use Android to talk with the hbo.com site, they return a message about how you could use there own android client to access the site. They probably are trying to help people using web browsers. Changing the USER-AGENT then caused the above program to get the correct (and parse-able) xml document.
