Likelihood function for number of slots taken over slots available

I have a study in which I am comparing the number of outpatient visits a certain surgery experiencse in a same period in two different years; the total number of visits is a limited by the number of slots per week. The periods cover 2-3 months, and to simplify the model I summed up the number of visits in these period and the total number of slots. I don't think this assumption introduces too much bias because the numerosity is very low and the visit slots are never filled up. I am approaching this from a Bayesian point of view and I applied a binomial model, conditional on the number of available spots in a certain period, for example: $$ Visit \sim Binomial(Slots, p) \\ logit(p) = \beta_{year} \\ \beta_{year} = some\_prior() $$ My question is if the Binomial likelihood is appropriate. Patients showing up requesting a visit are more or less independent events, but the number of slots I'm not sure can be intended as the number of independent trials. Is there a more appropriate likelihood function? Would the difference be noticeable?
