The question boils down to the purely mathematical consideration -- " when are inequalities preserved ?". If you make changes that preserve ordering, then inequalities will be preserved. Consider a simple probability statement like $P(a\leq X\leq b)=c$ and a monotonic-increasing (i.e. order-preservng) transformation, $g()$. Then $P(g(a)\leq g(X)\leq g(b))=c$. (With a monotonic decreasing function the probability is preserved but the direction of the inequalities would flip.) $\qquad$ But if $g$ were not monotonic, such a statement would not be true in general. e.g. consider $g(x)=(x-m)^2$, where $m=\frac{a+b}{2}$ and $X$ continuous, then $P(g(a)\leq g(X)\leq g(b))=0$. So you can't take a function like $\cos$ and hope that in general the interval with transformed limits will preserve the coverage in the original probability statement. If the random variable on an interval is such that $\cos$ is monotonic increasing over that interval, then the probability statement would be preserved. Note that if $\bar{X}$ is positive then you can divide through by it while leaving the inequality unaltered, since dividing all terms by a positive constant preserves ordering. (This could be relaxed to almost surely while preserving the probability statement.)
