Are you looking for Thread Local storage using the ThreadStatic attribute ? public static class ThreadLocalExample { // There will be one Foo instance per thread. // Each thread will have to initialize it's own instance. [ThreadStatic] private static Foo bar; } Of course you could add some helper methods or properties to the above to help you manage the instance, including ensuring initialization on each thread.
