Animate Content in a Grid Column

I'm trying to write a basic proof-of-concept for having a grid layout, with two columns with content in them, plus a third column that has only a GridSplitter. The content in the left-most column will be resized by the GridSplitter, but I'd also like to have some collapse and expand buttons that shrink/grow this same column. Basically like the Solution Explorer in visual studio, which can be dragged bigger, or just unpinned, which collapses it. The code is below. LeftPanel is what I'm trying to animate. If I set a Width on LeftPanel, it animates, but no longer automatically re-sizes to fill the grid column when I drag the GridSplitter around. And when I leave off Width from LeftPanel, or set it to Auto, it animates, but no longer resizes with the GridSplitter. I looked at this post about adding a DependencyProperty to animate the GridColumn directly, but again, dragging the GridSplitter would break it. Shrink Grow Handlers private void Button_Grow(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { sbGrow.Begin(); } private void Button_Shrink(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { sbShrink.Begin(); }
