How do I save an object that contains and EntitySet?

Say I have an User (mapped to a User table) and the Edit view (in MVC) displays a multiselectlist of Modules (mapped to a Modules table) that user can access, with the Modules pre-selected based on the User's EntitySet of Modules. I have tried saving the User then deleting all User_Modules manually and adding them back based on what's selected on submit, but the User has a null EntitySet for User.User_Modules. I cannot find the correct way to handle this scenario anywhere online. Can anyone help? Edit: adding my EntitySet code private EntitySet _UserModules; [Association(Storage = "_UserModules", ThisKey="UserId", OtherKey = "UserId")] public EntitySet UserModules { get { return this._UserModules; } set { this._UserModules.Assign(value); } }
