Yes, this is a totally viable solution and probably it would work. However in my experience, even CNNs trained on very generic data (e.g. imagenet) that has nothing to do with MRIs can be used as pretrained models and achieve very good enough results. The reason, probably, is that the features they learn to extract in their initial layers (i.e. lines, circles, corners, etc.) are general purpose and can be used for virtually any task. This has two benefits: 1) you don't have to pretrain the model on your own; you can download weights online and 2) the models are trained on a dataset which most likely is an order of magnitude (or two) larger than the one you're trying to use (which means that it is trained better).
