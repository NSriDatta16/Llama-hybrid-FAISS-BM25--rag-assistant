How can I compare 2 XML Documents?

I have two documents both are similar but I need to find an elegant and efficient way to compare the two files and return the values in Doc #1 that don't exist in Doc #2. XML Doc #1 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 XML Doc #2 1 2 7 8 9 I was thinking about using linq if I could join these two documents on the id field. Is there a better way? I'm looking to return id #s 5 and 6.
