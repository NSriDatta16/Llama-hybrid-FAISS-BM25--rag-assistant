Making file wrap around when using fwrite

I am using an embedded system running linux.I use a ramdisk filesystem on the embedded target. My application captures real-time data and does Standard C "fwrite" to a file in this ramdisk fs.As there is limited amount of memory , I would like to set a max size for the file and cause fwrite to wrap around like a circular buffer. Is there a way to do this in manner that is transparent to the application ? I would prefer the application to remain unchanged when I migrate to a filesystem on a storage device (eSATA) having much larger capacity.
