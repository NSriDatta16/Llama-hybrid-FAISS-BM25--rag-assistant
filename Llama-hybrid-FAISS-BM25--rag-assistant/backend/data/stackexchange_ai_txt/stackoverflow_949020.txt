Can a search engine link to a certain section of an HTML file?

If I have a page divided in sections/fragments, that are linked to within the page with anchors, like this: Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 Section 1 Bla bla bla... ... can search engines like Google find those relationships and present them as hashed links in the search results, like this? http://www.somepage.com/somefile.html#sec1 The reason I ask is because I find document fragments convenient for unobtrusive tabbed layouts in HTML. But the user must be able to find the content of a specific tab quickly via search engines. Thank you /J
