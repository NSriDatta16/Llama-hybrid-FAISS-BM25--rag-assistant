You are going to need fill-paragraph , if , probably progn , probably string= , save-excursion , forward-paragraph , backward-paragraph and perhaps a few more. All of these can be read up if you do M-x describe-function and supply it the name. As for the how, it is in your question. If the paragraph begins with 4 blank space letters, fill-paragraph . Does that answer? Have I missed anything?
