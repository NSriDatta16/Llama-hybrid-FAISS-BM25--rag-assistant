How large should $M$ be?

Here is an interesting question I came across: Suppose you want to design a multiple choice test with $M$ questions. Each question has $4$ alternatives, out of which only one alternative is correct. How large will you take $M$ such that you can distinguish between a good student and a bad student? This is the question, and that's it. An answer has to be given using Statistics only using this information. I would like to see how one can logically approach a solution. Considering Glen_b's advice and whuber's answer, I am quite convinced that there is not a single correct answer to this question. I also feel that this question was essentially devised to check the application skills of the student. (By the way, this is not something I created, it was asked in an admissions interview of a university.) Something I thought of and not at all sure about : It does not depend on $M$ . It just depends on how much I want a bad student to score. I will assume a bad student randomly guesses each answer, so he has a success probability of $1/4$ and failure probability of $3/4$ . Suppose I do not want him to score more than $Mp$ marks, where $0 (assuming each question carries $1$ mark and there is no negative marking). Let $B$ be the number of correct answers given by a bad student. Then clearly, $B\sim Binomian(M,1/4)$ . On an average, I do not want a bad student to score more than $Mp$ marks. Therefore, $Mp>E(B)=M/4$ implying $p>1/4$ . So I need to design my cutoff marks, not my number of questions. Does this seem plausible? Well, here's the thing: this was not the intended solution! And I do not know what the intended solution is. I would like to understand how such kinds of questions can be tackled using Statistics only. Using estimation, hypothesis testing, etc.
