SQL Server and tables? Invalid object

Firstly I'm a complete newbie when it comes to SQL Server. I have five SQL Server databases, in all of them except one I can easily do say... SELECT TOP 10 * FROM dt_Organizers However one of the new databases require me to do this: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM dbuser.dt_Organizers Note that all the tables in all databases have "dbuser" "dbamy" "dbyon" "dbmio" "dbcana" prefixes respectively, this never caused a problem before. Now if I use the query without doing dbuser .dt_Organizers it brings up: Warning: mssql_query() [function.mssql-query]: message: Invalid object name 'dt_Organizers'.
