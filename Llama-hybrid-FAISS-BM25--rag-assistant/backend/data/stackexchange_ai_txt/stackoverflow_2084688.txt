I think the rule makes sense in many scenarios, since the .NET Framework essentially considers two assemblies with the same AssemblyVersion to be interchangeable. So, for example, an old version is in the Download Cache will not be automatically overwritten by a new version differing only in AssemblyFileVersion. This can be confusing for the average developer, hence the rule. Of course, if you know what you're doing and understand the trade-offs, you can ignore the rule.
