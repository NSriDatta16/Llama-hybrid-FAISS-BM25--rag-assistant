You might need to send a User Agent so that the site doesn't think that you are a bot. Some sites don't bother with CSS when requested from bots. Also the reading of the remote HTML could be simplified using a WebClient : using (var client = new WebClient()) { client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent] = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100611 Firefox/3.6.4"; string html = client.DownloadString(url); }
