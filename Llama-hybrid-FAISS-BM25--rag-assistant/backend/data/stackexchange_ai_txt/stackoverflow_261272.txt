Look up virtualization of the filesystem and registry on Windows Vista. If your app uses certain parts of the filesystem and/or registry you will find that your app "works" - that is, the APIs succeed with no errors - but that data isn't stored where you expect. In particular, many areas that would have been shared between multiple users on one machine are now out-of-bounds, and the data actually goes into some storage that is specific to the current user. You'll only find out some time later that users aren't actually sharing the same data. There is a way to stop this Virtualization from happening. Provide a manifest file for your application to say that it knows about UAC, as described here... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756929.aspx . It doesn't matter specifically what level of privilege you ask for in the manifest file. The mere presence of it says that your app understands UAC and the OS won't try to be clever and virtualize access to "privileged" areas of the filesystem or registry. API calls will simply fail if you don't have the necessary privilege to access those things, and that will be a lot easier for you to debug.
