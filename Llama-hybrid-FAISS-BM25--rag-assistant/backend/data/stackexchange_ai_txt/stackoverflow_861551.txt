If you are doing as much data transfer as you say, it would seem whatever it is you are doing is growing quite rapidly. It might be worth your while to contact your hosting provider and see if they offer any sort of shared storage solutions via iscsi, nas, or other means. Ideally the storage would not only start out large enough to store everything you have on it, but it would also be able to dynamically grow beyond your needs. I know my hosting provider offers a solution like this. If they do not, you might consider colocating your servers somewhere that either does offer a service like that, or would allow you install your own storage server (which could be built cheaply from off the shelf components and software like Freenas or Openfiler). Once you have a centralized storage platform, you could then add web-servers to your hearts content and load balance them based on load, all while accessing the same central storage repository. Not only is this the correct way to do it, it would offer you much more redundancy and expandability in the future if you endeavor continues to grow at the pace it is currently growing. The other solutions offered using a database repository of what is stored where, would work, but it not only adds an extra layer of complexity into the fold, but an extra layer of processing between your visitors and the data they wish to access. What if you lost a hard disk, do you lose 1/3 or 1/2 of all your data? Should the heavy IO's of static content be on the same spindles as the rest of your operating system and application data?
