Organizing data sources when working with multiple tables from one database

I'm working with a workbook that has a dozen or so dashboards, each showing information stored in a different table in a MS SQL Server database. The information is pre-summarized, Tableau is just displaying it to the end user. The way this was created by the previous developer, each dashboard has its own data source, which is just the linked table. Each data source separately includes the connection information for the SQL server. This leads to an issue whenever I want to change from Test to Prod: I have to update every single data source separately. There has to be a better way to do this - what is it?
