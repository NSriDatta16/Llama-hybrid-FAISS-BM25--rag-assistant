Replication of Stata commnad in R

I am not very good at working in R, usually I am working with stata. I just need to replicate one study in R. The command, which I need to replicate from Stata is : logit y x z v l m i.year, cl(name) nolog I have tried to use in R command : install.packages("miceadds") install.packages("multiwayvcov") library(miceadds) library("multiwayvcov") reg2 This gave me the same coefficients as well as Standard errors like Stata, but the z-value and p-value were absolutely different, what meant that the variables were not statistically significant. Also I have tried to run command logit But I do not know how to cluster the standard errors in this case. Can anyone help me how to run a logistic regression where will be the year fixed and also, I will be able to cluster standard errors?
