Actionscript: ExternalInterface.addCallback is not working in IE

Html: Javascript: try { if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') != '-1') { var embed = jQuery('#testqwe')[0]; } else { var embed = jQuery('#testqwe embed')[0]; } } catch(e) { log({error:e}); } Actionscript: private function jsAPI():void{ ExternalInterface.addCallback("callfromjs",callfromjs); } private function callfromjs(js:Object):void{ //code here } When i'm trying to call embed.callfromjs() it says that Object doesn't support this property or method. What i'm doing wrong? I think the problem is in html markup.Something missing probably or i made a mistake somewhere. It's working in Firefox/Chrome/Opera, but doesn't in all IE. Help! Spent around 4-5 hours and nothing...
