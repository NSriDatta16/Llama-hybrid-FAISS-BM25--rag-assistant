Yearly average correlation vs Monthly average correlation

Based on this question , I am seeing negligible correlation between temperature and precipitation. Since, the data points represent annual averages for 42 years, will it make sense to correlate the same variables but this with time monthly averages for the same timeseries to get better/improved correlation results (due to more data)? Or the correlation might still be poor?
