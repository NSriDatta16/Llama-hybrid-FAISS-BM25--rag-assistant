Neural networks with a lot of layers are deep architectures. However, the backpropagation learning algorithm used in neural networks doesn't work well when the network is very deep. Learning architectures in deep architectures ("deep learning") have to address this. For example, Boltzmann machines use a contrastive learning algorithm instead. Coming up with a deep architecture is easy. Coming up with a learning algorithm that works well for a deep architecture has proven difficult.
