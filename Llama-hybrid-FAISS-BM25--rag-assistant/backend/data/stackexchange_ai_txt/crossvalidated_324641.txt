Does time fixed effect always have to be considered in panel regression analysis?

This question might sound very silly, but I haven't found a clear answer so far. Suppose you are working with a panel including several time series data for different countries/cities/firms: when analyzing the panel in a regression is it somehow mandatory to consider time and countries/cities/firms fixed effects? If this is not the case, what makes you decide when these have to be considered or not? Thanks
