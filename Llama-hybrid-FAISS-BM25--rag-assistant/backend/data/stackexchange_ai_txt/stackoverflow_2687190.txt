I'm using 2 PU in stateless EJB and each of them is invoked on one method Indeed. But you're calling the second method from the first one so you're doing a distributed transaction and you need to use XA for this (at least for one of the resource since GlassFish supports the last agent optimization allowing to involve one non-XA resource). In other words, setting one of your datasource as a XADataSource is the way to go. If you get an error when doing this, please add details about what you did exactly and the stacktrace.
