Microsoft has some suggestions for storage locations in the Windows Vista: Application Certification and Compatibility document . So, if it [your program] is ever changing shared DATA (not CODE) then it [the data] should logically go in to ProgramData folder. If it is individual DATA then it can go to the user profile. We use a license file and store it in the ProgramData\CompanyName folder. But our licenses are on a per machine basis, not a per user. By default, this folder is hidden in Windows, but is not protected by UAC.
