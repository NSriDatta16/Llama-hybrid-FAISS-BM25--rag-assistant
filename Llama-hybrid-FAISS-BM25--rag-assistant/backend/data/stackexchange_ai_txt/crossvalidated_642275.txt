What are some good books on how to avoid, as a statistician, being used to lend false credibility to a dishonest project?

I mean for example companies or organizations who are not really interested in decision making driven by serious data analysis, but who employ or hire statisticians to try to give false credibility to "results" that have already been decided before any serious data analysis has actually taken place. Another example could be a company tampering the data they provide to a statistician they hired, to try to make the company look good. Are there references on how to deal with this kind of scenarios, for someone trying to do his job honestly without being manipulated? I guess this is an issue that experts in many fields might have to face one day or another, but I was wondering if some references were tackling the issue specifically from the point of view of statisticians or data analysts/scientists. Thank you. -- Edit: I'm not entirely sure why this question was closed. My question is general, the examples I give are just illustrations, perhaps not perfect. I don't have more specific examples in mind, and that's why I ask this question in the first place: if I already knew specifically how a statistician can be manipulated, I think I wouldn't need references on this subject. I think that ignorance of the details is one of the things that make someone vulnerable to manipulation. In my opinion, this question can only be answered by people with a good knowledge of publications in the field, that's why my first thought was to ask it here (otherwise, I don't see where else I could ask it, but would be glad to get suggestions if my question stay closed). Codes of conduct are interesting and definitely relevant, but I think that the thing they lack and I'm looking for are "case study" examples. So if you want, what I would find interesting is something a bit like a code of conduct aimed at statisticians, but with detailed real-life examples, and not just listing principles. Are there books like that? -- Second edit: As mentioned in the comment section, there's another question on a related topic ( What are some good references on the history of ethics in statistics? ). So I'm aware of the answers there. However I'm looking for something more specific, and directly relevant to today's practice (so references about historical case studies are of secondary interest to me, unless these past situations are likely to still happen today. I prefer to clarify that, in order to avoid possible duplicate answers with the other question, even if I think my question should be distinct enough).
