If you assume your draws have already converged to the stationary distribution, you need to estimate how variable this distribution is. Say you're using estimating $E[h(X)]$ with $\overline{h}_n(X) = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^nh(X_i)$ then you need to estimate its asymptotic variance: $$ \text{Var}(\overline{h}_n(X)) \approx \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\left[ 1 + 2 \sum_{i=1}^n\text{Corr}(X_1, X_{i+1})\right] $$ where $\sigma^2 = \text{Var}[h(X)]$ ( derivation here ). Notice that the uncertainty increases when your draws are more correlated. That means you definitely don't want to use the standard formula for sample variance that assumes your data is iid. The two ways that I know of to estimate the above are spectral methods and different types of batch means methods. The spectral method comes from the fact that evaluating a spectral density at $0$ gives you almost the same expression above (i.e. $ 2 \pi f(0) = \sigma^2(1 + 2\sum_{i=1}^n\text{Corr}(X_1, X_{i+1}))$). Batch means, on the other hand, splits your samples up into batches/windows, takes the mean of each batch, and computes a typical sample variance for those batch means. If the batches are big enough, then those batch means have really weak dependence. The R package mcmcse handles both of these situations.
