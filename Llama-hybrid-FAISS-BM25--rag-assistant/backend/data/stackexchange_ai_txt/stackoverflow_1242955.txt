Can't find my functions?

I've been trying to find out what's going on with my page for more than an hour.. What I'm trying to do here is to call a javascript function when the page loads, but for some reason it says "object required" then its pointing to my onload event in the body tag. This is what I have.. Audio Rage - Home and I have this files in this structure localhost/mytest/JScript/jquery-1.2.6.pack.js localhost/mytest/JScript/stepcarousel.js localhost/mytest/JScript/Carousel.js localhost/mytest/JScript/TopNav.js localhost/mytest/mypage.aspx My TopNav.JS has this function function TopNavPageInitialize() I also get "Unexpected call to method or property access." in my carousel but I'm not really worried about it I think if I can fix this maybe that 2nd error that I'm getting can be fixed. Thanks! I'm confused. What am I missing. Thanks.
