As Alan says, the patterns will be matched in the order you specified them. If you want to match on the longest of overlapping literal strings, you need the longest one to appear first. But you can organize your strings longest-to-shortest automatically, if you like: >>> '|'.join(sorted('cs csi miami vice'.split(), key=len, reverse=True)) 'miami|vice|csi|cs'
