Relationship between regressing Y on X, and X on Y in logistic regression

Correlation and linear regression are sometimes distinguished in statistics books by saying that the former is symmetric and the latter is asymmetric in the following sense: in the case of correlation, no distinction is made between dependent and independent variables, whereas it makes a difference which variables are treated as dependent and independent variables in a regression equation. To be sure, it is possible to treat $Y$ as a predictor of $X$ instead of treating $X$ as a predictor of $Y$ by using the following equations: $X$ as a predictor of $Y$: \begin{align} \text{Slope: }b_1 &= r_{XY} \cdot \frac{(sY)}{(sX)} \\ ~\\ ~\\ \text{Intercept: }b_0 &= \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x} \end{align} $Y$ as a predictor of $X$: \begin{align} \text{Slope: }b_1 &= r_{XY} \cdot \frac{(sX)}{(sY)} \\ ~\\ ~\\ \text{Intercept: }b_0 &= \bar{x} - b_1 \bar{y} \end{align} However, the regression lines to which the scatter plot will be fitted will differ depending on whether $X$ is treated as a predictor of $Y$ or $Y$ is treated as a predictor of $X$. My question is whether something similar holds in the case of logistic regression and whether it is possible to formulate similar equations for the regression coefficients in logistic regression for when $Y$ is used as a predictor of $X$.
