I assume you use django. Then you can try something like this: from django.conf import settings from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from django.http import HttpResponse @login_required def listen(request, file_name): # note that MP3_STORAGE should not be in MEDIA_ROOT file = open("%smp3/%s" % (settings.MP3_STORAGE, file_name)) response = HttpResponse(file.read(), mimetype="audio/mpeg") return response Note that you will get dramatic speed decrease.
