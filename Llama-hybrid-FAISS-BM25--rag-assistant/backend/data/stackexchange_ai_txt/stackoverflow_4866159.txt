Creating directories You can nest Directory tags as you like and after that use DirectoryRef to list components that go into this directory. Adding a custom UI Dialog with a browse button You can define UIRef with WixUI_InstallDir somewhere in a Fragment , Include , or Module (not in Product , despite the documentation): This will create a package that uses InstallDir UI, for example, the target directory can be specified in the UI (in case you mean this, otherwise you'll need to define a new dialog from scratch/copy an existing one and insert it into the sequence.) Adding registry entries Specify something like inside a component. Creating shortcuts on the desktop and start menu Note the use of ShortcutFolder directory from the directory list I showed earlier. Including dependencies Not quite sure which dependencies you mean. .NET Framework? Example: Installed OR NETFRAMEWORK35 OR NETFRAMEWORK40FULL Third-party DLLs? You just create a separate component for every DLL and specify the path where WiX should look for it using the File tag. This component then is listed under a DirectoryRef tag that specifies where the file goes during install.
