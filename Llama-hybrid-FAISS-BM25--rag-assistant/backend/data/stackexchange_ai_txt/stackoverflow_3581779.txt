How to write such a regex in PHP?

$contents = 'url("/test/what)'; echo preg_replace('/url\(([\'"]?)(?!(?:[a-z]+:)|\/|[\'"]\/)/i', 'url(\1'. '/prefix' . '\2', $contents); I want to append /prefix to those urls that didn't use absolute path(start with / ), the above works, but is pretty ugly. Is there a more elegant solution?
