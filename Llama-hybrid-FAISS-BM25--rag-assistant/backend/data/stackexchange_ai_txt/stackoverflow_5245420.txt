It is not really what you mean, but the garbage collector in Internet Explorer I think a pattern like this would do function foo() { var div = document.getElementById('mydiv'); div.onclick = bar; function bar() { div.style.opacity = 0.5; } } Now, whatever you do, the function bar references the variable div , and at the same time is assigned to a property of div . As a consequence, it used to be necessary to put particular attention when using closures on IE to avoid memory leaks .
