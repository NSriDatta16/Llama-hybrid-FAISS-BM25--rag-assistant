Regression models not passing

I've implemented an optimization algorithm to optimize the revenue of a particular store. I've done this for my 2020-2022 data. Moving forward, what I aim to do is to predict the difference (% increase or decrease) between my normal revenue and optimized revenue. I've done linear regression, GLM, GAM, and regression trees to try and predict this value but for my linear models I keep failing the assumptions (normality, independence, etc.) and for GAM and Regression trees, I keep getting high scores for RMSE and MAPE. My data has a few outliers but I think these are necessary to be kept since there are days when some factors (like prices) are too high/low. I've also tried the models with different data transformations (log, sqrt) and did some parameter tuning where necessary. Answering the comments: -For the linear regression model and GLM: I am failing the Shapiro-Wilk test and DurbinWatson and Breusch Pagan tests (normality, independence, and homoscedasticity tests). All p-values are always less than 0.5. When I do the data transformations, when I pass the SW test, I'll fail the other two or v/v. -My most basic model has a fairly good performance. With a relatively high R^2 and both predictors are considered as significant. -Here are some plots as well:
