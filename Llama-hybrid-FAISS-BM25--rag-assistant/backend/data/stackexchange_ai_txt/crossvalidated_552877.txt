Is Nonnegative matrix factorization a clustering method or a dimensionality reduction method?

In the matrix factorization we have the problem of decomposing a nonnegative matrix $X$ into two lower-rank matrices $W$ and $H$ . I would like to know whether this method is considered as a dimension reduction algorithm or a clustering algorithm?
