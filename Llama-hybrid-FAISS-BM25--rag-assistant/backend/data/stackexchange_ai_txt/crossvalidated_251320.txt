Not able to understand Discrete Probability distribution in the question

I'm trying to learn machine learning and till now I know "Discrete Probability distribution is a probability distribution in which sum of all probabilities sum to one and this is not continuous'. Now I have a problem to solve which contains following data. Population = [111 x 200] matrix data and I need to calculate 'Centroids' from this data using the probability density function P(x,y) = (1/z)*p(x,y) where Z is a normalization constant I tried to find the centroids by dividing each column array sum by total mean of the array and got some 200 values but I'm not sure whether it is correct or not?? please help.
