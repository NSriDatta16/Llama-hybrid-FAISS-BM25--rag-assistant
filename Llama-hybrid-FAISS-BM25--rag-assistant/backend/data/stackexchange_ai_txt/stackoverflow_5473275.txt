Reading first 5 lines of a URL, then printing in reverse order

I want to write a simple program that reads the first five lines of a URL and then prints them out in reverse order, so it'd be line 5, line 4, line 3, line 2, line 1. Here's what I've got so far: public static void main(String[] arg) throws Exception { BufferedReader keyboard; String inputLine; keyboard = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print("Please enter the name of a company (without spaces): "); System.out.flush(); /* Make sure the line is printed immediately. */ inputLine = keyboard.readLine(); URL u = new URL("http://www." + inputLine + ".com/"); InputStream ins = u.openStream(); InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(ins); BufferedReader readURL = new BufferedReader(isr); What would be the most elegant way to do what I'm trying to do?
