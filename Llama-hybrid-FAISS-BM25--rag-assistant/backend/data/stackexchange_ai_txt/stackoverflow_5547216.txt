Can NUnit stand up to TestNG

Possible Duplicate: Selenium, Nunit Best Practices? I have been working on Selenium using TestNG which has given me lots of flexibility, especially with test dependency. While working on UI based integration test it becomes indispensable to have test dependency. For example I have 5 steps registration process and each step is individual method having inter dependency. i.e. - ......step3Method DependsOn step2Method DependsOn step1Method Not only this I can also define which class is to be executed before any other class. For example Registration class is to be executed first followed by ManageProfile class. These fixtures are very easy to achieve with TestNG, but TestNG can only be used with java. While working on Selenium test with C# I came across NUnit. But I suppose these fixtures are not possible with NUnit and I also understand that NUnit is unit testing framework and not for integration testing. But then is my selection of Nunit wrong or I am just not aware of how these features could be leveraged in NUnit.
