Java is the only way (currently) to create a full Android application. As previously mentioned, there is an Android Scripting Engine and some hacking around with other languages - but if you actually want to write a non-trivial application with good performance and release it anytime soon... crack open a Java book. I remember reading a news story (sorry don't recall the link) that there's some potential to write core parts of your application in C but it's strongly discouraged. And that doesn't help you much anyhow. (This reply written on a modified G1 btw... qwerty keyboards rock!)
