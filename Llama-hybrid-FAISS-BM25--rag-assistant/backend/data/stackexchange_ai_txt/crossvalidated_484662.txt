You’re expecting to drag up the mean of that group by having a gigantic number, right? You’ll be successful in dragging up that mean by doing that. It also expands the variance, and that’s why you’re not getting a low p-value, despite the considerably different means. The t-test is hard to trick with these kinds of extreme points (so-called “outliers”, though most of us on here don’t like that term).
