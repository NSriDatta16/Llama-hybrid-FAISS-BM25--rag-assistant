Most clients I'm aware of key their list of torrents that are loaded/downloading by their info-hash. The info-hash is often used as a unique identifier within the client as well, which might make it hard to modify a client to support downloading the same torrent in parallel. You could just run multiple processes, one for each copy of the torrent you want to download. With uTorrent you can pass in /RECOVER to circumvent the single-instance check for instance. I would imagine most clients have similar features. If not, you could try to leverage the OS to sandbox the client instances from each other, with a jail for instance. However, that seems like a very straight forward and simple solution. The fact that you're asking seems to imply that you might have some other expectations on downloading the same torrent in parallel. Like, do you want them to share data between each other? (i.e. the old seeding-a-torrent-on-multiple-private-trackers problem). Depending on what you want the "torrent software" to do, you could write a thin wrapper around libtorrent and run one session per instance of the torrent you want to download.
