A product term in a logistic regression has an estimated value and its associated P value based on the model hypothesis. These are two different things. If the treatment effect varies by gender in stratified analyses then the overall model with the product term should have a product term coefficient different from the null value (which is what you have observed). It makes no difference whether statistical significance was observed or not as the P value only tells you how much evidence you have against the model hypothesis at your sample size and nothing more. Statistical significance is not the same thing as the estimated effect of treatment.
