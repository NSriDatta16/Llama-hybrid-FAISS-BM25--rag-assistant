Change User Agent and Headers in pyWebkitGTK?

I've read the suggestions for making your own data handler, for example: web_view.connect('resource-request-starting', resource_cb) def resource_cb(view, frame, resource, request, response): print request.get_uri() #get data using urllib with different user-agent... request.set_uri('data:....') (from http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/wiki/HowDoI ) will let you download using custom header/useragent. However, sometimes it will complain if set_uri is given string with null-char, or it will give an error like "** Message: console message: (http://url) @linenumber: SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent." Is there a better way to set a browser useragent for pygtk code? This says you can add/remove/replace headers using SoupMessage, however that documentation is missing...
