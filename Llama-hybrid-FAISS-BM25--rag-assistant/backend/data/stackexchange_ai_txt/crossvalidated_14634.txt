Reporting results of a logistic regression

I have the following logistic regression output: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.5716 0.1734 3.297 0.000978 *** R1 -0.4662 0.2183 -2.136 0.032697 * R2 -0.5270 0.2590 -2.035 0.041898 * Is it appropriate to report this in the following way: Beta coefficient, Odds ratio, Zvalue, P value. If yes, how can I obtain the Odds ratio?
