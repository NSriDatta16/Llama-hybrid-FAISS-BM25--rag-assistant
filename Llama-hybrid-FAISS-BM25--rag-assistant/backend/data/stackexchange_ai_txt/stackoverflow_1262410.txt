What is the technical limitation for banks that makes them only give you 18 months of history?

For both my bank accounts I can only access 18 months of history. To access older account history, you have to pay a certain amount of money for each old statement. Why do banks do that? Shouldn't this practice go away as we get bigger hard disks and cheaper storage?
