Each of the 5 classes you are predicting are independent of each other. If you look at the way Neural Networks are constructed, each input has a weight that ultimately ends up activating, or not each output. When you get a yield of 11000 it means that the data you trained the Neural Network on has cause the network to activate by surpassing the weights trained into the neurons for both classes, which is possible. In the second example you give, each of the 20 inputs to the neural network have weights to the 5 outputs which could be activated. Those weights are increased or decreased based on the training data, the eta value, and the number of iterations the model used to train. In short, any number of features could activate, or not, every output class. The activation is simply statistically related to the training data and the configuration of the network. The more training data you have the more potential accuracy.
