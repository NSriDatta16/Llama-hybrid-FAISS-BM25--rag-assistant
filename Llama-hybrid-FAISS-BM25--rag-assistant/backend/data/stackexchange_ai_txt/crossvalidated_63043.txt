In the Bayesian model you are subtracting something (mean_factor_b1, etc.) from each of the predictor variables. But you are not doing the same thing in the call to lm . Assuming that "mean_factor_b1" is the mean of the "b1" variable, etc. this means that the intercept in the Bayesian model represents the predicted value of FC when all the b variables are at their mean. In the MLE ( lm ) model the intercept represents the predicted FC value when all the b variables are equal to 0 (which may or may not make sense). If you want the intercepts to match then you need to have them mean the same thing, either subtract the means in the call to lm or don't subtract the means in the Bayesian model.
