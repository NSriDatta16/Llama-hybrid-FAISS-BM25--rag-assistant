The Weibull distribution has two parameters, the scale $\lambda$ and shape $k$ (I'm following Wikipedia's notation). Both parameters are positive real numbers. The function fitdist from the fitdistrplus package uses the optim function to find the maximum likelihood estimations of the parameters. By default, optim imposes no constraints on the parameters and tries out negative numbers as well. But negative values for the scale or shape produce NaNs for the Weibull distribution. By using the options lower and upper , you can impose limits on the parameter search space for optim . The gamma distribution also has two parameters and as with the Weibull distribution, both are positive. So the same limits lower = c(0, 0) can be used for the gamma distribution. Edit Here is a small comparison of the Weibull and gamma fit for the posted data. The errors for the gamma distribution arise because of bad starting values. I provide them manually and then it works fine without errors. library(fitdistrplus) temp Plot the fit for the Weibull: plot(fit.weibull) And for the gamma distribution: plot(fit.gamma) They are practically indistinguishable. The AICs are virtually the same for both fits: gofstat(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma)) Goodness-of-fit statistics 1-mle-weibull 2-mle-gamma Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic 0.07288424 0.07970184 Cramer-von Mises statistic 0.02532353 0.02361358 Anderson-Darling statistic 0.20489012 0.17609146 Goodness-of-fit criteria 1-mle-weibull 2-mle-gamma Aikake's Information Criterion 601.7909 601.5659 Bayesian Information Criterion 604.9016 604.6766
