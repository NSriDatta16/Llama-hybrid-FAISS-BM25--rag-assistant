I am no expert but from the looks of it, yes it looks like a simple count. However I believe the intention is to have a class that can generate a multi-hot representation that wraps around any categorical_column_* kind of column according to the documentation . There is also a paragraph about the indicator_column in the Wide & Deep tf tutorial . It feels like it is a convenience class so that you don't have to write code to generate the representation yourself.
