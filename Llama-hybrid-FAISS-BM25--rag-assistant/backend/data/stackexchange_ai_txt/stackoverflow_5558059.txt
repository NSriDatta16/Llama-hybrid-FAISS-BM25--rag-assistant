Configure the grid with stateful: true and set its stateId (optional if your grid has an ID that won't change). Also initialize the Ext.state.Manager: var thirtyDays = new Date(new Date().getTime()+(1000*60*60*24*30)); Ext.state.Manager.setProvider(new Ext.state.CookieProvider({expires: thirtyDays})); Though not included in Ext 3, you can find online a state provider that uses HTML5's localStorage rather than cookies.
