To build on Ludo's answer, and the link they provided: Combat Imbalanced Classes in Your Machine Learning Dataset , you might also try the following: Treating the problem as anomaly detection. There are different supervised and unsupervised ways to do this, but one example would be one-class SVM, as described in this blog post . Using a kernel for the SVM. Is there some high dimensional space that can be used to further distinguish the minority from the majority classes? Trying a different algorithm. Random Forests I believe are supposed to be pretty good for imbalanced datasets, since they try are directly concerned with class entropy. It's a little difficult to tell what will work the best, so it's worth it to just try a variety of different approaches and see which one works best for your problem.
