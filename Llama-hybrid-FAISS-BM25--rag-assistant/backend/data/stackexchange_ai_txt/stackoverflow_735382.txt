Funny that you should ask this today, and then later I read about Continuations in Mono . Looks like the kind of thing you're after. In particular there's a reference to Microthreading in Second Life , including this description: SecondLife required that code be suspended at any point in time and that its entire state be serializable into a format suitable for storage into a database. Serialized state could then be restored at a different point in time or on a different computer (for example while moving from node to node). Unless I've misunderstood you, this could be a good avenue to explore.
