How to estimate the "average number"?

I have many numbers representing some survey results, namely the number of siblings of each respondent (usually 0, 1, or 2 in this sample). The assignment is to estimate the average number of siblings. Could you please clarify the problem? I suppose it would not be enough if I just compute the sample mean? How such problems are usually solved? Perhaps some data transformation could be convenient?
