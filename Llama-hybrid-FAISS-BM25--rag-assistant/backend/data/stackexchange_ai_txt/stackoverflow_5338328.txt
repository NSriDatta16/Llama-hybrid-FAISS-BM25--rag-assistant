I'm no jQuery expert, but from jQuery API doc: The .append() method inserts the specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery collection I'd think, that this means, that .append(' ') inserts an empty paragraph. To add your content inside your paragraph, you should be using the same method as with you div's and anchors. .append($(' ', {html: content}))
