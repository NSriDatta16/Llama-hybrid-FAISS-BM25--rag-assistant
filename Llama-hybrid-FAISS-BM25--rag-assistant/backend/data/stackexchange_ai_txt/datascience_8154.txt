Your problem looks more like a ranking problem than a classification problem to me. Have you tried a more naive method, like a 1-NN "classifier" with unigram text representation, Tf-Idf term weighting and a cosine similarity metric? It's far from the state of the art but it tends to give rather good results in retrieval and recommendation tasks.
