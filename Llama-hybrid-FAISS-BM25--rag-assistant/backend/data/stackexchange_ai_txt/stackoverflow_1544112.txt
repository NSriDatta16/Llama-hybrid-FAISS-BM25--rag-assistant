It's possible but it's a bit more complicated than just setting an option. The key is a stream context . The required function is stream_context_create() - please also have a look at "HTTP context options" . $context = stream_context_create(array( 'http' => array( 'user_agent' => 'testing' ) ); $client = new Zend_Soap_Client($wsdl, array('stream_context' => $context)); // or set option after instatiation $client->setStreamContext($context); EDIT: As the stream context user-agent seems to get overridden another option is to use the user_agent -option of SoapClient itself. But this is a little bit more complicated as this option is not exposed by Zend_Soap_Client . $client = new Zend_Soap_Client($wsdl); $options = array_merge($client->getOptions(), array( 'trace' => true, 'user_agent' => 'testing' )); $soapClient = new Zend_Soap_Client_Common(array($client, '_doRequest'), $wsdl, $options); $client->setSoapClient($soapClient); The above code is more or less an extract of what happens in Zend_Soap_Client::_initSoapClientObject() which initializes the default SoapClient when no custom object is registered.
