If you wanted to model the sales of drinks types as a vector [sales of wine at t, sales of beer at t, sales of spirits at t], you might want to look at Vector Autoregression (VAR) models. You probably want the VARX variety that have a vector of exogenous variables like region and the policy intervention dummy, alongside the wine, beer and spirits sequences. They are fairly straightforward to fit and you'd get impulse response functions to express the impact of exogenous shocks, which might also be of interest. There's comprehensive discussion in LÃ¼tkepohl's book on multivariate time series. Finally, I'm certainly no economist but it seems to me that you might also think about ratios of these drinks types as well as levels. People probably operate under a booze budget constraint - I know I do - which would couple the levels and (anti-)correlate the errors.
