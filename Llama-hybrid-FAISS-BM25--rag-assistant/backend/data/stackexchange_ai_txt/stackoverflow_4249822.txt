I assume that overlapping intervals are fine as long as it gives optimal answer. Before I go further, I would like to ask, if you know why your greedy approach failed to give optimal answer? (think a minute before reading next paragraph.) If you have not figured it out why, let me tell you. you always pick longest interval (after sorting), but it may not be the longest interval that covers uncovered interval segment. lets say you have 0-10, 5-14, 9-15. If you pick by longest interval then you are going to pick all segments. After you pick 1st segment, picking the 2nd one covers only 4 units extra whereas picking 3rd one covers 5 units extra. So its clear that picking based on longest interval length doesn't give optimal solution. I think now you get the idea. Given that it is marked as homework, its not appropriate if I present solution beyond this point.
