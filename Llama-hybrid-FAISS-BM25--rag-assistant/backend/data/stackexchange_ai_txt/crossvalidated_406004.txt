Calculation of Bayeain rule as classifier for mixture Gaussian model

Here is a paper which used a bayesian classification based on Gaussian mixture model I read many article saying that we can fit a gaussian mixture model to a data and then, based on the estimated parameter, we can easily predict the class of the new point using Bayes rule. For the mixture model, I understand it quite good. My problem is in understanding the Bayesian rule as a classification. The Bayesian rule is: $p(c|x) = \frac{p(c)p(x|c)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(c_i)p(x|c_i)}$ . As I understand, $p(c)$ does not dependent of the class so we do not need it in our calculation. My questions are: Assume that I have a data set with 7 observations, as follows: 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa Assume further that the prior is 0.5 . Then, to calculate, ${p(c)p(x|c)}$ , do I need to multiply the prior ( 0.5 ) by the joint density for each row of my data set. For example, 0.5*joint_density at (5.1 , 3.5 , 1.4 , 0.2 ). Is that correct? Then, for the denominator, do I need to sum for each row with respect to each class. For example, 0.5*joint_denstity (of the first class) at (5.1 , 3.5 , 1.4 , 0.2 ) + 0.5*joint_density (of the second class) at (5.1 , 3.5 , 1.4 , 0.2 ). Then, the class with high posterior is chosen. Edit based on the answer of @gunes (thank you so much). What I try to do is: Fit a Gaussian mixture model to my data (iris with two classes only). Then, I need to estimate the Gaussian densities for each class. Then, I need to apply a Bayesian rule for classification. My problem is how to calculate the denominator and nominator? If we assumed that the estimated Gaussian density for the first class is dnorm1 and for the second class is dnorm2 . These densities are estimated at each point. Then, as I understand, I can calculate the nominator as follows: 0.5*dnrom1 (for the first class) and 0.5*dnorm2 (for the second class). Is that correct? Any help, please?
