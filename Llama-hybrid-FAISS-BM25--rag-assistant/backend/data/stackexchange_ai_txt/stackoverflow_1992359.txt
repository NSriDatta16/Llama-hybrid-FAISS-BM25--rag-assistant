How to authenticate your server to my server when a user loads your page in PHP?

user signs up for a key and secret from my site, then they can send/receive from my REST server. Where I need help is when a user interacts with the REST, how can I determine if they are authenticated using THEIR key and secret? Basicly this will be for a social network site app area. I have seen that many social networks have an app area and use REST and OAuth and sometimes OpenSocial but I have looked at those and they are a bit complex for my needs I think. As for authenticating with OAuth, I guess I do not really understand exactly how it works, maybe it is what I am looking for though? I don't need to authenticate the user who views the page that is running the API, I need the owner of the app's server to authenticate to send back and forth with my REST? Any advice on how to do this the best way? I would like to do it the best method for future growth, so if I could do it like the big boys do (Facebook, myspcae, hi5, bebo) that would be the way to go I think. when a request is sent it should pass the key in the URL to my server but they should have there Secret somewhere in there script, I am not clear how to make that work with each other?
