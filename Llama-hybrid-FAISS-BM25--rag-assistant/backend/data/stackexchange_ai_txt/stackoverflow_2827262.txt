Training a NLP classifier would probably be the best way to go. However, a simpler method might be to simply check that each word exists in a list of all known "valid" words. Most Unix systems have a file called /usr/share/dict/words that you can use for this purpose. Additionally, Ubuntu expands on this with /usr/share/dict/american-english, /usr/share/dict/american-huge, and /usr/share/dict/american-insane, each list more comprehensive then the last. These lists also include a lot of common misspellings, so you won't filter out text that's not technically a word, but clearly recognizable as a word. If you're really ambitious, you can combine these approaches, and use these words lists to train a Bayesian or Maximum Entropy classifier.
