Splicer.dll on Windows 2008

I'm attempting to leverage the splicer.dll component from http://splicer.codeplex.com on a windows 2008 server. I'm running into an error when the splicer.dll is first used. I'm guessing I don't have one of the dependencies installed. What are the required components that I need? Error: Exception: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80040154): Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {78530B75-61F9-11D2-8CAD-00A024580902} failed due to the following error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)). at Splicer.Timeline.DefaultTimeline..ctor(Double fps, String temporaryStoragePath) Further investigation leads me to believe it's related to qedit.dll which isn't installed and can't be copied and registered from my Win7 machine. Any ideas?
