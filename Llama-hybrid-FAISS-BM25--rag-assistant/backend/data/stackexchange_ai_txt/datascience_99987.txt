Anomaly (Outlier) Detection with Isolation Forest too sensitive even with low contamination

I'm trying to use the sklearn implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in my time series data. However, even with a very low contamination parameter (0.0001), it is detecting things that should not be outliers in my opinion, as shown in the picture below: While this is the highest peak of the data, it doesn't really seem anomalous to me. How can I configure an Isolation forest to only detect samples that are drastically different from the other samples? Maybe an isolation forest is not the right way to go here? All help appreciated.
