Read this first: http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html It's an introduction to a mathematical concept known as Wilson score confidence intervals for Bernoulli parameters . That article is a great primer on how to use your user's votes to calculate a score that is actually useful and mathematically sound. Do this, and you're already ahead of Amazon.com Then, I think you probably need to tweak that formula a bit. In that formula it uses p for the fraction of positive votes. You might need to update the formula for p , to reflect the karma of the user that cast that vote. Finally, to take the age into account, you multiply the outcome of the formula with an age multiplier. For example, if you want the outcome to become less relevant by 1% for each day it ages, multiply it by 0.99^age_in_days . In a nutshell, that is the path I would follow. Hope this helps.
