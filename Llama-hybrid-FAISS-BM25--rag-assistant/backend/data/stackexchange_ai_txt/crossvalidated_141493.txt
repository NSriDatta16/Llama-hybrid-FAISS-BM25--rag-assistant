Are you doing the regression on the data after you've removed the trend? You have a positive trend, and your seasonal signature is likely masked in your regression (variance due to trend, or error, is larger than due to month), unless you've accounted for the trend in Yvar... Also, I'm not terribly confident with time series, but shouldn't each observation be assigned a month, and your regression look something like this? lm(Yvar ~ Time + Month) Apologies if that makes no sense... Does regression make the most sense here?
