drag and drop in winforms or wpf

i would like to create a simple winforms or wpf application where i can drag and drop virtual "cards". this below is not exactly what i want to do, but it the closest thing that i found on the web to represent the user interface. http://www.greenpeppersoftware.com/confluence/plugins/advanced/gallery-slideshow.action?imageNumber=1&pageId=24870977&decorator=popup&galleryTitle=Task+board+and+transitions so basically i want to have columns in the GUI where i can drag and drag from one to the other. My questions are: would this be easier in winforms or wpf where do i start?
