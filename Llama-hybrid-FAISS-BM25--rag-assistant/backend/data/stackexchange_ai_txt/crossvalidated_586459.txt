How do I fit a constrained logistic regression model via quadratic programming in R?

I trying to find $\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \pi_{3}$ for model: $$ Y = \pi_{1}X_{1} + \pi_{2}X_{2} + \pi_{3}X_{3} + \epsilon, $$ with constraints: $\Sigma_{k}\pi_{k}=1$ and $\pi_{k}\geq0$ . (All $\pi$ are positive and add up to 1) I found a very similar question here that tried to minimize squared errors: $\Sigma_{i}(Y_{i}-(\pi_{1}X_{i1} + \pi_{2}X_{i2} + \pi_{3}X_{i3}))^{2}$ . However, my dependent variable $Y$ is binary, not continuous. So it's like fitting a logistic regression model rather than a linear regression model. Is there a way for me to apply a link function (e.g. logit function) to the solution provided in the above link to find better estimates of $\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \pi_{3}$ ? Or, are there any other well-known solutions to solve problems like these (quadratic programming where dependent variable is binary?) I copied the example code from the above link with the dependent variable rounded to either 1 or 0 in case it helps. library("quadprog"); X I tried searching for similar problems on Google, but with my little knowledge on quadratic programs, I couldn't get close to finding information that matched mine.
