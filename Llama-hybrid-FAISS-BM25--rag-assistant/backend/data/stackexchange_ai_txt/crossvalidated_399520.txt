http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/gbm-faq/missing_values.html This means that missing numeric, categorical, or unseen categorical values are turned into NAs. (The Random Forest FAQ isn't that explicit or detailed, but DRF and GBM treat missing values the same, e.g. see this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52976032/841830 )
