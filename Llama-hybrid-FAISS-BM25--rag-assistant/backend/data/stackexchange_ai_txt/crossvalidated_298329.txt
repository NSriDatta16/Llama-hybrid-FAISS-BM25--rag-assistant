You've got E(y $\vert$ encouraged) = $\tfrac{18}{67}$ E(y $\vert$ !encouraged) = $\tfrac{2}{67}$ E(use $\vert$ encouraged) = $\tfrac{53}{67}$ E(use $\vert$ !encouraged) = $\tfrac{16}{67}$ Equation (2) from the source from other Eric in intuitive words: the total effect is the 53 that 'use' resulting in 18 'y'. substract from that the 16 that normally (without encouragement) 'use' and result in 2 'y' Then the causal effect of 'use', the 37 extra 'use' that stems from the encouragement, is 16 extra 'y', and "therefore" the causal effect is $\frac{E(y\vert e)-E(y\vert !e)}{E(use\vert e)-E(use\vert !e)} = \frac{16}{37} = 0.43...$ This analysis is without the age parameter since it does not correlate anyway (then we do not need the regression to obtain the estimated values). For the model with the covariates (if you have a serious effect of age in the real data) you will need some regression model to obtain those estimated values. I suggest that you use a reasonable model, restricted to values between 0 and 1, such that the predicted values make at least some sense. If you wish something like: "I want to be able to say that..." ... - the intervention - increased - y - by 43% points - from a to b. What the double regression does is more something like (using the same structure): ... - the change in intervention use that is due to the encouragement (from 16 to 53) - increased - y - with a coefficient of 0.43 - from 2 to 18" The encouragement increases the use and the use increases y. The 0.43 is not related to the relative increase of y (from a to b) but to to the coefficient that relates the change of 'use' with the change of 'y'.
