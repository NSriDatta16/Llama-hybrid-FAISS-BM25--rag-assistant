I am looking too for something like this just now. After much investigation, this is what I learned: The Mozilla Browser component they have on that page is outdated, but they do build an up-to-date component with a thing called XULRunner. Just download XULRunner binaries and the component is there. But it's not being actively developed anymore, meaning the functionality of the ActiveX control itself stays roughly the same. Minimal installation size for the component seems to have jumped from 4 megabytes to at least 10 megabytes (without recompilation). Given that one of the selling point of Mozilla Embedding was the size, now (~16 mb) it's comparable to IE6 (roughly 24 mb). There are some problems with the component, namely, after importing it into Delphi I have found out it does not handle Tabs correctly. Tabbing while inside of it just tabs you out of it instead of iterating through the web page controls. Additionally, the component itself does not get focus when you focus any of the page controls. Last issue was a deal-breaker for me, but I'm investigating the source now and I'm going to submit a patch to XULRunner if I manage to fix it. With it fixed the component should be pretty usable and up to date, just don't use XULRunner 1.9.2.x because it throws access violations left and right (that's one stable release, no doubts!). XULRunner 1.9.1.x works just fine.
