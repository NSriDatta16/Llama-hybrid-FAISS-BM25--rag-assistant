You can use a multiple-degrees of freedom test and logistic regression. I will show this with some R code. First simulating some data: p The null hypothesis is that $p_2=p_3$ and $p_1=p_3$ (and $p_1=p_2$ , but that is already implied by the first two). We can represent that with a contrast hypothesis with two rows. We fit a logistic regression model without intercept, to get one parameter for each group. Note that since this is a saturated model, some other link function would give the same estimated probabilities. library(car)# for car::linearHypothesis mod Chisq) 1 119 2 117 2 6.548 0.03785 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
