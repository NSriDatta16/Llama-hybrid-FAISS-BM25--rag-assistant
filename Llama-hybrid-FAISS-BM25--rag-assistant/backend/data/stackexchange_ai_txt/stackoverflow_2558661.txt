As Alex said, you shouldn't need to unzip the jar. The can load antcontrib.properties directly out of the jar. The error you got is because you changed the resource path, but the path to the file inside the compressed jar/zip is still the same. The taskdef isn't paying attention to the properties file you moved because the you provided to tells it to only look in the jar.
