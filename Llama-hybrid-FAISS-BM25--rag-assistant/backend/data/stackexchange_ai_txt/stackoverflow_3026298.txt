How can I force a tree itemrenderer to redraw during a drag and drop operation?

I have a tree control with a custom item renderer. The item renderer has different states that should be set while an item is being dragged over the item renderer. I understand from reading this post http://forums.adobe.com/message/2091088 that the 'right way' to do this is to override the 'getCurrentState' method and append some text. I do that. Now in my tree control I handle the drag over event and get a reference to the itemrenderer that is being dragged over and I set the boolean 'dragOver' property to true. Now I just need to force my itemRenderer to redraw. I can't figure that out. A workaround, is to just set the currentState of the itemRenderer. My question then, how can I force my itemRenderer to refresh? (and I've tried calling validateNow, invalideDisplayList/Properties/Size, to no avail) ...
