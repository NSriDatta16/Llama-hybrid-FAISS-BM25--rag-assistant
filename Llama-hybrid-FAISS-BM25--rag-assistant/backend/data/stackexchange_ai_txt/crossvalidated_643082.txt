In general, odds ratios tend to provide the most straightforward interpretation when presenting to a non-statistical or clinical audience and are widely. Currently your estimates are on the log-odds scale so you will need to exponentiate your estimates and confidence intervals. Your interpretation is close but I believe is backwards. The coefficient is showing the difference in the log-odds of each outcome level (no and use too) compared to the reference (yes). The sign attached to the coefficient is essentially showing the 'direction of effect'. Here is a useful resource for interpreting OR/RR - https://www.nature.com/articles/pcrj20006.pdf Looking at your dataset it seems you only have one observation with outcome level 'use too' which can cause an issue with model accuracy and explains the incredibly large coefficients. If it does not cause you to lose too much detail in your outcome variable, I might suggest collapsing the 'no' and 'use too' levels to create a dichotomous outcome and use binary logistic regression.
