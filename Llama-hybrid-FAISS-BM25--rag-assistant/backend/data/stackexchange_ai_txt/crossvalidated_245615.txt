How to fill in missing data in time series?

I have a large set of pollution data that has been recorded every 10 minutes for the course of 2 years, however there are a number of gaps in the data (including some that go for a few weeks at a time). The data does seem to be quite seasonal and there is a large variation during the day compared to the night in which the values do not have much variation and the data points are lower. I have considered fitting a loess model to the day time and night time subsets separately (as there is an obvious difference between them) and then predicting the values of the missing data and filling these points in. I was wondering if this is a suitable way of approaching this problem, and also if there is a need to add local variation into the predicted points.
