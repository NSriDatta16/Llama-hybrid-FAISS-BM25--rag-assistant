What are these features called (LOG and C3)?

I used a feature extraction code, where two of the features are unknown to me. They work well for my model but I don't know the formal names for them. The first one has the following python implementation: def LOG(y): n = len(y) return np.exp(np.sum(np.log(np.abs(y)))/n) I didn't find any feature by LOG. The other one was taken from tsfresh library, https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/blob/master/tsfresh/feature_extraction/feature_calculators.py?fbclid=IwAR0Qnh3X1t_2M9Y1bniEcMoyUUIiYwCS80Vj1D7_B5-hDHBBSyCiDKLOg4Q#L1480 def c3(x, lag): """ This function calculates the value of .. math:: \\frac{1}{n-2lag} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-2lag} x_{i + 2 \\cdot lag} \\cdot x_{i + lag} \\cdot x_{i} which is .. math:: \\mathbb{E}[L^2(X) \\cdot L(X) \\cdot X] where :math:`\\mathbb{E}` is the mean and :math:`L` is the lag operator. It was proposed in [1] as a measure of non linearity in the time series. .. rubric:: References | [1] Schreiber, T. and Schmitz, A.
