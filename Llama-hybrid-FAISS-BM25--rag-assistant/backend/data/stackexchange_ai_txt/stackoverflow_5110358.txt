How to copy user libraries between workspaces in Eclipse

I was mistaken in thinking that the user libraries I define in one workspace would be available in all and subsequently created workspaces. So I created a new workspace to organize the myriad of projects, but alas my user-defined libraries did not get replicated in the new ws. I am seeking a way to get my user library defs from the old ws into the new ws. Is there any good way to hack this? (I've tried researching this but have come up empty handed.)
