It's not visible in the snippet above, but newel has been appended to the dom using another element that was itself appended to the DOM. When inserting a dom element, you have to re-retrieve your handle if you wish to reference its siblings, since the handle is invalid (I'm not sure, but I think it refers to a DOM element inside of a document fragment and not the one inside of the document.) After re-retrieving the handle from the insert operation, moveToElementText stopped throwing an exception.
