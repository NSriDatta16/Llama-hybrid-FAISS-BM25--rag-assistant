Why does machine learning have metrics such as accuracy, precision or recall to prove best models, but statistics uses hypothesis tests?

I am taking some statistics and machine learning courses and I realized that when doing some model comparison, statistics uses hypothesis tests, and machine learning uses metrics. So, I was wondering, why is that?
