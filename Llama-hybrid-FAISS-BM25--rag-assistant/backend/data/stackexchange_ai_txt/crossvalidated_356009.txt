Follow Stefan's suggestion, you can formulate this as logistic regression in the following way. For each pair, consider it as a Bernoulli random variable where 1 corresponds with the left object being real, and 0 corresponds with the left object being fake. Then, each pair, a feature vector you could use could simply be the features of the left object concatenated with the features of the right object. You can then easily augment/constrain your feature vector by taking differences of features between the LHS and RHS object, for instance.
