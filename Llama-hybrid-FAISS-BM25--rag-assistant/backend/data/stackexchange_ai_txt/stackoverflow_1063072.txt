I successfully created a Web Service (SQL Server 2005) using the above technique and it works great populating a list box in the InfoPath preview mode. When I publish the form to SharePoint, only the first row populates the list box rather than the entire record set. good article, i really like it. I am doing a bit on research about web service directly and i found also macrotesting www.macrotesting.com to be very good source. Thanks for you article..... Regards... Meganathan..
