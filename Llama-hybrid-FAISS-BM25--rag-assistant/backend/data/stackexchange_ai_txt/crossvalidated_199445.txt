Standard deviation vs. variance as a feature

I'm using the median of response times (of users) as a feature in a machine learning context. As a second feature I want to use the standard deviation or variance of the response times. Of course, the variance is just the squared standard deviation, so from that point of view I think it should not matter which I choose. Does it really not matter if choosing the standard deviation or the variance?
