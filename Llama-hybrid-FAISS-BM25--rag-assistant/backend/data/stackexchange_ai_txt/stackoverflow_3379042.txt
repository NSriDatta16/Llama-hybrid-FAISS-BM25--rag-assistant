The sed-based approach strager and msw gave will work fine if the plist you're changing is in XML format, but if it's in Apple's binary format it'll probably corrupt the file format. You can use plutil to convert it to XML first: plutil -convert xml1 filename sed -i -e "s/placeholder/$macnum/g" filename It shouldn't be necessary to convert it back to binary format afterward, as Apple's plist frameworks read the two formats interchangeably. Another approach would be to use PlistBuddy to edit the contents of the plist (although it'll require the script to know what entries to set to what values, rather than just replacing a placeholder): /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "set :oneentry 'value including $macnum where appropriate'" filename /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "set :anotherentry 'value including $macnum where appropriate'" filename Finally, you can do the same thing with defaults, although it requires you specify the .plist file by full path, and leave the .plist off its name: defaults write oneentry "value including $macnum where appropriate" /path/to/filename-without-plist defaults write anotherentry "value including $macnum where appropriate" /path/to/filename-without-plist
