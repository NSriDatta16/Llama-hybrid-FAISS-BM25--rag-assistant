Just need to add a bit more to the answer by @conjugateprior than can fit into a comment easily. The usual rule of thumb for logistic regression is that you need about 15 events per predictor variable that you are considering in the model. For this purpose, "events" are the least frequent of occupied/not occupied, so that's 45 events. Also, all except one of your species counts as a separate predictor, so in the interaction model with 28 different species and the continuous dap predictor you are trying to evaluate 28 individual predictors PLUS 27 interactions between dap and species, a total of 55 predictors. So you don't even have 1 event per variable. Regularization, as suggested by @conjugateprior in a comment, might help, but at this point it seems that you really don't have enough information to proceed this way. Think carefully about what you are trying to accomplish; might there be some way to combine species (e.g., into genus) in some way to cut your number of predictors down? (That combination of species into groups, however, would need to be done without reference to the occupancy data.)
