WCF Message security using certificates -

I am trying to create a WCF service that will use message mode security with a certificate. When I run the service code, both in IIS and cassini I get the following message It is likely that certificate 'CN=TempCA' may not have a private key that is capable of key exchange or the process may not have access rights for the private key I have created certificates using the following commands makecert -n "CN=TempCA" -r -sv TempCA.pvk TempCA.cer -sky Exchange -pe makecert -sk SignedByCA -iv TempCA.pvk -n "CN=SignedByCA" -ic TempCA.cer SignedByCA.cer -sr localmachine -ss My The TempCA.cer has been imported into the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities\Certificates" and the SignedByCA.cer into the "Personal\Certificates" I then ran the following command pvk2pfx.exe -pvk TempCA.pvk -spc TempCA.cer and imported the TempCA.pfx into the "Personal\Certificates" The service config file is as follows (Taken from an MSDN tutorial and modified for my project) I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to resolve this but I'm not making any real progress...
