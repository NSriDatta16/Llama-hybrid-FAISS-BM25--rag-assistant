The expected hitting time is equal to the amount of time it takes to get from 0 to 6. At every jump of the Markov chain, you can either remain at the same state, i.e. you've thrown a number you already got before, or jump to the next state, meaning that you've collected a new number. Thus if $\tau$ is the total time it takes to get from 0 to 6 and $\tau_i$ is the time it took to get from $i$ to $i+1$, you want to calculate: $$E[\tau]=E[\sum_{i=0}^{5}\tau_i]=\sum_{i=0}^5E[\tau_i],$$ by linearity of expectation. Jumping from i to i+1 has has expected time: $$E[\tau_i]=\sum_{k=0}^\infty k(i/6)^k (1-i/6),$$ i.e. the expected value of a geometric distribution with success probability $p=1-i/6$, which has expected value $6/(6-i)$. This is how you arrive at: $$E[\tau]=\sum_{i=0}^5\frac{6}{6-i}$$ The generalized form of this problem is known as the coupon-collector problem .
