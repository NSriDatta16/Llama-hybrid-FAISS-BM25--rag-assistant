1) The reason this appears correct sometimes is simply how the text breaks in your paragraphs. Your p tags are taking the full width of your main div, so putting right padding isn't doing to help. Instead, just put some padding on your image. Line 190: #target2 { float: right; padding-left: 5px; } 2) You can use negative margins the same way you do for the picture rows. Line 178: #googlemap { margin-bottom: -130px; } 3) Remove margin-bottom: -10px; from this rule: #container #main #rotxt { font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",Times,serif; font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 35px; padding-left: 1px; } Update For the Google map footer issue in IE7, try adding this rule to a IE7 stylesheet (see here for info on conditional comments): #footer { z-index: -1; position: relative; }
