What does "Fama-MacBeth logit regressions" mean?

On page 10 of this paper the author states that In this section, I use monthly Fama and MacBeth (1973) logit regression [...] to examine the type of forecast. My question(s) are: what does this mean, is it even remotely justified by the typical conditions making normal Fama-MacBeth procedure (namely, that asset returns are approximately serially uncorrelated), and how does the nonlinearity of error in the coefficient estimate affect the aggregation of the cross-sectional estimates? My take is that it means that he runs a single cross-sectional regression each month and forms the point estimates and standard errors from the time series of these estimates, probably not exactly, but this is not so important (people use Fama-MacBeth in many contexts where the individual estimates are not independent), and I have no idea. Any insight or other interpretations of this would be much appreciated. I would also welcome references to other papers applying a similar methodology ( here is one ). A fully rigorous argument (or pointer towards one) justifying (or showing it to be incorrect) such a procedure would be optimal.
