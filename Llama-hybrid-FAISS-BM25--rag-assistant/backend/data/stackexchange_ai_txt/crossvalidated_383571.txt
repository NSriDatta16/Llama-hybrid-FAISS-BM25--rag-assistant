When it comes to collinearity, we have to distinguish exact collinearity from approximate collinearity. The former occurs when one independent variable (IV) is an exact linear combination of other independent variables. Usually this is due to some sort of elementary mistake (like entering weight in pounds and also weight in kilograms) and is easily corrected. The latter occurs when one IV is almost a linear combination of other IVs. Assessing when "almost" is close enough to be troublesome can be done through various means, the one I think best is condition indexes and proportion of variance explained; this has been discussed elsewhere and I won't add more here. In your case, it is very unlikely that the relationship between sex and weight is close enough to cause trouble. In a general population, it's true that men, on average, weigh more than women. But there's lots of overlap: There are plenty of light men and heavy women. If (for some reason) your sample consisted of jockeys and football players, then it would cause problems. The problems that collinearity causes include high variances for the parameter estimates and extreme sensitivity to changes in the data. In other words, we only have a very poor idea of what the parameter estimates are and a small change in the input data can result in a huge change in the parameter estimates.
