Redendant levels are most often called reference levels you can just replace 0's in Estimate column with reference level note or change description of non-refrence levels e.g. [country=1 vs 3] or make another footnote under your table saying "Reference levels: country=3, gender=1". Basically I want to make a table which includes Estimates, Standard error and significance. Can I somehow put country as one variable? You can get significance of country as one variable. You can't get Estimate and Std. error for it. Why? Just take a look on Estimate 's interpretation. 1.07 for country=1 means that in this country OC_A_Total is on average 1.07 units higher than in reference country ( country=3 ), adjusting for age , gender and the rest of your variables, of course. Similarly, you can say, that in country=2 it is 1.005 units higher. These two estimates can not be collapsed into one (at least if you still wish it to have some clear interpretation).
