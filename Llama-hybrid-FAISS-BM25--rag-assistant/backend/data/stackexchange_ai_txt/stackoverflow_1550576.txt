I do something similar, except that I include credit card slips and cash purchases as well as checks. It's basic bookkeeping. For a variety of reasons, I chose to have a table called "almanac" with one row (record) for every date. There are columns (fields) for such things as day of the week, month of the year, and so on. I populate this table with a little code fragment written in VB. Even with ten years worth of dates, that's only about 3,653 rows in the table. I then use simple joins with this table to reduce transaction data to data that's summarized by month. I can summarize in other ways, too. The query is so easy that I just did it with the graphical query interface. However, my summary would have twelve times as many rows as yours, with only one month in each row. When I want data laid out in the format of your master table, I use one of two tools: the crosstab query tool in MS Access, or the Pivot Table tool in MS Excel. They are both very powerful, but the pivot tool is more flexible. I had to install an add in called MS query in Excel in order to query database data from Excel. That may be a function of the version I'm using. This is very different from your framework, and it's your choice whether to use it. It's worked well for me.
