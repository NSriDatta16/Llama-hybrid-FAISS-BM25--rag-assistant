Is there any C# equivalent to the Perl's LWP::UserAgent?

In a project I'm invovled in, there is a requirment that the price of certain stocks will be queryed from some web interface and be displayed in some way. I know the "query" part of the requirment can be easily implemented using a Perl module like LWP::UserAgent. But for some reason, C# has been chosen as the language to implement the Display part. I don't want to add any IPC (like socket, or indirectly by database) into this tiny project, so my question is there any C# equivalent to the Perl's LWP::UserAgent?
