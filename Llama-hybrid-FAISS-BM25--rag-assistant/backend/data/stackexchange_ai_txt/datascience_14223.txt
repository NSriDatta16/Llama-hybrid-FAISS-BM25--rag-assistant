Directly proportional Trend in training and cross validation curves

In continuation with a question already asked, I tried the same curve on a different dataset I found. My model is a simple Logistic regression curve with OnevsRest Classifier. But the graph I obtained this time was different. What could be a possible reason for this? As explained in the other answer, if it takes less data to fit better, shouldn't the accuracy decrease here as well?
