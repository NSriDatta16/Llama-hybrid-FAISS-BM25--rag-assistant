The interpretation of the command line is up to the launched program. Depending on the nature of the installed e-mail client, you may or may not get your Unicode support (in one or another different shape or form). So there's no single recipe. Some of them may use ANSI command line (because why not?), some of them may respect URLEncoded characters, etc. Your best bet is to detect 3-4 popular mailers by reading the registry and customize your command line accordingly. Very inelegant, and incomplete by design, but nothing else you can do.
