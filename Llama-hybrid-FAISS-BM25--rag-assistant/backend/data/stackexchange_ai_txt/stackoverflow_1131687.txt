how to upcast object array to another type of object array in C#?

I want to upcast object array to different array of different object type like below object[] objects; // assuming that it is non-empty CLassA[] newObjects = objects as ClassA[]; // assuming that object to ClassA is valid upcasting is there any way other than upcasting each element individually?
