I'm in an iPhone provisioning mess -- Insight needed

My app has been more or less ready to be submitted for a while now, but as usual, the overly complex provisioning nonsense that Apple forces developers to jump through is causing me an enormous amount of stress. Initially the problem I was receiving was Invalid Codesign. After trying every 'solution' i could find on the internet and failing, I decided that it would be best if I started fresh -- Deleted all my provioning profiles, cleaned up my itunes connect account, deleted all my keys and certificate from the keychain access and started from scratch. The problem is that once I deleted by keys and developer certificate from the keychain access, I cant get them back!!! I've tried restarting, I've tried installing it every way imaginable, but I just cant get anything to be listed in the 'keys' nor 'my certificates' sections of the keychain access. I do have an iPhone edveloper profile in the 'certificates section' but this doesnt even seem to be of any use because when I look in the Organizer there are no developer profiles listed, and all my provisioning profiles warn "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain" Someone please help me through this mess. I've been developing my app for several months now and I already have an app in the App Store but Apple insists on making this process damn near impossible. Thanks so much!!!
