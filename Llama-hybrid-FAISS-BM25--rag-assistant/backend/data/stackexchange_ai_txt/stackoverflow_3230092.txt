cakePHP "session" is not returning session ID

I am into development of a cakePHP based web application. Here are my core.php settings for session handling Configure::write('Session.save', 'database'); /** * The name of the table used to store CakePHP database sessions. * * 'Session.save' must be set to 'database' in order to utilize this constant. * * The table name set here should *not* include any table prefix defined elsewhere. */ Configure::write('Session.table', 'cake_sessions'); /** * The DATABASE_CONFIG::$var to use for database session handling. * * 'Session.save' must be set to 'database' in order to utilize this constant. */ //Configure::write('Session.database', 'default'); Configure::write('Session.start', true); /** * The name of CakePHP's session cookie. */ Configure::write('Session.cookie', 'CAKEPHP'); /** * Session time out time (in seconds). * Actual value depends on 'Security.level' setting. */ Configure::write('Session.timeout', '300'); /** * If set to false, sessions are not automatically started. */ Configure::write('Session.start', true); /** * When set to false, HTTP_USER_AGENT will not be checked * in the session */ Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', true); /** * The level of CakePHP security. The session timeout time defined * in 'Session.timeout' is multiplied according to the settings here. * Valid values: * * 'high' Session timeout in 'Session.timeout' x 10 * 'medium' Session timeout in 'Session.timeout' x 100 * 'low' Session timeout in 'Session.timeout' x 300 * * CakePHP session IDs are also regenerated between requests if * 'Security.level' is set to 'high'. CakePHP session id is always blank. although other session read/write activities are working perfectly fine. Below is the session object. SessionComponent Object ( [__active] => 1 [__started] => [__bare] => 0 [valid] => [error] => Array ( [2] => Auth.redirect doesn't exist ) [_userAgent] => 2abebfb51fc971ec64569f7cd415fe0b [path] => / [lastError] => 2 [security] => high [time] => 1278950154 [sessionTime] => 1278953154 [watchKeys] => Array ( ) [id] => [_log] => [host] =>localhost [enabled] => 1 [cookieLifeTime] => 0 ) All the other session variable are stored and retrieved properly, the problem is I am not getting session id at any stage. Can you please help me what can be problem. Thanks, Sourabh
