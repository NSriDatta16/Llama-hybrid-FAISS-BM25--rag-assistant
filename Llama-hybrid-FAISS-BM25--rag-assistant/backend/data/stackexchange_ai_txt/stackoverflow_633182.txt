I use multicore quite regularly when performing monte carlo simulations. In this case it can be an absolute godsend, because sometimes these simulations take forever and each run is independent of every other run. In fact, right now I'm waiting for a monte carlo simulation to run on my quad core. Another use case is when testing a machine learning algorithm using cross-validation. The dataset can be loaded once and stored in an immutable object. Then, each cross-validation iteration can be performed independently. For things like this, the key is to be careful about memory allocations and avoid the implicit lock acquisition this involves. If you allocate and free/garbage collect infrequently enough, the speedup can be near linear in cores used.
