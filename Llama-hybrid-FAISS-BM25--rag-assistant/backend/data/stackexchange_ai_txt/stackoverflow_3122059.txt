I'm assuming you're using the visual studio designer..if not, let me know. Put down a ToolStrip Container, change it's visibility to be (assuming you want it at the top of your app) top only, then click "Dock Fill in Form" Now add drag two toolstrips onto the container. Presto :-) Edit: Per your requirements, it gets a bit tricky, but not so bad. Click on your toolstrip so it has the small white box in the upper left hand corner, and the small triangle in the upper right. Click the triangle and change Dock to "None" Now manually stretch it to fill half the screen/whatever and do the same for the second toolbar. Only problem with this approach is that occasionally, i've noticed visual studio "repositioning" the toolbars a pixel or two randomly after a compile. So, double check before releasing to the customer :-D
