How to validate a model when the data is highly imbalanced?

My data is highly skewed with about 1% positive cases and 99% negative cases. How can I validate a machine learning model like a random forest on this data? Naturally, I prefer 10-fold cross validation but that does not work because some folds will always contain only negative cases. Is there a way arround that? Stratified 100-fold cross validation might work but also introduces a lot of variance.
