When is it time to create a 2nd database?

I have a mysql database which has grown to over 200 tables in it. I know this isn't a performance problem, but most admin tools I have aren't organized well enough to manage this number of tables easily, and I am thinking of putting some (new) tables into a 2nd database just for my own sanity. Has anyone else gone down this path, and was it worthwhile, or did it end up being more trouble than having one monolithic database? Edit: Thanks for all the answers, although I was looking for some real-world experiences rather than hypothetical advice, sorry I can't pick a right answer.
