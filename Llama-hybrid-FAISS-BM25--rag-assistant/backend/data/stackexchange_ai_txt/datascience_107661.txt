Auto-ML for only fixed estimator

Am working on a binary classification with 1000 rows and 28 columns. I would wish to use an Auto-ML solution to try out different combinations of hyperparameters etc but the algo should only be logistic regression . I don't wish to use other algorithms for the lack of interpretability. So, I would like my auto-ML solution to stick to logistic regression and try out different values for hyperparameters. Of course, I might use fixed estimators like Decision trees, random forests etc as well Is there any auto-ML solution that can use fixed estimator? I read about Tpot , Evalml , AutoML etc but they all try multiple algorithms and finally output the best one (which may not be logistic regression). How can I restrict my auto-ML solution to only use logistic regression?
