Export to word with a filename doesn't seem to work

I export a datatable to word, when I pass a file name it doesn't seem to get the file name in Open/Save dialog box. Here is what I am doing public static void Convertword(DataTable dt, HttpResponse Response,string filename) { try { Response.Clear(); Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment;filename=" + filename + ".doc"); Response.Charset = ""; Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ContentType = "application/vnd.word"; System.IO.StringWriter stringWrite = new System.IO.StringWriter(); System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter(stringWrite); System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView dg = new System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView(); dg.DataSource = dt; dg.DataBind(); dg.RenderControl(htmlWrite); Response.Write(stringWrite.ToString()); Response.End(); } catch(Exception err) { throw err; } } When I pass filename "report(" + System.DateTime.Now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy"); + ")" it doesn't take the value as dd/MM/YYYY instead it shows file name as dd_MM_YYYY
