I may be misunderstanding, but I really cannot understand WHY you want to do this but it is doable: #pragma comment( linker, "/out:c:\mydll.dll" ) I cannot re-iterate enough exactly how much you don't want to be doing this though ... If you want to GET the output path via pre-processor info then, I'm afraid ... you can't. That info comes from several steps after the pre-processor so there is no way the pre-processor could get that info.
