R lrm model with no predictors

I am creating multiple logistic regression models using lrm from Harrell's Design package in R. One model I would like to make is the model with no predictors. For example, I want to predict a constant c such that: logit(Y) ~ c I know I how to compute c (divide the number of "1"s by the total), what I would like is to use lrm so I can manipulate it as a model in a consistent way with the other models I am making. Is this possible, and if so how? I have tried so far: library(Design) data(mtcars) lrm(am ~ 1, data=mtcars) which gives the error: Error in dimnames(stats) and I have tried: lrm(am ~ ., data=mtcars) But this uses all the predictors, rather then none of the predictors.
