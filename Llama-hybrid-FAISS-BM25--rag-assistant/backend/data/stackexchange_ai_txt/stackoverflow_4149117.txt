How can I implement the button, that holds an action (QAction) and can connect with one in designtime in QtDesigner?

I want to use an approach, when most of application commands hold in QActions, so that I could drag actions easily into menu, or toolbar, or button, or anything. So, I need to implement such a button. It is easy to write some class, that will hold it, take icon, text, shortcut and tooltip from it and connect clicked() to triggered(). But I can't even force my button's 'action' property into designer. Seems, that only QVariant holdable types may appear in it's property editor. BUT! Trolls did it somehow, so the task should be achievable. So, any suggestions?
