Intersection of multiple gamma distributions

Let's say I own a few hundred McDonalds locations. In a subset of those (say 100) I observe vegans eating there and I estimate the arrival time of vegans at these 100 restaurants using a Poisson distribution (so 100 different Poisson RVs with their own lambda values). Ie) at restaurant "A" I observe a lambda of 1.5 / hour and at "B" it is 3/hour etc. Overall I model the distribution of these individual lambdas as a Gamma. Now say I observe another characteristic - bearded customers for example - in another subset of restaurants (say again 100 for simplicity). And I follow the exact same process as above (model arrival times of beards with Poisson at each of the 100 locations and have 100 different lambdas modeled with a Gamma). What can I say (if anything) about the intersection between these two gammas? Specifically, what does the distribution of the rate parameter for people that are vegan AND have a beard look like given I have the rate parameters for vegans and beards separately? Additional knowns: Total # of locations observed with bearded vegans + total # of bearded vegans observed. Concretely say there were 50 total locations with bearded-vegans (out of the 100 with vegans and 100 with beards) and a total of 150 bearded-vegan customers across those 50 locations (so an average lambda of 3)
