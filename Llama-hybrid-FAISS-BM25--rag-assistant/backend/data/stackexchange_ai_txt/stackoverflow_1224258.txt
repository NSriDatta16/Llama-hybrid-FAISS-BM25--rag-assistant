I'd say that using for this purpose is actually less semantic then using - you're most certainly not creating a definition list. Link, header and paragraph wrapped in a div seem perfectly acceptable to me. You can try using unordered list instead; but you'll likely have same (or worse as you won't have dt / dd separation anymore) problems with CSS as you did with . Plus using header tags won't validate within list item either, so you'll have to resort to another paragraph / div / span - definitely less than ideal. Update (based on idrumgood 's comment below): Header (and other block-level elements) do validate within unordered list item, so perhaps the following approach would both be semantic and work with your styles: Title description goes here
