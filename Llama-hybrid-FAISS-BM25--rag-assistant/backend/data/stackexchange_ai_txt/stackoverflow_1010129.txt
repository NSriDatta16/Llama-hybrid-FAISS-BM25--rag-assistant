What sort of things can cause these errors? Doing naughty things with memory, e.g. writing after the end of a buffer, or writing to a buffer after it's been freed back to the heap. How do I debug them? Use an instrument which adds automated bounds-checking to your executable: i.e. valgrind on Unix, or a tool like BoundsChecker (Wikipedia suggests also Purify and Insure++) on Windows. Beware that these will slow your application, so they may be unusable if yours is a soft-real-time application. Another possible debugging aid/tool might be MicroQuill's HeapAgent.
