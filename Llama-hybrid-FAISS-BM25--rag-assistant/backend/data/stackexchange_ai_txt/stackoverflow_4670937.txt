Creating requests in fiddler2 gives a 401 unauthorized but the 200 negotiated request doesn't follow

I'm trying to use fiddler to generate requests to receive a JSON response. I drag a request that was captured from IE with a 200 response into the request builder then change the Accept header to "Accept: application/json". After that I execute the request and get a 401 unauthorized response but the negotiation with a following 200 response does not take place. If there another way I can get this to work?
