Why are parsing tools needed for DSLs?

Couldn't a DSL be as simple as an API and therefore not need a parser? Or am I misunderstanding what a domain specific language really is? I thought it referred to any organized set of rules for solving a particular domain problem. An API would seem to fit that definition, right?
