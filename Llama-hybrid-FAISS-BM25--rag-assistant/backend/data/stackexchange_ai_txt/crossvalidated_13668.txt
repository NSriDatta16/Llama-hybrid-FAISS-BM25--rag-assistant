Fruequentist: By constructing an 1-alpha confidence interval, 1-alpha confidence intervals generated this way will include the "true" population parameter. Here the population parameter is fixed and the boundaries of the confidence interval are random. This, however, says nothing about the probability of a certain confidence interval including the population parameter after the fact. After the fact, the confidence interval either includes the population parameter or it does not. There is nothing probabilistic anymore. So one cannot say that the true parameter lies within the confidence interval {-0.34, 0.2} with a probability of 95%, but rather that 95% of the confidence intervals generated by the same procedure (random sampling etc.) will include the fixed population parameter. A good animation illustrating confidence intervals can be found on Yihui Xie's Website, who is author of the animation package in R: Animation of confidence intervals: http://animation.yihui.name/mathstat:confidence_interval Animation Package on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html Bayesian Bayesians on the other hand incorporate uncertainty/information about the population parameter in their statistics (this is the so called "prior"). So a credible interval might be better thought of as a region of highest subjective believe. "Based on the prior information and the data I believe to 1-alpha % that the interval {-0.34, 0.2} includes the parameter". Most of the times this subjective believe is based on ohter data. Practical Use Both intervals say something about the accuracy of our estimate. If you want to let the data speak for themselves, you could use confidence intervals or bayesian credible intervals with a uniform prior. If, however, you have strong prior information that you want to not only include in your discussion section but also in your statistics, I would use credible intervals. So to me the problem is more one of what you want and less one of interpretation.
