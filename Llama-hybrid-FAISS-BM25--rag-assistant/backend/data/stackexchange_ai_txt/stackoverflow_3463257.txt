Because of the relationship between C strings, arrays, and pointers the exercise is rather shotty IMHO - the most idiomatic description of a "String" in C is represented by the char*, which is not an array. Your (the OPs) title and post differ in their definitions between string and char[fixed length]. The OP should read and understand this FAQ entry , and between that and the posts here: easily figure out a solutionâ€”as well as defend it to the teacher/judge if need be. I'll comment on this: never use scanf("%s", buffer) to populate a fixed length string. If you must use scanf() to do it, please use a field width specifier: e.g. scanf("%9s", buffer); if buffer is an [10], you want a specifier of 9 because of how scanf fills the buffer: otherwise you must beware the dragons! You could also scanf by character and evade the issue with a loops bounds, but that would likely be less efficient.
