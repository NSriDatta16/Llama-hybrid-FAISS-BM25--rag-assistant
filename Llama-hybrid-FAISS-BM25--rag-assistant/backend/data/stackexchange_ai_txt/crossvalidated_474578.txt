Forecasting with empirical copulas

I estimated the beta copula with 3 variable time series. Now I'd like to make forecasts to evaluate the out-of-sample performance of my model. I know 2 of the 3 variables and I have the dependence structure (copula density), how can I predict the third, unknown variable? In general, how does one make predictions with copula models? thanks
