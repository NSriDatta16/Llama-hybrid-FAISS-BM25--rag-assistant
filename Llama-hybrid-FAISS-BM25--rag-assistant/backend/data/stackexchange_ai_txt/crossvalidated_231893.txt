Odds ratio necessary to achieve a certain power

I have the data resulting from a genome wide association study. What this means is that logistic regression has been used to determine the association of each genetic variant with the phenotype (which is case/control), with the desired statistic being an odds ratio. I believe the power will be calculated with based on four components: The effect size (in this case odds ratio), The threshold of statistical significance, The number of samples, And the minor allele frequency in the sample (in other words, the prevalence of the less-common value of the independent variable). So if I take that list and swap out the effect size for the desired power, I should be able to calculate the odds ratio I need. I imagine the process working like this: I use the significance level to find the corresponding z-score, I calculate the standard error of the odds ratio from the sample size and minor allele frequency, I use the z-score and the standard error to determine the minimum odds ratio that will pass the test, and I then determine how large the odds ratio needs to be, given its standard error, for there to be an 80% chance (or any other power level) that it will be higher than the minimum passing z-score. First of all, is this correct? If it is, then my question is: how do I determine the standard error of the odds ratio? In case an example is helpful, I have one genetic variant that has 61,000 samples, 28% of which are A and 72% of which are B. Given that my significance threshold is $5 \times 10^{-8}$, how large an odds ratio would this variant have to have for the power to be 0.8? Edit: Additionally, should I be doing this with the log OR instead?
