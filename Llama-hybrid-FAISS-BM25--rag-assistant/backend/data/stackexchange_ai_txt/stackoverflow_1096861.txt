Can WinPcap be used to capture network traffic per process?

On Windows I am loading a DLL and running it. The DLL performs a lot of network activities. Now I need to monitor which url and hosts the DLL connects to. I think using a packet sniffer might be a good option. Can WinPcap be used to capture traffic from a single process? I can't find any such option in the docs. If that canâ€™t be done using WinPcap, is there any other library or solution beside it that can capture data from a single selected process only?
