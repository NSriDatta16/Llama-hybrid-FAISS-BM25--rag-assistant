How can I best fill the gaps of my mathematics knowledge?

Every so often I get the impression that my knowledge of mathematics (as it pertains to the field of software development) has some gaps. I'm an educated person. I have a college degree. I've always enjoyed learning, which is why I would like to try to fill in these gaps. My job is in the financial industry, and I feel like many of the large-scale number crunching tasks that we do could be made more efficient, possibly, if I had a better grasp on the mathematics/logic that's going into it, or concepts that could be leveraged as a shortcut. Do you have any suggestions? Books that you've found helped with this? Video lectures? EDIT: I should note that my degree is in Computer Science, so I am familiar with some of the areas of mathematics that are relevant. I'm just not sure how best to brush up on them or to refine what I already know :)
