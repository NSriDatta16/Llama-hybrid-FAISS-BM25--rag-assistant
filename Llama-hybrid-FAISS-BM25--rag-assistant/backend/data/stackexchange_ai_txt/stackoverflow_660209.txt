May be you have ClearCase LT , which only provides snapshot view ? As mentioned in the ClearCase mkview help page : Specifying the kind of view Default ClearCase: Dynamic view. ClearCase LT: Snapshot view Anyway, you can try to create your views through command line cleartool : Snapshot: cleartool mkview -snap -tag yourView_snap -stream yourStream@\yourPVob -stg aStorage aViewPath Dynamic: cleartool mkview -tag yourView -stream yourStream@\yourPVob -stg aStorage Please note the naming convention (yourView_snap for snapshot view): this is a convention, and it should reflect: your login the name of the stream More details in this other SO answer . Also note that an "integration view" is not always made for a "dynamic view": if you make some "integration test" involving some compilation, a snapshot view may be more adapted.
