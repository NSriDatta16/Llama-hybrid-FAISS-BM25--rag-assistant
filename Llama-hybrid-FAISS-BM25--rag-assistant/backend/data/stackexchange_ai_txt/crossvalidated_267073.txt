As @DeltaIV hinted in his or her comment, Bayesian methods are a natural fit for this. Using linear regression in a Bayesian fashion means treating the parameters (viz., the coefficients and the SD of the error term) as random variables. If you think a certain coefficient is more likely to have certain values, you can choose a prior distribution for that random variable that puts more weight on the values in question.
