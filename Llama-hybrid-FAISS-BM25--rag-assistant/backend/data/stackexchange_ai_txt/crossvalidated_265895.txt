Selecting SVM regression parameters based on a knowledge driven analysis

I have been going through the literature for SVM regression and I find that majority of the focus is on selecting a model using grid search. This is a completely data driven approach. I would like to see a more knowledge driven approach in selecting the hyperparameters epsilon, gamma and C. Please refer me to a good paper or article highlighting the workflow for selection of SVM parameters by a knowledge driven approach based on understanding of the various features and data points.
