What are you matching against? A referer url? Assuming you're matching against a referer url that looks like this: http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=whatever+site:foo.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 A regex like this should do the trick: \bsite(?:\:|%3[aA])(?:(?!(?:%20|\+|&|$)).)+ Notes: The colon after 'site' can either be unencoded or it can be percent encoded. Most user agents will leave it unencoded (which I believe is actually contrary to the standard), but this will handle both I assumed the site:... url would be right-bounded by the equivalent of a space character, end of field (&) or end of string ($) I didn't assume x-www-form-urlencoded encoding (spaces == '+') or spaces encoded with percent encoding (space == %20). This will handle both The (?:...) is a non-capturing group. (?!...) is a negative lookahead.
