SpreadsheetGear for .NET comes with an Excel compatible Windows Forms spreadsheet control which you can simply drag to your form. It includes a Workbook Designer which allows you to edit workbooks right in Visual Studio or load Excel workbooks from disk, and also includes a comprehensive API which is similar to Excel (except that it is .NET friendly). You can learn more and try the free evaluation for yourself if this might work for you. Disclaimer: I own SpreadsheetGear LLC
