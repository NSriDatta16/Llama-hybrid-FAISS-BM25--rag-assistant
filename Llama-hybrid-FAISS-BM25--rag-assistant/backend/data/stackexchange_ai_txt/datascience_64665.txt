Nice question. I can tell you two possible approaches from my experience with sensor data coming from IoT devices (in the industrial sector). Assuming you have several signals over time (temperature, pressure, torque...), you might be interested in: estimating whether a single data sample (i.e. 1 row of X signals values) is normal or an anomaly resampling your time series to a lower frequency applying summary statistics for each of the new resampled package of signals (e.g. from the original signals frequency in seconds to a new minutes interval); in this case, there is a nice package called tsfresh (time series fresh), as this creates an inmense group of new attributes for each resampled signal (e.g. median, std, min, max... for each minute interval of each signal)... Once the preprocessing is done, you could apply models like OC-SVM (one-class support vector machine), IF (isolation forest)... as semi-supervised learning strategy (i.e. knowing the data of the normal behaviour, create a model which can detect anomalies far from this behaviour).
