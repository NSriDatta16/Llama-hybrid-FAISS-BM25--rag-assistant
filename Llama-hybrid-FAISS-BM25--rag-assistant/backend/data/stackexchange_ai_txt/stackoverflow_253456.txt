Quick edit mode in cmd.exe is my favorite. This is slightly off topic, but when interacting with the command shell it can be a lifesaver. No, I'm not being hyperbolic--you will only see caret-capitol-v a certain number of times before you die; the more you see, the faster you die. Open up regedit (caution, not my fault, blue screen, etc) Go to HKCU/Console Set QuickEdit to 1 (You can set this from the UI as well, which is probably the better way. See the comments for instructions. Also there's a nice one line script to do this as well.) Now, to copy, just left-click and drag to select and right click to copy. To paste, just right click. NO MORE ^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V^V!!! Crap, I think I just killed somebody. Sorry!
