It looks like your current approach is taking a long time because you are trying to search a large space of hyperparameters. One way to make the hyperparameter search more efficient is to use a smaller number of values for each hyperparameter, as this will reduce the total number of combinations that need to be tried. There are several ways to optimize the hyperparameter tuning process for an SVM, including the following: Use a smaller sample of the dataset for hyperparameter tuning, as the processing time will be proportional to the size of the dataset. Use a more efficient algorithm for hyperparameter tuning, such as Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms, which can find the optimal hyperparameters in a more efficient manner. Use a more efficient implementation of the SVM algorithm, such as the LibSVM library, which can be faster than the default SVM implementation in scikit-learn. Try different combinations of hyperparameters manually, rather than using grid search or randomized search, which can be computationally intensive. Use a more efficient kernel, such as the linear kernel, which can be faster to train than more complex kernels such as the polynomial or RBF kernels. Use a smaller number of hyperparameters, as the processing time will be proportional to the number of hyperparameters being tuned. Use a coarser grid for hyperparameter tuning, such as increasing the stepsize for the values of the hyperparameters, as this can reduce the number of combinations to be tested. Overall, it is important to carefully select and optimize the hyperparameters for an SVM to improve its performance and reduce the processing time. Also, check - SVC classifier taking too much time for training
