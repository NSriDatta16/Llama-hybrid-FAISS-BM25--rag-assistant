Short answer: you don't. If you need to serialize your objects, use an ORM, or even better something like activerecord or prevaylence. If you need to store data, store it in a relational manner (being careful about what you are storing, and paying attention to what Jeffrey L Whitledge just said), not one affected by your object design.
