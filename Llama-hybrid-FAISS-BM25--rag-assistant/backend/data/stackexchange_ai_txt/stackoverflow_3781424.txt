I generally create a NavigationController object which has knowledge about both my UINavigationController and my viewControllers. If you give each of your VCs a reference to an object like this, or make it a singleton, then it can handle things like this for you. There is nothing wrong with embedding navigation logic in view controllers, but it can make them harder to maintain when they know about every other view controller. Encapsulating navigation logic in a shared object makes your app easier to understand and maintain. YMMV
