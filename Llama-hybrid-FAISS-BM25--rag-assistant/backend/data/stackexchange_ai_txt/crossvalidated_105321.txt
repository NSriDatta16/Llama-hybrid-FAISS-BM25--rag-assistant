The suggestion of using a zero-inflated Poisson model is an interesting start. It has some benefits of jointly modeling the probability of having any illness-related costs as well as the process of what those costs turn out to be should you have any illness. It has the limitation that it imposes some strict structure on what the shape of the outcome is, conditional upon having accrued any costs (e.g. a specific mean-variance relationship and a positive integer outcome... the latter of which can be relaxed for some modeling purposes). If you are okay with treating the illness-related admission and illness-related costs conditional upon admission processes independently, you can extend this by first modeling the binary process of y/n did you accrue any costs related to illness? This is a simple logistic regression model and allows you to evaluate risk factors and prevalence. Given that, you can restrict an analysis to the subset of individuals having accrued any costs and model the actual cost process using a host of modeling techinques. Poisson is good, quasi-poisson would be better (accounting for small unmeasured sources of covariation in the data and departures from model assumptions). But sky's the limit with modeling the continuous cost process. If you absolutely need to model the correlation of parameters in the process, you can use bootstrap SE estimates. I see no reason why this would be invalid, but would be curious to hear others' input if this might be wrong. In general, I think those are two separate questions and should be treated as such to have valid inference.
