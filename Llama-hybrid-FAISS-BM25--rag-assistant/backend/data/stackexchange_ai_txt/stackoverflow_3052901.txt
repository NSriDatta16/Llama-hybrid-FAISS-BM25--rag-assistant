CruiseControl.Net 1.5, htmlReportPlugin, how to make/keep build-specific copies of the html-files?

I'm using NCover 3.4 (current as of 2010-06-16) to create html reports, which I wish to link to from CCNet. This article explains how, http://csut017.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/improved-ncover-integration/ but my build-specific report is not stored in a way that is expected in article(?). At least it does not work for me. I guess the question is - given a directory with files, how do I get them included in my build-log? I get reports generated in ./src/coverage/FullCoverageReport during the build. When I click my report link in dashboard () I get [6:WARN] Unable to find file '74\coverage\FullCoverageReport\fullcoveragereport.html' in 'HealthMonitor'
