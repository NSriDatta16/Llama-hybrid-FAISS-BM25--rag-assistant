SNMPv1 uses community strings, which became context-IDs in SNMPv2c. Essentially it's the same thing but a slightly different way of looking at things. SNMPv3 has security and all kinds of additions that make the protocol anything but simple. If you try and make SNMPv2c requests on a SNMPv1 device you will run into problems if the SNMPv2c manager is using get-bulk requests (where it requests more than 1 subsequent object at a time, useful for pulling in columnar objects quickly). SNMPv1 has no support for bulk operations. So, a SNMPv1 manager may be able to retrieve objects from SNMPv2c agents. But a SNMPv2c manager may have trouble getting objects from a SNMPv1 device. Mixing SNMPv3 with anything else is asking for trouble.
