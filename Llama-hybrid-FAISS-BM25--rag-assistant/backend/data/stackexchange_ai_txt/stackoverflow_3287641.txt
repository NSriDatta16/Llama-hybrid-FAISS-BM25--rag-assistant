What is the best paid proxy service for google search ranking tool?

I'm struggling to find a good and reliable paid proxy service to run a script that reports on organic search results for a set of keywords. Does anyone have any recommendations? We'll be analyzing 60 keywords against 30 urls per day and our setup is LAMP based using Curl for the script. Any advice would be welcome. Thanks Jonathan
