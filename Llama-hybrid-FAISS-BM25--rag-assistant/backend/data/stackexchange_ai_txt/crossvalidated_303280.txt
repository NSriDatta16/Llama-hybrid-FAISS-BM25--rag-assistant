What is data called that is fed into a model?

I know the differences between training, validation and test data. Just to be clear "training data" is used to make multiple models with different hyperparameters "validation data" is used to choose one of these models "test data" is used to ascertain how well the chosen model is really doing or to quote "Ripley, B.D. (1996) Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 354": Training set: A set of examples used for learning, that is to fit the parameters [i.e., weights] of the classifier. Validation set: A set of examples used to tune the hyperparameters [i.e., architecture, not weights] of a classifier, for example to choose the number of hidden units in a neural network. Test set: A set of examples used only to assess the performance [generalization] of a fully-specified classifier. Now let's assume I am already done with the whole modelling process, I got my model and have put it into production (e.g. to classify products on an assembly line in a manufacturer). What do I call the data that is now classified? I am not using it for testing, as I am not getting any model statistics from it - it does not have labels - but I am applying my model to it. If there is not already a word for it, and idea might be classificand, modelland or something similar, since "-end" or "-and" are suffixes forming nouns denoting patients or recipients of actions, such as addend, subtrahend, and dividend. , but I was actually going more for something like "... data". PS: rand on Why is it called "validation" dataset? I feel that is misleading name. "tuning" dataset would be more appropriate, because that is what it is used for. The "test data" is currently used for actual validation. rand off
