Cyclic dependency between feature and predictor class

I have a feature which has specific categorical values ex(Technology, Hardware, Software, Marketing, Evnts etc). Based on this and some other features, I am trying to classify the dataset into 2 categories IsSoftwareSystem or NotSoftwareSystem. In this case is this cause a reduce in accuracy because i am feeding the category itself in the data and trying to predict the same. Using Random Forest/XGB.
