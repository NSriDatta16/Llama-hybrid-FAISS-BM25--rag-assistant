Is there an event that fires on changes to scrollHeight or scrollWidth in jQuery?

I'm using JQuery to design an application where the user can drag elements inside of a div that automatically adds scrollbars and expands the scrollHeight/scrollWidth as needed. I need to fire off an even when the scrollHeight and scrollWidth of the container div are changed. No, don't want to use the scroll event because 1) scroll doesn't get fired when you just start dragging an element to the edge and the scrollHeight/scrollWidth change. 2) scroll fires when the scrollHeight/scrollWidth doesn't change. Any hints?
