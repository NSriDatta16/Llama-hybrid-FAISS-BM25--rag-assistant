Maybe I have missed some nuance of your Question; the answer seems almost too simple. Sorry if I'm wasting your time with this. The brief Wikipedia article on mixture distributions has some relevant material. Because $f_Z = \alpha f_X + (1-\alpha)f_Y$ you have $$E(Z) = \alpha E(X) + (1-\alpha) E(Y),$$ and then $\alpha = E(Z-Y)/E(X-Y).$ You can use means of the samples you have to estimate the required expectations, and thus $\alpha.$ Here is a brief simulation of 100,000 $Z_i$ s that are a mixture with $\alpha = 1/3$ of standard normal and standard uniform. [See this page for more elegant and more general methods of simulation.] m = 10^5 x = rnorm(m); y = runif(m) MAT = cbind(x,y) id = sample(1:2, m, rep=T, p=c(1,2)) z = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m) { z[i] = MAT[i,id[i]] } mean(z) [1] 0.3333354 # aprx 1/3 = 0(1/3) + (1/2)(2/3) hist(z, prob=T, br=50, col="skyblue2") curve((1/3)*dnorm(x)+(2/3)*dunif(x), add=T, col="red", n=10001) mean(z-y)/mean(x-y) [1] 0.3314798 # aprx 1/3 = alpha
