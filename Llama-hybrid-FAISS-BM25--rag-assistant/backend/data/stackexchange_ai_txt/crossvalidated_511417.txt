Since your outcome is binary and you are using OLS, you are in essence running a Linear Probability Model . Since your predictor is also binary, OLS is estimating two conditional probabilites here: $P(\text{Divorce}=1|\text{OneParent}=0) = \beta_0 = 0.238$ $P(\text{Divorce}=1|\text{OneParent}=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 = 0.238 + 0.095 = 0.333$ Your $t$ -statistic is further telling you that there is a statistically significant difference between the divorce rates of the two groups (e.g., at $\alpha = 0.05$ ). Note two things: There are more standard test procedures for a simple comparison of proportions, e.g. $\chi^2$ tests or Fisher's exact test which you can employ outside a generalized linear model framework (test results and confidence intervals should not differ meaningfully given the large sample size here) A good reason to specify a model nonenethelss would be to include further predictors, e.g. some of which could be confounders of your relationship between predictor and outcome. If you want to answer a causal question with your model, you will definitely have to adjust for some potentially ommitted variables, or look for instrumental variables (there is a huge literature on instrumental variable approaches to estimate trans-generational effects in economics and epidemiology). $R^2 tells you that the vast majority of variation in your data is unexplaiend There is some debate around linear probability models. In general, most people recommend link functions that limit the range of outcomes between 0 and 1, as in logistic regression. This will become relevant when you add continous predictor variables (e.g., age) which would extrapolate probabilities of divorce beyond 0 and 1
