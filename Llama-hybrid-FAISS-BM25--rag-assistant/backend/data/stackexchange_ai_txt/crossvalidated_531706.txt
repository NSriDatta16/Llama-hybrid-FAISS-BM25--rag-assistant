Autoencoders as dimensionality reduction tools..?

I'm trying to get a basic understanding of AutoEncoders. Basically they are neural networks with a very low representation of the original input in some hidden layer, and then a final layer which has exact same dimension as the input but 'reconstructed' from the latent lower-dimensional representation. What I don't understand is what should we do with autoencoders, apart from denoising or compression. For example, would it be possible to use the latent representation as a dimensionality-reducted version of the original input, and then using it to train some Machine Learning Model? Many thanks, James
