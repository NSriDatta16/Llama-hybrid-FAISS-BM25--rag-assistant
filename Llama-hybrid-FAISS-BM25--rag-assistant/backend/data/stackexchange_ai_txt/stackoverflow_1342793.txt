I've only used InfoPath for one or two things in MOSS. It seems to me that InfoPath is a bit more integrated into MOSS than trying to use .Net webforms from a data retrieval/modification standpoint. That being said, virtually everything we have been doing in SharePoint lately that isn't easily done in a webpart has been done through .Net webforms. From a flexibility standpoint I think you have more options with the .Net framework then what you get in InfoPath, especially if we have to use multiple form that interact with one another almost like an embedded SharePoint webapp.
