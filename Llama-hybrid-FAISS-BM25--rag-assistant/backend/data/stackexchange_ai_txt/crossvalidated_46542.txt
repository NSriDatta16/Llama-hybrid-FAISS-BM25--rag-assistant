Assuming diagnoses of cancer are uniformly spread across the year, the persons who are diagnosed are exposed to the risk of being diagnosed for (on average) half a year before that diagnosis. Your link mentions the assumption of occurrence at the half-way point in the observation period but not where it comes from - which is just the assumption of uniformity. This assumption isn't always reasonable, and there are times when it can make a substantive difference. I'd recommend being aware of the assumption every time you use the formula, because you should consider its suitability and if it isn't suitable, whether it is likely to have a substantive impact on the estimate (in which case, a better assumption about the occurrence should be investigated)
