I see the problem - for example, if you have a 45' angle and a 315' angle, the "natural" average would be 180', but the value you want is actually 0'. I think Starblue is onto something. Just calculate the (x, y) cartesian coordinates for each angle, and add those resulting vectors together. The angular offset of the final vector should be your required result. x = y = 0 foreach angle { x += cos(angle) y += sin(angle) } average_angle = atan2(y, x) I'm ignoring for now that a compass heading starts at north, and goes clockwise, whereas "normal" cartesian coordinates start with zero along the X axis, and then go anti-clockwise. The maths should work out the same way regardless.
