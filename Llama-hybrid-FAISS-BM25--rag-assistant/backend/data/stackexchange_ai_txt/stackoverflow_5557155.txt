With ojdbc6 getMetaData() on resultset spikes in number of sql's executed, dont see this with ojdbc5

we use getMetaData() on every cursor returned from the oracle stored procedure call. With ojdbc5 we dont have spike in number of metadata sql's executed and average time. But with ojdbc6 we see spike in number of metadata sql's executed and increase in avg sql execution time. Does anyone know or aware of this issue with ojdbc6.. wish they had made it open source? did anyone atleast try decompiling the ojdbc6 jar anytime?
