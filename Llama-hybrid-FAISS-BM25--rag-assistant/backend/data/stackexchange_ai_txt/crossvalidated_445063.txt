Which of these cases are instances of a "spurious relationship"? How could the remaining cases be termed? I think 1. and 2. are both spurious, but they result from taking a finite sample. If we took independent samples from some distribution, say a normal distribution, we would very likely find that the correlation between the two is not exactly zero. Obviously this problem would be worse when the sample sizes are very small. The case of 3. deserves the most attention. I can think of a few situations where this can arise: Spurious correlation due to confounding. The example you gave is a good example, this happens when two variables have a common (often unmeasured) cause. Spurious correlation due to mathematical coupling. This occurs where two variables are linked, for example when two variables are divided by a 3rd variable. This often happens where rates of disease, exposure, sales etc., are created by dividing by the population size. This can induce a large correlation in otherwise unrelated and independent variables. Spurious correlation due to regression to the mean (RTM). Galton is credited with discovering this whereby the offspring of tall parents also tend to be tall, but less tall than the parents, while the offspring of small parents also tend to be small, but less small than the parents, however it can occur in many settings. RTM occurs with any variable that fluctuates within an individual or a population either due to measurement error and/or physiological variation. One example is in longitudinal studies where a variable is measured at several points in time and the interest in is a distal outcome measured once, or cross-sectionally. Methods used to analyse such data often condition on the outcome which induces RTM. The reversal paradox. This is a general term for things like Simpson's Paradox, Lord's Paradox and suppression, in situations where subgroups are being analysed or when mediators are included in a regression. I can't really think of anything that fits this description of 4. Bonus question (just in case you have an opinion on the matter): Which ones may deserve the most attention in a quantitative methods class taught to management students? Unsurprisingly I would definitely suggest that those falling under 3. deserve the most attention.
