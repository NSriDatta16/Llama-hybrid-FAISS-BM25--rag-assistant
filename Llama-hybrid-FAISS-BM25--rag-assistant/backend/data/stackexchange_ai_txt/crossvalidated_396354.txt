The variance of a standardized variable is $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_j\frac{(x_{jk} - \bar x_k)^2} {S_{kk}}=\frac{S_{kk}}{S_{kk}}=1, \quad k=1,2,...,p,$$ and so is, therefore, its standard deviation. Hence, $D$ , which is a diagonal matrix with the variances (not the standard deviations, that is given by $D^{1/2}$ ) on the main diagonal, satisfies $D=I$ , and therefore, $D^{1/2}=D^{-1/2}=I$ , the identity matrix. Notice we do not need to subtract the sample average, as a demeaned variable has mean zero by construction: $\sum_{j=1}^n(x_j-\bar x)=\sum_{j=1}^nx_j-n\bar x=0$ .
