Essentially, you have to rename the password field (for example, to "pw") to prevent the Auth component from hashing it automatically. Then, if the password passes the validation rules, hash it and save the hash under the password key. This is usually done in the beforeFilter() callback as this article describes. It is also possible to validate the data and hash the password in the controller. This practice is generally discouraged, but it might be a little easier to wrap your head around if you're just starting out with CakePHP. // this code would go after: if (!empty($this->data) // and before: $this->User->save($this->data) // validate the data $this->User->set($this->data); if ($this->User->validates()) { // hash the password $password_hash = $this->Auth->password($this->data['User']['pw']; $this->data['User']['password'] = $password_hash; }
