We know that any optimal solution (there may be two) will fill the rectangle either horizontally or vertically. If you found an optimal solution that did not fill the rectangle in one dimension, you could always increase the scale of the tiles to fill one dimension. Now, any solution that maximizes the surface covered will have an aspect ratio close to the aspect ratio of the rectangle. The aspect ratio of the solution is vertical tile count/horizontal tile count (and the aspect ratio of the rectangle is Y/X ). You can simplify the problem by forcing Y>=X ; in other words, if X>Y , transpose the rectangle. This allows you to only think about aspect ratios >= 1, as long as you remember to transpose the solution back. Once you've calculated the aspect ratio, you want to find solutions to the problem of V/H ~= Y/X , where V is the vertical tile count and H is the horizontal tile count. You will find up to three solutions: the closest V/H to Y/X and V+1 , V-1 . At that point, just calculate the coverage based on the scale using V and H and take the maximum (there could be more than one).
