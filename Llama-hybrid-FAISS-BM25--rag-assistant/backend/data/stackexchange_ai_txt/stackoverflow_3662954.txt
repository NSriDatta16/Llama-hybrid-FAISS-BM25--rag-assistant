Place HTML lists side by side

I want to place a variable number of HTML lists side by side inside a fixed-sized element like the following: +--------------------------------+ | LIST 1 LIST 2 LIST 3 | | - xxx - xxx - xxx | | - xxx - xxx | | - xxx | I need this line break â€“ | | I floated the lists ( float: left; ) to get them positioned side by side but I don't know how to avoid that LIST 4 moves up as far as possible (until it is directly beneath LIST 1). How do I get the vertical space between LIST 1 and LIST 4? Is there any way to use the clear property elegantly to solve this problem?
