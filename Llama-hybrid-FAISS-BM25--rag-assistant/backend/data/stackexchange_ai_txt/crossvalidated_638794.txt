Calculating VaR from copula-GARCH using rmgarch

I'm new to both R and copula, nevertheless I want to compare VaR estimations for 25 days ahead using a GARCH and a copula-GARCH model in R. To calculate VaR for the GARCH model seems pretty straight forward, however, for the copula-GARCH I am a bit uncertain and would like someone to disapprove or confirm my hypothetical method. The plan is to calculate VaR by simulating $N$ samples for 1-day ahead estimations using cgarchsim in the rmgarch package for the copula-GARCH. I'm using a CCC model so the correlation matrix (for two time series) is constant. Given $\text{VaR}_t \approx \sigma_{t}F^{-1}(\alpha)$ I want to estimate the inverse, $F^{-1}(.)$ , at time $t$ by using the quantile function on my $N$ simulated samples. By using the estimated returns to be the starting values for the next 1-day ahead simulation, I want to repeat the process 25 times. The VaR is calculated for the returns, so even though the correlation matrix is constant, the variance for each simulated residuals could work as the variance at time $t$ , ( $\sigma^2_t$ ), or possibly use the correlated portfolio variance, $w\Sigma w^T$ where $w$ is the weight for asset $i$ and $\Sigma$ is the correlation matrix. What I am hoping to get help with is Can VaR be calculated for the copula-GARCH this way? Should the variance be constant using $w\Sigma w^T$ or estimated with each simulation? Any help is appreciated!
