How can I make visual c++ 2010 recognize the declaration "_extension"

While compiling a Visual Studio 2010 program, I included the python2.5 directory. In the file _types.h, there is the code: #ifndef __off64_t_defined __extension__ typedef long long _off64_t; #endif with the error on extension: this declaration has no storage class or type specifier. What is wrong?
