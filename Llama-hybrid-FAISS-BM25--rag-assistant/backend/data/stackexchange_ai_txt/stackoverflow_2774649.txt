I would look at the command line and see, if there are any "-agent" parameters. All profilers, debuggers and other code modificators use this for introspection. You could also check for unusual jars on the bootclasspath, since those might also provide a threat (but be aware that you then also must deliver a custom JVM, since some software like Quicktime adds itself to the bootclasspath of ALL java apps running... (I couldn't belive my eyes when I saw that...))
