It might be overkill, but that is not obvious. I could see the interactions mattering. For instance, adding a year to the age might have more of an impact on the price if the mileage is high, and that impact might not even be constant. You might wind up needing to interact the mileage with a nonlinear function of the age. Polynomials can fit these patterns, too, and it has been argued that deep learning is just polynomial regression (Cheng et al, 2018) . However, neural networks, for better or for worse, make this easy by just throwing a bunch of neurons at the problem and having the network figure out the rest, instead of having to be explicit about which polynomial features are included in a (generalized) linear model.
