Getting list of fields back from 'use fields' pragma?

So I'm familiar with the fields pragma in Perl that can be used to restrict the fields that are stored in a class: package Fruit; use fields qw( color shape taste ); sub new { my ( $class, $params ) = @_; my $self = fields::new( $class ) unless ref $class; foreach my $name ( keys %$params ) { $self->{ $name } = $params->{ $name }; } return $self; } Once I've declared the fields at the top, how I can get the list back, say because I want to generate accessors dynamically? Is keys %FIELDS the only way? Secondarily, is there a more efficient way to pre-populate the fields in the constructor than looping through and assigning each parameter as I am doing above?
