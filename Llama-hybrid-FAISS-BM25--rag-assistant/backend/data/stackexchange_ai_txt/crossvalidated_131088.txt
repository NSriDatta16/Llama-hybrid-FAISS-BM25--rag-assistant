Find Neural Network Inputs Given Outputs

I've trained a neural network with two inputs, a single hidden layer with two neurons, and one output using a bipolar sigmoid activation function. If a single input is known, how would I determine the second input to create a desired output? For example, let's say the neural network is trained to add two inputs to produce an output. So if input_1 = 3 and input_2 = 4, the output will be 7, (3 + 4 = 7). Given input_1 = 3 and the desired output is 7, I want to calculate the second input required to produce the desired output (the answer should be 4). How would I do this for a network that is more complicated than basic addition and has multiple inputs/outputs? For example, for a network with four inputs and two outputs, how would I calculate input_3 and input_4 given input_1, input_2, output_1 and output_2?
