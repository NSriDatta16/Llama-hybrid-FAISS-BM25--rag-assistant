Found the answer: http://community.sharpdevelop.net/forums/p/5934/17056.aspx#17056 Hi, If you are creating a new Zip archive is might be easier to use the ZipOutputStream class instead. If you are updating you can get the ZipFile class to write directly to the existing archive on disk if you choose. IArchiveStorage (The library supplies a DiskArchiveStorage) is the key interface passed when BeginUpdate is called. It has a UpdateMode property which can be set to Safe or Direct. The implications are obvious hopefully. Failure during an update may corrupt the archive losing the data. hth, -jr-
