Fitting a probability distribution to non i.i.d. data?

I have temperature time series data that I have determined is not independently and identically distributed (from looking at the autocorrelation plots and Ljung-Box tests). However, I am still able to fit PDFs, typically GEV, gamma, and Weibull distributions to my different data sets, with a $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test accepting the null hypothesis. So my question is: since these underlying PDFs assume the data is supposed to be i.i.d., and my data is not i.i.d., how should I proceed? How worried should I be about my estimates being biased?
