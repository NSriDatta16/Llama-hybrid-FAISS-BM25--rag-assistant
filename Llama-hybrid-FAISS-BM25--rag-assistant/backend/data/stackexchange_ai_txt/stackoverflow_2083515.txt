Non-relational databases (currently all the rage with the NoSQL movement) approximate such a situation. Many such databases are anything but toys, and are intensely used as the basis of hugely scalable production systems -- the lack of free indexing and other limitations empower almost unbelievable scalability, especially for "mostly-read" scenarios. The downside is basically in having to give up normalization, and duplicating information all over the place in ways that are strictly dependent on what queries need what degree of optimization. I'm not sure what your "single index" scenario is based on, but unless it offers the same kinds of advantages as the best "nosql" storage systems (and you're willing to fully pay the price for that), it seems unlikely to be a technically viable concept;-).
