The idea is that which style to use depends on two things: how specific it the selector is, the position of rule (latest rule wins). Example: p { background-color: red; } p { background-color: blue; } Paragraphs will be blue. Another example: body p { background-color: red; } p { background-color: blue; } Paragraphs will be red since "body p" is more specific. Edit: Also try to avoid using !important. It is supported but a side effect is that you can never override it (ever). Thus only use it in the really extreme cases where you have no way of knowing how to construct specific enough rules (e.g.: generic print.css).
