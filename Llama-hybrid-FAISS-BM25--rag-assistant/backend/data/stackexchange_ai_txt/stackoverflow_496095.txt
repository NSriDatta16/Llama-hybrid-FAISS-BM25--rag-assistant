Normally TOP 1 is a good idea. Consider a large table with millions of rows with no index on the column you are matching, however you are only looking for a single row. SELECT TOP 1 will mean the table scan stops as soon as the one item is found. Without the TOP 1, the table scan will continue right through to the end. As with anything that involves scanning (or brute force) to do the search. Using TOP 1, it should on average be 50% quicker than not using TOP 1. However, Depending on what you need to return back, A real performance gain can normally be made by using EXISTS. Instead of writing SELECT * FROM table t WHERE t.id = (SELECT TOP 1 foreignid from table2) You can use SELECT * FROM table t WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 from table2 WHERE foreignid = t.id)
