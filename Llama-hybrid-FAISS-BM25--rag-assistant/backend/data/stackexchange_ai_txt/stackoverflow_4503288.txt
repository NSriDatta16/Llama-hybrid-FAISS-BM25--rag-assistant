Cannot install Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin in Google Chrome

I am using Windows XP SP2 and Chrome (version 9.0.597.19) but every time I run gwt in developer mode I see: "Development Mode requires the Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin..." No matter how many times I install it. How can it be that gwt developer mode is not running in google's own chrome in xp sp2?? This is outrageous??!! It is working in FF but is very slow.
