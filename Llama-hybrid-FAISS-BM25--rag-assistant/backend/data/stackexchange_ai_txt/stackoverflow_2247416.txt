ObjC/Core Data. How can I change the key value of an entity from another NSArrayController?

I am completely noob in objective-c and I am trying the whole day to find a solution to this problem: I have two entities (Storage and Expenses). In Storage I have an attribute "number". In Expenses I have an attribute "number" and another called "cost" Both entities are linked to tables via cocoa-bindings I have created subclasses for both NSArrayControllers so I can create the following action: 1. multiply the Expenses.selection.number with the Storage.selection.cost I did this with this code in the Expenses ArrayController: - (IBAction)submit:(id)sender { NSNumber *price = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[[self.selection valueForKey:@"storage.buy"] floatValue]]; NSNumber *insert = [NSNumber numberWithInt:[[self.selection valueForKey:@"number"] intValue]]; NSNumber *cost; cost = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[insert intValue] * [price floatValue]]; [self.selection setValue:cost forKey:@"cost"]; 2. get the Storage.selection.number and add the Expenses.selection.number here I have a problem. In the expenses ArrayController I try to: NSNumber *stock = [NSNumber numberWithInt:[[self.selection valueForKey:@"storage.number"] intValue]]; sum = [NSNumber numberWithInt:[stock intValue] + [insert intValue]]; [self.selection setValue:sum forKey: @"storage.number"]; but I get: [ setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: the entity Expenses is not key value coding-compliant for the key "Storage.number". I also tried to create a method in the Storage ArrayController: -(void)setNumber:(NSNumber*)number{ [self.selection setValue:number forKey: @"number"]; } but when I call it like: [Storage seNumber: sum]; it returns: +[Storage setNumber:]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x100003430 I also tried: Storage *st = [[Storage alloc] init]; [st setNumber: sum]; [st release]; and although it doesn't return any error message, it doesn't work. any ideas how to solve this problem? thanks a lot.
