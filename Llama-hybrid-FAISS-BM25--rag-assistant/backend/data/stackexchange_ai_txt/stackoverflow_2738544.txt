Changing save directory

Disregard my previous pre-edit post. Rethought what I needed to do. This is what I'm currently doing: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIScriptableIO downloadFile: function(httpLoc) { try { //new obj_URI object var obj_URI = Cc["@mozilla.org/network/io-service;1"].getService(Ci.nsIIOService). newURI(httpLoc, null, null); //new file object //set file with path obj_TargetFile.initWithPath("C:\\javascript\\cache\\test.pdf"); //if file doesn't exist, create if(!obj_TargetFile.exists()) { obj_TargetFile.create(0x00,0644); } //new persitence object var obj_Persist = Cc["@mozilla.org/embedding/browser/nsWebBrowserPersist;1"]. createInstance(Ci.nsIWebBrowserPersist); // with persist flags if desired const nsIWBP = Ci.nsIWebBrowserPersist; const flags = nsIWBP.PERSIST_FLAGS_REPLACE_EXISTING_FILES; obj_Persist.persistFlags = flags | nsIWBP.PERSIST_FLAGS_FROM_CACHE; //save file to target obj_Persist.saveURI(obj_URI,null,null,null,null,obj_TargetFile); return true; } catch (e) { alert(e); } },//end downloadFile As you can see the directory is hardcoded in there, I want to save the pdf file open in the active tab to a relative temporary directory, or anywhere that's out of the way enough that the user won't stumble along and delete it. I'm going to try that using File I/O, I was under the impression that what I was looking for was in scriptable file I/O and thus disabled.
