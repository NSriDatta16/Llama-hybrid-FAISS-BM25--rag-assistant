G'day, I know you're question is to decide on making a selection of the optimum screen size to work on all phones but that approach soon wears thin with users. A large web site I'm associated with takes the UserAgent string and normalises it to a common denominator, e.g. over 300 different UA strings in use in the UK for a particular Sony Ericsson phone type so they all get converted to the same string, and then does a lookup into a table to determine screen real estate. The coders also have access to the current connection speed which is deduced by a geolocation application based on connection type, routing type, etc. at the time of the request. You don't want to be sending rich, high-def media to someone with a slow connection. This is then used to decide if rich content can be served, and then select the optimum format for the content. HTH cheers,
