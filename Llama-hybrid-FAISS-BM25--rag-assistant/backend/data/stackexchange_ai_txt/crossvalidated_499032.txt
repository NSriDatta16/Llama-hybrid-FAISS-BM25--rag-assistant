Time Series Analysis vs Linear Regression for Stock Price Prediction

I see many online blogs that use Linear Regression to predict future stock price. I too have done this and my x variable is time elapsed. But I have been advised this problem is better suited for Time Series problem instead of Linear Regression. I want to understand why and what is the difference between say ARIMA and Linear Regression in the context of predicting future stock prices based on historical data. e.g. date and closing price.
