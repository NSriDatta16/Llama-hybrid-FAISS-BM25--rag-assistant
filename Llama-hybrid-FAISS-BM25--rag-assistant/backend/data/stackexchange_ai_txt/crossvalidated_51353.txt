Generating rules to obtain a given categorical distribution... is it possible?

I'm working on a problem, I was wondering if there are any methods available to do the following. I have a data set with information on people (continuous and categorical data). I have 3 categories to assign to these people {A, B, C}, and I want to try and develop some rules of how to assign each person a category. However the tricky part is, the 'target' I'm looking for is a distribution. So for example I would like to be able to pass in {.2, .05, .75} as the distribution of {A, B, C} and then have an algorithm try out different rules and splits of the data (similar to a decision tree) until it achieves the given distribution. Are there any machine learning type methods suited to this problem? Is there a name for this type of problem? I wasn't finding anything with my googling... Thanks edit: Just for a little more information, the way I'm currently going to approach it is random assignment, give everyone a random number, if it's below .2 then give Category A and so on. Not ideal, but the fact that it's random is a major issue for the problem. Although I would much prefer to have a set of rules that I could use instead.
