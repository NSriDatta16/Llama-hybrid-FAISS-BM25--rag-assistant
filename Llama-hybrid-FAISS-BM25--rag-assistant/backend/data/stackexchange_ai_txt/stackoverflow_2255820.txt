I think I figured this out (haven't tested it yet)... Turns out the entire crash log isn't written in polish. There's a part that says that the "application failed to launch in time" I suspect that my database is too large to be copied during launch of the application. to quote apple: ***iPhone OS uses a watchdog timer when applications are launched. If an application takes too long to complete its initial startup, the operating system terminates the application. Applications terminated for this reason will have the exception code 0x8badf00d and related information noted in the associated crash report:* *When Xcode launches an application, the watchdog timer is disabled to compensate for additional overhead that may be incurred when Xcode attaches the debugger. As a result, your application's long startup may initially escape your attention if you are exclusively testing by running from Xcode.***
