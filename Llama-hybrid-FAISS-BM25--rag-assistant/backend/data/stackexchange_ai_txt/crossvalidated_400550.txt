This is table 4 from the linked paper: Table 4. Univariate mixed-effects logistic regression model for the associations between independent variables and surgical site infections (patients: level 1* and hospitals: level 2**). Variables Surgical site infection after total hip arthroplasty Odds ratio 95% confidence interval p-value Elective procedure* (reference: non-elective) 0.40 0.24, 0.67 p Note how the odds ratios (even the significant ones) are mostly close to 1. These table is the uni-variate (that is, with only one predictor) (logistic) regressions, all with the same response surgical site infections . Then the multi-predictor (logistic) regression: Table 5. Mixed-effects logistic regression model for the associations between independent variables and surgical site infections including the interaction between staffing adequacy and procedure type (n = 2724) (patients: level 1* and hospital: level 2**). Variables Surgical site infection after total hip arthroplasty Odds ratio 95% confidence interval p-value Staffing adequacy 1.00 0.96, 1.02 0.670 Age group 1.03 1.01, 1.06 0.008 Non-elective procedure 1 – – Elective procedure 5.4 1.34, 21.7 0.017 Interaction: elective procedure × staffing adequacy 0.94 0.91, 0.97 0.001 No other model validation is reported. I'm not sure this looks very convincing, looks like a pilot study.
