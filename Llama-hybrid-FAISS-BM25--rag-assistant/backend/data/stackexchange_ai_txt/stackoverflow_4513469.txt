One of the problems with using the IsolatedStorageFileStream constructor is that the exception generated has limited info. The alternative OpenFile method has a richer set of exceptions. As a general rule of thumb if an API allows you to do the same thing with a constructor or with a method go with the method. In this case try this code instead:- IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); IsolatedStorageFileStream nameXmlFile = isf.OpenFile("Names.xml", System.IO.FileMode.Open); If this fails you will have at least narrowed down the potential cause. This may seem obvious but in your creation code you have actually written to and closed the file you created?
