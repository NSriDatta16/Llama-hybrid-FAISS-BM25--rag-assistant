What you've illustrated is a time series column (or bar) graph. The two graphs are of differing time resolution or differing time aggregation. There may be industry specific terms for these types of charts. In finance, for example, the open-high-low-close chart is a very common time series plot: When the x axis is time, as in your example, it's often common to illustrate the points as a line graph, instead of bars/columns. The reason for this is to put the visual emphasis on the change from one period to the next. You might also consider graphing period-over-period. For example a year-over-year would show how the numbers for a given month (typically, although could be month or day) compare to the numbers of the prior year for the same month. But I realize your question was about naming, not all the other cool graphs you can do ;)
