Reality check: Issue 2 is a non-issue. In a cluster ALL data must be on shared discs, otherwise the cluster failover can not access the data. If that defeats the purpose fof a cluster you are invited to install a SQL Server cluster without shared discs. ALL data storage on clusters must be on shared discs. Has been like this since cluster service was first created for windows. Which basically makes your conclusions already quite - hm - wrong. You also need to make some mathmatics. 5th grade style. Can I serve up say 100 users with 100 1 MB files within a 5 second window? Ignore SQL Server for a moment. Depending on how I read this thi is either 100mb or 10.000mb. Anyhow, 100mb in 5 seconds = 20mb per second, which runs around 200mbit. This is serious traffic. We taalkg of minimum 250 to 300mbit needed external bandwidth.
