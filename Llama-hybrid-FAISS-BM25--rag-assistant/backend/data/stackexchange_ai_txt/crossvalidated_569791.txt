How to model seasonal variance in a high frequency time series?

I have a time series that exhibits a clear seasonal pattern regarding its variance. Basically at night and morning the variance is low and at midday it is high. The time granularity of the data is 5 minutes. so the length of a season is 288 time periods. As a preprocessing step I want to normalize the data such that the assumptions of ARIMA are roughly satisfied. The method should be fast since I need to process 51840 values every 5 minutes. Alternatively a method that can learn incrementally but takes a long time for initialization would be fine too. Any Idea which models would be appropriate here?
