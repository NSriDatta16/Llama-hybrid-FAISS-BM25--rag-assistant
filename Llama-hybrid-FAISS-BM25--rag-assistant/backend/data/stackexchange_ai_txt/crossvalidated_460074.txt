TF-IDF or just TF

I'm very new to Machine Learning and I'm working on classifying some reviews into Good or Bad reviews. I have a training set of about 20,000 reviews. I'm planning on using the "Bag of Words" approach. Now, I don't know whether I should use Word Count, Word Frequency or TFIDF? My understanding is that most of the bad reviews will contain words like "terrible", "broke", "useless" and so shouldn't just TF be enough? What benefit will IDF bring to me?
