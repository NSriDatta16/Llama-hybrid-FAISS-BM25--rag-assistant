Use clusters.stats function from a hierarchical clustering in R

I would like a great help from you. I used the cluster.stats function that is part of the fpc package to compare the similarity of two custer solutions using a variety of validation criteria, as you can see in the code. However, I have one question: Is it possible to know which is the most viable cluster, 2 clusters or 5 clusters? If so, could you explain me better how I can know. Thank you so much!
