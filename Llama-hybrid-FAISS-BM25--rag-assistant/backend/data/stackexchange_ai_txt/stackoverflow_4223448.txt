Flex 3: determine if an event target is a descendant of a component

I have a custom component with a couple of text input fields (among other things) that is used as the row components in a tree. I have had to write my own drag and drop handling, and have almost finished the start handler (which I did last), using mouseDown as the event to kick if off. It basically works, but when the tree is expanded enough so that a scroll bar shows, using the scroll bar drags a row of the tree at the same time ! Not the desired behaviour. Looking in the debugger, I can see that when a row of the tree is dragged the currentTarget is the tree itself, and the target is the textInput component. Looking at the parents of that component I can see my custom component (that contains the textInput) a couple of levels up. My question is, is there an easy way to determine if this target is descended from my component, so that I can initiate a drag only if that is the case ? event.target is doesn't work by the way....which I kind of expected, because it isn't ! Thanks, Mike
