Is there a link function $g$ which is a monotonic function with $g(0) = 0$?

I am working on a machine learning project (similar to this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04136 ). For this I need to make an assumption that a link function is monotonic and takes value $0$ at $0$ . Thus my question is : Is there a link function $g$ which is a monotonic function with $g(0) = 0$ ?
