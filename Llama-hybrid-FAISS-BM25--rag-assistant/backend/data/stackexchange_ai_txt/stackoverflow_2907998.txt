A good book for this is Object-Oriented Software Construction by Bertrand Meyer ( widely considered a foundational text of object-oriented programming ). From the Wikipedia page: The book, known among its fans as "OOSC", presents object technology as an answer to major issues of software engineering, with a special emphasis on addressing the software quality factors of correctness, robustness, extendibility and reusability . It starts with an examination of the issues of software quality, then introduces abstract data types as the theoretical basis for object technology and proceeds with the main object-oriented techniques: classes, objects, genericity, inheritance, Design by Contract, concurrency, and persistence. It includes extensive discussions of methodological issues.
