I think in this case (as with so many) - it depends. It's a case of knowing what's appropriate in in the context of the problem you're addressing. In a purist sense, you're probably right in thinking that the Observer model is potentially easier to extend and manipulate in the future. However that purist view rarely takes into account the pragmatic realities if actually having to work in a reasonable timescale. It may well be that the observer model serves you fine. But is the logic time critial, and is it likely to be expensive? If these are things that matter in your implementation, then you have to tale account of them. Unfortunately, only you can tell - and while it may work well in one situation, a conceptually similar situation may have different constraints, and perform poorly (or be totally impractical) with that same design. So, in answer to your question: no - I honestly don't think that anyone can say that there are clear rules. People may have preferences, and they be more, or mostly, applicable. But I doubt they're ever going to be universal. You're going to have to think about it - but that's what makes it fun!
