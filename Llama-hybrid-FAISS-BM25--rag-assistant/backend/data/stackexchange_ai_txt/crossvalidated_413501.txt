.49 is not great, but its interpretation is different than the ROC AUC. For ROC AUC, if you obtained a .49 using a logistic regression model, I would say you are doing no better than random. For .49 PR AUC, however it might not be that bad. I would consider looking at individual precision and recall, perhaps one or the other is what is driving down your PR AUC. Recall will tell you how much of that 9% positive class you are actually guessing correct. Precision will tell you how many you guessed positive that were not. (False Positives). 50% recall would be bad meaning you're not guessing many of your imbalanced class, but perhaps 50% precision wouldn't bad. Depends on your situation.
