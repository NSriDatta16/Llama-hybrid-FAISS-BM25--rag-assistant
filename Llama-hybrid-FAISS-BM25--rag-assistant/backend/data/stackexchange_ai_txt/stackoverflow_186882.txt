Unless you are implementing a given PNRG algorithm there is no way to tell that the numbers are random, thats the nature of randomness. yeah on average as you number generator goes towards infinity it will even out, but you aren't going to test an infinite number of iterations. If you are implementing a known algorithm, check the first few thousand numbers match the results they provide given a set of seeds. there is no way to be sure though as the number of possible seeds is infinite. You can't even proove mathmatically that a sequence of numbers is random... XKCD DILBERT Gets modded down...
