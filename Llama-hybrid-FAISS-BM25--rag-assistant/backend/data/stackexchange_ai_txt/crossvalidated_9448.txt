I think the joint distribution of temperature data on successive days could be reasonably modelled using a multi-variate Gaussian (Gaussian distributions are often used in statistical downscaling of temperature). What I would try would be to regress the mean and covariance matrix of the temperature time series on sine and cosine components of the day of year (to deal with the seasonality). The details on how to do that are given in a paper by Peter Williams , Williams uses a neural network, but I would start off with just a linear model. This will give you what climatologists would call a "weather generator" (of sorts). Using this you could generate as many synthetic time series as you want with the appropriate statistical properties, from which you could estimate the probabilities you require directly. You would need to estimate the window over which temperatures were usefully correllated - which may be quite high in winter due to blocking patterns (for the U.K. anyway). A bit baroque I suppose, but it would be the thing I would try!
