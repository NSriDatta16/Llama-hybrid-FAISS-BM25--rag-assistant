If you keep adding items to the list, you'll run out of memory long before you hit that limit. By "long" I really mean "a lot sooner than you think". See this discussion on the large object heap (LOB). Once you hit around 21500 elements (half that on a 64-bit system) (assuming you're storing object references), your list will start to be a large object. Since the LOB isn't compacted in the same way the normal .NET heaps are, you'll eventually fragment it badly enough that a large enough continous memory area cannot be allocated. So you don't have to check for that limit at all, it's not a real limit.
