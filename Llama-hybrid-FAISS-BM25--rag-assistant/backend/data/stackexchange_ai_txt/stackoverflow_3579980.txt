phpunit clover from some particular directories, not full clover. Is it possible?

Why do I need this? I'm running the tests on symfony project (and using Zend fw) and phpunit generates clover for all affected files. But I don't want see coverage for symfony and Zend libs (and all another third party ones). I wish see coverage for my code only. Or may be this should do clover viewer? I'm using the clover plugin for hudson, but it does not support viewing for particular sources. The clover plugin shows, that my code covered only 20%, that is incorrect because it considered symfony and Zend libs too. Btw, may be there are another ways to get this?
