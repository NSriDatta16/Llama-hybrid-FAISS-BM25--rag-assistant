From "The Pragmatic Programmer" : "Put abstractions in code, details in metadata." This is what I propose. You should program using metadata (the more you do it, the most general and portable is your code). So one/multiple table for users A table for industries A table for fields -> industries A table for posting You would get something like this |-------| ?? |----------| 1--->* |-----------------| 1--->* |------------------| | users | | industry | | industry_fields | | industry_posting | |-------| |----------| |-----------------| |------------------| | name | | name | | field_name | | field_id | | pass | | id? | | industry_id | | description | | ... | |----------| | id | |------------------| |-------| |-----------------| this is a quick draft , hoping you understand the basics of it. You can, like that maintain common tables for industries. you could also map one field to multiple industries with a many-to-many! This is only an excerpt
