Instead of computing acf on your simulated time series, you could first create a time series of number of each kind of state change per unit of time (so you will a time serie for each state). And then compute the acf on each of the time series, and compare it with the real ones. It's not a direct method, but you still you'll know if the rate of each kind of state changes through time is respected.
