Can a paired t-test be used with the number of words recalled?

I recently went to a 3rd grade level science/math school exhibition, where someone had posted this data on how well people remember words, when they read it in a book vs a tablet. There were in total 10 similar (if not same) words which the participants were asked to recall from two paragraphs (same participants on book vs tablet, but different paragraphs). (For the sake of discussion assume that the data is collected scientifically) tablet: 8 8 8 6 10 6 4 10 10 6 4 6 10 9 10 9 9 10 9 7 book: 10 10 10 9 9 10 9 10 10 6 4 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 3 9 I have applied paired T test [( mean of diff - 0) / std dev of diff/sqrt(n=20) ] to figure out if the difference is statistically significant at 95% confidence level. I used two tailed T test and came up with the fact that this difference is not significant since test statistic is 1.686 which is well with in the range of T values for .975 with 19 degrees of freedom (+- 2.093024) So my questions are: Is my assumption correct to use paired T-test? If not then what is the right test? and if and only if possible is my calculation correct? I also have another query: Where can I get a book where I can get tons of question on stat, but where I don't know the context of the question in which it is being asked. Like right now when I'm solving problems from a book I know that I'm reading chapter on paired t-test so I've to apply this solution.
