What I believe is going on here is the following. I assume it's dist1 that can only take three values, not dist2, as opposed to what is shown in the last paragraph (dist1 and dist2 seem to have changed names there). I abbreviate "gower_dist_test" as "dist". Average Silhouette Width (ASW) of 1 can only be achieved if all observations within a cluster have distance zero between them. This is possible with dist1, as there are many zeroes. Chances are the clusters in the clustering of dist1 are very strong in the sense that they have almost all within-cluster distances zero, and most if not all between-cluster distances as 0.5 or 1. This produces very high ASW values. dist2 looks like dist1 with some "noise" added. Chances are the added variable has relatively little influence on the overall distance other than making the separation between zero, 0.5, 1 distances more "noisy" and less clear. This causes the lower ASW values. Now it is probably something of a coincidence that the resulting clustering is exactly the same, however if the variables defining dist1 define a very strong and clear clustering structure and what is added to arrive at dist2 is just unstructured noise, depending on the "size" of the noise one should expect to see a very similar clustering structure for dist2, and it is not super-unlikely that it's exactly the same.
