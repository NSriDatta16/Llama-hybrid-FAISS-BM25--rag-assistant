So very "hacky", but this is the closest I can get it to do what I want... Basically when method swizzling, simply letting the image stretch wasn't working well for me because I also had rounded corners. So instead I made the corners a separate transparent img and add it as a subview so they wouldn't get affected by the stretch animation. So my category now looks like this.. #import "UINavigationBar+custom.h" #define cornersTag 1 @implementation UINavigationBar (UINavigationBarCategory) -(void)setCornersIfNeeded{ UIImageView *corners = (UIImageView*)[self viewWithTag:cornersTag]; if(!corners){ UIImage *img = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"navbar_corners.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:10 topCapHeight:0]; corners = [[[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:img] autorelease]; corners.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, img.size.height); corners.tag = cornersTag; [self addSubview:corners]; } } - (void)customDrawRect:( CGRect )rect{ [self customDrawRect:rect]; [[UIImage imageNamed:@"navbar.png"] drawInRect:rect]; [self setCornersIfNeeded]; } @end for more on method swizzling... http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MethodSwizzling and Method Swizzle on iPhone device
