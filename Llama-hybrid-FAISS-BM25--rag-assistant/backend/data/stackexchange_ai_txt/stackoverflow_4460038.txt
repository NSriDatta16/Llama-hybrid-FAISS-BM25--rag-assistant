Code coverage without instrumentation

We have an automated regression test setup for Functional tests and are interested in measuring the test coverage/code coverage for our project which is based on Linux. I would like to know if there are any tools which can be used for test coverage/code coverage measurement without instrumenting the code. Please suggest any tool or method that can do this. I am aware that instrumentation provides the best method to measure the code coverage, but it would suffice for us if the tool can just measure the functions that were executed for the test coverage measurement. Thanks and Regards, Prashnk
