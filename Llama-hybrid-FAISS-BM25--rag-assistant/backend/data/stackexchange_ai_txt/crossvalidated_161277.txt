Just "take the average" they say. It's not that straightforward, right?

I have an acquaintance who does not study statistics and doesn't understand that summing data and dividing by the number of data is a summary statistic, i.e. that information is lost. For example, say that there are data which are measurements of some sort: $x_1, ..., x_{100}$. The most common measure of centrality is $$\hat{\mu}_1 = \bar{x} = \frac{1}{100}(x_1 + ... + x_{100})$$ However, if the data are skewed then $$\hat{\mu}_2 = \tilde{x} = \frac{1}{2}(x_{(50)} + x_{(51)})$$ is a better estimator. Then, of course there is the midrange $$\hat{\mu}_3 = \frac{1}{2}(x_{(1)} + x_{(100)})$$ that is an option. My question is: defining some loss function— for simplicity's sake L2-loss— how to judge which $\hat{\mu}$ is best? Obviously the answer is specific to the data, but what is the MSE of the midrange, for example?
