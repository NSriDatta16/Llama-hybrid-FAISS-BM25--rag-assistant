Doing moreController.topViewController.view is kinda dangerous. I'd recommend instead putting in a tab of your own creation that does the more list, with the normal icon, then opening the other tabs under the more list via normal nav controller methods. You'll need to remove any overflow tab items from the tab bar of course. There might be a more elegant way to do this, however.
