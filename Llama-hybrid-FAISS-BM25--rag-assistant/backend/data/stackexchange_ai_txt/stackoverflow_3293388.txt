I think what you need is some attributes on the variables. By default all variables are shared, and as you want max_private to be per-thread, you can happily add 'private' clause to its declaration (it might go a bit faster then). For max, you need to put it inside the omp block, and mark it with 'shared' if it still doesn't work properly (though it should be ok as you have it) So, I think you want #pragma omp parallel private(max_private) and put both variables outside the main omp block.
