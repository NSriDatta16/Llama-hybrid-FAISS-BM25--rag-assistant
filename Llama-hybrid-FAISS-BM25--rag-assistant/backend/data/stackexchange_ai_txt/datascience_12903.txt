I tell you what has worked for me: practical examples. They have probably already read about what data science is in general and which are the standard procedures. What they have not seen is someone in front of them explaining how innovative (and useful for business!!!) the data science really is. Follow the "Say what you would say to your granny to tell her how cool your work is" advice. People want to know what you have actually done, indipendently from the algorithms or procedures you have used. Good luck!
