I Figured out my own issue. There is a DLL NTidy.dll in the bin folder. This dll required the following dlls to be in the system32 folder: msvcp71d.dll ( Microsoft C++ Runtime Library ) msvcp71.dll ( Microsoft C++ Runtime Library ) msvcr71d.dll ( Microsoft C Runtime Library ) msvcr71.dll ( Microsoft C Runtime Library ) Once I added those dlls the application began to work. Thanks
