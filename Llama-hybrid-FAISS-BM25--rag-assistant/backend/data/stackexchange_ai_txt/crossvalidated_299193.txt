How to learn timeseries with LSTM, having different orders of magnitude in the output?

I am relatively new to neural networks and LSTM networks in particular, but I already worked with other ML algorithms. I am currently trying to reproduce a physical model (based on ordinary differential equations) with a Long-Short Term Memory network. In practice, I ran the original model several times, for different values of its parameters, obtaining different datasets that I am now using for test and validation. In general, my problem can be expressed as: y = f(t, k, s) where t is the input (time), k is a parameter that does not change during the same time series, and s is the state of the system. My issues are related to the behavior of the system for different values of k : not only the values of y vary by orders of magnitudes, but the peaks of the function also appear much sooner or later, also depending on k . To give you an example, here are two time series for values of k=3 : and k=6 : You might notice that not only the peak values of y differ by an order of magnitude, but the peaks appear at very different instants of t (close to t=0.02 for k=3 , close to t=0.1 for k=6 ). Summing up, I have two questions: a) if I normalize y , training the LSTM network provides good results for higher values of k , and lousy results for low values of k , probably because the optimization greatly reduces the error by overfitting the time series for high values of k . Is there a way to assign the same importance to each time series, regardless of the peak values of y ? b) Sampling the time series is also an issue: if I sample all time series using the same value of delta_t (to define the time interval between samples), I end up with very few points for time series with low k , or (vice-versa) with a lot of points for each time series, and huge datasets that slow down training considerably. Do you have any advice? Is choosing a different delta_t for each time series a viable option?
