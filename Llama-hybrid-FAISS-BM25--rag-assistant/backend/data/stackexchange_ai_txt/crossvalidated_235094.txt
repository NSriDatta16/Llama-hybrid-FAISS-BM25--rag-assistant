Basically, you are referring to conditional independence. Imagine that we have three events, $A,B,C$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$ if $$ \Pr(A \cap B \mid C) = \Pr(A \mid C) \, \Pr(B \mid C) $$ so by using the first formula you are assuming conditional independence, what may, or may not be true for your data. This is related to the idea of exchangeability , in Bayesian statistics we often assume that our data is independent and identically distributed conditionally on parameters (see also the O'Neill, 2009 paper that Wikipedia refferes to). To learn more refer to Wikipedia article and math.stackexchange.com thread that go into more details and provide multiple worked examples. O'Neill, B. (2009). Exchangeability, Correlation and Bayes' Effect. International Statistical Review 77(2), 241â€“250.
