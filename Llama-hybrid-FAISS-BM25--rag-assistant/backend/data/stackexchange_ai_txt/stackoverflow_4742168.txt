Java GData Spreadsheets API failing on getting Feed

I'm trying to get a specific document by the key of the doc. I'm following the instructions here: https://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/data/3.0/reference.html#ConstructingURIs I get the key from the URL: https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aoz...mcmc&hl=en#gid=0 URL feedUrl = new URL("https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/spreadsheets/private/full/0Aoz...mcmc"); SpreadsheetFeed feed = _service.getFeed(feedUrl, SpreadsheetFeed.class); _entry = feed.getEntries().get(0); It gives me the following exception: Exception in thread "main" com.google.gdata.util.ParseException: [Line 1, Column 165] Invalid root element, expected (namespace uri:local name) of (http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom:feed), found (http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom:entry The exception doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. I guess it wants the tag to be the root but it's getting . If I go to the URL I'm using for feedUrl then I get the XML document I want (has the name and all that of the document I'm aiming for). I don't see what I'm doing wrong here and I can't find anything online that has been able to help me. Anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
