What the best practices to place ads in a website?

I want place ads in my website, but I'm unsure about the common practices to place thes ads. By example, some cool asp.net articles sites shows ads in the middle of the article! So you read 2-3 paragraphs, read some ad, then finish the article reading... Another worry is about sabotage. One of mine customers get their Google adsense account banned, due some rival that clicked a lot of times in the goodle ads... there is some javascript techniques to block [edit] the undesirable click flood! [/edit] ?
