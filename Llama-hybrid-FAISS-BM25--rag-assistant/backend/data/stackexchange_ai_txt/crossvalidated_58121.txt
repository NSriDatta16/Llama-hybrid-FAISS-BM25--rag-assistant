Build statistical model

I need to build model where y depends on x (y~x). But while I have the usual data for Y, I only have a range of values for X, e.g. X=4..5; Y=2 X=4..5; Y=2.1 X=5..7; Y=3 .... X=10..12; Y=8 I think standard regression and OLS can not be used. What a way to build the model? The Y value actually represents an average of several values​​, the corresponding values ​​of X are unknown, known only to the range.
