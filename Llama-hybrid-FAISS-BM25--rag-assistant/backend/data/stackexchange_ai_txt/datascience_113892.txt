There is no difference, Machine Learning is just statistics, but using more modern techniques. The theory of statistics also applies to machine learning methods, they are no exception. Traditional statistics tends to be more interested in inference (rather than prediction) than machine learning, but there is nothing to stop you from using ML for inference as well. A false division between statistics and machine learning, rather than viewing it as a continuum, is bad for both communities, who have a lot to learn from each other. The main reason for this is that a lot of machine learning researchers come from a computer science, physics or engineering background (engineering in my case, but I now teach CS) and simply were not aware of a lot of things that were already well known in statistics. Fortunately there are some statisticians that have become well known in ML, which helps (e.g. Vapnik). Similarly, a lot of statistics could benefit from the (on average) greater understanding of computing in the ML field. ML tends to be more computationally demanding, but there is no real division.
