Without knowing just what your setup is, and the purpose of this processing, we can only guess at a good answer. I'll assume you mean that you have two microphones in different locations. If you add the two channels first, or if you Fourier transform each and then add, you'll get bad results. The reason is interference - at some frequencies the source will be an integer number of wavelengths from one microphone but an integer and a half from the other. This is a common beginner's problem in audio recording. Perhaps what you want to it measure the signal of a source heard by both microphones, while ignoring random noise and extraneous sources local to each microphone. In that case, do a Fourier on each channel, compute the power (the squared magnitude) at each frequency, take the logarithm of that, and then average the two channels. This avoid problems with interference, and statistically reduces the random noise (though not a whole lot).
