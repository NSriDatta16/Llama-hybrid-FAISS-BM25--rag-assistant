Welcome @Remus Raphael :) - Your approach is a sound option. More specifically, if a density-based algorithm was already working for you, I'd recommend the HDBSCAN clustering algo, which should have a better performance and has a unique built-in cluster validation (based on the DBCV algorithm). Then your general pipe line could be: An optional pre-processing An optional NLP / TFIDF for meaningful text features An optional dimensionality reduction (I found TSNE and TruncatedSVD to work nicely with HDBSCAN with textual processing) HDBSCAN tuning for different params and distance metrics Finally, when you're satisfied with the clustering quality - you can simply start with the 2 largest clusters for your AB testing I'd love to hear you feedback on your actual data :)
