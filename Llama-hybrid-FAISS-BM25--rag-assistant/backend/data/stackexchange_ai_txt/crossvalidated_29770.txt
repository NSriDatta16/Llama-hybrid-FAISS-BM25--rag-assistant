If your data are not normally distributed you can try bootstrap confidence intervals but my research has shown that you need larges samples to get the proper coverage (these intervals have advertised coverage only asymptotically). Also although you say that you know the measurements are unbiased and the actual mean parameter is 20 you can compute the sample estimate of bias and test to see if it is different from 0.
