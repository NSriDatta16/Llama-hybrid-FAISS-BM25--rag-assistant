Symfony Actions Namespacing, or a better way?

In Rails, you can organize controllers into folders and keep your structure nice with namespacing. I'm looking for a similar organizational structure in Symfony 1.4. I was thinking of organizing multiple actions.class.php files in an actions folder, but all I came across was using independent action files, one for each action... like this: # fooAction.class.php class fooAction extends sfActions { public function executeFoo() { echo 'foo!'; } } But I'd have to develop a whole new routing system in order to fit multiple actions into that file, which is... silly. Really I'm just looking to make Symfony into Rails, (again, silly, but I'm stuck with Symfony for this project) so I'm wondering if there's a better way....? Thanks.
