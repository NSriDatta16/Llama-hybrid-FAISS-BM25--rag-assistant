I would recommend going through Towardsdatascience and Medium articles. They can explain the methods in a very simple and light way by summarizing the theory and also inlcuding the practical side of things. for example: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-unsupervised-learning-8f1b189e9050 If you want to dive more into the maths the famous ESLII (Elements of Statiscal Learning) https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf and Pattern Recognition of Bishop ( http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf ) are the way to go. These two are the "bible" of Machine Learning
