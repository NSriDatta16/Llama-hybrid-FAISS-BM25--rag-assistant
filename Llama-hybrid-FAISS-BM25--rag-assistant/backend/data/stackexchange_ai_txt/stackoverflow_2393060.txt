Not exactly sure I understand your question but the Dragster and Dropzone apps clearly work something like this: They have an application icon in the dock. They respond to a drop request in the standard fashion. Upon receiving a drop request, they open an application window above the dock which also accepts a drop request. According to the link you provided, they use the accessibility API to locate their dock icon so they can open the application window above the dock icon. The window is just a standard application window although most likely modal and floating (like a help window.) It can have any appearance you wish.
