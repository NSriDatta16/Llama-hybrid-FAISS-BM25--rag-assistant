Coding categorical variable

Let's say I have a dataset where a data point contains information about a group of people. The group can consist of MALE, FEMALE, or BOTH - a variable group_gender. Should I code this as a factor with 3 levels: MALE, FEMALE, BOTH or to use an indicator variables MALE and FEMALE and use it like this. If the group is MALE code it as: MALE 1, FEMALE 0 If the group is FEMALE code it as: MALE 0, FEMALE 1 If the group is BOTH code it as: MALE 1, FEMALE 1 Similarly, for each group I have age range which can be [18, 24], [25, 34], [35, 44], [45, 54], [55, Inf]. A group can consist of only single age range or it can be any combination of the age ranges. I am planning to use the data in a logistic regression model. Please provide some info why one approach is better then the other or the pros and cons of each approach.
