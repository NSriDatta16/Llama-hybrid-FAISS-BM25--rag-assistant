How to 'web enable' a legacy C++ application

I am working on a system that splits users by organization. Each user belongs to an organization. Each organization stores its data in its own database which resides on a database server machine. A db server may manage databases for 1 or more organizations. The existing (legacy) system assumes there is only one organization, however I want to 'scale' the application by running an 'instance' of it (tied to one organization), and run several instances on the server machine (i.e. run multiple instances of the 'single organization' application - one instance for each organization). I will provide a RESTful API for each instance that is running on the server, so that a thin client can be used to access the services provided by the instance running on the server machine. Here is a simple schematic that demonstrates the relationships: Server 1 -> N database (each organization has one database) organization 1 -> N users My question relates to how to 'direct' RESTful requests from a client, to the appropriate instance that is handling requests from users for that organization. More specifically, when I receive a RESTful request, it will be from a user (who belongs to an organization), how (or indeed, what is the best way) to 'route' the request to the appropriate application instance running on the server?
