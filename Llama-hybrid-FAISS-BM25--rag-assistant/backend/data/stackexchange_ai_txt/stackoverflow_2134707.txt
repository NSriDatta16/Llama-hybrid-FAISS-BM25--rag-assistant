How can I read Excel files in Perl?

I am looking for some examples/advice on how to write a Perl script to read data from an excel file then use the data read in (as a string hopefully) and pass it to another Perl file (as an argument). The goal is to have a table in which the user can type some data (ftp destination or filename) into the table. Then my program will grab that data at do some automation with it. It does not have to be very elegant in implementation ... Just need it to read rows of data more or less.
