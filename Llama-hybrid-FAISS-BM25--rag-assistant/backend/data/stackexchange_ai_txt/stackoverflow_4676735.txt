Pull data from FB app and store in spreadsheet

I am hoping you guys can help me out. I play a Facebook game called Dragons of Atlantis. It is a Real-Time Strategy game with a large world map. The world map is a 750x750 grid. I'd like to know the details of each coordinate of that grid, as unfortunately, there is no in-game way to view this data. Not directly, at least... There is a JSON file which supplies the app with partial amounts of map data (data correlating to a 20x20 grid on the world map). I want to use that JSON file to store those results in a spreadsheet so I have my own record of map details I can view locally and on a whim. Here is an example of one of the JSON files containing map data: http://realm3.castle.wonderhill.com/api/map.json I'll be the first to admit I hardly have any programming knowledge. I'm a SQL expert, but that knowledge seems to be getting me absolutely no where in this endeavor... :( Any tools you guys know of which would help me achieve my ends? I don't think what I'm asking for it all that uncommon or complicated, but I cannot find a solution for the life of me. Any help is greatly appreciated.
