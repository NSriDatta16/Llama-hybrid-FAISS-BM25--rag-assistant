You don't need Xcode or a Mac to install an ad-hoc-provisioned app. All your users need is iTunes. You need to have your users send you their UUIDs, which you then need to register in Apple's provisioning portal. Download the updated profile and be sure to link to it when building your app for distribution. I have heard of people having trouble installing .app files. The safest option is to chose "build and archive" from the build menu. This will create an ipa file that can be installed through iTunes. If you open the Xcode organizer after building and archiving, you can select your new ipa and save it to file, or send it by e-mail straight from Xcode.
