Statistical test to compare global performance of two models over multiple data set of time series

I have measurements from $N$ subjects. For each subjects $i \in {1,...,N}$ , I measure three time series composed of $T_i$ elements : $x^i = \{x^i_1,...,x^i_{T_i}\}$ , $y^i = \{y^i_1,...,y^i_{T_i}\}$ and $z^i = \{z^i_1,...,z^i_{T_i}\}$ . I use two models to predict $z^i_t$ from $x^i_t$ and $y^i_t$ respectively, for $t \in {1,...,T_i}$ . Using the corresponding residuals $r^i_{x_t}$ and $r^i_{y_t}$ , I can test if the signal $x^i$ is better (provides the lowest errors) than $y^i$ to predict $z^i$ for a given subject $i$ . Now, I want to test statistically if the signals $x$ are generally better than $y$ to predict $z$ . How can I do it ?
