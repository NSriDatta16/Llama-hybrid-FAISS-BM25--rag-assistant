Simply looking at generative models on Wikipedia, I read that in machine learning, the generative approach is opposed to the discriminative approach. The generative model corresponds to the conditional density $p(x|Y=y)$ of the data given the model index, while the discriminative model is the conditional probability $\Bbb P(Y=y|X=x)$ of the index given the observation. The later usually avoids modeling the observable. Generative and discriminative models are also used simultaneously in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
