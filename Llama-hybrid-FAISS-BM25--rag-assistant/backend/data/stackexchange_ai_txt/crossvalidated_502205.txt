What is the algorithm to solve logistic regression with lasso a.k.a $L_1$ regularization?

what is the procedure/algorithm for a logistic regression with a penalty on the $L_1$ norm? I found the iterative soft thresholding algorithm for a classical linear regression, but I can't adapt it for a logistic regression.
