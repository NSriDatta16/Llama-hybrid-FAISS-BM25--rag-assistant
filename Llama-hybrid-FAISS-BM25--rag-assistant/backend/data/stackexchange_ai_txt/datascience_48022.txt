What simple machine learning algorithm to use in POS tagging

I am new to NLP. I have a dataset that has already a parts of speech included, the only problem is what algorithm to use in order to train my dataset. Sample: {"word1": "POS", "word2": "POS", "word3": "POS", "word4": "POS"} Ambiguity is not a problem in this case. If I input a word, it should tell what POS it is, but if the word is unknown, the POS will also be unknown.
