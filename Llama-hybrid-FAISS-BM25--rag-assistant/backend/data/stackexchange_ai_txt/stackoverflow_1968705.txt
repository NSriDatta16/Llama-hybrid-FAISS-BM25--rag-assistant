Neural network [if i am not mistaken] would work on interpreting patterns, You provide inputs to your program and the program searches that pattern in a set of stored patterns and based on the match provides a possible match. In your case, the dimensions for the patterns could be data such as speed + direction or only direction, etc I made a small simulation of a neural bot that chats on my site in a similar fashion. The more patterns the program 'Learns', the more accurate answers it provides.
