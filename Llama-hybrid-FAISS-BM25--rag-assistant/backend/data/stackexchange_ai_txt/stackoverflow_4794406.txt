Have you tried changing the rendering image's Window Width and Level in accordance with the calibrated Hounsfield Units? Are you using vtkPievewiseFunction in the vtk rendering pipeline? Add points to it where (x,y) x = hounsfield unit for the organ, y = 1.0f x = -10,000, y = 0.0f x = +10,000, y = 0.0f You'll have to refine the algorithm, but that should get you started.
