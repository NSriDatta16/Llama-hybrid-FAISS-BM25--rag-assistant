A good Machine Learning Book

Possible Duplicate: Machine learning self-learning book? I am a researcher on Machine Learning and I generally try to refer to Andrew Moore's Tutorials and Simon Haykin's Neural Networks. I am looking for a book which works in some detail with easy language and good exercises and recent concepts. My problem is I have a Humanities background, and I always ask questions. I am thinking of the book by Christopher M. Bishop / Andrew Ng's Tutorial. Are they fine? Or do you have any other suggestion? I generally prefer a downloadable version.
