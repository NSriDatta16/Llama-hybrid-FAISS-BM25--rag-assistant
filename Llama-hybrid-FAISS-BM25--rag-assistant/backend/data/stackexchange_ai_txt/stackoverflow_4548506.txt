SimpleXML failing to find namespaced elements

I can't seem to get PHP's SimpleXML class to recognize prefixed namespace elements in an XHTML document. Here's my example: test.html Untitled Document Heading Paragraph When I do the following: $sxml = simplexml_load_file('test.html'); print_r($sxml); It returns: SimpleXMLElement Object ( [head] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [meta] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [@attributes] => Array ( [http-equiv] => Content-Type [content] => text/html; charset=utf-8 ) ) [title] => Untitled Document ) [body] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [h1] => Heading [p] => Paragraph ) ) But when I do the following: $sxml = simplexml_load_file('test.html'); $sxml_zuq = $sxml->children('zuq', true); print_r($sxml_zuq); It returns empty: SimpleXMLElement Object ( ) Iterating through the object with foreach or otherwise doesn't seem to work, and using the URI rather than the prefix in children() also fails. I've obviously made a mistake somewhere, but I'm not sure where, as my attempt is quite identical to many tutorial examples I've come across in my reading. What's going on here?
