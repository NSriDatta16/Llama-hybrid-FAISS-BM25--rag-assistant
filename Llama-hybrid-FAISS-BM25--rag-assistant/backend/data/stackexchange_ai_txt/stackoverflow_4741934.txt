Most easy solution : relocate the auto-increment of the table on your master to current value + number of rows in your temp storage . This needs to be done when your logging app is down, or else it will become messy. That's done in a matter of minutes. You can the restart your app. Then you add the difference between the first id on the temp db and the old value of the auto-increment on the master to the ids on your temp db. Finally simply insert your data from the temp db to the table on the master, and it's done!
