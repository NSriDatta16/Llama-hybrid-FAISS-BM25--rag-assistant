Akaike (1978, pg. 224) describes how the AIC can be adjusted in the presence of a transformed outcome variable to enable model comparison. He states: “the effect of transforming the variable is represented simply by the multiplication of the likelihood by the corresponding Jacobian to the AIC ... for the case of $\log\{y(n)+1\}$ , it is −2 $\cdot \sum \log\{y(n)+1\}$ , where the summation extends over $n = 1,2, ..., N$ .” Akaike, H. 1978. "On the likelihood of a time series model," Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D (The Statistician), 27(3/4), pp. 217–235.
