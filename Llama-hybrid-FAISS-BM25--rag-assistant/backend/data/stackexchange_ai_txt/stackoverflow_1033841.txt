Is it possible to implement smooth scroll in a WPF listview?

Is it possible to implement smooth scroll in a WPF listview like how it works in Firefox? When the Firefox browser contained all listview items and you hold down the middle mouse button (but not release), and drag it, it should smoothly scroll the listview items. When you release it should stop. It looks like this is not possible in winforms, but I am wondering if it is available in WPF?
