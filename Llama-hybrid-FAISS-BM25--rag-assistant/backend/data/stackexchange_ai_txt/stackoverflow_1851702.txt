I am not into fusion and therefore don't see how to fix it in a simple and elegant way (i mainly don't see how member functions are supposed to work), but i worked on something similar that might be an alternative for you. If you want to take a look at the result, it is in the Firebreath repository. In short: MethodConverter.h contains the main functionality the ugly dispatch_gen.py generates that header ConverterUtils.h contains the utility functionality like conversion to the target types TestJSAPIAuto.h and jsapiauto_test.h contain a unit test that shows it in action The main changes would probably involve to strip the FB-specific types, tokenize the input sequence before invoking the functors and supply your own conversion functions.
