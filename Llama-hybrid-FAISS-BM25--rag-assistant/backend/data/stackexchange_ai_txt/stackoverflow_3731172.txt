How much size "Null" value takes in SQL Server

I have a large table with say 10 columns. 4 of them remains null most of the times. I have a query that does null value takes any size or no size in bytes. I read few articles some of them are saying : http://www.sql-server-citation.com/2009/12/common-mistakes-in-sql-server-part-4.html There is a misconception that if we have the NULL values in a table it doesn't occupy storage space. The fact is, a NULL value occupies space â€“ 2 bytes SQL: Using NULL values vs. default values A NULL value in databases is a system value that takes up one byte of storage and indicates that a value is not present as opposed to a space or zero or any other default value. Can you please guide me regarding the size taken by null value.
