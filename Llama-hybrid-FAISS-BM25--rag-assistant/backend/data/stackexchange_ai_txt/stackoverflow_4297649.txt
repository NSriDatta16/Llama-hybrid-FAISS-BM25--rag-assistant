Basic SSL Certificate Questions

It has been a long time since I purchased a SSL Certificate for a web site and I am confused on what I need. There are a lot of options and I can't filter out what is really needed verse what are optional premium services. Would really like to hear from your experience what is important to you when purchasing a SSL Cert. Some of my questions are: How important is it to have 40 bit minimum vs. 128 bit minimum encryption? Is organization validation important if this is going to be a B2B site? Is the warranty/insurance important at all? Is this just a marketing scheme? How many people really collect on this? The site is going to be Windows Azure should this matter in my decision? Thanks in advance for your answers!!
