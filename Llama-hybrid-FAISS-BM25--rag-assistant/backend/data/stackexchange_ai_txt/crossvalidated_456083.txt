PCA of Clusters - Intuition behind role of Variance

The image above shows data generated from two Gaussians, forming two conspicuous clusters. The data is now projected onto two axes, and the projected data on one of the axes has higher variance than the other (i.e. 17.37 is more than twice of 8.35). The book I took this image from, further adds that, If cluster structure is present in the data, using the projection with the highest variance is likely to preserve this structure . However, I don't seem to understand the intuition behind this statement - even though it's evident that it is true, from the attached picture. Could someone please explain? Thank you! P.S. I'm only a beginner in Machine Learning, and this is my first interaction with the CrossValidated SE community. Pardon me if I've not presented the question properly, and let me know if this forum is appropriate for more such questions!
