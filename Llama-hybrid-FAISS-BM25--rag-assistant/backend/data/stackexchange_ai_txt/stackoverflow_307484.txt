Easiest way to figure it out is to Google dynamic programming. It's an algorithm that's been borrowed from Information Retrieval and is used heavily in modern day bioinformatics to see how similiar two gene sequences are. Optimal solution uses dynamic programming and recursion. This is a very solved problem with lots of solutions. Just google around until you find some open source code.
