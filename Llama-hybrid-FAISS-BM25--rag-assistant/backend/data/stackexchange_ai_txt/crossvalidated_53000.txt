Fitting a logistic regression using lassoglm in matlab

I am fitting a logistic regression model using lassoglm in matlab. I issued the following command [B,FitInfo] = lassoglm(ec50,Y,'binomial','Lambda',0.0001,'CV',10); Now once I get the coefficients B, how am I supposed to use it. I mean do I have to do $P(y=1) = \frac{e^{(\theta^tx)}}{1 + e^{(\theta^tx)}}$ where $\theta$s are obtained from B. Is it the case?
