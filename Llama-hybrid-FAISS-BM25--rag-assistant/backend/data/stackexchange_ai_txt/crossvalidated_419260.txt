In my field (political science) conjoint experiments are very common. Typically the data come in the form of a forced-choice comparison â€” i.e., survey respondents are shown a series of comparisons between product profiles in which features of the products are randomized, and then respondents choose which product they prefer. In terms of analysis, a paper by Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto shows that you can estimate a quantity called the average marginal component effect (AMCE) by a linear regression (using OLS) of the form $$Y_{ij} = a + \beta_1 X_{1ij} + \beta_2 X_{2ij} + \cdots + \epsilon_{ij},$$ where $Y_{ij}$ is an indicator for whether respondent $i$ chose profile $j$ when they had the option, and the $X$ 's are vectors of indicator variables for the features. The AMCE is the average change in probability of choosing a product that has that specific feature, relative to the baseline, marginalizing over the distribution of other features. In other words, it averages over all possible interactions effects. This is a very simple estimator to implement since it's just OLS. If you want to know how the importance of specific factors varies as a function of other factors, you could subset based on the other factor (e.g. whether the product was made in China) and re-estimate the regression above, or you could simply include interaction indicators. As you note, though, you can't estimate all possible interactions using OLS, since the number of combinations very quickly exceeds the number of respondents. Your idea to use LASSO makes sense to me. To see another estimator for this problem that has some nice properties, you could take a look at this paper by Egami and Imai .
