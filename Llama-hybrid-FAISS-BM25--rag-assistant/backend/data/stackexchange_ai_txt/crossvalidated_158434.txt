Can I Interpret the impact of variables like positive or negative on the model by Random Forest, as I can do by Logistic Regression

I have created a model for prediction of candidates presence or not . I have used Logistic Regression and Random Forest . By Logistic Regression, I got coefficients associated with 100 features and I sorted these by coefficient values, and I am assuming the values greater with the coefficients have a positive impact and negative values will have a negative impact. But, when I did Random Forest and got the feature importance it is not same as I got from Logistic Regression and RF coefficients for features are not negative also. So, I was wondering based on the greater values that I got from Random Forest, can I interpret the impact of these variables or features as positive impact and negative impact . Please help.
