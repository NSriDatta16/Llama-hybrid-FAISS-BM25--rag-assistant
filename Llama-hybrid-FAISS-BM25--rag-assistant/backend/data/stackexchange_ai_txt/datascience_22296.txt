I recommend getting to know PyMC library for Bayesian Inference applied to graphical models but also deep learning. See this article for an implementation of Bayesian MLP in PyMC3. As you would expect, the MLP weights are assigned a prior Gaussian distribution which gets updated to a posterior after observing the training data. Instead of Stochastic Gradient Descent or Adam optimizer, ADVI variational inference algorithm is used to compute the posterior distributions of all latent variables.
