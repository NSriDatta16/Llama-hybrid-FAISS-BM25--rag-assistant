These limits are absolutely not cast in stone. They go back to work by Aris Syntetos and John Boylan about 15 years ago on classifying demand as intermittent, lumpy or continuous, and rely essentially on one or very few datasets. There is no particular reason why these specific limits should work well for new datasets - and what "working well" means is already something one can argue about. You do find time series that are classified as "intermittent" based on these limits, but that anyone eyeballing them would classify as "lumpy". So by all means, go ahead and choose other thresholds. Clustering is one way. Another one is to just play around with possible limits until you get a "good" result. Keep in mind that this classification is just a means to an end, so be mindful of what a "good" result is. Average sales, in this classification, are calculated across all time periods. (Cutting off spurious zeros at the beginning when the product is not available, of course.) If you remove zeros, then you can't very well classify the series as intermittent or lumpy any more. And that already leads us to a shortcoming of this simple classification: it will happily classify a series as intermittent or lumpy that absolutely isn't , because there are patterns to zeros, patterns which this method does not even look at. Here is an example of "intermittent" data (because it has "many zeros"), which is actually seasonal, not intermittent: Explain the croston method of R So don't over-rely on this classification, but keep other possible features like seasonality in mind. For instance, Talagala et al. (2022) and literature cited therein give a nice intro into the entire stream of leveraging time series features.
