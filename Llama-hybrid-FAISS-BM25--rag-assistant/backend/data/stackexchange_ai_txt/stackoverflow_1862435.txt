@Jasconius I used the technique you describe for creating thumbnails of imported stuff into an AIR app and it's a drag to build all the routines, but in the end I'm satisfied with this solution. I use it for creating thumbnails from images, video and modules (with each a different container and routines to load and unload the footage) The good part of this is that when you are building your thumbnailcreatorComponent - you can position it in the viewarea of the app to see what's going on. Later, when you are sure that everything works fine, you can put the thumbnailCreator at -10000,-10000 and forget about it.
