How can I use Wikipedia2vec model for embedding my article named entities as 40% entities are not in a wikipedia?

I have news articles in my dataset containing named entities. I want to use the Wikipedia2vec model to encode the article's named entities. But some of the entities (around 40%) from our dataset articles are not present in Wikipedia. Please suggest to me, how can I use the Wikipedia2vec model for embedding my article named entities efficiently with the help of the article?
