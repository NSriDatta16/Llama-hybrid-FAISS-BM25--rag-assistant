Python - How to group variables separated by or/and operators

I am trying to find a way to make the following (sample) code more elegant: if answer == "yes" or "Yes" or "Y" or "y" or "why not": print("yeah") In the same manner there in english you would not say: The possible answers are yes or Yes or Y or why not. and you would rather say: The possible answers are yes, Yes, Y or why not. What would the more elegant way of doing this would be? Thanks in advance!!
