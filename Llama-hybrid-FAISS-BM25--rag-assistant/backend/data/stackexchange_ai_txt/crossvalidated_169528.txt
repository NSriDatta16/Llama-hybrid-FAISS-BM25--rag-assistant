The role of validation in estimation and hypothesis testing

Validation, with or without statistical/machine learning procedures, is used often, if not universally, in prediction. In estimation or hypothesis testing that does not seem to be the case, yet I don't understand why. If the purpose of estimation and hypothesis testing is generalization, as is normally the case, shouldn't we safeguard against overfitting as we similarly do when the objective is prediction? I am currently conducting a cross-sectional study in which I try to estimate relative effect sizes between two groups. Is there any reason that I should or shouldn't concern myself with model training and validation?
