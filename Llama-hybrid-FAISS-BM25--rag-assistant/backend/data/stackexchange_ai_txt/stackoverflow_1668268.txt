Blackberry Content Protection and the Persistent Store

I have an application which stores data to the persistent store by setting the contents of the PersistentObject as a hashtable, e.g. saving preferences is done by entering strings as the keys and values of the hashtable and then setContents is called on the PersistentObject with the Hashtable passed as the parameter. I understand that the data is saved unencrypted. If I enable content protection in the IT policy for the device will this implementation of persistent storage automatically start encrypting the data or do I have to change the implementation to use for example the ContentProtectedHashtable for saving the contents? All the information I have found so far about content protection has been with regards to the BES IT policy and nothing about implementation in the application, which makes me think that the standard implementation (i.e. just commiting a Persistable object to PersistentObject object) is adapted automatically to encrypt the data?? Any ideas?? Thanks.
