As a developer who rarely tests his own code, I can tell you the one thing that's made me slowly shift my behavior... Visibility If the environment allows pushing code out, waiting for users to find problems, and then essentially asking "How about now?" after making a change to the code, there's no real incentive to test your own stuff. Code reviews and collaboration encourage you to work towards making a quality product much more than if you were just delivering 'Widget X' while your coworkers work on 'Widget Y' and 'Widget Z' The more visible your work is, the more likely you are to care about how well it works.
