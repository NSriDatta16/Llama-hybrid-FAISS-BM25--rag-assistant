Have run into this problem, when we wanted to run with patient-based deep learning models or individual observations (the same patient could have come several times) based deep learning models. In your case, they could be analogous to Animal-based model vs general-one-for-all model which has all the animals. Pros of animal-based: If you are going to build an animal-level classifier, it certainly is going to generalize better when compared to one-model for every animal. Cons of animal-based: If you don't have enough data for one particular animal, you can't help out much, for that case. This is slightly advantageous as well, I can't say for veterinarian examples, but if you are going to use a general-one-for-all model it might misclassify the prediction as well (because of lack of data for that particular example). I would suggest you try both. There is nothing certain in this world. Only hunches and guesses from past experiences. Hope this helps.
