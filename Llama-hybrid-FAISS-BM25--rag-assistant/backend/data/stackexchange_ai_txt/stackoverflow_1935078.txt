This is fundamentally impossible. As (almost) everybody has said, the web browser of your user needs to be able to read your html and Javascript, and browsers exist to serve their users -- not you. What this means is that no matter what you do there is eventually going to be something on a user's machine that looks like: ... because otherwise there is nothing to show the user . If that exists on the client-side, then you have lost control of it. Even if you managed to convince every browser-maker on the planet to not make that available through a "view source" option -- which is, you know, unlikely -- the text will still exist on that user's machine, and somebody will figure out how to get to it. And that will never happen, browsers will always exist to serve their users before all others. (Hopefully) The same thing is true for all of your Javascript. Let me say it again: nothing that you send to a user is secure or secret from that user . The encryption via Javascript hack is stupid and cannot work in any meaningful sense. (Well, actually, Flash and Silverlight ship binaries, but I don't think that they're encrypted. So they are at the least irritating to get data out of.) As others have said, the only way to keep something secret from your users is to not give it to them: put the logic in your server and make sure that it is never sent. For example, all of the code that you write in PHP (or Python/Ruby/Perl/Java/C...) should never be seen by your users. This is e.g. why Google still has a business. What they give you is fundamentally uninteresting compared to what they never send to you. And, because they realize this, they try to make most things that they send you as open as useful as possible. Because it's the infrastructure -- the Terrabyte-huge maps database and pathfinding software, as opposed to the snazzy map that you can click and drag -- that you are trading your privacy for. Another example: I'm not sure if you remember how many tricks people employed in the early days of the web to try and keep people from saving images to disk. When was the last time you ran across one of those? Know why? Because once data is on your user's machine, she controls it. Not you. So, in short: if you want to keep something secret from your user, don't give it to her.
