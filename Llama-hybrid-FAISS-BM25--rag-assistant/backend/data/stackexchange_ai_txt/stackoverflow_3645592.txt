I fiddled with some of the things: I'm returning the inverse of this.length, for 0 that is true , for everything other number that is false . I removed the check for " " . I actually haven't seen much, if any cases where a single space was entered, removing the check is IMO faster on average. And flipped the regex string like the others did. String.prototype.isEmpty = function() { return !this.length || /^\s*$/.test(this); }
