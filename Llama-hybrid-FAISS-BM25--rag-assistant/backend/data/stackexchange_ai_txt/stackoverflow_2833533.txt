echo $areas['footer']; Simple and has the exact same effect as the original line. Edit in reply to Felix This gives a notice, but unless you're supposed to turn this in as ultra-perfect homework, it doesn't really matter. You can either fill your code with isset calls or ignore small stuff like this. I'd worry about it if I was working in say... Java, but pragmatically nobody is going to care if PHP code that works produces notices.
