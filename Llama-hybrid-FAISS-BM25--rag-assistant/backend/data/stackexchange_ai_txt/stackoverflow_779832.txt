Can I store custom attributes in HTML DOM like a database record?

When developing for browsers FF3 and IE6/7 with jQuery, are there any compatibility issues when setting custom attributes on HTML tags? First, I'm aware of jQuery's data() function and it essentially does what I want, but the data doesn't survive a clone() function. This is an issue when using the jQuery UI draggable/droppable plugins because it clones DOM elements during a drag/drop. For the purpose of this question, I need an alternative to data() . I want to persist data between drag/drop operations. I want to be able to inject data into the DOM element that is moved during a drag/drop operation. To do this, I can build HTML child elements to simulate a database record. Quick experimentation shows that Firefox has no issues utilizing any attribute names I want to store fields of data. However, the HTML 4 spec says that certain tags can only contain certain attribute names. Will populating the DOM with nonstandard attributes cause incompatibility issues with the browsers I've mentioned?
