Time series proportion/share modelling issue

I want to model import share (one commodity product in country) as dependent variable from local price premium (local price minus import price) and seasonality factor (0 or 1). Model is used to make an inference for predition of import share in the future. The intuition is: when local price is too high compared to import alternative, costumers start buying more import product and if local price is too low compared to import althernative - volume of import share is close to zero. There is natural lag between cause and effect - usually one month, and effect usually lasts for two months. For example if local price premium is high in March, import share increases in April-May. Ther is also natural seasonality - in autumn/winter costumers are less likely to switch to import because demand is weak. Data is processed to monthly based (47 observations). Each observation is: Price premium with one month lag Import share for two months (current and 1 month forward) Seasonality factor Import share is continous (strictly between 0 and 1), 90% of values are between 0 and 0.1. There is auto corellation. Non stationary. Price premium is continous, can be both negative and positive, measured as percentage. There is auto corellation. Non stationary. I have read some articles that imply that beta regression should be used to model share/proportion, but I have time series data. Variables are non stationary and I am not sure if I can straitforward employ beta regression here to make statistically significan inference. I am not sure I can use cointegration because it does nog guaranty dependent variable to stay in (0,1) boundary. I also read some suggestions - when using beta regression for time series to add to model lags of dependent and explanatory variables and ensure that residuals do not corellate. Can anybody suggest a right approach for my case? I can share csv file if needed.
