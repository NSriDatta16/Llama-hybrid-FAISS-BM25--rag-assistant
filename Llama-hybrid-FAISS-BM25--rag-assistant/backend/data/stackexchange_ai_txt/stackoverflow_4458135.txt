How to get this button on NSWindow

I'm making a new OSX app and I'm trying to copy the flow that tons of apps use. I just need to know how to add a button on the right hand side of the application's title. Here's what I currently have Here's the button I'm trying to get (right hand side) I don't know what it's called, but when I try to drag a sample push button, Interface Builder just ignores it. Thanks for any help in advance!
