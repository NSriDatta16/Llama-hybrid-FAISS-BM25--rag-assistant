SVM is a classification algorithm that relies on optimization only. It does not assume a probabilistic model. You can use it for prediction, but not really for inference. FraMan explanation might give some intuition, but I'm not sure how it generalizes to different kernels than the linear one, and I'm not 100% sure it holds for the linear as well.
