Significance Test for Distributions Across Unequal Time Periods

I am looking at monthly death data and am trying to understand if there's a sound way to determine if the patterns in the current month are different from the same month in previous years. For example, is the proportion of male deaths different in December 2022 than it was for December 2017-2021? What would be the best way to statistically test for this since the time periods are not equal? In other words, would it still be correct to do a 2-sample test of proportions to compare the proportion of male deaths in December 2022 vs. proportion for December 2017-2021? That is: Male deaths in December 2022/all deaths in December 2022 vs. Male deaths in December 2017-2021/all deaths December 2017-2021 Or is it best to compare Dec 2022 to the average for Dec 2017-2021, though I'm not sure what the best statistical test would be since Dec 2022 would not be an average. Thanks!
