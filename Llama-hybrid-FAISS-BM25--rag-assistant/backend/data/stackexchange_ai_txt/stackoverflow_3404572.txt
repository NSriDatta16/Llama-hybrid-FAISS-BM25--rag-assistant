sqlite: temporary table/view in a read-only db?

It seems that sqlite won't allow me to create a temporary view in a read-only db. Am I missing something? If it's TEMPORARY, I figured db connection mode shouldn't matter. I even specified "PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY" -- it didn't help. Is there a reasonable alternative to using views?
