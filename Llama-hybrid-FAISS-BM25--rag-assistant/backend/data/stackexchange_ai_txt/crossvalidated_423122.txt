First, before you start generalizing (drawing inferences) from six mice, you should establish what population of mice these six are a random sample of. If you can't do that, then I'd go with what @BruceET said. Second, these results pass the IOTT - the interocular trauma test - it hits you between the eyes. It seems like overkill to do all the work you are doing. Third, your two numbers are answers to different questions. The first question is "Of all seeds eaten, what proportion were control and what proportion were treated?" and the second is "What is the average proportion of control seeds eaten?" They get different answers because different rats ate different numbers of seeds. Finally, for the standard error, the usual formula is $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ . This isn't perfect and a bunch of alternatives have been proposed, but, given how extremely clear the results are, this estimate is probably fine for your purposes.
