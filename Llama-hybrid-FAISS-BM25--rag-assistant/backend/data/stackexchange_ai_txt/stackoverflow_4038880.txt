Are your database needs significantly beyond key/value stores? If not, I've found a number of javascript packages for local browser-based database abstraction. One such package is jStore: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jstore/ I recently used it to add local key/value storage. It's well-documented and the integration time was negligible -- it supports an array of storage backends, including flash local storage, through its API. CouchDB is an excellent solution -- for a problem that is not quite congruent with yours. Check out couchone mobile . Not for strictly 'web apps' but it may provide a database foundation you could run with, if you have some flexibility with the specification.
