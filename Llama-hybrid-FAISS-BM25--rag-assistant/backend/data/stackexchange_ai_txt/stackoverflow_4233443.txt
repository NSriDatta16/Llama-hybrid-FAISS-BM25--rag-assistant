Mono does not run under IIS 7 because Mono does not have an ISAPI module that implements the right API to interact with IIS 7. UPDATE : In regards to your question about what prevents you from developing an ISAPI module to do that? Nothing, really. Mono has a good embedding API that you could easily consume from C/C++. My guess is, the reason nobody has done it is because there is not much of a need to do it.
