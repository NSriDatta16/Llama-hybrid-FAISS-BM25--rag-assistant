Problem configuring my first Stripes project

apparently i'm having some technical problem configuring Stripes. I use Eclipse ganymede and when i try to run my project from the main project or from the jsp i get a 404 error from Tomcat. This is the structure of my project: Web-content>Web-inf>lib>....jstl, commons.logging and stripes jars Web-content>Web-inf>classes>StripesResources.properties Web-content>Web-inf>classes>stripesbook>action>StripesTime.java (extends ActionBean) Web-content>Web-inf>jsp>stripesTime.jsp Web-content>Web-inf>lib>web.xml....which looks as follows: web.xml: Stripes Stripes Filter net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.StripesFilter ActionResolver.Packages stripesbook.action DispatcherServlet net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.DispatcherServlet 1 StripesFilter DispatcherServlet REQUEST FORWARD DispatcherServlet *.action StripesTime.jsp Apparently, jars are loaded correctly, the packages are in the right places "the stripes tutorial i'm following inserts the packages as folders under the web-inf rather then under the Java-Resources:src" I cant get why, even if i run the jsp file independently, tomcat wont find it. Any suggestions? Thank you!
