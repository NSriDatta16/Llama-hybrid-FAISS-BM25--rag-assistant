How do you add an email filter to an IMAP email account?

I'm using PHP (zend_mail_storage_imap specifically). I built the first iteration of an email product a few days ago. Basically, I flag and filter a number of emails using zend_mail and an imap email account. The problem is that I'm currently searching the email address every five minutes to see if a new email was received. I'd like to change this by placing a filter in IMAP itself - a filter similar to GMAIL filters. Would this be possible to set this up directly in IMAP? If not, what would be the next best solution? My main problem is that although I can filter emails, they still get "pushed" to my blackberry storm before they get filtered out every five minutes.
