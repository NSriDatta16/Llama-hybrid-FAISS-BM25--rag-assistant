I am partial to the former interpretation. Here, $\beta_k$ is interpreted as the effect of treatment for different lengths of exposure to the treatment. As is the convention in most event study frameworks, $\beta_{-1}$ is normalized to be equal to 0. The estimate of $\beta_0$ is the instantaneous treatment effect; it's the average effect in the first year the treatment is implemented. Positive values for $k$ represent treatment lags , which is useful when we want to assess treatment effect dynamics. The estimate of $\beta_9$ is, in effect, the coefficient on the ninth lag. Put simply, it's the average effect of treatment 9 years after the first (immediate) adoption year. As a general recommendation, don't concern yourself so much with interpreting each lead or lag. Instead, show their evolution over time by plotting the coefficients.
