If you're server is set up to handle PHP files, it will compile and execute them prior to sending the output. The actual file will not be downloaded. However, I have seen people name include files with extensions other than *.php, such as *.inc, and they didn't make sure the server would handle those files correctly. This can be dangerous, as include files often contain configuration data. So, as mentioned by sberry2A, it's all about the server set up rather than the language itself. But, it's certainly something that should have attention paid to it.
