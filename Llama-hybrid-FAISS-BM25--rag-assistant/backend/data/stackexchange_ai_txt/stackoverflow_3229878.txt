Peter from Teamworkpm.net here - I'm one of the main developers and was concerned to come across this report about a security problem. I checked into this and I am happy that is not possible to delete a task that you shouldn't have access to. You get a message saying "You do not have permission to delete this task". I think it is just the confusion between being a Project Administrator and being an overall Administrator that is the problem here :- You may not be a member of a project but as an overall administrator, you still have permission to delete any task within your Teamwork site. This is by design. We take security very seriously and it's all implemented server side because as Jens F says, we can't reply on client side security. If you do come across any issues in TeamworkPM that you would like to discuss, we'd encourage any of you to just hit the feedback link and you'll typically get an answer within a few hours.
