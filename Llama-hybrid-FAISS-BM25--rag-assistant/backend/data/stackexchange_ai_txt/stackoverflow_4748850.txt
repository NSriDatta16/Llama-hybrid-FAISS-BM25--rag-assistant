It looks like from the comments that embedding the jar in the bundles isn't going to work. We were able to get Axis 1.4 to work as a bundle by changing some of the Axis 1.4 source code via this post: http://issues.ops4j.org/browse/PAXLOGGING-58 We also took the MANIFEST.MF from the springsource Axis and just drop it into the newly compiled Axis JAR. We did this instead of running it through BND and trying to configure all the optional dependencies. http://nl.interface21.com/repository/app/bundle/version/detail?name=com.springsource.org.apache.axis&version=1.4.0 (Note: We don't use Pax Logging but instead use the Sling logger and the changes above work fine for us. They fix how Axis gets the Logger from the commons-logging compatible framework, which is what seems to break Axis 1.4 in OSGi.) Environment we're using: Day CQ 5.3.0, Felix OSGi container.
