Developing Leverage Statistics Manually in R

I've asked this question on Stack Overflow but think it might be better here. I currently have the below data frame df with the regression equation regression_eq and am trying to determine the leverage points by hand. I have now reviewed many sources and am still stuck. I understand that typically you would use the lm function then develop the diagnostics plots with R but was hoping to do this by hand as I developed results separately. response x y xx xy yy xxx 1 -0.1999981 2.000000 -4.794927e-09 4.000000 -9.589855e-09 2.299133e-17 8.000000 2 -0.2796748 1.997601 -3.995733e-02 3.990411 -7.981882e-02 1.596588e-03 7.971252 3 -0.3590789 1.994407 -7.981885e-02 3.977661 -1.591913e-01 6.371049e-03 7.933076 4 -0.4381798 1.990421 -1.195688e-01 3.961775 -2.379922e-01 1.429669e-02 7.885600 5 -0.5169470 1.985645 -1.591913e-01 3.942786 -3.160975e-01 2.534188e-02 7.828973 6 -0.5953499 1.980083 -1.986710e-01 3.920729 -3.933850e-01 3.947016e-02 7.763370 If it is possible to convert this manually in R please let me know as I have found results that I am unsure of thus far and want to clarify if they are correct. Thanks in advance.
