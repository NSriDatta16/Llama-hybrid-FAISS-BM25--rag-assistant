Measures of variable importance in random forests

I've been playing around with random forests for regression and am having difficulty working out exactly what the two measures of importance mean, and how they should be interpreted. The importance() function gives two values for each variable: %IncMSE and IncNodePurity . Is there simple interpretations for these 2 values? For IncNodePurity in particular, is this simply the amount the RSS increase following the removal of that variable?
