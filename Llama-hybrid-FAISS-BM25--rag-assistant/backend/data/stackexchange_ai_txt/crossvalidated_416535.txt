In bayesian estimation the prior and posterior distribution works together. You can check on wikipedia the conjugate prior https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior . The ideas is to give a prior such that the posterior stay in the family of distribution you want to work with. You can see why he takes the prior proportional to what you say in the table of the wikipedia page. After $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are not constant, its just we are often interested by estimating a parameter. And we just need to know your distribution is proportional to the parameter you want to estimate. You write $p(\mathbf{x}|\sigma) $ is proportional to a function of $\sigma$ , and in this setting $\sigma$ is your target. So you can compute MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation just knowing it is proportional. If you are motivated you can compute all.
