Typically, what I've done in the past was import the excel file into a staging table, and then pruned out duplicated, and then copied the resulting list into the master table. You might have to cull ex-members from the your master table, in which case, maybe it's easier to delete all the members that came from member organisation and reload the entire list. But then you have to record which organisation they came from.
