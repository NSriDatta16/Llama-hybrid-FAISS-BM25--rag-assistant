How to handle both text and numbers for PCA in R?

I'm relatively new to R and am working with a very large dataset that has a mix of numerical scores (for instance, household income) as well as text values (i.e. race). I was planning on using PCA to analyze this dataset but it only works on numerical data. Is there any good alternative?
