Your insertion function assumes that the given array is sorted, it searches directly for the location where the new element can be inserted, usually by just looking at a few of the elements in the array. The general sort function of an array can't take these shortcuts. Obviously it at least has to inspect all elements in the array to see if they are already correctly ordered. This fact alone makes the general sort slower than the insertion function. A generic sort algorithm is usually on average O(n â‹… log(n)) and depending on the implementation it might actually be the worst case if the array is already sorted, leading to complexities of O(n 2 ) . Directly searching for the insertion position instead has just a complexity of O(log(n)) , so it will always be much faster.
