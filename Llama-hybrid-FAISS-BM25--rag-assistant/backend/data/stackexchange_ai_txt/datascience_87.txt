Looking at this document called Anatomy of Facebook I note that the median is 100. Looking at the cumulative function plot I can bet that the average is higher, near 200. So 50 seems to not be the best number here. However I think that this is not the main issue here. The main issue is the lack of information on how the database was used. It seems reasonable that a data storage designed specially for graph structures to be more efficient than traditional RDBMs. However, even if the RDBMs are not in the latest trends as a data storage of choice, these systems evolved continuously in a race with the data set dimensions. There are various types of possible designs, various ways of indexing data, improvements related with concurrency and so on. To conclude I think that regarding reproducibility, the study lack a proper description of how the database schema was designed. I do not expect that a database to dominate on such king of interrogations, however I would expect that with a well-tuned design the differences to not be such massive.
