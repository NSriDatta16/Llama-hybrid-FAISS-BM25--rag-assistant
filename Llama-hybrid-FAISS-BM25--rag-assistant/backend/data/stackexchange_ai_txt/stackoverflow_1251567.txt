Lennart's hypothesis is correct: a metaclass is indeed the culprit. No need to guess, just look at the sources : the metaclass is DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass currently at line 53 of that file, and adds attributes base_fields and possibly media based on what attributes the class has at creation time. At line 329 ff you see: class Form(BaseForm): "A collection of Fields, plus their associated data." # This is a separate class from BaseForm in order to abstract the way # self.fields is specified. This class (Form) is the one that does the # fancy metaclass stuff purely for the semantic sugar -- it allows one # to define a form using declarative syntax. # BaseForm itself has no way of designating self.fields. __metaclass__ = DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass This implies there's some fragility in creating a new class with base type -- the supplied black magic might or might not carry through! A more solid approach is to use the type of EmployeeForm which will pick up any metaclass that may be involved -- i.e.: return type(EmployeeForm)('EmployeeForm', (forms.Form, ), EmployeeForm.__dict__) (no need to copy that __dict__ , btw). The difference is subtle but important: rather than using directly type 's 3-args form, we use the 1-arg form to pick up the type (i.e., the metaclass) of the form class, then call THAT metaclass in the 3-args form. Blackly magicallish indeed, but then that's the downside of frameworks which do such use of "fancy metaclass stuff purely for the semantic sugar" &c: you're in clover as long as you want to do exactly what the framework supports, but to get out of that support even a little bit may require countervailing wizardry (which goes some way towards explaining why often I'd rather use a lightweight, transparent setup, such as werkzeug, rather than a framework that ladles magic upon me like Rails or Django do: my mastery of deep black magic does NOT mean I'm happy to have to USE it in plain production code... but, that's another discussion;-).
