From your description this is a classic problem in OR (operations research). I don't think you even really need "machine learning" per se for this, just use a solver which will abstract all the details so you can concentrate on formulating your problem in terms of its constraints. A tool like PuLP is very easy to use, it comes with a free solver or you can plugin a commercial one such as Gurobi if your needs are particularly intense and beyond the free one. If you prefer R there are many packages too.
