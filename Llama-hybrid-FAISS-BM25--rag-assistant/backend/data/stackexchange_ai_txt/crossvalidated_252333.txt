Joint forecast with Linear Model and ARMA

This might be a rather trivial question, but I cannot seem to figure out how to do this in R. I have estimated a linear model for my time series, and modeled the residuals of the model using an ARMA model (a MA of order 2), as follows: Time Now I would like to make forecasts with this 'joint' model, i.e., using both the linear model and the MA(2) model. How can I do this in R? Do I first need to forecast the MA(2) model and then add the formula of the linear model, or can I do this al at once?
