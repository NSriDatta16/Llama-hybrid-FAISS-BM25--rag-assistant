I'd say organize the constants by logical meaning, instead of a single Constants class. Say you have the 3 you show as some kind of task state, and you have some more that are used as error codes for file access (just making stuff up here): public class TaskStates { public static const SUCCESS:String = "success"; public static const FAILURE:String = "failure"; public static const RUNNING:String = "running"; } public class FileErrors { public static const FILE_NOT_FOUND:String = "filenotfound"; public static const INVALID_FORMAT:String = "invalidformat"; public static const READ_ONLY:String = "readonly"; } I find this makes it easier to document what the expected values are for something. Instead of saying "Returns either SUCCESS, FAILURE, RUNNING, ...", you can just say "Returns one of the TaskState.* values). You could put all these in a single package for constants, or you could have the constant classes live in the same package as the classes that use them.
