How to implement a status bar in an ASP.NET application?

I have a simple ASP.NET application which has one master page called MasterPage.master. In MasterPage.master I have a Label called lblStatus . I want to update the text of this label when certain events happen in the website and always display the latest status no matter which web page I am on in the site. This is what I'm thinking of doing, but I'm unsure if this is the most elegant: Create a new class file with the code to update session state Session["status"] Call a method in this new class file to update Session state whenever something happens In the PageLoad event of the MasterPage.master page, update the lblStatus.Text with Session["status"] Questions Should I use a Literal instead of a Label ? Would it be better to do it another way? Thanks, here's my code so far in MasterPage.master: public string StatusText { get { return ltlStatus.Text; } set { ltlStatus.Text = value; } } MooDB - I'm unsure of the next bit. Do I need to copy this code onto every page in my site:? private void ChangeStatus(string newStatus) { ((SiteMaster)this.Master).StatusText = newStatus; } Sorry I'm new to ASP.NET and I'm not sure what to do. What is SiteMaster?
