Logistic Regression predict_proba keeps on increasing when I increase the value of the most predictive feature

I am applying logistic regression to predict a target variable ( success or no-success).I added some new features, tested my AUC.My AUC initially was 0.6, and it increased to 0.7 when I added polynomial features (degree=2). I was building an app to test my model and calculated the probability of success ( using predict_prob_).But when I was building the app, I realized that when I increase the values of the most predictive feature in the model, the probability of success continues to increase.There seems to be no plateau ( meaning the probability doesn't remain constant after a the predictive feature crosses a certain threshold). Is this expected? I cannot seem to solve this problem.I assumed the adding polynomial features would help reach a plateau.Any advice? or am I understanding the concept wrong?
