Selecting most realistic C and g params after gridsearch

I just ran an extended SVC gridsearch in libsvm on about 9000 multi-dimensional vectors representing a time series. Here are the highest scoring results: [local] 3 -7 72.4729 (best c=0.5, g=0.5, rate=76.9618) .. [local] -1 -5 71.79 (best c=8.0, g=0.5, rate=77.4432) .. [local] 15 -11 73.0326 (best c=2048.0, g=0.03125, rate=77.5887) .. [local] -5 -3 66.0249 (best c=32768.0, g=0.03125, rate=77.723) .. [local] 7 -3 77.9245 (best c=128.0, g=0.125, rate=77.9245) Here's the contour of the cross validation accuracy: Given the above I'm very tempted to settle on either a C value of 0.5 or 8.0 - anything above 100 seems heavily over fitted to me. Especially given the rather minuscule success rate differences. Any thoughts, insights, or pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
