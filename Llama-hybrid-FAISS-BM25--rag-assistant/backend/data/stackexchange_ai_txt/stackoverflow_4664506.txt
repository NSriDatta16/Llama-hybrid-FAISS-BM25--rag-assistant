UISlider events

I'm using an UISlider, its updated automatically except the user is touching the sliderbutton. therefore i did this in the function which updates automatically by an NSTimer: if (!isSliderTouched) { [progressSlider setValue: progressValue]; } How do I track the ending of this event, when the user releases his finger. I want to set isSliderTouched as long as the user interacts with this control. EDIT : this should be the plot: user beginns draging/touching UISlider => isSliderTouched = YES user releases/untouch the UISlider => isSliderTouched = NO Solution : UIControlEventTouchDown UIControlEventTouchUpInside [progressSlider addTarget:self action:@selector(sliderMoveStart) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown]; cheers endo
