What is this approximation called?

In Bayesian statistics, you have a likelihood and a prior, $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n \mid \theta)$ and $\pi(\theta)$ respectively, and you use these to obtain the posterior $\pi(\theta \mid x_1, \ldots, x_n) \propto f(x_1,\ldots,x_n \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)$. Occasionally there are situations where a) the data arrive very quickly, and b) using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to simulate from the posterior is difficult/slow. It seems the only option is to use an "outdated" posterior. Say you were interested in the posterior predictive distribution's mean, and you have data up to time $n$. However, the last time you finshed an MCMC sampling was at time $m What is this approximation called? What are some references where people address the issue of quantifying the error in this approximation?
