In Machine Learning terminology, data often has more dimensions than is typically described e.g. 2d image data is normally actually 3d, with dimensions: $w$ the width of the image $h$ the height of the image $k$ (of size $3$ ) the RGB channels of the image (in a greyscale image $|k|=1$ ). When describing $1\times1$ convolutional layers, this usually implicitly means $1\times1\times k$ , where $k$ is the number of channels - i.e. the filter reduces dimensionality across channels (e.g. averaging the value across the three separate RGB channels).
