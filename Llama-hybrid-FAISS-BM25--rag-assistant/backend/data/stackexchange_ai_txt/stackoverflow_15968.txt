The memory windows, very useful if you're doing low level stuff. Control + K , Control + F - Format selection - great for quickly making code neat Regions, some love them, some hate them, most don't even know they exist Changing variables in debug windows during execution Tracepoints Conditional break points Hold down Alt and drag for 'rectangular' selection.
