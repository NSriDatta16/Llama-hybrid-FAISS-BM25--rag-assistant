Can I use ANOVA if a sample is not normally distributed

My data are not normally distributed. I have to compare three groups for their achievement in skill learning. $n=4$ in each group. I have used three methods ($M1$, $M2$ and $M3$) to teach one skill to developmentally delayed children. Can I still use ANOVA? Do I have to use repeated measures of ANOVA or a time series? Please throw some light
