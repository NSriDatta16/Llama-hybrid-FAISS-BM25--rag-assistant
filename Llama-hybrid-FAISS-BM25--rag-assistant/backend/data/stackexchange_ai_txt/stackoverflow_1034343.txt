iPhone OS3 changes to UIScrollView subclasses

I have a subclass of UIScrollView that overrides touchesBegan:withEvent: touchesMoved:withEvent: touchesEnded:withEvent: Overriding these three seems to be a technique that is widely used (based on my observations in forums). However, as soon as I compiled this code on OS3, these methods are no longer being called. Has anyone else seen this problem? Is there a known fix that doesn't use undocumented methods? My first attempt at a solution was to move all the touchesBegan/Moved/Ended methods down into my content view and set delaysContentTouches = NO; canCancelContentTouches = NO; This worked partially, but left me unable to pan when I have zoomed. My second attempt only set canCancelContentTouches = NO when there were two touches (thus passing the pinch gesture through to the content). This method was sketchy and didn't work very well. Any ideas? My requirement is that the scroll view must handle the pan touches, and I must handle the zoom touches.
