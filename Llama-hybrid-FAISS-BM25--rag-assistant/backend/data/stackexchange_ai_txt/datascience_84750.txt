I would highly suggest doing some deeper Analysis on why the ("-") class is beeing predicted. Meaning what do you predict for class ("-") when no the correct class. Analysing this you could see that you are ordering class ("-") as class "++". Than you can look at the Input data and feature engineer Features that discriminate between These two class. Forcing you model to do this indirectly is a fair try, but model cant learn whats not to be found in the data. With feature Engineering you can enhance the data so that discrimination is better.
