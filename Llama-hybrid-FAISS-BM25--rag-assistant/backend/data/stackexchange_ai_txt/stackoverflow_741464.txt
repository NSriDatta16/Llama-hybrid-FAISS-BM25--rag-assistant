The main problem is that your header files include each other in a circular manner. A includes K which includes J which includes B which then includes A again... You should never require a situation where this happens. You should go back to the design drawing board and either cut some of the dependencies, or reorganize your classes entirely so that this circular dependency doesn't happen.
