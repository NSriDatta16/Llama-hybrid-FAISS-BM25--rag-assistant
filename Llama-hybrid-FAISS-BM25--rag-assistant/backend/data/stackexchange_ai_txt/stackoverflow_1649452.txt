lalr(1) action table algorithm

Could someone describe the algorithm to generate the needed tables (action, goto) from a given grammar for LALR(1)? I have already read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser Edit Finally I found out some interesting related pages in the dragon book, but whoever wants, can answer the question.
