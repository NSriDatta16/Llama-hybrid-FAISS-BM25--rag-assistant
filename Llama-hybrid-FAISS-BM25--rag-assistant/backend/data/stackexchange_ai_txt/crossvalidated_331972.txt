Significance of relationship between sex and bachelor's degree or higher (2017 U.S. labor force, ages 25 and up) (disparity, difference)

Reports and webpages like the following prompted this question: " Women Now at the Head of the Class, Lead Men in College Attainment " by Kurt Bauman and Camille Ryan, October 7, 2015, United States Census Blog Random Samplings . (This is not homework.) Within the context of annualized 2017 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm), and within the U.S. civilian labor force of age 25 and over: Was there a relationship of practical or statistical significance or both between sex and having a bachelor's degree or higher? Why or why not? The two variables -- sex and having a bachelor's degree or higher -- are both naturally dichotomous variables in the B.L.S. estimates. As per those estimates, a person is either a man or a woman, and either has a bachelor's degree or higher or does not. Table 1, below, contains the B.L.S. estimates 1 in a two-way two-by-two contingency frequency distribution table with extra rows and extra columns for displaying related numbers. (The last numbered note below contains this question's table data in CSV format to make it easier for you to load it into a spreadsheet or other program.) As can be seen, 39.69991% of the total population had a bachelor's degree or higher, but fewer than that percentage of men had a bachelor's degree or higher, and more than that percentage of women had a bachelor's degree or higher. Accordingly, there was a disparity between the percent or rate of women who could have passed a test for having a bachelor's degree and the percent or rate of men who could have passed that test. Table 1: Numbers from and derived from 2017 B.L.S. C.P.S. |Civilian |Bachelor's | | Expected | Difference | | labor force | degree | % | number at | from | | age >= 25 | or higher | (rate) | 39.69991% | expected | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Men | 74,258,000| 27,781,000| 37.41146%| 29,480,360| -1,699,360| ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Women | 64,901,000| 27,465,000| 42.31830%| 25,765,639| +1,699,360| ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Together | 139,159,000| 55,246,000| 39.69991%| [n/a] | [n/a] | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Disparity| [n/a] | [n/a] | 88.40492%| [n/a] | [n/a] | in rates | | | | | | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| As can be seen in Table 1, the disparity in the rates by sex was 88.40492%. For every 100 women who had such a degree there were about 88 men who had a degree. The total disparity as a whole number was 3,398,720. The Table 1 estimates may be entered into one of the many online chi-square calculators to get the result p-value . Again, however, those B.L.S. estimates are just that: estimates . Additional insight into the apparent disparity may be gained by examining the ranges within which the B.L.S. has a degree of confidence that the actual numbers are. The B.L.S. has provided instructions on how to determine the 95% level of confidence intervals for the estimates. 2 At the 95% level of confidence, the low end and high end numbers are as follows: Table 2: B.L.S. low and high end numbers with 95% level of confidence intervals. |Civilian |Civilian |Bachelor's |Bachelor's | | labor force | labor force | degree | degree | | age >= 25 | age >= 25 | or higher | or higher | | LOW END | HIGH END | LOW END | HIGH END | ---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------| Men | 73,635,096| 74,880,904| 27,172,805| 28,389,195| ---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------| Women | 64,285,841| 65,516,159| 26,857,979| 28,072,021| ---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------| The disparity in the by-sex rates of attaining a bachelor's degree or higher can be lessened and narrowed by using those edge-case numbers as follows: For men, use the low-end labor force number and the high-end bachelor's degree or higher number. For women, the opposite: Use the high-end labor force number and the low-end bachelor's degree or higher number. Those numbers may be tabulated as follows: Table 3: Table 1 but starting with edge-case least-disparate numbers based on the 95% level of confidence intervals. |Civilian |Bachelor's | | Expected | Difference | | labor force | degree | % | number at | from | | age >= 25 | or higher | (rate) | 39.70296% | expected | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Men | 73,635,096| 28,389,195| 38.55389%| 29,235,316| -846,121| ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Women | 65,516,159| 26,857,979| 40.99443%| 26,011,858| +846,121| ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Together | 139,151,255| 55,247,174| 39.70296%| [n/a] | [n/a] | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Disparity| [n/a] | [n/a] | 94.04665%| [n/a] | [n/a] | in rates | | | | | | ---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------| Accordingly, the disparity -- when using the edge-case least-disparate case numbers -- in the by-sex rates of having a bachelor's degree or higher in the civilian labor force age 25 and over in 2017 was 94.04665%. The total disparity as a whole number was 1,696,244. Even though Table 3 is based on edge-case least-disparate numbers, the numbers still lead to the result p-value . Disparities in relationships like the disparity being examined have commonly been found to be statistically significant at p-value To get p-value To get p-value In other words, the disparity is perhaps 1,696,244 to 3,398,720 human individuals greater than the approximately 17,190 individuals it would need to be less than to attribute the disparity to chance. NOTES: The B.L.S. numbers are based on the B.L.S. 2017 "Current Population Survey" ("CPS") numbers in thousands here and here . For example, Table 1's "Civilian labor force age >= 25" numbers are based on the following simple addition: Men = ages 25 to 54 years (54,813,000) + ages 55 to 64 years (14,156,000) + ages 65 years and over (5,289,000) = 74,258,000 Women = ages 25 to 54 years (47,870,000) + ages 55 to 64 years (12,743,000) + ages 65 years and over (4,288,000) = 64,901,000 The data is also available with unweighted record counts from the U.S. Census Bureau's CPS Table Creator . From K. Kosanovich, B.L.S. Economist, 2018-03-06~16:59EST: * * * Information about the reliability of estimates from the CPS and how to construct approximate standard errors and confidence intervals is online at https://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability . * * * There are several ways to construct a confidence interval. For example, you can calculate one for the estimate of the number men in the civilian labor force ages 25 and over in 2017 (an annual average). I’ll briefly review one example using the guidance in the PDF file about calculating standard errors online at https://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability and the parameters and factors provided in the XLSX file at that link. * * * In 2017, for example, there were 27,781,000 men in the labor force with a bachelor’s degree and higher. I’ll choose parameters and factors in table PF-4 for an annual average number of people with a bachelor’s degree where a = -0.0001858, b = 12882.76, and f = 0.67. To calculate the standard error for an annual average level, the formula is se(x) = f * squareroot[ax2 + bx]. In this case, the standard error of 27,781,000 = 0.67 * squareroot [ (-0.0001858 * 27,781,000 * 27,781,000) + (12882.76 * 27,781,000) ] or 310,304. To create a 90-percent confidence interval, we multiply the standard error by 1.645, resulting in 510,450 or approximately plus or minus 510. We have a 90-percent confidence that the number of men in the labor force with a bachelor’s degree or more was 27,781,000 plus or minus approximately 510,000. You can construct confidence intervals for women with a bachelor’s degree or more using the same parameters and factors. For men or women in the labor force age 25 and over, you can use the parameters and factors for men and women 20 years and over from table PF-1.
