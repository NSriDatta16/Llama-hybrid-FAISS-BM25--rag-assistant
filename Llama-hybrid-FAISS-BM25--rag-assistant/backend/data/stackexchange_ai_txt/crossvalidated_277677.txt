Am I correct for cross-validation or validation set in libSVM?

I used libSVM in MATLAB to find whether there is some relationship between the features and label. My steps are: Divide the dataset in 60% for training, 20% for testing and 20% for validation. I used the 60% and 20%(validation) as the input of SVMTrain. And I added a '- v' parameter in options. I retained the 80% above with SVMTrain and the parameter I got from step2. I used the model from step3 to predict the remaining 20% and get the accuracy. Repeat the 4 steps above until all the 20%s are tested and you got 5 accuracies. My Questions are: My comprehension of cross-validation is to avoid overfitting and find the best parameter for the best model on the whole dataset. Are my steps correct or not? What is the output of SVMtrain with the parameter '- v'? What is the difference between validation set and cross-validation? Thanks a lot!
