I think that the solution boils down into what you consider to be "stable across time". Is a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 5 more stable than one with 10 mean and 5 standard deviation? Or would it if the mean for different participants would correspond to the actual order of the means of the underlying distributions? I would try to calculate the average change in one step, and normalize that with the total standard deviation of the measurements. $\frac{\sum_\text{p} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (x_{p, i}-x_{p, i+1})}{\text{STDEV}(X)}$ where $x_{p, i}$ is the measurement for participant $p$ on day $i$. I think that the key is to find a right metric to normalize the results with, which should correspond to what kind of stability you are looking for.
