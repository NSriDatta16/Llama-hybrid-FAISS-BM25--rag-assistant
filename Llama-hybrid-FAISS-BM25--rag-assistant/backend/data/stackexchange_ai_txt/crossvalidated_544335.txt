Michael Betancourt writes a little about this in this paper. Here is an excerpt of his paper: This assumption implies that the variation in the integrand is dominated by the target density, and hence we should consider the neighborhood around the mode where the density is maximized. This intuition is consistent with the many statistical methods that utilize the mode, such as maximum likelihood estimators and Laplace approximations, although conflicts with our desire to avoid the specific details of the target density. Indeed, this intuition is fatally naive as it misses a critical detail. Expectation values are given by accumulating the integrand over a volume of parameter space and, while the density is largest around the mode, there is not much volume there. To identify the regions of parameter space that dominate expectations we need to consider the behavior of both the density and the volume. In high-dimensional spaces the volume behaves very differently from the density, resulting in a tension that concentrates the significant regions of parameter space away from either extreme In that paper, Betancourt motivates the use of expectations with respect to some target distribution as the real quantities of interest in Bayesian stats. Because expectations are functions not only of probability density but of volume as well, focusing solely on the mode of a target distribution is to focus on a region with high density and small volume. Betancourt goes on to say that we need to focus on regions of parameter space where the product of density and volume is high. This is referred to as the typical set . Additionally, I wrote a paper in 2020 comparing HMC (which is slow to sample for large problems) with MAP (which is faster). Though MAP and HMC have similar point predictions, the normal approximation used by MAP greatly overstates uncertainty. In applications where we need to make decisions about what to do, this uncertainty can greatly effect our decision quality, as we demonstrate via simulation.
