How many lags should I include in time series prediction?

I'm wondering: how do I select the number of previous time steps to use to predict the current one? I'm just plotting the autocorrelation plot and picking previous time steps that have statistically significant correlation with the present. Is this a proper way of doing this? I'm basically just wondering how many time steps should I include.
