I would strongly suggest against relying on user-agent strings in any kind of JS app. You will get nothing but problems. Browsers have new versions, some change spoof the user-agent string etc. A good example was that various sites broke when Opera 10 was released, because they were sniffing the user agent string and read 10 as 1. Instead, you should use feature detection - test if the browser supports what you're trying to do. There is really no good reason to sniff the user agent string, other than collecting usage statistics.
