I need more description to answer more accurately. My answer is based on my understanding of your question. I hope it helps you. In your problem, you can not use conventional neural networks because your data are not a matrix. You have some features and you normalize the features. Then, you can use MLP (a type of neural network). if you want to change features to vectors, it depends on the data type of values for each feature. It depends on many things for converting values to vectors. If values are numbers, you just need to keep values in the same range like [0,1]. If data are True/False, just convert them to 0 and 1. The machine learning algorithms can find hidden info among features and solve your problem (in most cases). If the feature values are not the same (different data types), you must use different methods. We have different encodings for string or categorical data and conversion to numerical values/vectors. Some encodings are one-hot, target, label, and binary encodings. If the data is small, you can use some traditional ML methods like SVM, XGBoost, Decision Trees and so on. This is based on my experience. There might be other methods and I am not aware of them. So do more research.
