Don't. This is 2001 thinking. The only object "pool" that is still worth anything now a days is a singleton. I use singletons only to reduce the object creation for purposes of profiling (so I can see more clearly what is impacting the code). Anything else you are just fragmenting memory for no good purpose. Go ahead and run a profile on creating a 1,000,000 objects. It is insignificant. Old article here.
