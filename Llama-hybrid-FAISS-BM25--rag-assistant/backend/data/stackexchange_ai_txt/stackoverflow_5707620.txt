I wonder if this is what you're looking for: http://code.google.com/p/geckofx/ Or this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Roll_your_own_browser_-_An_embedding_HowTo Or even a similar question here on SO: Is it possible to Embed Gecko or Webkit in a Windows Form just like a WebView? Having said all that, I would suggest upgrading from VB6 -- My guess is that you won't find anything that will work with VB6: pretty much anything that's been written in the last five (even ten?) years is going to need .NET or other libraries that VB6 won't be able to deal with.
