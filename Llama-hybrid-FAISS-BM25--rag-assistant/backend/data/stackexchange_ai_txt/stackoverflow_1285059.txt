The Stopwatch class offers high-precision timing in .NET. It is capable of measuring time with sensitivity of around 100s of nanoseconds (fractions of milliseconds). To get the exact resolution, read the value of Stopwatch.Frequency . var timer = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew(); // Run code here. var elapsed = timer.ElapsedMilliseconds. Also, be sure to run your code repeatedly (as many times as is feasible) to get a better average time, as well as to reduce the effects of fluctuations in CPU load.
