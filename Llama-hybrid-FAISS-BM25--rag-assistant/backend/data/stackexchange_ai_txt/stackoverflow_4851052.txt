The short answer is: don't pass the credentials at all. That approach is insecure. Instead you should be looking to leverage the secure mechanism provided by the OS for achieving what you are wanting to do. It is called SSPI (Security Support Provider Interface). Using this the processes exchange a series of tokens generated by an OS-level security provider, to set up a security context without the need for passing credentials in user mode code. If you were able to upgrade your service to use .NET 3.5, you could use WCF to do the IPC, and, appropriately configured, it would take care of the details of the SSPI handshake, and enable impersonation straightforwardly. If you are stuck with .NET 1.1, then take a look at the articles and sample code provided here and here , which show how to invoke SSPI from managed code and use it to secure a .NET remoting channel.
