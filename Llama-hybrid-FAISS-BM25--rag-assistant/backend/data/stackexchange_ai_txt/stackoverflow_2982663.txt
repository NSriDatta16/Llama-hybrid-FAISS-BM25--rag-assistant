Yes, it would require several conditions: Both Erlang & PHP should rely on identifying sessions or HTTP with a cookie name, exchanged over the same domain (or wildcard-domain). The should both be able to read the format in which the session is stored (json comes to mind, or peb_connect() in php ) You should only store 'simple' structures in the session, which both can understand (arrays, hashmaps,, strings, integers, anonymous objects would be pushing it a bit) They should use a locking mechanism for read/writes that both can use (otherwise you have the chance new values are overwritten with stale data) For PHP this means you should write your own handler for a session (see http://nl2.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php ), as far as I gather Erlang can use the same thing (well, the Erlang implementation is up to you). The Erlang / PHP bridge may be used, but strictly speaking it is not necessary, it could save some work though. Also of note: http://code.google.com/p/mypeb/wiki/ErlangAsSessionStorageForPHP
