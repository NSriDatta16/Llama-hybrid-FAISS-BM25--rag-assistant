How can I store a video with proper indexing

How can I store a video (either in database or file system) so that instead of starting streaming from starting I can start this streaming from any fix index. Main aim is like I have a large video of roads of New York from one end to other and corresponding map of New York save on a central server. Now a user opens up the website and selects the two points on the map of New York and video of road between those two points starts streaming, not from starting but from first point to second point given by user. So main requirement is to store a video with its indexes such that I can start streaming from any of the index. Edited Part : Actually I am planning how to store video of complete city so I can show it to user whenever he selects it on map. So Now Main question in my mind is can I merge video for all roads in one video like various linked lists (Roads). Like if there are two turns at particular point then instead of storing two videos from that point for different path can I store them in a single video such that which video you have to play will depend upon starting and ending point selected by user and shortest path between those two points, But can I store video of all roads as a single video. How can I do this, will it depend on stream mechanism or on storage ? Thanks, GG
