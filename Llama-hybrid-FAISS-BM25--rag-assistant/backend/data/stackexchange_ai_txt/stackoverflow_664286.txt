Have a look at this example: http://www.codeplex.com/TheBeerHouse , which was developed as the example for this book: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764584642 It's .net 2.0 and not perfect, but it's a great example of an n-tier application that makes good use of the provider model. We've adapted the pattern and use if for 90% of our in-house development. Make sure you don't confuse this pattern with the MVC pattern, as they are quite different. Have a look at the wikipedia article on n-tier architecture: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture . The presentation tier is implemented as pages and user controls in the example I have given, the logic tier (commonly called BLL or business logic layer) is concrete C# classes defining specific behaviour, and the data tier (commonly called DAL or data access layer) is abstract C# classes defining the storage mechanism with concrete C# classes for using Sql Server as the storage medium. Hope this helps.
