I have used log4net and log4J directly in domain objects. This has good side effects and bad ones. + : Logging in the domain object is simple and straightforward to code and you know you can take advantage of log4net features. -- : It means the program making use of the domain objects needs to pay attention to log4net configuration, which may or may not be a problem -- : You cannot link your domain object to a different log4net version than the calling program is using. I've seen a lot of conflicts with one item linked against log4net 1.2.0.10 and another linked against an earlier release. Not logging in your domain object is a bad idea. The alternative is as others have suggested, dependency injection or an external framework (such as commons-logging for log4J) that allows plugging different logging frameworks or creating an interface that does the logging and logging against that interface. (The code using your domain object would need to then supply an appropriate instance of that interface for logging purposes.)
