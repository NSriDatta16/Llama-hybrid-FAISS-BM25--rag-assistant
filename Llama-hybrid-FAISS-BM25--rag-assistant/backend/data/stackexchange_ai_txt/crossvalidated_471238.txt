Are there good methods to increase the weight of prior distribution in parameter estimation using Bayesian method

say, I have a prior distribution of parameter $\pi(\theta)$ Then, given observation $x_1,x_2,...x_n=x$ , we have $\pi(\theta \mid x) \propto f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)$ , which is then used for various of forecasting. Let's say, I don't trust the data and would prefer to rely more on the prior distribution, are there ways to do so? For example, one proposed method by me is to modify $\pi(\theta \mid x) = f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)^a$ for some constant $a$ . However, I am not sure if this is a rigorous way. Are there good ways to achieve what I want?
