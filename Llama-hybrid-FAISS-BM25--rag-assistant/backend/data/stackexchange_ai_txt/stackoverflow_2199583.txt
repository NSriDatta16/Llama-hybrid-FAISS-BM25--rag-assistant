Run SQL Profiler on your database for a while to see if the "slowness" is due to any problem queries. Then you can analyize these queries in order to run any indexes or statistics to increase performance. As the comment suggests though, auto shrink can result in a very fragmented database. The database will generally grow as it needs to and its usually best not to worry about how big it wants to be. As long as you perform regular transaction log backups then you're better off letting it grow. You might need to ask yourself is performance is more important than having to buy new.more disks. You can also run some maintenance plans against the database to rebuild the indexes and statistics. This might sort things out in the short term.
