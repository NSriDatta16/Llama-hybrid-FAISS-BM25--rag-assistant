Can you clarify what you mean? S3 is a file storage system only - that's it. You put files in there and pull them out with a URL. S3 cannot fetch files from your site (although I am not sure what you mean by that). Do you want to provide access to your S3 files via your site? You can access them using a simple url: For publicly visible files they are in the format: http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket]/[key] However, you can make your content private so it is not reachable by the standard url and only via a signed, expiring url .
