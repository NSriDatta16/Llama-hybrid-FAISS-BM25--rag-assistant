the to redirect stderr to stdout append this at your command: 2>&1 For outputting to terminal and logging into file you should use tee Both together would look like this: mycommand 2>&1 | tee mylogfile.log EDIT: For embedding into your script you would do the same. So your script #!/bin/sh whatever1 whatever2 ... whatever3 would end up as #!/bin/sh ( whatever1 whatever2 ... whatever3 ) 2>&1 | tee mylogfile.log
