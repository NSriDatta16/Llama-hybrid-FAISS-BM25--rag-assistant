How may I evaluate my self study of Machine Learning?

I am trying to learn Machine Learning on my own. To do this, I try to read from textbooks, good web-based materials like Stanford or Caltech. I try to work out my exercises, and try to discuss my understanding with seniors and peers. Things are more or less going fine, but sometimes I feel the need to cross check some of the concepts I learned. I write can write a synopsis, but sending a synopsis to a room / forum like this feels slightly awkward. Can anybody suggest how may I do that?
