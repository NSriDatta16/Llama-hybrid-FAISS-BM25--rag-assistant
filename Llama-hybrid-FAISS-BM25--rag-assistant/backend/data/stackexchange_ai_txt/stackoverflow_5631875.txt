CouchDB is fine. You might have some alternatives with Unix tools. The simplest key/value database is files in a filesystem. They work great. If you only need key/value storage with basic replication, then rsync can do that. If your conflict resolution policy is, for example, always take the latest timestamped data, then you might get away with rsync. First of all, you're probably running Unix/Linux. SSH and rsync will be included, unlike CouchDB. Another advantage of rsync (actually its SSH tunnel) is of course identification, authentication, and authorization. Your device is presumably Unix/Linux, and there are a million ways to wire up Unix authorization. It's not a guarantee but nearly anything is doable: password files, NIS, LDAP, Kerberos, Samba/Active Directory. The list goes on. With Couch you will have to figure out some kind of user management system. Will you use oauth? Will you have to write an authentication plugin? Will you also replicate the _users database around? What about conflicts in the _users database? Do you instead have a central _users database? How can you have a central users database if you can't have a central data database? Couch, like MySQL, is a full-blown server. It will maintenance load that rsync won't. Remember to compact your databases, compact your views, and run view cleanup Remember to rotate the log files Possibly back up your .couch files and your .ini config In other words, can you do a quick and dirty rsync hack, or do you need the full Couch package? CouchDB is a uniform, consistent platform regardless of OS. That can be good or bad. Not knowing your specifics, I would guess that rsync over SSH is the best short-term, but Couch is the best long-term. (But with so many software projects, long-term never seems to arrive.)
