Bayesian multivariate regression

I am trying to solve the below multivariate regression problem by building a fully Bayesian model- \begin{align*} \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{E} \end{align*} where $\mathbf{Y} \in R^{n\times p}$ is dependent variable, $\mathbf{X} \in R^{n \times s}$ is the predictor, $\mathbf{B} \in R^{s \times p}$ stores the regression coefficients and $\mathbf{E}$ is the error term. I can use a multivariate normal distribution for $\mathbf{E}$ with mean $\mathbf{X}\mathbf{B}$ and covariance $\Sigma$ , but I am not sure how to model $\mathbf{B}$ . Should I use a matrix normal or multivariate normal distribution? I think matrix normal distribution will be informative but would that be overkill for the problem? This is a standard problem but I am not able to get the solution for it exactly.
