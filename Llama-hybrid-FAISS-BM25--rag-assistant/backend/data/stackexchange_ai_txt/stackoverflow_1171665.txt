The big difference that you need to be aware of is the licencing. To use MOSS over the internet will require an Internet licence. The actual cost depends on what deal you have with MS, but it is a significant cost. We have found that it is more costly to develop for Sharepoint than ASP.net pages. Especially due to requirements for the development environment and deployment problems. From a performance perspective it depends on how you program it. With ASP.net you have more control and therefore, should be able to get better performance. Do not use MOSS unless you are leveraging the functionality that MOSS provides.
