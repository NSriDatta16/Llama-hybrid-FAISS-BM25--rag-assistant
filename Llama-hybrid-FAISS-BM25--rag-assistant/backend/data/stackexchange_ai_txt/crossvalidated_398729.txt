Averaging Meta-Analytic Correlations?

I am conducting meta-analytic SEM and interested in looking at one outcome. A previous meta I was going to use as part of my data reports meta-analytic correlations for this outcome, however it is pulled into two sub-categories. It is more common in recent literature to report one outcome. Can I just take an average of these two meta-analytic correlations or do I need to use a different approach in combining? Thank you for your help.
