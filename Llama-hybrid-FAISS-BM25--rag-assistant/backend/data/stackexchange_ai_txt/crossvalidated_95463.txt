I think you should aggregate. If the price is assigned to an entity, then the flow variation within entities will not matter. Aggregating makes sense particularly if the price is reviewed periodically. In that case, the price might reflect some aggregate measure of flow (for example, if the average flow has been high they pay more, or they pay by maximum flow, etc). I do not think your disaggregated set up is right because the dependent variable does not vary within certain groups of observations. That is, if left disaggregated, there are some extreme dependencies in price within entity groups.
