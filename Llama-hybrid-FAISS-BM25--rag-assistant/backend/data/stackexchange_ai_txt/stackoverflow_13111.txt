Increasingly I think not. The kind of large rigid organisation currently still clinging to 1.1 (probably because they're only just upgraded to it) is also the kind that's highly unlikely to look at open source solutions. If I were starting a new ASP.Net project right now I'd stick with .Net 3.5 and probably the new MVC previews.
