Capturing seasonality in multiple regression for daily data

I have a daily sales data for a product which is highly seasonal. I want to capture the seasonality in the regression model. I have read that if you have quarterly or monthly data, in that case you can create 3 and 11 dummy variables respectively â€” but can I deal deal with daily data? I have three years of daily data. The independent variables are price point, promotional flag (yes/no), and temperature. The dependent variable is sales of that product. I am not looking for a time series model as I am using a multiple regression model.
