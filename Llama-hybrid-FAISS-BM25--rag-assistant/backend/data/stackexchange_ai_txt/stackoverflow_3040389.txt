Keep in mind that Clojure is running on top of a JVM. So you may have 10,000 Java threads, but that doesn't equate to 10,000 OS processes. I suspect that the garbage collector could end up being your bottleneck, so I would focus on tuning the footprints of each agent. (It goes without saying that you should test and verify this before tuning.)
