ldpi, mdpi, and hdpi correspond to density "classes", not the actual density of the device. For instance the G1 is a mdpi class device (160dpi) but its screen density is actually around 180dpi. The droid is a hdpi class device (240dpi) but its screen is 265dpi. Bitmap scaling is based on the density class only. The actual screen density is ignored. So a G1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screen, but this is a very small difference so it's not a big deal. (Note that other dimension types, such as "in" and "mm", do take into account the screen density.) So for densities you have 3 choices: ldpi (120), mdpi (160) and hdpi (240). Therefore, your 100x100 bitmap should be 75x75, 100x100, and 150x150 respectively. For more info see: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#qualifiers
