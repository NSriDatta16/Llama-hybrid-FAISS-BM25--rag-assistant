First, if your research question is about comparing two groups, why are you including a third group (controls) at all? Second, why don't you use a method specifically designed for comparing multiple groups? There are matching and weighting methods specifically designed for such comparisons. The key to using them and ensuring validity of the comparisons is to ensure they target a meaningful population and that each comparison targets the same population. For example, with matching, if you select the control groups as the focal group and find merit-based students similar to the controls and need-based students similar to the controls, you would be estimating the average treatment effect on the controls, i.e., the effects of receiving a scholarship for those that didn't. Treated each scholarship group as focal and doing two separate matches (finding controls similar to the merit-based and, separately, finding controls similar to need-based) would yield matched samples that correspond to different target populations and therefore would be incomparable to each other (i.e., any difference you could be due to the composition of the samples, not the type of scholarship. Finally, you would need to restrict your target population a lot to ensure overlap is met; need-based and merit-based students will likely look extremely different from each other; it is unlikely you will find a student who could have gone one way or another, and if you do find such a student, they will be a very unusual type of student and the effect might not generalize to other students.
