XGBoost Architecture Diagram required

Good Day! My topic is general and theory related, about XGBoost working. I am searching XGBoost Architecture Diagram. I know it works on principles of Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, Gradient Boosting but to sum up all I need a visual representation of these for XGBoost. There I may be able to show weights assigned. Hope I am able to deliver my query. Can any body highlight any resource or share the material? I tried searching on Internet but in vain. I couldnâ€™t find XGBoost Architecture Diagram as per theory. Please share. Many Thanks.
