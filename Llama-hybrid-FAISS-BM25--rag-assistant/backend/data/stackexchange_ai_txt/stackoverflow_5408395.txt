PHP - stripout header

I've made a proxy system with CURL. I do need to access the header, but I also want to be able to separate the header from the content. All was working fine until I ran into that response: HTTP/1.1 100 Continue HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 23 Mar 2011 15:36:57 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.16 (Ubuntu) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3-1ubuntu9.3 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Gestion des actualit√©es I try to separate the header from the content using: strpos($httpResponse, "\r\n\r\n"); But the problem is that this will cut the header right after the "100 Continue". Note that I don't create the header, it's a default behavior of Apache... Do you have a good way to separate the header from the content ?
