take the case of two perfectly correlated independent variables, x1 and x2 then the corresponding coefficients w1, w2 can go to +/- infty (by adjusting the other appropriately), and we have an infinite number of solutions. adding L2 regularisation, means that of all these solutions (with same mean square error), there is a best solution - namely the one with smallest l2 norm. assuming we normalise the variables, this will have w1=w2, ie we take the average x1 and x2.
