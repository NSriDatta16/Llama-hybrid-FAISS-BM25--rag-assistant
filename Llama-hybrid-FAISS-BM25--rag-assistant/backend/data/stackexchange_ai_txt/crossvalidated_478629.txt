Order and interpretation of Gaussian Mixture Model with strong overlap between components

Most examples for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) employ datasets with fairly obvious underlying structure (well-separated clusters). How should one determine the order of a GMM (and interpret the result) when components overlap strongly? For example, consider a dataset where the true data-generating process is 4 bivariate normal distributions. Working in R: #generate data as a mixture of four bivariate Guassians library(MASS) set.seed(123) reds Here is a plot of the data we observe: Now we want to fit a GMM to this. We will use the {mclust} package ( Scrucca et al., 2016 ), which has by default using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select both the model (i.e. various constraints on volume, shape, and orientation of the component Gaussians) and the order of the model (the number of components. The package also implements the Integrated Complete Likelihood (ICL) criterion, and bootstrap-based Likelihood Ratio Tests to select model order. Let's run them! library(mclust) #assess candidate models... #...via BIC criterion BIC Here are the results: > summary(BIC) Best BIC values: VVE,3 VVV,3 VEE,3 BIC -20693.33 -20704.26965 -20711.07961 BIC diff 0.00 -10.94192 -17.75188 > summary(ICL) Best ICL values: VVV,2 VVE,2 VEV,2 ICL -21621.86 -2.162203e+04 -21779.9036 ICL diff 0.00 -1.667867e-01 -158.0386 > LRT ------------------------------------------------------------- Bootstrap sequential LRT for the number of mixture components ------------------------------------------------------------- Model = VVE Replications = 999 LRTS bootstrap p-value 1 vs 2 3242.884063 0.001 2 vs 3 158.729763 0.001 3 vs 4 2.290044 0.490 These answers aren't the same. BIC indicates 3 components and a VVE model (ellipsoidal Gaussians with variable volume and shape but equal orientation), while ICL indicates 2 components and a VVV mdodel (orientation can vary too). The LRT test with a VVE model indicates 3 components. Assuming we don't know the data-generating process, what is the correct order of this model?
