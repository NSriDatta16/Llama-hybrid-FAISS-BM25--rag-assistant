I'm not sure if I completely understand your question. Are you asking for the difference between the code generated for 'short history[1000]', and 'short history1, history2, ..., history1000;'? Both should use similar amounts of RAM: each entry is going to take be stored in a single file register (assuming you're using a 16-bit PIC). The code to calculate the average of the latter is going to be ugly though, and will likely take quite a bit of ROM, as it is going to need to reference each value separately (rather than just offsetting the base). Edit: The reason for the 256 element limit is because of file register paging on the PIC. You can't address a larger array by just offsetting the base register, because you may need to request a page change. Do you absolutely have to calculate a running average? Or can you do an overall average? If an overall average is okay, then use a variant of Alphaneo's answer: just keep the sum, and the number of values collected in two variables, and divide any time you need the average.
