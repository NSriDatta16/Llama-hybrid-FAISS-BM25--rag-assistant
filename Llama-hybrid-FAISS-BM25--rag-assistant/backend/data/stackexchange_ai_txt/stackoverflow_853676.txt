How to avoid this? select count(distinct Status) from [MyTable] with (NOLOCK) where MemberType=6 The error message I get is: Msg 121, Level 20, State 0, Line 0 A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - The semaphore timeout period has expired.)
