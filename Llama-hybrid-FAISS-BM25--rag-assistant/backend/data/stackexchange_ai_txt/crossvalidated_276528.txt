Look at page 21-22 here . The construction is for Markov chains, but I think essentially, the assumption is only of weak dependence. My answer here is also useful. Here I present the gist of it: Say $\{X_t\}_{t\geq 1}$ is a $p$-multivariate process with weak dependence. Here $X_t = (X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \dots, X^{(p)})^T$. Now suppose the random mean vector from $n$ "samples" is $$\theta_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n}X_t = (\theta_n^{(1)}, \theta_n^{(2)}, \dots, \theta_n^{(p)})^T\,.$$ If a central limit theorem for all components holds, then for $i = 1, \dots, p$, there exists $\sigma^2_i > 0$ such thatas $n \to \infty$, $$\sqrt{n} (\theta_n^{(i)} - \theta^{(i)}) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2_i)\,. $$ Here $\theta^{(i)}$ is the true mean for the $i$th component. Let $(t_1, t_2, \dots, t_p)$ be arbitrary vector of constants in $\mathbb{R}^p$. Then, $$\sum_{i=1}^{p} t_i \sqrt{n}(\theta_n^{(i)} - \theta^{(i)}) \overset{d}{\to} \sum_{i=1}^{p} t_i N(0, \sigma^2_i)$$ Then by the CramÃ©r Wold Theorem , there exists a $p\times p$ positive definite matrix $\Sigma$ such that as $n \to \infty$ $$\sqrt{n}(\theta_n - \theta) \overset{d}{\to} N_p(0, \Sigma) \,.$$ Here $\Sigma = \lim_{n\to \infty} Cov (\theta_n)$. For Markov chains this breaks down nicely and uses the assumption that $Cov(X_1,X_{1+k}) = Cov(X_{t}, X_{t+k})$ for all $t > 1$. This may not hold for all weakly dependent processes.
