Categorical variables in LASSO regression

I just built a logistic regression model via Lasso Penalization. Now I'm trying to interpret the coefficients. One is "days". I have a coefficient for "days". when I do a normal logistic regression with glm, I usually get 6 coefficients, lets say monday is my reference category, so i'll get coefficients for tuesday till sunday. but after I built my model with lasso, I only get one coefficient, which is "days". My question is now, how do I interpret the coefficient "days" in Lasso Regression?
