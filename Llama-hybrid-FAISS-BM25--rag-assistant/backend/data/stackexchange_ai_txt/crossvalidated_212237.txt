Weakly stationary time series questions

Say I have the following model: $y_t = 0.5y_{t−1} +x_t +v_{1t}$ , and $x_t = 0.5x_{t−1} +v_{2t}$ , where both $v_{1t}$ and $v_{2t}$ follow IID normal distribution ∼ (0,1). The following statements are either true or false... (i) The time series $y_t$ is weakly stationary. (ii) The unconditional variance of $y_t$ is larger than the conditional one-step ahead variance. (iii) The path of forecasts for $y_{t+i}$ conditional on the information available at time $t$ will be oscillatory but it will eventually converge to 0.1. (iv) If a sample of 1000 observations were simulated from this model for $y_t$ , then at least five values will be expected to be larger than 6. (v) The upper bound for the 95 percent conditional 1-step ahead confidence interval for $y_t$ is 2. True, because the unconditional moments of $y_t$ do not depend on time? I think this is false... that it can be smaller or larger, but I am not sure, could someone please explain this to me? How do I compute conditional means and variances for this type of model? I'm not quite sure I understand this... Is the one step ahead conditional mean $E[y_{t+1}|y_t,x_t]=0.5y_t+0.5x_t$ ? I also think this is false... I think the forecasts will converge to zero? I have no idea where to start with this question, so any help would be appreciated. What is this question asking? I assume I just calculate confidence interval in the usual way using conditional mean and variance? How do I compute the conditional one step ahead variance for $y_t$ ?
