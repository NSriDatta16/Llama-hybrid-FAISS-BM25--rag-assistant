Mortgage loan predictive analysis

I have hundreds of thousands of mortgage loan historic records that look like these 2 examples: CCCCCCCCCCCC33CCCC3CCCCCCMFBBBBM999999999999999999963CM3CCCCCCCCCC BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF99999999999963333CC33333333CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC Each symbol is a monthly status of a loan: C - current, F - foreclosure, M - modification, 3 - 30 days late, 9 - 90 days late, etc. I'm looking to use a machine learning algorithm that could learn form the data and would be able to predict probabilities of the next month outcomes. Could you point to a subset of approaches that I should look into?
