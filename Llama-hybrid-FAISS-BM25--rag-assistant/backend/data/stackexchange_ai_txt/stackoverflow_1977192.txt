You haven't really explained very clearly what you are trying to do. You are using the word "stroke" while referring to images. You can stroke a path, but not with an image. It doesn't make any sense. You can use an image as a mask and a path that specifies which part of the image to mask. You can do that with CAShapeLayer . If you are trying to add a new point to a path on each touch, you can just call these two things on the first touchesBegan: CGContextBeginPath(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()); CGContextMoveToPoint(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y); And then call CGContextAddLineToPoint(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), currentPoint.x, currentPoint.y); on subsequent calls to -touchesBegan. Again, I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do. One thing to note is that this is not doing anything: currentPoint.x = currentPoint.x; currentPoint.y = currentPoint.y; And I don't see where your mouseSwiped variable is ever getting toggled (set to NO).
