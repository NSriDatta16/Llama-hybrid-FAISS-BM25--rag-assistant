Authenticating to multiple OUs in Active Directory

I'm using the Active Directory Membership Provider with the following configuration: This works perfectly except it requires ALL of my users to be in the "Product Users" OU when I would actually like to have all of my users organized into various child OUs under our "Product Users" OU. Is this possible? (Note that this is a partial repost of this question but the question I'm asking here was never answered there.)
