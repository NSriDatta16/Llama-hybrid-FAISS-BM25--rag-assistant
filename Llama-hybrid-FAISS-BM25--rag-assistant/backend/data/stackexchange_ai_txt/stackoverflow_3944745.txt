A lot of logging software supports "asynchronous logging", where a log event is put into a queue very quickly, and then a separate thread writes them to persistent storage as soon as it can. The drawback here is that you are more likely to lose messages if your app crashes while events are still in the queue. The overall overhead is slightly higher too, since you have multiple threads coordinating with each other. Additionally, many logging frameworks have a "watch configuration" option that periodically checks a configuration file. This allows you to enable or disable a logger on a "hot" system. What logging library are you using?
