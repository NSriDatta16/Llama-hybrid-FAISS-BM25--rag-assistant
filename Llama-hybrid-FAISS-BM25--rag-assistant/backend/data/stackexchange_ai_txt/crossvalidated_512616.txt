Identify non-linear trend to know when to use log transformation in ARIMA?

There are basically three often used approaches to make time series stable based on three difference scenarios: 1) first difference for linear trend; 2) log for non-linear trend; 3) log seasonal difference for seasonality. anyone know how to identify if the data has a non linear trend? and is there a test that indicate that time series has non linear trend?
