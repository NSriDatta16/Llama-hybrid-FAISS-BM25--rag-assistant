I'm a fan of DeMorgan's Rule which takes your ex3 and produces your ex2. An empty if block is a mental block imo. You have to stop to read the nothing that exists - then you have to wonder why. If you have to leave comments like // This left blank on purpose; then the code isn't very self-explanatory.
