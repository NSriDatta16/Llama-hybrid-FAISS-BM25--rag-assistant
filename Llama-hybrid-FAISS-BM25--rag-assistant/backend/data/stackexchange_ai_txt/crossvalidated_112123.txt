Use random forest outliers to detect group of variables

I have a input data and an output binary variable . The y value is 1 if the patient get ill. > summary(x_or) Symscore1 Symscore2 exercise3 exerciseduration3 groupchange age3 Min. :0.0000 Min. :0.0000 Min. :1.000 Min. :0.000 Regular to Regular : 340 Min. :45.00 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:3.000 1st Qu.:2.000 Regular to Menopausal : 360 1st Qu.:49.00 Median :0.0000 Median :0.0000 Median :4.000 Median :3.000 Transitional to Transitional: 171 Median :54.00 Mean :0.5504 Mean :0.5941 Mean :3.651 Mean :2.545 Transitional to Menopausal :1492 Mean :54.07 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:5.000 3rd Qu.:3.000 Menopausal to Menopausal : 246 3rd Qu.:59.00 Max. :5.0000 Max. :5.0000 Max. :5.000 Max. :4.000 Max. :66.00 packyears bmi3 education3 Min. : 0.000 Min. :16.77 Basic : 348 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.:22.32 Highschool:1013 Median : 0.000 Median :24.84 University:1248 Mean : 4.397 Mean :25.60 3rd Qu.: 5.714 3rd Qu.:27.72 Max. :97.143 Max. :57.09 > summary(y_or) 0 1 2129 480 I have fitted a random forest model and computed the outlier measure rf = randomForest(x = x_or, y = y_or, proximity = T, ntree = 1000) out = outlier(x = rf$proximity, cls = y_or) plot(out, col=y_or) From the outlier plot I can see that some of the samples with y=1 have a very low outlier measure. The general prediction performance of my model are very low. Can I deduce from this plot that there is a subgroup of patient that will very likely get ill? Basically I would like to say at the medical team that it is difficult to obtain a general model but that we are able to classify people with this characteristics...
