Number of outputs exceeds the number of classes in the training set

I have to build a classifier that classifies samples to one of thirteen classes, but the training dataset I have contains only 10 classes (the dataset is not balanced and some classes does not have any sample) Is it right to build a Neural network classifier that has thirteen outputs although I don't have thirteen classes in my training set? Would it affect the accuracy to have more classes in the output that the classes in the training set? I was considering to put the full number of classes just in case in the future I can retrain the model again with better dataset so I don't need to change the code of the classifier. Thank you,
