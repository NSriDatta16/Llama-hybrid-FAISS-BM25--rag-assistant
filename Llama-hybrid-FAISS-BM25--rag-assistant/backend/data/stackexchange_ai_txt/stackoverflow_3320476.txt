Should've payed attention to a few more frames back, and I would have seen the answer. The MyClass object I was trying to copy the data into had been initialized as a NULL pointer, which is where the error in memcpy() was coming from. ("Cannot access memory at address 0x0" -- d'oh!) Can't believe I missed that... Thanks for your help -- I probably would've continued beating my head against a wall had I not tried out your solutions. Explicitly writing the assignment operator convinced me that the problem was elsewhere. Gratia plena!
