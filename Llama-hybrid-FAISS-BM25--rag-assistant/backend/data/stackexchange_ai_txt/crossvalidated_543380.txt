This is quite a deep question, and it is a matter of much debate (here on CV, too). It depends on your goals: If your goal is prediction , it is best to use as much information as available. The only possible problem might be overfitting, which can be checked with cross-validation or separate hold-out data. If your goal is explanation , a simpler model will be easier to understand as long as the most influential effects are included. Thus, for predictive purposes, it is generally even better not to assume a linear relationship at all, but to use spline regression, LOESS, or Random Forests (if you have tons of data). For a polemical discussion of this topic, see Leo Breiman: "Statistical modeling: The two cultures." Statistical Science 16.3, pp. 199-231 (2001) And for a more sober discussion: Galit Shmueli: "To explain or to predict?." Statistical Science 25.3, pp. 289-310 (2010)
