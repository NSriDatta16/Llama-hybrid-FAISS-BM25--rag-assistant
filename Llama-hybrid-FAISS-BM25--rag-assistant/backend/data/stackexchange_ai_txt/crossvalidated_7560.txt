There are two things going on here. Difference between primal and dual problem. The "original" objective function of SVM is to minimize $1/2 ||w||^2$. This is called "primal form". Turns out that the objective function you wrote (the one involving $L_D$) is the dual form of this problem. So the two lead to equivalent solutions and can be used interchangeably. The second formulation you describe is called "soft margin SVM". It is obtained by taking the primal form of (1) above and replacing the constraint $y_i f_w(x_i) \geq 1$ by the penalty term $C \cdot \max(0, 1 - y_i f_w(x_i))$. The effect is that you allow violations of the constraint. This is useful e.g. if your data is not linearly separable. You can obtain a dual formulation of this (similar to your expression with $L_D$) as well.
