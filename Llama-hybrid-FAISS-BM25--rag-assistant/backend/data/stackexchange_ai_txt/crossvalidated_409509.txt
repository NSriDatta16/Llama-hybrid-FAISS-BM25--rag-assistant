Features that are important according to random forest are not significant when logit model was used. How to interpret?

I have a feature set for each customer [age, gender, income, lifestyle, & so on...] and a response variable say: has_repurchased. I use a logit model summary which shows income & gender to be significant (p logit_res = logit_mod.fit(method='bfgs') When I run a random forest and perform model.feature_importances_ with the same feature set to obtain a ranking of features: both income and gender are ranked low whereas the topmost feature is age. (which as per logit model is not even significant). Shouldn't the rf feature importance show highly significant feature has highly ranked? Is this a correct way to interpret these results?
