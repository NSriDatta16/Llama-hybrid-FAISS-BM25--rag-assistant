Applying logistic regression to data recorded on a 0-10 scale

I used 0-10 scale to record disease data on each plant. 0 = no disease 1 = 1–10% of plant leaves infected 2 = 11–20% of plant use infected . . . 10 = 91–100% of plant leaves infected. I am considering dividing the response variable by 10 to create a proportion and then using logistic regression. While I am aware that an ordered beta distribution can be used for rank data, I am interested in using the binomial family. Can I apply logistic regression in this context, and are there any considerations or adjustments I should be aware of for this type of data? Analysis goal Predict disease based on weather conditions
