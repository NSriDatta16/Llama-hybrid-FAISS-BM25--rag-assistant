Goodness of fit, predictive power, discrimination

I'm making a couple of logistic regression based predictive models and intend to compare them and see which is "best". "best" here is obviously ill-defined, but as I'm looking for common metrics for evaluating the model performance I've came across different uses of GoF. For instance, on this wiki page R^2s are GoF, while here R^2s are measures of "predictive power". I also read somewhere that ROC is a GoF measure. So my question is, is there a distinction between GoF and predictive power? And is discrimination something that can be under either? Also, where does proper score functions, c-statistic and specificity/sensitivity fall under?
