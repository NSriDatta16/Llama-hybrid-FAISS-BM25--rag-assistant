How to change Linear model in SGDClassifier scikit learn?

The SGDClassifier of scikit learn defines it as "Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, etc.) with SGD training." . I understand from this that any Linear classifier can be used here. I want to know that how can we define a specific linear classifier to be used in the case of SGDClassifier.
