WPF DataGrid - Can't Use Mouse To Scroll Because Of Drag Drop

I am using a datagrid that is allowing to drag its rows. My problem is that when i try to scroll down on my grid using the mouse on the side scroller, i get the 'no enterance' sign that means that "drag and drop is not allowed here, dude...". How can i modify my drag and drop function to recognize that this is not a drag and drop action, but a scroll mouse action? private new void MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { Point currentPosition = e.GetPosition(GridUC); Object selectedItem = GridUC.SelectedItem; if (selectedItem == null) return; DragDropContainerObject ddObject = new DragDropContainerObject(typeof(Actor), selectedItem); DataGridRow container = (DataGridRow)GridUC.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(selectedItem); if (container != null) { DragDropEffects finalDropEffect = DragDrop.DoDragDrop(container, ddObject, DragDropEffects.Link); } } }
