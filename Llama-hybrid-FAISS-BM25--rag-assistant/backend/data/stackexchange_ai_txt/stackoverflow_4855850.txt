magento - delete extension?

I bought a magento extension and copied the files into the magento directory. Everything worked great. Then I wanted to re-install it. So I deleted all relevant files in app/code/local and i deleted the relevant database tables. When I re-copied the extension files back into the magento directory and tried to test the extension out, i get this error: SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'mydb.swam_list' doesn't exist I looked in the database and it seems magento did not re-create the database tables for the extension. How do I re-install this extension?
