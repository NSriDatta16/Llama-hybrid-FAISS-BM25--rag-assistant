How to extract files from .CAB file using C#.Net?

I have a CAB file generated from CABARC.EXE. I need to extract the file using ASP.Net C#.Net. How to do it in C#.net itself? I don't want to use the same CABARC.EXE for extraction. Because we don't use this tool in production environment. Please give your valuable suggestions/code to achieve this task. Thanks in advance Ganesh.
