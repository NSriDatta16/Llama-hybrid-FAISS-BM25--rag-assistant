Combining tangentially related study results to form a single probability in forensic pathology

I am a forensic pathologist with a question about combining perpetrator studies into one probability. For instance, let's say I know the following regarding male vs female assailants in murder cases: Attack at night: Male assailant: 70% night, 30% day Female assailant: 40% night, 60% day Multiple injuries on victim: Male: 80% > 10 injuries, 20% Female: 30% > 10 injuries, 70% Known to victim: Male: 40% known, 60% stranger Female: 80% known, 20% stranger Note that none of these percentages are real; I'm just using this as a toy example. So, I have a victim that suffered 15 injuries, attacked at night, by a stranger (assume I actually know all these things). What is the probability the assailant was male? What test should I use? I assume I need to know prevalence data (e.g. how many assailants in general are male vs female). Is this a Bayesian thing? Do I need to chain them? If so, how can I calculate the priors? For one study, for instance, I understand that $P(\text{male} | \text{night})= P(\text{night} | \text{male} ) \cdot P(\text{male})/P(\text{night})$ And there are studies that will give me P(male), P(night), and even P(night|male). But now, what about adding the next one: $P(\text{male} | \text{night}, \text{stranger}) = P(\text{night}, \text{stranger} | \text{male}) \cdot P(\text{male})/P(\text{night}, \text{stranger})$ and on and on. I don't think there's a study for the $P(\text{night}, \text{stranger}, \text{multiple wounds})$ equivalent prior for my particular problem. Is there a way to do this without knowing that prior well?
