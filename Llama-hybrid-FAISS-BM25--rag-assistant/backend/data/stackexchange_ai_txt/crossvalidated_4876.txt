Comparing and visualizing rates of subsystems

I am trying to track the performance of a set of homogeneous subsystems vs the system as a whole. The performance metric is measured by a mean value based on a set of tasks performed by a the subsystem, for example, the mean wait time before scheduling task. Each subsystem may be responsible for varying numbers of tasks. I can calculate the mean wait time for each subsystem and for the system as a whole. My question is how to measure and visualize how each subsystem is performing compared to the whole system average (or maybe there's a better aggregate measure for the whole system?) Obviously being below the mean shows the subsystem is performing relatively better and above the mean vice versa, and the distance from the whole system mean represents that, but I struggle to get real meaning or provide a good visualization from that. Is there a better way? Or if I'm on the right track, how do I assign meaning / visualize the metric?
