You can't really make your browser window blink in the task bar. For HTML5 a Notification API was planned and so far Chrome supports it, but it seems that it was dropped again. The only cross-browser possibilities to get the attention of your users are either to set the focus of the window: window.focus(); or to change the title of your page: document.title = "New message!"; See also this SO answer for a nice "blinky" implementation of changing document.title .
