Categorical Variable and Logistic Regression

I ran a really simple logistic regression and want to know the X% increase in odds for each of my categorical variables. My equation is $Honors=f(Status)$ such that $Status$ is Low, Medium or High. The output of my results shows the following model$coeffiecents (Intercept) Low Medium 1.07366 0.284 0.241 I transformed the coefficients into odds using $e^{coefficient}$ . So holding all things constant, we see the odds of being in Honors for Low is 27.3%( $e^{0.284}-1$ ). The odds for being in Honors for Medium is 32.85%. Does this mean the odds for being in Honors for High is 1-(27.3%+32.85%) = 39.89%? What if I wanted to get the probability of being in Honors given you are High? I can get Medium and Low as $\frac{e^{coefficient}}{1+e^{coefficient}}$ but how would I get High?
