I would recommend using an encoder-decoder structure based on LSTM-RNN for sequence-to-sequence learning ; it will provide you with exactly what you want. A link that I find very helpful is: https://machinelearningmastery.com/define-encoder-decoder-sequence-sequence-model-neural-machine-translation-keras/
