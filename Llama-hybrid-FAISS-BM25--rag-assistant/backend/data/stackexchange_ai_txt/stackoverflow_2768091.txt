How exactly you use your view models is a judgement call. One developer might have fewer typed ViewModels so they can be reused. Another developer might have more ViewModels, each smaller and more specific to particular actions. And another developer might rely more on ViewData. If possible, have your view models be well-organized, contain just what the view needs, and consist mostly of light entity objects. If you have a complicated view though, don't be afraid to make a highly customized view model class that will help simplify the view logic. It's okay to make reusable ViewModels that have a little unused data in them, but avoid using just a few one-size-fits-all ViewModels. ViewModels should have just the data needed for that view or very close.
