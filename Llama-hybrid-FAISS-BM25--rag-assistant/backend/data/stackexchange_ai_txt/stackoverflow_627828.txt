This is not exactly what you asked, but could be useful when using one of the suggestions other people have posted: Be aware that if your application is a Windows forms app, and it ends up installed in C:\Program Files... you might not have write access to your application folder if the user that starts the application is not running as administrator. That could be a problem if you want to 'extract' the embedded resource and save it to disk in the same folder as your app. I would recommend either: Not embedding the .exe as a resource. Just set its Copy to Output Directory to Always. Then deploy it together with your main .exe Embedding it as a resource but when saving it to disk, use either the Windows temp folder (if it is just a one time thing) or the User's data folder (C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data) You can get the proper folder for the current OS like this: // for the Windows temp folder Path.GetTempPath() // for the user's application data folder Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData))
