Run a traceroute (a series of pings with short TTL's to the address, if the firewall(s) is(are) one of the hops then it's visible from outside the organisation so should be acceptable. System.Net.NetworkInformation has a ping class that should give you enough information for a tracert like routine. This does sound like a big hole though, another approach should probably be considered. Preventing the machine that runs this prog. from accessing any other machine on the internal network may be better - a kind of internal firewall. I've added a simple traceroute, since you like the concept:- class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { PingReply reply = null; PingOptions options = new PingOptions(); options.DontFragment = true; Ping p = new Ping(); for (int n = 1; n "); } Console.WriteLine("Done."); System.Console.ReadKey(); } } Should be good enough for a reliable local network.
