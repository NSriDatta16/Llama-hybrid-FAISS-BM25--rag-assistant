Steve314 said it well. OOP is more about the design patterns and organization of large applications. It also lets you deal with unknowns better, which is great for user apps. However, for analyzing algorithms, most likely you are going to be thinking functionally about what you want to do. In that case, I'd stick to more simple PP and not try to create a fully OO design, when you care about the algorithm. I'd want to work with C or Matlab (depending on how math intensive the algorithm is). Just my opinion on it.
