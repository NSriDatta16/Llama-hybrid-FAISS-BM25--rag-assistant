No, I would think that in C++/CLI you also don't need the dynamic cast here. Derived* implicitly converts to Base* unless there's an ambiguity w.r.t. multiple inheritance. The same it probably true for "gc-pointers". In C++ a dynamic cast -- when upcasting -- requires polymorphic classes (with at least one virtual function). I don't know how C++/CLI handles it, though. I would think every CLI class is by default polymorphic. You may want to remove the C++ tag, by the way. ;)
