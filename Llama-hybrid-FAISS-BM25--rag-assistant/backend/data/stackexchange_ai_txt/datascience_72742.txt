I solved it the following way: zero padding all time series that are smaller than the longest one adding a Masking() layer with masking_value=0. which ignores all zero values before feeding the network. The part of the model with the Masking layer looks like the following: model = keras.Sequential() model.add(layers.Masking(mask_value=0., input_shape=(None, 1))) model.add(layers.LSTM(100)) Additional Info: Implementing the Masking Layer for a Model with two separate Inputs was kind of unconvinient with a the Keras Functional API , therefore i implemented that part of the model with the Keras Sequential API and connected it to the rest of the model which is implemented with the Functional API.
