In Visual Studio, you can point a reference to a "specific version" of a library. You just change the default 'False' to 'True' in the reference's properties. This would handle the looking up of assembly info for you. It's trivial to override that using a binding redirect, but this would prevent the program trying to run in situations where the wrong version is installed accidentally. I do recommend digital signing to get the best protection against deliberate tampering, as @Alberto Martinez mentioned.
