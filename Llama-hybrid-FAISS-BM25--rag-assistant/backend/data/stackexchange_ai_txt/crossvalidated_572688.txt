How do I get the final mean value of imputed data?

I have run multiple imputations on my data and need to now export a final dataset that I can then calculate the mean of each imputed variable. How would one do this? I can't pool the data straight into my analysis because of the way my data is set up: My dependent variables are measures of participants response time and accuracy when reading different words (20 words in total, so 20 accuracy scores and 20 response time scores) for which I have around 150 observations. This is where the missing data is.. However my independent variables are measures of word factors e.g. word length, word frequency. So I have 20 words each with those variables. So my end goal is to run a multiple regression to see the predictive value of word factors for response time and accuracy. (E.g. can word length predict variance in response time of that word) However this is my issue: I have to first find the mean value of the 150 observations (with the imputations) for response time for each word. I then input these means into a clean data set with my independent variables. And then use that dataset in my regression model. So I can't directly pool the imputed data into the model. I need to first average those variables. But how do I find the mean of the imputed variables when I have 30+ imputation cycles? ....wondering if this is even possible now or if I should revert to se deletion
