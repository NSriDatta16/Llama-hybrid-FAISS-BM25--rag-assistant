First off.. Using HashMap would destroy any attempt to 'order by' in your SQL since you are not guaranteed to get back the order you put the items. So if you used an 'order by' in your SQL you would be forced to use a LinkedHashMap for storage to retain item order. A TreeMap would order for you, if you set up a valid comparator. My preference would be based on the size of the lists and usage. If many people will be accessing this list on a daily basis and refreshing it, I would prefer to have their own user interfaces handle the ordering.. This part really depends.
