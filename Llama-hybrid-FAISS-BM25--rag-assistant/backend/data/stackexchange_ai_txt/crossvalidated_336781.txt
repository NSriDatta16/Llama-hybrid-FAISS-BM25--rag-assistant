Visualizing the embedded space in Probabilistic Matrix factorization for recommendation

Is there a preferable way to visualize the embedded space in Probabilistic Matrix factorization for recommendation? Should I run PCA after getting the User and Item matrix? If so, I should then merge the two matrix before applying PCA, right? Here you can find an example of visualization. Unfortunately there is not much information on how to replicate the graph. I also noticed that some people just plot the first two or three elements of the latent vectors.. While being certainly a possibility, I am not sure whether that is the standard approach.
