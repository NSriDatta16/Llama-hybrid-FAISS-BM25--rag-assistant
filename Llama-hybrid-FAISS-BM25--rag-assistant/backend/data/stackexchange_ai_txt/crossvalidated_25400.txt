Bayesian Analysis in R/WinBUGS and SAS (Proc MCMC)

I have a Bayesian model here in R/WinBUGS. This data "pumps" has two columns, time and fail. Each observation is a pump and fail[1] tells how many failures there were in time[1]. I want to know how I can write this same model in SAS using Proc MCMC. Thank you! pump
