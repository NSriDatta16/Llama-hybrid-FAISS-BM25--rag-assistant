Both definitions of the model seem to be the same, at least I do not see anything strange as well. JAGS is a declarative language, and the for loop assignment is perfectly valid from the syntax point of view, so they should not differ. So I agree, it's strange. JAGS is not actively maintained, the last update is from 2017 if I see correctly. Additionally, it is a one-man project to a great degree. Both are red flags for software * . I'd encourage you to switch to something more modern and actively maintained, e.g. Stan . * - Although JAGS was pretty popular a few years ago and there is a lot of one-man projects in open source, including things I maintain myself.
