The second one is the most elegant to me (and you could tweak it with KVO instead of notifications). And it is since it does not load B with more responsibilities that he needs (B cannot even know about A) whereas the third option makes B notify A. Plus it will be more independent from changes than the first one (because you are obliged to check the situation before A is loaded, and you use ViewWillApperar:, but this situation can change in the future)
