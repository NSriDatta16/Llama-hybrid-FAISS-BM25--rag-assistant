Minimum number of studies to meta-analyze in random-effects GLM models

I have a question regarding the use of random-effects GLM meta-analytic models and the minimum number of studies needed and its relation to the estimation of $ \tau^2 $. (I understand that only two studies are needed for a fixed effect estimate.) My hunch is that one needs at least $k=4$ studies, since 1 degree of freedom will be used for the average effect estimate and the remaining 3 will then go towards estimation of $\tau$. However, I have see published reports that will report random-effects estimates with $k=2$ studies, and indeed any popular meta-analytic packages will fit such models because it is mathematically possible. With so few studies, will $\hat{\tau}^2$ be meaningful? or (badly) biased?
