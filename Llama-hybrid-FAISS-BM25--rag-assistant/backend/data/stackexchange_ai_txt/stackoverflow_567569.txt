The lock statement (encapsulating the Monitor class) supports re-entrance (recursion) within a thread, i.e. you can nest the calls, which use the same monitor. Other locking approachs: Monitor - recursion is supported ReaderWriterLock - recursion is supported, but slow ReaderWriterLockSlim - recursion is supported, but discouraged EventHandle ( ManualResetEvent , AutoResetEvent , Mutex , Semaphore ) - recursion not supported
