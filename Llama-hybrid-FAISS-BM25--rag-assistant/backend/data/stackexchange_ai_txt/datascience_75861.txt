Random Forest vs Neural Networks

Why neural network is considered a better model than random forest in a classification task ? I've tried both the models in a 10 class classification problem and the random forest perform better than a neural network with 1 hidden layer and only slightly worst than a neural network with 3 hidden layers. To compare them i used the same number of estimators (in the random forest) and neurons (for hidden layer in the neural network).
