A lot within these limits: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/limits.html Also from manual http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html There is a limit of 2^32 (~4.295E+09) rows in a MyISAM table. If you build MySQL with the --with-big-tables option, the row limitation is increased to (2^32)^2 (1.844E+19) rows. See Section 2.17.2, “Typical configure Options”. Binary distributions for Unix and Linux are built with this option. Just for fun: You can have 65536 bytes per row. This means you can create 5461 LONGTEXT/LONGBLOB columns, each able to store 4GB of data. Now multiply that times 2^64... That's strictly theoretical number though.
