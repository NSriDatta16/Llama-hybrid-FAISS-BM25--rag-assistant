Decrease line spacing in a TextBlock / FlowDocument

Some fonts have a large amount of whitespace above and below the characters. Is there a way to correct for that, and tighten up the space between lines of a word-wrapped paragraph in WPF (in either a TextBlock or a FlowDocument)? Kind of like a negative margin between lines? There's a LineHeight property on Paragraph and TextBlock , but it only seems to let you increase the spacing -- if you set it to a smaller value than the default, it's simply ignored.
