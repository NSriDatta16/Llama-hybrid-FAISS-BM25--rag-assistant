It depends how much work it takes to synchronize the state between the two threads. If it takes 0 work, then this will be, on average, 50% faster than a straight through algorithm. On the other hand, if it takes more work than X, it will start to get slower (which is very likely the case). From an algorithm standpoint, I don't think this is how you want to go. Even 2 threads is still going to be O(n) runtime. You would want to sort the data (n log n ), and then do a binary search to get the data. Especially you can sort it 1 time and use it for many searches...
