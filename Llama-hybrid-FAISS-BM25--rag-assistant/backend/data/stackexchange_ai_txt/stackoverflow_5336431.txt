What could cause a transparent scrollbar bug in a ListView?

I have a ListView, set up in what I believe is a completely standard way in a C# .Net 3.5 project, running on a laptop using XP, which pretty much stays on the whole time (although I reboot it about once a month or if I install any new software). On coming in in the morning, I sometimes notice this greeting me when I unlock my machine: Scrollbars showing background through http://www.premierekitchens.co.uk/storage/DodgyScrollbars.png As you can see, the scrollbars are showing my background through them. They have turned transparent. They still "work", in that the mouse can interact with them, but they do not update at all. And strangest of all, any child windows (which get created and destroyed in the usual c# way) also have this problem. And not just on ListViews. Standard text boxes also have this issue. I've searched, but I cannot find anything about this anywhere. Does anyone have any ideas on a) what's causing it? and b) how I can fix it?
