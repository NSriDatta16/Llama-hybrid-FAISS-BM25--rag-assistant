Determine if any one character is repeated at least a specified number of times in a row

I know this could probably be done without regular expressions, but I'd rather make the solution short and elegant than a block of hackjob code. What I'm looking to accomplish is to determine if any character is repeated at least X times in a row in a string of non-predefined length. The threshold for repetition, X, can be hard coded because the code it will be used in won't be changing much. The repeated character itself is unimportant, I only care to know if such repetition exists. For example, if the threshold is set to 4: aaaabcd = Match aaabbcd = No Match abbbbcd = Match aabaaad = No Match aAaAbcd = No Match If the repetition threshold is set to 1, any input non-empty input string should match and if the repetition threshold is set to longer than the input string, it should fail to match. I have a feeling the solution is going to involve back references, but I'm not familiar enough with them myself to work out a solution. If anybody is curious, the language I'll be implementing this in will be PHP, so code snippets are welcome!
