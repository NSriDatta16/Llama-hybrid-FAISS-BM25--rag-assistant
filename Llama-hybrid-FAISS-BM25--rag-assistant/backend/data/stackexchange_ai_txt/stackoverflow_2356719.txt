I've just solved this... not sure it is the most elegant way... However, I basically track each push and pop myself on a stack, but I store objects rather than views. Each time something is pushed or popped off my stack I save it (takes no time). When the application launches it looks for the stack file and then does several pushes (popping items off the loaded stack) but not animating each one. My hierarchy is (at its deepest) 4 items, and to the user it looks like it just opens on the object. The stack is loaded from the file in the viewDidLoad method of my root controller.
