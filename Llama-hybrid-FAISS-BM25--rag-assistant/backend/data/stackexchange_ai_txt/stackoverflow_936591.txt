Marty: I had this same problem and I could not find a suitable solution. You can use simple result transformers to control the number of objects that are returned: CriteriaSpecification.ROOT_ENTITY CriteriaSpecification.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY But the objects would always contain the full results for their children. I did happen across an excellent article that uses a DTO pattern along with projections and the aliasToBean transformer. Here it is: http://swik.net/Hibernate/Hibernate+GroupBlog/Hibernate+3.2:+Transformers+for+HQL+and+SQL/cmxs This has worked well for me. The biggest problem is that you have to create these flattened out DTO objects. For me its not that big of an issue because my specialized DTO objects are used in search results and are very reusable, plus I won't be needing very many of them. I know that this does not directly address your issue, if you do find a way to accomplish your goal please update the post as I would love to see the solution.
