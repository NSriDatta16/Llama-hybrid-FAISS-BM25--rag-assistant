Java Synchronized concept in PHP

Condition I have comma separated list of airway bill numbers in a record in table core_config_data. This table uses engine Innodb. I have a class with a function to take read this record, explode it, unshift one airway bill number, implode rest and save in database again. Problem When 2 or more people press assign airway bill number at same instance, all the shipment get same airway bill numbers. Question Is there a way in php / magento / zend to implement synchronized for this kind of situation. Regards, Saurabh
