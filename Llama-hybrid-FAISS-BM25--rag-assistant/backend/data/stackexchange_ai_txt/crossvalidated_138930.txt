I think logistic regression is a reasonable approach to answer your question, assuming that a binary question of "did/didn't the event happen within one month" is the right way to think about it. If there are more complicated temporal dynamics involved, then some sort of survival analysis probably more appropriate. But there's value in simplicity, and results of the approach you describe will be easy to communicate to a non-technical audience. To do the logistic regression you're talking about, your outcome will be a simple yes/no, and each date will have an associated "precipitating event occurred" value that is also yes/no. So for example d3 = data.frame(EventOccurred = rep(c(1,0,1),50), OccurredLastMonth = rep(c(1,0,0),50)) head(d3) m1 Here is a link to an article I published in the American Journal of Public Health that uses a more-or-less similar approach for treating time points as the random variable in your analysis.
