Small data set in machine learning

I see from reading that the medical industry is using machine learning to apply to small data set and wanted to understand how this worked? As such I created a small data set for my wife's business. I have a data set that will be around 100k units, how to I determine the best predictive or factor model to use when approaching this small'ish data set? I want to avoid overfitting etc. Any common pitfalls that I should avoid and/or tricks I should use to get more out of this data?
