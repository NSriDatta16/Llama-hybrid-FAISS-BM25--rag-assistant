Unfortunately, this is less of a Django issue than an HTML question. The HTML specification (RFC1866) says: At all times, exactly one of the radio buttons in a set is checked. If none of the elements of a set of radio buttons specifies `CHECKED', then the user agent must check the first radio button of the set initially. However, browsers have historically ignored this and implemented radio buttons in different ways. HTML also makes this difficult because the "checked" attribute of the tag doesn't take a parameter, so you can't use a customized Django widget that sets this attribute to False or No. A possible workaround is to put in a little Javascript that runs as part of the document's onLoad event that finds all the radio buttons on the page and sets the 'checked' attribute to false (using JQuery, for example).
