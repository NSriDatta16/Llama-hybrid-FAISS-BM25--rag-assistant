? .9 - .8999999999999995 This subtraction process, with 15-16 significant digits, gives 0.0000000000000005 The rest of the digits are just rounding errors. However, since the computer always stores 15-16 significant digits after the first non-zero digit, the rounding errors are shown, and you get a lot of trailing random digits produced by rounding errors. So the result has 16 significant digits from the subtraction operation plus 16 digits from the storage of the result, which gives 32 digits.
