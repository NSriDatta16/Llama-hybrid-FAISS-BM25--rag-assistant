Assigning weights to indicators using pca

i am creating an index using stata consisting of 11 indicators. i want to assign weights to these indicators using PCA. i have checked correlation of the indicators and then ran the pca and performed rotation of the factors. however i am unsure as to how to calculate the final weights. i am new to this, and any help would be appreciated. thank you
