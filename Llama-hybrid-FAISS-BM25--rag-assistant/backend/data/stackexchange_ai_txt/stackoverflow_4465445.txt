Zend Framework Sessions Being Lost

I'm using sessions to store items in a shopping cart. I can create and persist sessions, but with some strange problems: When I close the tab in Firefox (not the entire browser), the session appears to have been lost. Sometimes it doesn't happen though but usually it does. Every single time I refresh the page or go to another page, the session ID changes to a new one. I've confirmed this by looking in the cookie with my browser, and also on the server. Also, there are a max of 4 sessions stored on the server at one time. Is all this normal behavior? The sessions seem to be lost at random intervals...it could be a few minutes or more than an hour. I just followed the Zend manual but no luck in solving any of this. In the bootstrap I also have Session::start() and Session::rememberMe(). I'm using normal file storage for sessions, just storing in /var/lib/php5 which I think is where Zend framework likes to put it. Thanks for any direction
