I want to embed Twitter or something that is connected to Twitter through API in an IFRAME

Does anyone have a solution for embedding twitter or all of its functionality into an iframe... Basically what I want is to embed Twitter within my webapp so my clients can use it as a marketing tool while also using my application. If someone has an API solution completed that I can embed through an iframe I am willing to look at it for purchase. If you know of a solution let me know...
