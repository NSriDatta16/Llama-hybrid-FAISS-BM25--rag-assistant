Jonathan, I think the problem is where your source files are including header files from 3rd party libraries, and you want to switch off the warnings for the latter. Kevin, i think you can use pragmas to control warnings : gcc diagnostic pragmas You could add these before and after any #includes for 3rd party libs.
