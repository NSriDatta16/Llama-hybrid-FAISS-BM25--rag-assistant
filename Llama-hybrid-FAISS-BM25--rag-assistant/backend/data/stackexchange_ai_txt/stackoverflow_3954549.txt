I thought virtual memory was supposed to have you covered in this situation? Anyways, it seems suspect that you really need all 5gb of data in memory at any given moment - you can't possibly be processing all that data at any given time - at least not on what sounds like a consumer PC. You didn't go into detail about your data, but something to me smells like the object itself is poorly designed in the sense that you need the entire set to be in memory to work with it. Have you thought about trying to fragment out your data into more sensible units - and then do some preemptive loading of the data from disk, just before it needs to be processed? You'd essentially be paying a more constant performance trade-off this way, but you'd reduce your current thrashing issue.
