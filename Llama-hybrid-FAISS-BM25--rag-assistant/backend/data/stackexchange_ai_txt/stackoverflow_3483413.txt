Don't worry about the storage space (the storage required is far less than you think). Use a PLIST (File > New File > Resource (Mac OS X) > Property List), and arrayWithContentsOfFile to make loading the words simple (define an array as the root item in the PLIST; Apple's documentation has further details). Then, simply: srandom(time(NULL)); NSUInteger index = rand() % [array length]; NSString *word = [array objectAtIndex:index];
