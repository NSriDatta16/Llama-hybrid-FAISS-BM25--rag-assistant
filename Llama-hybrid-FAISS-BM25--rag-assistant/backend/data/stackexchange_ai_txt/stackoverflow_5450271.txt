JQuery UI library provides some of the ready made common UI effects and functionalities like accordion, draggable tables, sortable tables, progress bar, date-pickers and so on. jquery_ui is a module that ports the jquery UI library to Drupal that's all. In general other modules would depend on this module to provide some jquery functionalities. Anyway if you are writing a custom module of your own, you can use the snippets from Jquery UI library if you have enabled this module.
