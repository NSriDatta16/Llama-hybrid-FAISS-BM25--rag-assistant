How to get the predominant color of a website?

I'm thinking if it could be possible to get a site's "characteristic" color. For instance, TechCrunch would be green, ReadWriteWeb would be red, CNN also red, Microsoft blueish, PHP purple, etc... It doesn't have to be accurate, just a best guess. Some things I have on my mind: parse all css rules and find the one matching the most elements parse all css rules and find background colors of the elements having the biggest dimensions getting the body element's background image and getting the predominant color of that (is this possible for an image) somehow finding the site's "header" (first element in DOM with background css attribute set?) and getting its background Also I would need a way to eliminate blacks, greys and white. Is this feasible? Do you have any other ideas? P.S. Sorry for my English
