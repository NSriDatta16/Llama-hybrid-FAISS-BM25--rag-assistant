Probabilistic Methods vs Q-Learning Technique

I have a confusion about the relationship between Q-learning and the probabilistic methods. Normally probabilistic methods are used to make intelligent decision even the problem is incomplete or uncertain. Q-learning is a model- free technique which learns through the dynamic interaction with the environment using reward as the only signal to learn. So can we categorise Q-learning under probabilistic methods?
