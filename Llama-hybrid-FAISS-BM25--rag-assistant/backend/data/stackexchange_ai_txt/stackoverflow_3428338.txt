Since the user agent data is extremely sensitive to changes and you'd like to delegate the maintenance of the data to a 3rd party, consider to use a public webservice like http://user-agent-string.info . They also have a Java example for the XML-RPC service. You can obtain the user agent of the current request using HttpServletRequest#getHeader() . String userAgent = request.getHeader("User-Agent"); Use that as parameter for the webservice. That said, if you actually have compatibility problems in the HTML/CSS/MSIE area, you should really consider conditional comments . If in JS area, use feature detection . You should not rely on the user agent and certainly not in the server side. Consider posting a new question about the problem for which you thought that sniffing the user agent in the server side is the solution. You'll get much better suited answers.
