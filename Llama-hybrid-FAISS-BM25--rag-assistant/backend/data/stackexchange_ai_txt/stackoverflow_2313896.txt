I believe that the pluggins you are interested in are all fine. Resharper is nice and powerful, but it requires a lot of memory. As some others have said, TestDriven .Net is almost a must. It lets you run your tests from the VS IDE. It works fine if your tests are in NUnit. And at last, I would recommend NCover to keep track of your test coverage. It has a community version and it can be executed from the IDE with TestDriven .Net too. And of course nAnt and / or MSBuild for automated builds. I would recomend nAnt better. Hope it helps
