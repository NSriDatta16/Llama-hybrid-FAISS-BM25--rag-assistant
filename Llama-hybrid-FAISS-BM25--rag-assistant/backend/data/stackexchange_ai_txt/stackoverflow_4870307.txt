You probably meant A1 Sitemap Generator? :) Anyhow, error 500 means "internal server error" If your browser does not give this error, it's probably a config issue: user agent not recognized by server (try other useragent in A1SG) unexpected HTTP requests headers (try other HTTP engine in A1SG) Don't rule out e.g. HTTP request headers. I once encountered a website that would barf if the Accept-Language request header did not match the local language :)
