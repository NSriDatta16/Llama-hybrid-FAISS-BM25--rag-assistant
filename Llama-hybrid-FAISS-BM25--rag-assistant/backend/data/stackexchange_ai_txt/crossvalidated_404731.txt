Eigenvalues as weighting factors for projection results on corresponding eigenvectors in PCA

In the paper Novel PCA-based Color-to-gray Image Conversion , the authors project the three-dimensional $(R, G, B)$ value of each pixel onto a one-dimensional grayscale space via a curious application of PCA (emphasis mine): (......) To compute a gray image ( $I_{gray} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ ), the proposed ELSSP is conducted, and then the output is scaled to $[0, 255]$ . Note that we utilize the eigenvalues as weighting factors for projection results on corresponding eigenvectors. As a result, the color-to-gray mapping is dominated by the first subspace projection, and the second and third subspace projections contribute to preserving details of a color image in a gray image. The motivation behind this proposal can be found in Section 2.1. Subspace Projections . Intuitively that makes sense to me, but from a theoretical point of view, this operation seems awkward. As far as I know, the first subspace projection preserved the most information of the original data, so such a linear combination must contain less information than the first subspace projection along, yet according to the paper's abstract, "experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both conversion speed and image quality." How is this possible?
