Problem retrieving SWF from PHP script

So why won't this URL for the Flash source file won't work for embedding in the HTML? src=' http://65.19.134.36/uploader/?uuid=suhFolmJnCL3T_7oJ1rkxyeP4oSQtbzf.swf ' (or as used in the object tag for value="...") There must be something that Flash doesn't like about it, but I cannot figure it out. I've even made a quick fix to the PHP as the original code should've been this, which didn't work either: src=' http://65.19.134.36/uploader/?uuid=suhFolmJnCL3T_7oJ1rkxyeP4oSQtbzf&type=000 ' That page serves a SWF file with the correct filename and mimetype, so it seems to be something else. Maybe related to ' http://65.19.134.36/uploader/ ' being seen as the swf file and the query string being appended to that? I've tried replacing the ampersand with &3F; and & but it makes no difference. I'm sure this will be a 'bang my head on the desk when I know the answer' question. Can anyone put me out of my misery?? Cheers, Mark...
