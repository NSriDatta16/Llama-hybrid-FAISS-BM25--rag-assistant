Sourcing shell scripts in Perl

I want to source a shell script from within Perl and have the environment variables be available in Perl, but I'm not sure if there's an elegant way to do it. Obviously, using system() won't work since it runs in a forked process, and all environment changes will be lost. I think there's a CPAN module that can do it, but I prefer not to use external modules. I've seen two solutions that would not work in my case: Have a wrapper that calls the shell script, and then calls the Perl script. I do not know ahead of time which of my shell scripts I need to call. Manually opening the shell script and scraping for arg=value pairs. This won't work either because the shell script is not a simple list of ARG=VALUE , but rather contain a bunch of conditionals, and variables can have different values depending on certain conditions.
