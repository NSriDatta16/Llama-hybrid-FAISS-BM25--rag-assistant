Does accuracy increase linearly when you add more factors/features to a random forest?

I have read in various machine learning books that adding more data should result in a more accurate model. Is this rule the same for adding more factors/features to the model as well? So, should I expect the accuracy of a random forest to increase linearly as I add more instances or factors to my model? Any references/resources are appreciated.
