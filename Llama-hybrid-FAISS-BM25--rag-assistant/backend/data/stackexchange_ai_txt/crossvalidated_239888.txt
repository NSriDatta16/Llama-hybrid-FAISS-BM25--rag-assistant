Learn a fined-grained periodic function from coarse-grained periodic functions

I'm a Machine Learning practitioner but not a Signal Processing practitioner. I have data and I assume they generated by an any periodic function (periodic wave), not necessarily sinusoidal. So I have some questions: What is the best way to learn that function from data please? Let us assume my theoretical fined-grained function (and so my observations) depends on piecing of coarse-grained functions a bit like Fourier transform. Does exist a model or algorithms doing that please? A bit like Benveniste's wavelet network 2.a. Always with the same assumption, if I want to model my fine-grained function with a known couple of coarse-grained functions, is there a way (model, algorithm, etc.) to find out the best combination of these coarse-grained functions modeling my fine-grained function. Feel you free to inform me about fields or papers about that field.
