The bootstrap procedure that you describe should be valid. However, it's important to keep in mind that, like normal-based 95% CI, a bootstrap confidence interval is only guaranteed to have correct coverage asymptotically. One nice thing about working with the median or other quantiles is that you can construct exact finite sample confidence intervals under very weak assumptions. The basic idea is that under the null that median of $y$ is $m$, the indicator for $y Chernozhukov, Hansen, Jansson (2009) for more details.
