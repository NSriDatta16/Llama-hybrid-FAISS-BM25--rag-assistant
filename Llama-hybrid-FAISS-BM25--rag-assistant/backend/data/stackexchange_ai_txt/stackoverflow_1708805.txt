How can I display an organized hierarchical data in asp.net 3.5?

I am working on a project that organizes the structure and hierarchy of departments. I want to view and display the whole structure of the organization visually, but I am stuck. I wanted to know what is the best way to do it in ASP.net 3.5; my goal is to achieve something like this by code and each node is linkable and can have CSS. The tree view won't fit neither master details grid view will fit to my requirements. Appreciate any help
