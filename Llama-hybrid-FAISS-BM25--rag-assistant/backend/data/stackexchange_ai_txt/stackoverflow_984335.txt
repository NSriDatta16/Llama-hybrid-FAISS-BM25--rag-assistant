Yes, there is confusion, because F# has morphed from OCaml to .Net over the years. Basically, the naming conventions are a "breaking change" - old code is inconsistent with new code. However, the May 2009 CTP has settled the issue. The Release Notes say... Standard Library Naming Conventions The naming conventions adopted for the F# library are as follows: All .NET and F# OO code uses PascalCase according to existing .NET guidelines The F# functional programming operators such as List.map are for use in F# internal implementation code. This kind of code uses camelCase for operator names Underscores should not be used. So, your question... Class.MyFunctionName or Module.my_function_name The answer is Class.MyFunctionName and Module.MyFunctionName ( but see edit below! ) (applying rule 1 above). -- Edit. Nov 2, 2019 -- The current guidelines recommend camelCase for functions at module level, so it's Module.myFunctionName Which then makes production code consistent with the F# libraries (eg. List.averageBy)
