malabar-mode is the best existing solution for Java development in Emacs. It has nice maven integration, groovy shell, semantic support, etc... Java IDE certainly outgun anything Emacs has to offer in terms of features related to refactoring and code analysis, but other than that the Emacs experience is way better - much more powerful editor, simpler and vast ecosystem of extensions and an overall aura of greatness ;-) It's all a matter of taste in end - whether you prefer click-based programming, when everything happens in menu and popups or prefer to go down to the bare metal, write the code more carefully(because there won't be a tool to analyze it for you) and create... If you go for IDEs do yourself a favor, ignore all the Eclipse propaganda and have a look at the competing projects - I personally recommend you IntelliJ IDEA. In the end one decides for himself, but the decision should be made objectively and not based on statements like "everyone is using Eclipse"...
