Which statistical analysis to compare proportions between multiple groups?

I can’t figure out the stats to use for my problem. I have 2 groups, each with 100 patients. These groups each have a different primary treatment of interest. I have 3 different secondary treatments within these groups. I also have an outcome which is expressed as positive outcome/number of trials. The data is something like this: Group Treatment Positive_Outcomes Trials A TreatA 4 4 A TreatA 8 20 A TreatB 0 3 A TreatC 2 6 B TreatA 5 9 B TreatA 2 2 B TreatB 3 5 B TreatC 5 5 I want to ask 2 questions… firstly if there is a difference in the proportion of positive outcomes between group A and B. Secondly, is using the primary treatment (Group) affect the outcomes of the secondary treatments differently (TreatA, B, C). I believe it may be some kind of regression analysis to deal with the proportion but I’m not sure how to go about it. I am using r for my analysis if you could suggest useful packages. EDIT: The dependent variable that I want to actually compare is the proportion of Positive_Outcomes .... (1, 0.4, 0, 0.33 etc) and I'm not sure how this fits in a logistic regression if I could please ask for some help and clarification on this.
