What you basically want is to find the similarity between two strings . I think the Soundex algorithm is what you're looking for. It can be used for comparing strings based on how they sound. Or as wiki describes: Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. And: Using this algorithm [EDIT: that is, "rating" words by a letter and three digits], both "Robert" and "Rupert" return the same string "R163" while "Rubin" yields "R150". "Ashcraft" yields "A261". There's also the Levenshtein distance . Good luck.
