Why an object is invisible?

I have a class. In this class I declare a a private variable private Agent agent; . In my class I have private Thread controller = new Thread() { ... } Within the above private thread I call getParameter which is a private method of the considered class. Within the getParameter I call one of the methods of the agent . As a result I get a NullPointerException . So, I conclude that agent is not visible from the getParameter . Why is that? Can it be that the reason of that is that the getParameter is within the private Thread ? And, if it is the case, how the described problem can be resolved? ADDED I realized that I need to be more specific. My code is organized like that: public class GameWindow { ... private Agent agent; ... private Thread controller = new Thread() { public void run() { ... Agent agent = new Agent(); ... parameter = getParameter(); } } ... private String getParameter() { ... agent.someMethod(); ... } } ADDED 2 In the GameWindow I have: public void startWindow() { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { controller.start(); } }); }
