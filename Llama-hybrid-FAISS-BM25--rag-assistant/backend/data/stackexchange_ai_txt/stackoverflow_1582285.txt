How to remove elements from a generic list while iterating over it?

I am looking for a better pattern for working with a list of elements which each need processed and then depending on the outcome are removed from the list. You can't use .Remove(element) inside a foreach (var element in X) (because it results in Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute. exception)... you also can't use for (int i = 0; i and .RemoveAt(i) because it disrupts your current position in the collection relative to i . Is there an elegant way to do this?
