problem with dual horizontal scroll view touches

I've been dealing with this problem for weeks, and still no solution. please help. I have a big scroll view with images. each image is screen wide, and paging enabled. on this scroll view, in the bottom, i have another scroll view with button. each button for each image. when i push the image button, the big scroll view jump to the image. since i have a lot of images, i have a lot of buttons on the little scroll view. right now, the big scroll and small scroll are working ok, and the buttons also. my problem start at the far ends of the little scroll. when i'm in the end of the little scroll (but still in the middle of the big one) i don't want the big one to move when i move my finger to the dead end. you can say i want to separate the small scroll from the big one, but still leave him as a subview (because i want it to move with the big one). i've tried subclassing the little scroll, the buttons, override hitTest and touchesBegan/End but nothing so far. i'm realy realy frustrated because my costumer demands this to work his way. i've been googled for so long and i can't find anything! HELLLPPPPP!
