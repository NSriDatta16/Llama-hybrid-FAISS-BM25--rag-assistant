SEO Ajax and Asp.net MVC

I'm messing a little about how to allow Google to index Ajax content. I would like to clarify my ideas posting here until i understood: Apparently we have to provide to google a "pretty" url to index like /content/contentdetail#!id=0123456. For other hand we have to serve Html fragments for this pretty urls instead complete pages. We have to put in the page a tag to indicate to google that we will use this pretty urls: Could you explain me how it works? its only client javascript programming what i should do to implement it, or server too? I have to create a route for handle this types of urls? I have the feeling that I'm messing too much.
