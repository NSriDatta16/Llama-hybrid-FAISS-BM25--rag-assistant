Neural Networks for predicting Energy at particular date

I am trying to predict Solar Energy value at particular date.So,for this I am applying Artificial Neural Networks model.I am having problem in deciding activation function. Since sigmoid function gives me output 0-1 but I want output something like 256.33. So I thought to apply sigmoid for hidden layer and ReLu for output layer to keep non-linearity in networks.Can you suggest me what is the way to do this?What I am doing is correct?
