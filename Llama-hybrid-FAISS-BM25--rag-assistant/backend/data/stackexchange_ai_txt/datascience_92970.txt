Can identifiers be used to train a model?

I recently participated in some Machine Learning competition where we were asked to decide whether a rider should accept or not a course (~2k riders and ~140k courses). It came up that some of the winners used the identifier of the rider (an integer number unique for each rider) in their features which was discarded on default notebook and it greatly improved their score. Is it legitimate? can identifier be used to train a model?
