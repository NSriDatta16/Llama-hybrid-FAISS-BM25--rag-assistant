Equivariance vs Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks

Could someone please explain to me in details (possibly from mathematical point of view) what is the role of Equivariance and Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks, and how are they actually achieved? I found a similar question here but I did not get the full picture.
