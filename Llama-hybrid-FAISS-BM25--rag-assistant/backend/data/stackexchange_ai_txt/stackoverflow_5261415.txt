The functionality you are asking about is the default one for XtraGrid, DXGrid (WPF). I believe that you are using XtraGrid and do not understand the problem you ran into. Everything should work properly and should not require additional adjustments. Could you please explain the problem in greater details. If the XtraGrid does not allow the end-user to edit its data, we need to know which DataSource you are using.
