How can I make input data for logistic regression?

I have dataset with 6 category variables. each category variable shows some machine error codes ranging between 0 and some big number like 50000. I want to try Logistic Regression to build a predictive model with a binary outcome. As far as I know, Logistic Regression can accept and handle any combinations of category, binary, and numeric data types. What concerns me is that values of each category variable varies too large. I have added another variable, weekofday, that just indicates the day of the week like Monday, Tuesday, and etc.. I have mapped those days to [0 to Monday, 1 to Tuesday, 2 to WendesDay, 3 to Thursday, 4 to Friday, 5 to Saturday, 6 to Sunday]. I want to understand the right way with making right input feature with category variables with large category values. I have attached the data with my question. Hope to get some answers. data link to my question
