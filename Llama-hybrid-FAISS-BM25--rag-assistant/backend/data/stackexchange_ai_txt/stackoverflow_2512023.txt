If the parameters have nothing in common, then they probably shouldn't be referenced by an interface. Here is one way you can work around this: AgentA agentA = new AgentA(); agentA.setFooParameter("someValue"); someMethod(agentA); AgentB agentB = new AgentB(); agentB.setBarParameter(true); someMethod(agentB); where someMethod accepts the interface of the agent rather than a concrete class public void someMethod(IModel genericAgent) { ... } Essentially, instantiate the agents (which all extend IModel) as concrete classes (rather than IModel agentA = new AgentA(); ), set the parameters you need to on the concrete class and then pass around the interface rather than the concrete class.
