For the first part of your question, even if the user drags the mouse beyond the edge of your picture box, you don't have to use those coordinates for your drawing routine. Simply do something like If (DrawingPoint.X > PictureBox.Right) DrawingPoint.X = PictureBox.Right // Right-hand limit of picture box End If And similar for the Y direction. As for the negative numbers while drawing, you want to translate screen coordinates to client area coordinates. Have a look at ScreenToClient and ClientToScreen .
