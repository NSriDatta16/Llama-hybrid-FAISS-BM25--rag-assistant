Unittest in Django. What is relationship between TestCase class and method

I am doing some unit testing stuff in Django. What is the relationship between TestCase class and the actual method in this class? What is the best practice for organizing these stuff? For example, I have class Test(TestCase): def __init__(self): ... def testTestA(self): #test code def testTestB(self): #test code If I organize in this way: class Test1(TestCase): def __init__(self): ... def testTestA(self): #test code class Test2(TestCase): def __init__(self): ... def testTestB(self): ... Which is better and what is the difference? Thanks!
