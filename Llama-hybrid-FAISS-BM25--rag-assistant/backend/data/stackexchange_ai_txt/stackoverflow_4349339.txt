Firstly, don't store the password. Ever! Anywhere! Store a salted hash of the password. If you need to store this to pass to a webservice (or similar) have the webservice return a token on successful login and store that instead. Now, your actual question. You've answered the first part of it yourself though. Because you want the application to be responsive, when the application launches you should perform timely operations off of the UI thread. Data should be loaded from and saved to IsolatedStorage at times which are most appropriate to the application, the volume of data and the frequency with which it is needed or updated. In your specific instance, I wouldn't expect the retrieval of 2 strings from isolated stroage to be very slow at all and so I would perform their retrieval in the Loaded() event of the page in question. If you were just retrieving a username and password I would consider using IsolatedStorageSettings to persist these. If you also had lots of other details to store and needed these at about the same time you may want to store them all together so you could retrieve them all together.
