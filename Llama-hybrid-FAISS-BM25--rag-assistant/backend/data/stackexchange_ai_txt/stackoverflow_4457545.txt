Here's a sneaky way of doing it. Create a model called Business mapped to the vendors table: class Business Now add a belongs_to on Employee: class Employee :vendor_id ... end Call to_json on Employee passing in the "virtual" association as an option: Employee.first.to_json(:only=>:name,:include=>:business) # "{\"employee\":{\"name\":\"Curly\",\"business\":{\"name\":\"Moe's Garage\"}}}"
