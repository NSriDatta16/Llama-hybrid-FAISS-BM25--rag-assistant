NVARCHAR(X) in T-SQL translates to "UTF-16 encoding": each of the X characters is 16 bits wide. If you are storing human-readable text, you're probably better off using NVARCHAR for text storage. VARCHAR(X) implies 8-bit storage for the characters. This implies that some transcoding has to happen between your C# application (which uses UTF-16 internally in its string type) and your database. Save yourself some grief and use Unicode consistently where you are storing human-readable strings.
