While one can solve for a prior that yields a credible interval that equals the frequentist confidence interval, it is important to realize how narrow the scope of application is. The entire discussion is assuming that the sample size was fixed and is not a random variable. It assumes that there was only one look at the data, and that sequential inference was not done. It assumes there was only one dependent variable and no other parameters were of interest. Where there are multiplicities, the Bayesian and frequentist intervals diverge (Bayesian posterior probabilities are in forward-time predictive mode and don't need to consider "how we got here", thus have no way or need to adjust for multiple looks). In addition, in the frequentist world the interpretation of confidence intervals is extremely strange and has confused many a student and caused some frequentist statisticians to become Bayesian.
