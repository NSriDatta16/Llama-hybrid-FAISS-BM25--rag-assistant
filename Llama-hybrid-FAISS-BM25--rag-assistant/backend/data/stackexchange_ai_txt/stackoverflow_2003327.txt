I solved the problem - in rather brutal and unsafe way. But for it's gonna work as the temporary solution. Well, when I'm raising PageDragStart event, I call Mouse.Capture(this, CaptureMode.SubTree); When the page is dropped somewhere - DoDragDrop throws different exceptions (COMException, NullReference (I couldn't find which object is null) and some others I don't remember). I catch exception and call PageDragEnd event (if the property IsPageDraggingOut set to true). As far as you can see this solution is really dirty and bad. But it works. So, any other ideas (or some ideas how to work with Mouse.Capture properly)?
