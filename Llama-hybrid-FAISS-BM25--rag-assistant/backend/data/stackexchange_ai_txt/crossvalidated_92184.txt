Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for Markov Chain initial distribution?

I am working on using MLE to estimate a Markov Chain, I have successfully estimated the transition matrix $A$, using the method provided in http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/462/lectures/06/markov-mle.pdf Which is simply counting $A_{i,j} = N_{i,j}/\sum N_{i,j}$ But is there a way to estimate the initial distribution $\pi$ or named $\mu^{0}_{i}$s ? It seems like MLE can do it but I dont know how.
