Serious problem in android

I am doing an app where i have to download some videos from my server and i have to store them in internal storage of android device, but the problem is when iam storing the video in internal storage then the android not allowing to play that video if i am saving the same video on SD card it's working fine why it is happening i want to play the video from local storage. Thanks, Balaram.
