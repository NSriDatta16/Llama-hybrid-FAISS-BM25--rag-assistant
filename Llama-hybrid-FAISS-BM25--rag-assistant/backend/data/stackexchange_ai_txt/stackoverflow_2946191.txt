In fact, the node in your config.xml file doesn't do an "update". As a matter of fact, I think you have done that in your config.xml : mylayout.xml and you have done your modifications in mylayout.xml. In fact, you have to do : mylayout.xml And then, in mylayout.xml : By looking at my code and comparing the files to each other, you will understand better how it works. In fact, don't forget that all xml files are concatenated in magento. So that, all nodes in all config files, respecting the same order, will be concataneted. For example, in our case, the config.xml files of magento will be concatenated, and the result is ONE file containing : mylayout.xml checkout.xml If you had replaced by the resulting file would have looked : mylayout.xml Note the mylayout.xml. This is the reason why the original layout file is completely replaced by your own layout :) Hope that's clear, in french it would have been easier for me to explain ;) Hugues.
