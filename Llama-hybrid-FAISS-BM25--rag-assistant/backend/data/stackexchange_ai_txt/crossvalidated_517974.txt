The best thing to do here is really to get labeled data. It will do far more for you than any attempt to solve this problem. Especially in something as life-and-death crucial as COVID, deploying a poor model is unethical. What you’ve suggested is to take an unweighted average and threshold it: $\mathrm{COVID?} = \left[ 4 \geq \sum_{i=1}^6 f_i\right]$ , using the Iverson bracket notation. The issue here is that certain features may be more important than others, and it’s hard to choose where to place the threshold. A principled way of learning from partially observed data is a generative model. Naive Bayes is a generative model of the joint distribution of classes and features $p(c, \vec{f})$ . Normally we train it with supervision about the true class $c$ , but we can also train it unsupervised on the unlabeled data: maximize $p_\theta (\vec{f}) = \sum_c p_\theta (c, \vec{f})$ . This can be done either with EM or by directly optimizing the marginal likelihood by gradient ascent. If you decide in advance that there are two classes, you can cluster the data points into two sets based on which class has a higher $p(c \mid \vec{f})$ . (This decision rule is separate from the probabilistic model. When you actually decide which points to put into which cluster, you may want to tweak the threshold.) Alternatively, you could use the ratio $\frac{p (c_2 \mid \vec{f})}{p (c_1 \mid \vec{f})}$ to rank them. You mentioned PCA. You’re right that PCA (as a probabilistic model) isn’t appropriate for categorical variables. What I’ve suggested is a special case of exponential family PCA , which generalizes PCA to distributions like the Bernoulli distribution. That makes it appropriate for your binary variables. You aptly note that the true class is hard to find. One heuristic is to say that the cluster with more false variables overall is the not-high-risk cluster. In short, your intuitions about how to approach this problem in the absence of data are good. Getting more data is probably better.
