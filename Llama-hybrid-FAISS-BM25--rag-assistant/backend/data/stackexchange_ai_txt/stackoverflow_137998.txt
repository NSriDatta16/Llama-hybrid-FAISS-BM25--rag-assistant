Q's on pgsql

I'm a newbie to pgsql. I have few questionss on it: 1) I know it is possible to access columns by . , but when I try to access columns like . . it throwing error like Cross-database references are not implemented How do I implement it? 2) We have 10+ tables and 6 of have 2000+ rows. Is it fine to maintain all of them in one database? Or should I create dbs to maintain them? 3) From above questions tables which have over 2000+ rows, for a particular process I need a few rows of data. I have created views to get those rows. For example: a table contains details of employees, they divide into 3 types; manager, architect, and engineer. Very obvious thing this table not getting each every process... process use to read data from it... I think there are two ways to get data SELECT * FROM emp WHERE type='manager' , or I can create views for manager, architect n engineer and get data SELECT * FROM view_manager Can you suggest any better way to do this? 4) Do views also require storage space, like tables do? Thanx in advance.
