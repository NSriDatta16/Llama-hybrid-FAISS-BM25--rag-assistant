If you refer to an industrial prototype (i.e. something that is done to be used by real people and not for pure research) python is at the moment the only way to go. If you use Matlab, Octave or R you get an easy to use environment for ML research but it will be a nightmare to put the model at work with an user interface or with a web service. In python we are lucky to have both an extensive scientific ecosystem ( sklearn for ML, pandas for data wragling, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization) and an application ecosystem (think about django and its rest framework ). Python it's an easy language to learn. In the future I hope the Javascript ecosystem will become scientifically sound as the python one, but despite some great projects I don't see that coming soon. Don't wrap yourself in a box, use a general language!
