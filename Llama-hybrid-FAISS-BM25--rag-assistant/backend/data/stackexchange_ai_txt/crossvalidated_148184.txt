Combining multiple features in a classification task

This question is a little general, but I am looking for suggestions of a method. I have several images that contain images of animals and I have to characterize which animals they are, let's call them anm1 and anm2 (there are only 2 options). In order to do that I have written 4 different methods to characterize them in MATLAB (m1 m2 m3 m4). The different methods I am using are not important (they use different geometrical characteristics and they are independent of each other) but some of the methods are very accurate and some have several false positives/negatives. The way we classify is this: we are assuming in method1 that we have a cutoff1. If a geometrical index is over cutoff1 then it is anm1, if it is lower it is anm2. Some methods are more accurate which means that there less wrong characterizations of animals (the characterization is purely geometrical no regression or machine learning used). We have several animals on the images (up to 15),and some methods accurately identify all but 2 of them(i consider that pretty accurate) and others identify all but 4 or 6 of them which is not a good result.The different methods are examining different features of the image so I can not use just one of them. I want to use all 4 tests to characterize the animals so I am hoping to find a way to put weights on the different methods (so that I know which one to 'trust' more), so that I can use all four to give me the accurate characterization. I was wondering if anyone has a suggestion about what kind of test/technique to use.I am using MATLAB to do the analysis. Thank you.
