No, the Empirical Rule does not apply to all distributions. It is only for bell-shaped, continuous, symmetrical data. However, Chebychev postulates a similar concept for any continuous distribution. Here is a link to Chebychev's Theorem and its relation to the Empirical Rule . According to the article, For any numerical dataset, at least $1−\frac{1}{k^2}$ of the data lie within $k$ standard deviations of the mean, that is, in the interval with endpoints $x \pm ks$ for samples and with endpoints $\mu \pm k \sigma$ for populations, where $k$ is any positive whole number that is greater than $1$. ... It is important to pay careful attention to the words “at least” at the beginning of each of the three parts of Chebyshev’s Theorem. The theorem gives the minimum proportion of the data which must lie within a given number of standard deviations of the mean; the true proportions found within the indicated regions could be greater than what the theorem guarantees.
