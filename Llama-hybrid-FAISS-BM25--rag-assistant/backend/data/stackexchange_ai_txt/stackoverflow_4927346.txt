set jQuery autocomplete match criteria?

I've written a page with a jQuery UI autocomplete. The user is meant to use the autocomplete to select a location from a list of places. Prior to this improvement, the user had to select a location from a long list, and this would be much better except for one problem. The locations are formatted like this: "Canada" "Canada -> Alberta" "Canada -> British Colombia" "United States" "United States -> Alabama" "United States -> Alaska" and so on. So, I tested this application by typing in "CA" expecting a list countries and states that beging with "CA" like: "Canada", "United States -> California", "Mexico -> Campeche". However, much to my dismay, I see all the Canadian provinces listed one by one because the "CA" matches the "CA" in "Canada". I now have almost twenty options to choose from. The user must see the hierarchy with the name of the country and the name of the state when looking up a state, but "Canada" as a country must be a single match as a single location. How can I set up jQuery autocomplete to allow me to specify in so many words that only the text to the right of the "->" is to be matched? Right now, in my Javascript code, I have var locations = "[{'label':'Canada','value','Canada'},{'label':'Canada -> Alberta', 'value':'Alberta'}...]. I do not want to make this work asynchronously. I fear it would result in way too many web service calls.
