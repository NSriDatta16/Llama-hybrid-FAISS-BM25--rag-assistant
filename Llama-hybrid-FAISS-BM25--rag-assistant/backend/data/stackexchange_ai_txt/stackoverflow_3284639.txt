Getting Entitymanager/EJB inside a @FacesConverter/Validator of a WAR-packaged app

I have a JavaEE6-application running on Glassfish v3.0.1 with EJB 3.1 (app is packaged as WAR), and all my EJBs are @LocalBeans. Currently, i'm writing a FacesConverter for use in JSF2, in which i need the EntityManager to get an Entity back from an id. Now i wonder, which is the best and cleanest way to get the Entitymanager inside the FacesConverter, now that we are on JEE6? Or can i even access an EJB through the Expression Language? And Weld/CDI doesn't work inside a FacesConverter, or does it? @FacesConverter(value="subscriptionListConverter") class SubscriptionListConverter extends Converter { public Object getAsObject(FacesContext ctx, UIComponent comp, String value) { var id:Long = Long.parseLong(value); // How to get the entitymanager? return em.find(User.getClass, id); } public String getAsString(ctx:FacesContext, comp:UIComponent, value:Object) {...} } Sorry i hope this is no duplicate, but most cases i saw where slightly different and didn't help me much.
