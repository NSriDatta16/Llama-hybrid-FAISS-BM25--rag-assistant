Simple queue files along with a separate agent. For each type of out of band process write a separate agent .exe which watches a directory for queue files that include whatever data is needed to perform the specified process. This may seem dirty but in the real world I find it gives a lot of flexibility, you aren't doing a lot of processing in ASP.net process space and you could easily adapt this style to farm processing out to cheap Linux servers running the agent process on Mono for when you start needing more RAM/CPU/disk.
