Your 1st objective has to do with insights/interpretation and the 2nd one has to do with predictability/accuracy. Usually those two are not going together, especially when you have many variables. In practice you have to create simple models for interpretation (might be general and simplistic though) and more complex models for predictions. In your case I would suggest to perform various simple regression models first. 1) one predictor variable at a time will show you how important they are (individually) and if they have a positive or negative effect. 2) Two predictors plus interaction at a time will enable you to investigate interactions of interest. Then you use all your variables (plus interactions; all or selected ones) and focus on prediction. I'd encourage you to try some regression trees as well and compare findings. Tree models are great in spotting interactions (automatically). They won't give you coefficients to interpret, but they will give you a kind of variable grouping in terms of predicting your dependent variable.
