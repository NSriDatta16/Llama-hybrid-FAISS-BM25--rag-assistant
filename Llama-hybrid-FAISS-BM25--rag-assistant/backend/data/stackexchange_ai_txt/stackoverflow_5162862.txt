writing data in to files with java

I am writing a server in java that allows clients to play a game similar to 20 questions. The game itself is basically a binary tree with nodes that are questions about an object and leaves that are guesses at the object's identity. When the game guesses wrong it needs to be able to get the right answer from the player and add it to the tree. This data is then saved to a random access file. The question is: How do you go about representing a tree within a file so that the data can be reaccessed as a tree at a later time. If you know where I can find information on keeping data structures like trees organized as such when writing/reading to files then please link it. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the quick answers everyone. This is a school project so it has some odd requirements like using random access files and telnet.
