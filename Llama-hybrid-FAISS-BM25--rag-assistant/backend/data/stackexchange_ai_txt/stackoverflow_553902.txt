First of all, I would name the column 'StayDuration' or 'StayLength', as just 'Stay' by itself is still a little confusing. Once that is done, I see two acceptable approaches: Put your lengths in a separate table and have your existing column store a foreign key into that table. Store an integer, such that the value of the integer can be easily expanded into actual values for the stay length barriers via a simple formula. (Example: a 'short' stay could be 1 day or a less, 'medium' one week or less, and then everything else is long, you might use 0, 1, and 7 for your integers. I tend to avoid storing varchar-type data directly here. It requires more storage and makes it easy to end up with mis-typed or obsolete data. A hybrid approach is also possible, such that the 'keys' from the new table in the first option map to the integer values proposed in the 2nd.
