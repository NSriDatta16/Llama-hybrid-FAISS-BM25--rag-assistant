How to Install OpenCV2.0 in Mac OS 10.6.1 (Snow Leopard)

I am not a Unix guy, so I have been trying to install openCV 2.0 for days with out success. I just downloaded the opencv library form sourceforge from this page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/ Does any one know the exact unix terminal commands for installing it? please don't say "go to google", I already did. I found this: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide and this http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port but the explanations are not very good for unix beginners. installations always fails in the end. It would be great if I can make a framework. for example OpenCV.framework from the current source, So I can use it with Xcode, and Cocoa easier. thanks I did: downloaded it. extracted it. cd Downloads/OpenCV-2.0.0 ./make_frameworks.sh and got this when linking all the .o files. mv -f .deps/saving.Tpo .deps/saving.Plo mv -f .deps/logger.Tpo .deps/logger.Plo mv -f .deps/index_testing.Tpo .deps/index_testing.Plo libtool: link: (cd .libs/lib_clapack.lax/lib_clapack_floatstore.a && ar x "/Users/nacho4d/Downloads/OpenCV-2.0.0 3/build_i386/3rdparty/./.libs/lib_clapack_floatstore.a") ../libtool: line 961: cd: .libs/lib_clapack.lax/lib_clapack_floatstore.a: No such file or directory make[2]: *** [lib_clapack.la] Error 1 make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... mv -f .deps/flann.Tpo .deps/flann.Plo make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make: *** [all] Error 2 Creating universal Framework ============================================= cp: build_ppc/OpenCV.framework: No such file or directory lipo: can't open input file: build_ppc/OpenCV.framework/OpenCV (No such file or directory) Done ! Do I need to do something before running the shell script? EDIT : For the interested, I wrote a post on how to install and use OpenCV 2.1.1 on Macs here: http://nacho4d-nacho4d.blogspot.com/2010/07/blog-post.html
