NLP: Language Analysis Techniques and Algorithms

Situation: I wish to perform a Deep-level Analysis of a given text, which would mean: Ability to extract keywords and assign importance levels based on contextual usage. Ability to draw conclusions on the mood expressed. Ability to hint on the education level (word does this a little bit though, but something more automated) Ability to mix-and match phrases and find out certain communication patterns Ability to draw substantial meaning out of it, so that it can be quantified and can be processed for answering by a machine. Question: What kind of algorithms and techniques need to be employed for this? Is there a software that can help me in doing this?
