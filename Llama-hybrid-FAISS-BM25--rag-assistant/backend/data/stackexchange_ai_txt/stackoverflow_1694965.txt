This doesn't work well in Eclipse at all. You usually want your project checked into Eclipse either in a folder or at the root of your /trunk/ . You can obviously organize things better than shoving everything into trunk, but here's an example anyway: Example: tags branches trunk |- MyProject (Eclipse project) | |- php/html/js/whatever files | |- MyOtherProject (Eclipse project) | |- php/html/js/whatever files | |- ThirdParty (Also an Eclipse project) |- All third party libraries that are shared, if you so wish Why? 1) Checking out random files is a pain in Eclipse. Since everything in Eclipse is a project, the .project file rules. Therefore, whoever checks out your "folder" will have the same project configuration as you do, thus making it easier on the development team. 2) Better organized for multiple projects. Rather than have a completely new repository for another Web Project, you can just have multiple folders.
