The meaning of an explanatory variable in computing accuracy of a prediction model

I am following the logistic regression predictive modeling example found here , chapter 10. To the pred object the variable capital_gain is set, I assume, as a predictor variable. The response variable is income and its levels are " 50k". If I remove capital_gain from the pred object, the accuracy(pred, income, income_null) gives the same output, and the confusion matrix remains unchanged as well. library(yardstick) pred % select(income, capital_gain) %>% #why 'capital_gain' is here? bind_cols( predict(mod_null, new_data = train, type = "class") ) %>% rename(income_null = .pred_class) accuracy(pred, income, income_null) #Confusion matrix confusion_null % conf_mat(truth = income, estimate = income_null) confusion_null But the logistic regression model produces a result, that is only a little bit different from running the model without removing capital_gain from the pred object. This first picture is produced with capital_gain in the pred object. This second picture is produced without capital_gain in the pred object. As you can see, there are only small differences. So, I am trying to understand what is the meaning of having capital_gain in the pred object. Why removing it doesn't affect the prediction accuracy nor the confusion matrix, and why it affects the scatter plot? Data: census % mutate(income = factor(income)) library(tidymodels) set.seed(364) n % initial_split(prop = 0.8) train % training() This is the regression model: mod_log_1 % set_engine("glm") %>% fit(income ~ capital_gain, data = train) train_plus % mutate(high_earner = as.integer(income == ">50K")) ggplot(train_plus, aes(x = capital_gain, y = high_earner)) + geom_count( position = position_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05), alpha = 0.5 ) + geom_smooth( method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), color = "dodgerblue", lty = 2, se = FALSE ) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0.5), linetype = 3) + scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) This post is migrated from Stack Overflow EDIT: I tried to clarify my question
