is there off-the-shelf convenient way to filter by a group column in XtraGrid GridView?

I know I can invoke filter editor and so on. But this is not a convenient thing, especially for non technical users. Can GridView continually display a nice filter field for a group column as it does for normal columns? I know I can roll my own via filtering on a hidden column and so on, but that's a lot of work. Maybe there is a built-in way to do this instead?
