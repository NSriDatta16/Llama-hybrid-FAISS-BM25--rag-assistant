It's because the random forest algorithm being used is based on a conditional inference framework (rather than Breiman's original algorithm). It essentially determines whether a split should be carried out by using a p-value calculated from a permutation test, corrected for multiple comparisons. The main benefit of this approach over Breiman's is that conditional inference forests yield unbiased variable importance metrics. It's available in R using the party package, and you can read more about it here .
