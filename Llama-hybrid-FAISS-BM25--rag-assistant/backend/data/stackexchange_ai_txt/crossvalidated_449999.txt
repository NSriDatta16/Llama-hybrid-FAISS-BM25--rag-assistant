Machine learning with univariate time series

I am trying to make predictions with daily data with time series in R. This time series is univariate and contains only data from sales from each 365 days in a four year period. My intention is to make prediction with machine learning models from Caret. At the beginning I have problems finding proper regressors and to put them into models(regression,random forest etc.) So can anybody help me to resolve this problem?
