Why my products don't go out of stock when qty = 0 in Magento?

I tried to make a order with a product with an inventory of 1. When the order is completed, the stock is 0. It's ok. However, the Stock Availability is set to " In stock ". And the option Qty for Item's Status to become Out of Stock is set to 0 too. Do you have any ideas? I don't understand. Edit, here is the config: System > Configuration > Catalog > Inventory (Global) : Product > Inventory (Product specific)
