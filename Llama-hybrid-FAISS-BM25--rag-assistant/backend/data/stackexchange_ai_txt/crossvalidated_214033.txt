Clearly, feature selection and linear transformations (including PCA) cannot help you there. If the data is not separable in $n$ dimensions, it will remain inseparable in $m Non-linear transformations may help you, and in theory Isomap is a non-linear transformation, but my intuition tells me that Isomap should not be of any use to separate the data. The standard isomap is "color blind" or "class blind" - it will find the "curved subspace" (or the manifold) where most of your data lies, and as far as I can see that will not separate your classes, unless your data was already "separated" but "not linearly" See for instance the figure on the Swiss roll here https://www.researchgate.net/figure/11580034_fig1_Fig-1-A-The-Swiss-roll-data-used-by-Tenenbaum-et-al-1-to-illustrate-their The classes/colors in figure A are "separated" and the isomap just flattens the subspace (figure b) and now the data is linearly separated.
