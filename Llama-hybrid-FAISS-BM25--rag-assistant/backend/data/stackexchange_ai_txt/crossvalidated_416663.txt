You can use OneClassSVM or IsolationForest. The purpose of these algorithms are to find what is normal by learning the distribution of the normal things. You need to fit them with normal data, then they will do a binary classification and say what is not normal. This is also the idea behind auto encoder in anomaly detection (you point out in your article). You expect your anomaly to be rare, so by learning an auto encoder, you should detect the anomaly by getting the data which have bad reconstruction rate. If you do clustering, you can try a DBSCAN. Anyway, all those algorithms are not magic. They need parameters, and according to how you set them you will detect different things. For example, in DBSCAN you need to set the distance (or the similarity, to say which data are similar) and some parameters saying your tolerance to noise. The best way in anomaly detection is to try out those algorithms and little by little get more and more insight on the data. When you will know well your data, you can do good feature extraction which will feed well your algorithm (in fact this is just data science life :D)
