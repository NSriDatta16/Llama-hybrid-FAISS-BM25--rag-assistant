I thought it was a joke at the beginning ;-) Anyway I assume you're talking about ADO, as in your title. Here you can find stuff. This site will help you with the connection strings for different database. The difference between access and sql server using ADO it is exactly the connection string. I would suggest you to avoid Remote Data Controls cause make your life simpler at the beginning but then you have to struggle with them cause they don't work properly. This is an example of connection and fetch of data: Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command Dim strSql As String cnn.ConnectionString = _ "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" & _ "Data Source=m:\testdbSource\testSource.mdb;" & _ "User Id=admin;Password=;" cnn.Open cmd.ActiveConnection = cnn cmd.CommandType = adCmdText cmd.CommandText = "select * from tblSource" cmd.Execute Set cmd = Nothing cnn.Close Set cnn = Nothing This sample works for me: Function Testing() On Error GoTo Error_Handling Dim MyDb As String Dim conConnection As New ADODB.Connection Dim cmdCommand As New ADODB.Command Dim rstRecordSet As New ADODB.Recordset MyDb = "db1.mdb" With conConnection .Provider = "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0" .ConnectionString = App.Path & "\" & MyDb .Open End With With cmdCommand .ActiveConnection = conConnection .CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Opt_In_Customer_Record;" .CommandType = adCmdText End With With rstRecordSet .CursorType = adOpenStatic .CursorLocation = adUseClient .LockType = adLockOptimistic .Open cmdCommand End With Do While Not rstRecordSet.EOF MsgBox "Record " & rstRecordSet.AbsolutePosition & " " & _ rstRecordSet.Fields(0).Name & "=" & rstRecordSet.Fields(0) & " " & _ rstRecordSet.Fields(1).Name & "=" & rstRecordSet.Fields(1) rstRecordSet.MoveNext Loop conConnection.Close Set conConnection = Nothing Set cmdCommand = Nothing Set rstRecordSet = Nothing Exit Function Error_Handling: MsgBox "Error during function Testing!" MsgBox Err.Description End Function
