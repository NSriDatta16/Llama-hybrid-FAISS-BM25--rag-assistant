Validation of Neural Networks

As data analytics and machine-learning approaches become more and more integrated, proper validation of such models also gain traction. Since validation of models are a necessity in many industries such as banking and finance, and are used extensively for traditional credit/market risk models, the question becomes how to effectively validate ANN models? For instance, assuming a neural network can actually achieve a reasonable performance confirmed through the validation set, How can one demonstrate and make the case that the hyper parameters chosen are indeed 'close-to-optimal' parameters? hyper parameters such as number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, drop out rate, etc.
