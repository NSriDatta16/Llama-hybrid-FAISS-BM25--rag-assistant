Based on Java's List toString implementation: Iterator i = list.iterator(); for (;;) { sb.append(i.next()); if (! i.hasNext()) break; ab.append(", "); } It uses a grammar like this: List --> (Item , )* Item By being last-based instead of first-based, it can check for skip-comma with the same test to check for end-of-list. I think this one is very elegant, but I'm not sure about clarity.
