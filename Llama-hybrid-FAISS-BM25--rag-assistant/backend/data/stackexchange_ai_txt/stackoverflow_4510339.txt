In Android, is Task == Application?

The terms "task" and "application" are both part of the new Android terminology I am learning. In the Activities and Tasks section in the Dev Guide, the following sentence caught my attention: The user presses the HOME key, goes to the application launcher, and selects a new application (actually, a new task) . Which raised the question: Is "task" a synonym for "application" in the Android world? If not, what are the differences between the two?
