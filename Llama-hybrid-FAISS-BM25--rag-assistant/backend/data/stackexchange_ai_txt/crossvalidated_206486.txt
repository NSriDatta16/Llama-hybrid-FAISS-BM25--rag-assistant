Normalising features extracted using a CNN?

I have used a pre-trained CNN to extract features from training and test images sets. The same CNN was used for all images. The CNN includes normalization layers. Before training a classifier (SVM etc) on these feature vectors, should they be normalized? I.e: scaler3 = preprocessing.StandardScaler() X = scaler3.fit_transform(X_train) Xt = scaler3.transform(X_test) Normally, I would, but I am unsure in this case as they derive from the same CNN. Thanks.
