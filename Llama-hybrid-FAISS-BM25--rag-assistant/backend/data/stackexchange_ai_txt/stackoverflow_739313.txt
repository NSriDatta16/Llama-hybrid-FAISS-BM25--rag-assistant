The whole point of the table is to be able to search by color. Does anyone have a workaround Yes, use BOOLEAN MODE searches, which are not affected by the 50% threshold and are less unpredictable. But, +1 to tpdi's answer, I can't imagine why you're using fulltext search instead of a simple join table listing the colours. It's a simple yes/no logical storage problem, there's no need to drag in the fulltext complexities of word-splitting, word ordering, stopwords, too-short words (“red” will not be indexed by default) and most of all the fact that you have to use nasty old MyISAM tables to get the feature at all! Fulltext search is hard in general, and not particularly well-implemented in MySQL. It should be your last resort for when you really do need to search for words in large stretches of text, and not as a feature of choice.
