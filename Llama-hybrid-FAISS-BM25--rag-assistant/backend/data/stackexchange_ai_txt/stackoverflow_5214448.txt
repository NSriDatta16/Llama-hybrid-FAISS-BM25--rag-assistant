Set up 3 tables like you proposed, e.g.: CREATE TABLE supporters ( supid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(32) ); CREATE TABLE organizations ( orgid INTEGER PRIMARY_KEY, name VARCHAR(32) ); CREATE TABLE supports ( supid INTEGER NOT NULL, orgid INTEGER NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY(supid) REFERENCES supporters(supid), FOREIGN KEY(orgid) REFERENCES organzations(orgid) ); You can then create supporters and organizations and add ids of both into the supports table so. (Note: The SQL will work in sqlite, but it's just for demonstration purposes). For each supporter that belongs to an organization, add his supporter id and the organization id in the supports table. There is no redundancy here; don't worry about duplicating the id's; they're needed to establish the relationship between the supporters and the organizations. It will look less "redundant" the more columns you add to the supporters and organizations tables.
