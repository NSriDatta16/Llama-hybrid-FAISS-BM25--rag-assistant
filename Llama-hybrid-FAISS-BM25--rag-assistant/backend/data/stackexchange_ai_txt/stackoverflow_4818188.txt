Edit: Sounds like this has to be an issue with timing or with random access to the stream. Things you could try: Try loading the entire image into an in memory array - a MemoryStream - and then use that in the SetSource call Try removing the unused code - the .ImageOpened delegate and the img = new Image() call if those things don't help then try checking the two streams at the byte level. For more info on 1, see How Do I Load an Image from Isolated Storage and Display it on the Device? - note that this is Microsoft's support official sample and it loads the image into an in memory MemoryStream before using it in the on-screen Image. Microsoft's code: // The image will be read from isolated storage into the following byte array byte [] data; // Read the entire image in one go into a byte array using (IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { // Open the file - error handling omitted for brevity // Note: If the image does not exist in isolated storage the following exception will be generated: // System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException was unhandled // Message=Operation not permitted on IsolatedStorageFileStream using (IsolatedStorageFileStream isfs = isf.OpenFile("WP7Logo.png", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) { // Allocate an array large enough for the entire file data = new byte[isfs.Length]; // Read the entire file and then close it isfs.Read(data, 0, data.Length); isfs.Close(); } } // Create memory stream and bitmap MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(data); BitmapImage bi = new BitmapImage(); // Set bitmap source to memory stream bi.SetSource(ms); // Create an image UI element – Note: this could be declared in the XAML instead Image image = new Image(); // Set size of image to bitmap size for this demonstration image.Height = bi.PixelHeight; image.Width = bi.PixelWidth; // Assign the bitmap image to the image’s source image.Source = bi; // Add the image to the grid in order to display the bit map ContentPanel.Children.Add(image); Please do report back on what fixed it.
