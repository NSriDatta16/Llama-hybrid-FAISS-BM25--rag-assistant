Should I Use a Code Coverage Tool?

I'm interested in using a code coverage tool for my next .NET project but was wondering if it is necessary for me? I'm the only developer in the company I work for, so would using NCover be a benefit to me or is it just for large teams using continuous integration? Thanks
