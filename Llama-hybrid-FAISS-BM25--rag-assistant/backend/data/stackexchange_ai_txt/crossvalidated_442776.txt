A couple of points: These models are nested and therefore you can also use formal hypothesis testing using F-test to compare them. These F-test are provided by the lmerTest package. In general it is not good to only look at measures like AIC or p-values to decide which terms to include in the model, especially the fixed effects in this case. You should also see how substantive is the difference between the additive model chickm3 and the interaction model chickm4 . You could more easily assess this using an effects plots - see, e.g., the effects or ggeffects packages. Indeed the effect that the intercept of the model does not correspond to the average value you have for Time equal to zero and Diet equal to the reference level is because you fit a line, and the estimate of the slope also affects the estimate of the intercept. You could mitigate this affect but fitting a nonlinear model for the Time variable using, e.g., splines. Finally, regarding the convergence warning message, you could ignore it in this case because it is very close to the tolerance value.
