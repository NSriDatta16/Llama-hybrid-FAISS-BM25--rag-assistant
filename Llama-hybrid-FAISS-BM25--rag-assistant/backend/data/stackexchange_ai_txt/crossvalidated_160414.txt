MATLAB is a great tool. However for Machine Learning simulation there is an increasing interest in R. R is emerging as a great platform for Machine Learning, Data Mining, Statistical Modelling (etc.) tasks. R has got a rich range of packages for statistical modelling. With the emergence of Big Data R has got a positive edge. If you need to perform your computation on large and distributed sets of data then R is a great tool. R has got integration APIs for Hadoop and also for Spark. Talking about production system and real life intelligent software products could be created using R. In such products you could use a mix of technologies. Like if you need to create an Enterprise Analytics application then you could program the core logic of the application in JAVA and use R for statistical and modelling aspects. Following articles give a nice explanation as how to integrate R with Java: R Tutorial: How to integrate R with Java using Rserve R Tutorial: How to integrate R with Java using rJava So other environments are also great but R is emerging at par with them. I hope this will be of some help.
