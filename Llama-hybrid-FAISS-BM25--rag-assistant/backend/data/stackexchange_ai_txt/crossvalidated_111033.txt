The problem you find concerning a statistically significant MANOVA output, but no statistically significant univariate ANOVA's, lies in the very nature of a MANOVA. A MANOVA differs from several univariate ANOVA's in the fact that you control for mutual relationships. So, you do not only test several 't-tests' or ANOVA's, but there is more to it. This can explain the fact that you do not find seperate significant results, although you're MANOVA is statistically significant. So, apparently gender has an effect on the combination of empathy scales, but not on the empathy scales independently. For an excellent paper on this difference, check Huberty and Morris' article on the difference between an ANOVA and MANOVA.
