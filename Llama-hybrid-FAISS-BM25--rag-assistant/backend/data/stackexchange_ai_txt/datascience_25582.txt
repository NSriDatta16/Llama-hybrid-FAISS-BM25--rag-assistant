Actually, the documentation was pretty clear. I'll keep it posted in case someone else searches before reading: The TfidfTransformer transforms a count matrix to a normalized tf or tf-idf representation. So although both the CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer (with use_idf=False ) produce term frequencies, TfidfTransformer is normalizing the count.
