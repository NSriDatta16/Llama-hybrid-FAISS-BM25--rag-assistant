Magento - Change attribute select to dropdown list in Adv Search

I've been trying to find a way of forcing an attribute to show as a dropdown rather than a block of options but had no luck. The code current looks like this: case 'select': ?> getAttributeSelectElement($_attribute) ?> Does anyone know how to make this look like a dropdown list instead? Thanks in advance
