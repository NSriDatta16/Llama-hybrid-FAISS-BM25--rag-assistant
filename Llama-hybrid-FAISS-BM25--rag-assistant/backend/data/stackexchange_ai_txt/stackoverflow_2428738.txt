How do you fix a MySQL "Incorrect key file" error when you can't repair the table?

I'm trying to run a rather large query that is supposed to run nightly to populate a table. I'm getting an error saying Incorrect key file for table '/var/tmp/#sql_201e_0.MYI'; try to repair it but the storage engine I'm using (whatever the default is, I guess?) doesn't support repairing tables. how do I fix this so I can run the query?
