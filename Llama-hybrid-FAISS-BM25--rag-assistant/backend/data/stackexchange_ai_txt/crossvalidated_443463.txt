If you think of dimensionality reduction only through linear transformations $T: V \rightarrow U$ , say $V = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $U \subset V$ , the transformation can be described by a $n \times n$ matrix but it is not full rank as $\text{dim}(\text{im}(T)) = \text{dim}(U) . The matrix is not invertible and there is no one-to-one mapping. Also by rank nullity theorem, $\text{dim}(\text{ker}(T)) = \text{dim}(V) - \text{dim}(\text{im}(T)) \geq 1$ . So there is at least one line in the space that is mapped to 0 with this dimensionality reducing transformation, and the map is clearly not bijective.
