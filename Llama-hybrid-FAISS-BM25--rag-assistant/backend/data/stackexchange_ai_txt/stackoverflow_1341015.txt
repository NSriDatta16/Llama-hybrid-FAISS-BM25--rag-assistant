Why is my for loop stopping after one iteration?

Racking my brains on this one. I have the code below: the first stages of a JavaScript game. All the objects are well-defined and I'm using jQuery for DOM interaction. The puzzle is created with the following JS code: var mypuzzle = new puzzle("{solution:'5+6+89',equations:[['5+3=8',23,23],['5+1=6',150,23],['5+3=6',230,23]]}"); However, the loop at the bottom of the code won't go further than the first iteration. Any idea why? No errors are thrown at all. function equationBox(equation, top, left) {//draggable equation box this.reposition = function() { this.top = 0; this.left = 0; } this.top = 0;//make random this.left = 0;//make random this.equation = equation; if(top && left) { this.top = top; this.left = left; } this.content = this.equation.LHS.string + ' = ' + this.equation.RHS.string; this.DOM = $(' ').html(this.content); } function puzzle(json) { this.addEquationBox = function(equationBox) { $('#puzzle #equations').append(equationBox.DOM); } this.init = function() { //this.drawPuzzleBox(); this.json = JSON.parse(json); this.solution = new expression(this.json.solution || ''); this.equations = this.json.equations || []; var iterations = this.equations.length; for(i=0;i
