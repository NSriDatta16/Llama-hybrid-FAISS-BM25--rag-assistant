There's something you can do: limit the working set size of your process. Paste this into your Main() method: #if DEBUG Process.GetCurrentProcess().MaxWorkingSet = new IntPtr(256 * 1024 * 1024); #endif That limits the amount of RAM your process can claim, preventing other processes from getting swapped out completely. Other things you can do: Add more RAM, no reason to not have at least 3 Gigabytes these days. Defrag your paging file. That requires defragging the disk first, then defrag the paging file with, say, SysInternals' pagedefrag utility. Especially the latter maintenance task is important on old machines. A fragged paging file can dramatically worsen swapping behavior. Common on XP machines that never were defragged before and have a smallish disk that was allowed to fill up. The paging file fragmentation causes a lot of disk head seeks, badly affecting the odds that another process can swap itself back into RAM in a reasonable amount of time.
