How to combine several categorical variables into one quality of health measure?

I am new to SPSS, and am trying to use SPSS to generate a variable on the quality of health service available to the residents of an area. Below are the categorical variables that could tell me the quality of health available to them. no insurance covering health care cost no access to ambulance service poor attention by medical personnel poor medical equipment poor drug provision time taken from dwelling to health centre more than 30mins poor waiting time at health facility health facility not available within neighbourhood How can I generate a number value on the quality of health of this population from the number values of these variables, bearing in mind that several respondents may affirm each variable as true.
