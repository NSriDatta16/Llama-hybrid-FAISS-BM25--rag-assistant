The only reasonable (much less "elegant") way to handle exceptions is to log them if you can't recover from them. Then notify the user there was a problem and offer them the chance to try again (if it's an interactive program). If your application is exclusively for .NET developers, go ahead and show them the exception message (though Exception.ToString is better, since it includes a stack trace). Otherwise, don't display exception messages in your user interface - that's a security hole and will only confuse your users.
