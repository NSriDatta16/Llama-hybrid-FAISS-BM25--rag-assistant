Speaker Verification with TRILLsson

I am searching for models suitable for Speaker Verification. I stumbled across the TRILLsson models. It seems to be usable for Speaker Verification, but i haven't managed to make it work yet. I tried to calculate difference between speakers the way it is done in NVIDIA NeMo toolkit's EncDecSpeakerLabelModel : import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np [...] # m is the loaded TRILLsson model em1 = m(x)['embedding'] em1=tf.squeeze(em1) em2 = m(y)['embedding'] em2=tf.squeeze(em2) X = em1/tf.linalg.norm(em1) Y = em2/tf.linalg.norm(em2) X=X.numpy() Y=Y.numpy() similarity_score = np.dot(X, Y) / ((np.dot(X, X) * np.dot(Y, Y)) ** 0.5) similarity_score = (similarity_score + 1) / 2 Unfortunately the generated embeddings are quite similar for different speakers. I used samples from Librivox audiobooks for testing. Is Speaker Verification with TRILLsson even possible?
