I can't answer your question directly. You (someone in your company) should contact the parties who are syndicating your content without permission, and try to get them to do it with permission. You should clarify your policy on unauthorised syndication. This is of course a business decision and your business development / process people and IP lawyers will probably have to get involved. If they persistently continue to do it and you absolutely need to get them to stop, you can start serving junk to their robots. Detecting their robots may be nontrivial, as they will probably be forging a "real" user-agent header and using varying IP addresses (Most miscreants seem to use EC2 these days), however, if you are successful then their web sites will become full of junk. Once their web sites become full of junk (or worse) then you can contact them again asking them if they'd like to stop their obnoxious behaviour.
