ssh executing commands remotely, how PATH is determined?

I have a bash script that uses ssh to execute commands remotely. I spotted however quite considerable difference in behaviour depending whether I launch commands in the background or not: ssh host cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3 vs. ssh host "cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3" & In the second case, some commands are not executed correctly because they don't appear on $PATH. It seems the environment is different in those two situations (when passing env as command I noticed quite considerable differences). How to explain that ? I know I could override PATH variable but is there a way to do it more in a elegant way to have the second example behave like first with "&" feature ?
