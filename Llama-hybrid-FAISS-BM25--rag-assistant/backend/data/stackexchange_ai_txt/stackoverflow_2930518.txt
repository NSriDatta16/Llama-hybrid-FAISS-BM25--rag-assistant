FlagBank would be fairly descriptive. But I have one suggestion. Instead of using uint32_t and bit masking, it might be less C-like to use an STL vector instead. It uses a template specialization for the boolean case where only one bit per element is used for the storage. Very efficient and MUCH more object oriented.
