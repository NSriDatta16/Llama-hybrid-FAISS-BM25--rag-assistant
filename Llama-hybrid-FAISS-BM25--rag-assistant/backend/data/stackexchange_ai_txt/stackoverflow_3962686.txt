I discourage you from trying to do this - writing files into the internals of JBoss is liable to give unpredictable results, depending on the specific setup of the server. Instead, I suggest writing the file to a temporary location on the filesystem, independent of JBoss. Then, write a Spring MVC controller to service requests for the file.
