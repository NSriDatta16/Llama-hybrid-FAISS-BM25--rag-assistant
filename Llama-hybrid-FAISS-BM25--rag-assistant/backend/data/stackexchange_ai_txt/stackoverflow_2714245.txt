My guess is that robots will not bother going through a registration process. Your average simple-minded robot simply spams into a form that requires no other action (authentication, identification) at all. The mere act of asking for one or more extra clicks will prevent most simple-minded "attacks." If you look at the blog site for Coding Horror, they use a captcha with a constant capture word. On the other hand, while a few extra clicks will deter dumb robots, they will not deter human spammers, jokers, griefers, etc. But then again, throwaway email addresses are pretty easy to come by, so if someone truly wants to fill your site with junk they can. My conclusion is this: I guess you will get about 10% to 20% more "junk" on your pages, and between 5% and 25% more "desired" accesses, depending on how badly it was bothering your potential customers. Thus, I don't see any big harm in removing the email barrier.
