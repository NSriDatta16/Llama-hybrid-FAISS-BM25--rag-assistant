I think it should be much easier to convert each page to image and train CNN that classify one page from the book, paper, etc. Then you can try to propagate each page from the book through the CNN and aggregate obtained results for each page. You can use different aggregation methods. For instance, you can average all probability distribution vectors and choose classes that has highest probability. Or you can find class that appears more often after classifying each page. For instance, if book has 10 pages and 8 of the classified as a book and 2 of them classified as a report then you classify it as a book. Another idea is to classify only first page, might be quite useful prediction feature. Or during the aggregation you can just give higher weight for the first page (make it more important than other page). There are some many possibilities... I think it would be so much complicated to get it work with RNN that has an input raw PDF structure. I don't suggest even trying it. I think you can achieve pretty good results with CNN per each page separately.
