If you have a java capable server and java clients, I would seriously consider using Apache ActiveMQ. A JMS topic works really well for this kind of push things (unless you have ambitions to dethrone twitter). When other things need to get access to these notifications, it might be good to look at Apache Camel. This allows the notifications to be accepted and routed to different locations, i.e. xmpp, email, http, dropping files in a directory,.... Camel comes with a whole bunch of existing interface to various protocols. It has some simple DSL's to quickly reconfigure routings and add protocols or other filter, transformers, etc... Both products are extremely simple to embed in an existing application.
