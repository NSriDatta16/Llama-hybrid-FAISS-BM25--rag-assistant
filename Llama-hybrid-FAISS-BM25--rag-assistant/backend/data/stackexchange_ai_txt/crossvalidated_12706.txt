How to deal with negative coefficients in logistic regression

I have 5 single factor regression models. Each has intuitive (positive) coefficients which is good. If I run multiple logistic regression one of the coefficients turns negative. If I run stepwise selection, the negative coefficient stays in ... it's not redundant ... How should I deal with this? Is there a way to enforce positive coefficients?
