CRT types across process boundaries

I'm doing drag/drop out of an activeX control. On drag, I provide a CComQIPtr which has COM methods implemented to pass information to the drop target. On drop, the drop target's process calls my COM methods to get information. Am I not allowed to use CRT types or pointers to CRT types near that interface boundary? I would love for my IDataObject to have a private std::list and some std::strings, and on the foreign side of the interface be able to call my COM methods which can access those private members. I think it's OK because I'm not actually passing CRT types across the boundary. MSDN: Potential Errors Passing CRT Objects Across DLL Boundaries
