Detrending a nice series with dummys and a break

I have a problem with a time series. In short: How do I detrend a time series with a break and some big outliers? Long version: I want to detrend a time series into a trend and some cyclical components. The time series looks like this: and the values can be found here Using the augmented Dickey-Fuller-Test I get the following results: Which means I can not reject the Null hypothesis that my time series has a unit root (the same is true when I use a constant without a trend or no constant and no trend). Even though unit root tests have a low power I don't think I should reject the Null hypothesis. Looking at the time series again this is what I see. There are some huge outliers at t=18 and around t=100. Apart from that there seams to be a permanent shock (break) in the time series at around t=40. Looking at the literature I found some reasonable explanations for the split in the time series as well as the big outliers at t=18. My problem is the following: How do I detrend the time series allowing for a break and without considering the outliers? As far as I know there are only two possibilities: (1) Using an OLS regression from t=1 to t=40 as well as some dummies for t=17, t=18 and t=19 and estimating another regression from t=41 to t=106. Problem: the cyclical components for t=17, 18 and 19 will be zero so I loose effectively 3 observations. Another problem is that this method does not really make the series stationary. or (2) Replace the big outliers at t=17, t=18 and t=19 with some new values base in interpolation (maybe linear Interpolation) see for example this paper . After this I would estimate a quadratic regression or a moving average. p. s. I know that there are many other methods to detrend time series: First difference (values are negative so I can't use this), moving average (requires a lot of observations), Hodrick-Prescott-Filter (I don't really want to use this one) and Bandpass Filter (not sure about this). Sorry for the messy post. Thank you for your answers. p.s. (1) Using an AR(1) Model: $$y_t=\alpha_0 +\alpha_1 y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$ I get stationary residuals that look like this: There are some big outliers at t=18;19;20;21 that are the result of an exogenous shock that I don't want to consider in my considerations). My idea was to use the regression AR(1) with some dummy variables (I try different settings (alone and together) with dummys for t=18; t=19;t=20 and t=21). But when I do this the residuals become non-stationary again (For the Dickey-Fuller Test I can not reject the null Hypothesis while for the Phillips-Perron Test I can...). So I'm stuck again...
