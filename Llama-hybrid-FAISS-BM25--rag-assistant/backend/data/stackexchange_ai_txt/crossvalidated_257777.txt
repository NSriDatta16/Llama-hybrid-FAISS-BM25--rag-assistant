Stationarity of categorical time series

I'm familiar with real-valued time series' stationarity, but what does it mean for $X_{t}$, a categorical-valued time series, to be stationary? Edit: an example of $X_{t}$ is the reduction of daily rainfall volumes to a binary series of 'd' and 'w' for dry and wet.
