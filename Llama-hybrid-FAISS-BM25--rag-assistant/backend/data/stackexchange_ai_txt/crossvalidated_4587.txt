I work in academy and I'm using multicore for some heavy benchmarks of machine learning algorithms, mostly on our Opteron based Sun Constellation and some smaller clusters; those are also rather embarrassingly parallel problems so multicore's main role is to spread computation over node without multiplication of memory usage.
