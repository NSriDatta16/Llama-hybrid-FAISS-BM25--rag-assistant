Fiddler won't filter results in Windows 7

I'm having some trouble getting Fiddler to apply any filters to the session results, or to restrict the results by process or host, or anything else. I'm running Fiddler as administrator in Windows 7 (otherwise it shows no results), and under filters I've tried a number of different settings, including "Hide the following Hosts," "Show only the following Hosts," and "Show only Intranet Hosts." I have "Show only Internet Explorer traffic" checked. But in all cases the sessions list still returns all outgoing HTTP traffic. These are requests from other browser windows and applications (for example, constant requests to mail.google.com and api.twitter.com if I happen to have those open). Of course I can close some of these browser tabs or apps, but that doesn't entirely address the problem and I actually need several of those things open while debugging. I'm getting by, but this is greatly interfering with Fiddler's usefulness. I've tried using the process filter by dragging the crosshairs to Internet Explorer. But it still shows requests from Chrome and everything else. If I select "Hide Image Requests" under Rules, images still show up in my sessions list. I've also tried directly editing the CustomRules.js file to hide a subset of host names, and then restarted Fiddler. In both that file and the application settings, I've tried several variations of the complete hostname, partial host names, and wildcards. No luck - every request still shows up in the sessions list. So it's basically like none of the rules are being applied to the application, no matter what I try. Any ideas would be appreciated.
