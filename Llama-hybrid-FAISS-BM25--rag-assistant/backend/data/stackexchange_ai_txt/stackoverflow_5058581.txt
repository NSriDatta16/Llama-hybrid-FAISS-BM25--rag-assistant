When you instantiate your sub-view controller, pass in a reference to the navigation controller (super's), and store it in an instance variable. You can then reference it when you need it in the sub. I have been looking for a more elegant solution to this and similar problems, without success. Passing in a reference works, so I do that and try to get on with my life. EDIT: add code sample In mainVC.m // this might be in didSelectRowForIndexPath: SubViewController *subVC = [[SubViewController alloc] init]; subVC.superNavController = self.navController; [self.navigationController pushViewController:subVC animated:YES]; In SubViewController.h @property (nonatomic, retain) UINavigationController *superNavController; In SubViewController.m @synthesize superNavController; // then, wherever you need it, say to pass to a sub-sub-viewController... [self.superNavController pushViewController:myNewVC animated:YES];
