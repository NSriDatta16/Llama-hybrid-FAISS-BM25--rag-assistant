This Question has two interesting and somewhat similar parts. The first question is in the title and the second is the question about the data table you provided. Title. Suppose the data are normal in particular, or symmetrical in general (provided that the population mean exists). Then it is possible to get a reasonable estimate of $\mu$ as the midrange, which is halfway between the max and the min. For example, if I take a sample of size $n = 100$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 50, \sigma = 5),$ then let's compare the sample mean $\bar X$ (the best estimate of $\mu)$ with the sample midrange. [Notice that in R, range gives the max and min, not the range. Subtract (max - min) to get the true range and average (min+max)/2 to get the midrange.] set.seed(810) x = rnorm(100, 50, 5) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 38.71 46.71 49.51 50.13 53.62 63.91 mean(x) [1] 50.12619 range(x); mean(range(x)) [1] 38.71067 63.91233 [1] 51.3115 For this sample, we know the population mean is $\mu=50$ (only because this is a simulation), that the sample mean is $50.13$ and the midrange is $51.31.$ Many statistics books show that the standard deviation of the sample mean is $SD(\bar X) = \sigma/\sqrt{n},$ which is $\sigma_{\bar X} = 5/\sqrt{100} = 0.50$ in our example. By simulation of a million such samples, we can get a good approximation of the standard deviation of the midrange: $1.52 > 0.50.$ Because the sample mean is a much less variable estimator than the midrange, we prefer to use the sample mean when possible. set.seed(2020) mr = replicate(10^6, mean(range(rnorm(100,50,5)))) sd(mr) [1] 1.524349 Above I have answered the question suggested by the title of your question. Table. However, it your table, you don't have the true "range" of anything. You have interval endpoints for income categories. You might guess the income of each subject in the list lies at the middle of his/her income category. Then average those midpoints to estimate the population mean income. A similar method is often used to estimate the mean of a histogram when only interval endpoints and frequencies are available. If you went to the trouble of making a histogram of subject incomes from data in your table, then you could estimate the mean income of the sampled subjects as $\bar X \approx \frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^K f_im_i,$ where $n$ is the sample size, $K$ is the number of histogram intervals, $f_i$ are the frequencies of the intervals and $m_i$ are interval midpoints. That would amount to the same thing as the method mentioned in the previous paragraph. Notes: (1) For the question about the table, perhaps see this related Q&A (2) For the question in the title, sometimes the sample midrange is a better estimator of the population mean than is the sample mean. Consider a sample of $n=100$ from a population distributed $\mathsf{Unif}(10, 20)$ with population mean $\mu = 15.$ In my sample below the sample midrange $15.01$ is closer to $\mu$ than is the sample mean $\bar X = 14.37.$ (The technical reasons the sample midrange is better in this case than the sample mean are perhaps best left for another discussion.) set.seed(1234) u = runif(100, 10, 20) mean(u); mean(range(u)) [1] 14.37497 [1] 15.00823
