Unmanaged solution: Essentially the same as 4.0. As soon as someone imports an unmanaged solution into an organization, it becomes an integrated part of the organization and can only be removed by manually removing all parts of the solution. The components of it can be freely edited, changed, and removed. Managed solution: Managed solutions can be locked down by the creators to not allow or allow editing of forms, adding new forms, changing display names, etc. A managed solution can be easily removed by just deleting the solution, and all components (that aren't needed for another solution) will be removed.
