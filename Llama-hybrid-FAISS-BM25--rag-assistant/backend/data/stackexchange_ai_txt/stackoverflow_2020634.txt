Although, as others have said, there are no guarantees, you'll typically find that a single write will be faster than a single read. The write will be likely to copy the data into a buffer and return straight away, while the read will be likely to wait for the data to be fetched from the storage device. Sometimes the write will be slow if the buffers fill up; sometimes the read will be fast if the data has already been fetched. And sometimes one of the many layers of abstraction between fread / fwrite and the storage hardware will decide to go off into its own little world for no apparent reason.
