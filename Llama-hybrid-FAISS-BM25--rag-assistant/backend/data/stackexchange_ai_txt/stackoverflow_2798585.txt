Some NoSQL databases are column-oriented databases, and some SQL databases are column-oriented as well. Whether the database is column or row-oriented is a physical storage implementation detail of the database and can be true of both relational and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. Vertica, for example, is a column-oriented relational database so it wouldn't actually qualify as a NoSQL datastore. A "NoSQL movement" datastore is better defined as being non-relational, shared-nothing, horizontally scalable database without (necessarily) ACID guarantees. Some column-oriented databases can be characterized this way. Besides column stores, NoSQL implementations also include document stores, object stores, tuple stores, and graph stores.
