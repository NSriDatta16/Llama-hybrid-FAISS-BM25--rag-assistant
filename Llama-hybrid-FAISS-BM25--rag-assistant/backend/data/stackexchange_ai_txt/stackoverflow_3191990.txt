Zend Validate, Display one message per validator

I am validating an email address using zend_validate_email. For example, for email address aa@aa it throws several error messages including very technical describing that DNS mismatch (:S). I am trying to make it display only 1 message that I want it to (for example: "Please enter a valid email"). Is there any way of doing it elegantly, apart from creating a subclass and overriding the isValid method, clearing out the array of error messages? Thanks!
