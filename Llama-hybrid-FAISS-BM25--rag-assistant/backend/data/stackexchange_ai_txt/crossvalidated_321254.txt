My understanding is ANOVA is not a good test since it's dealing with percentage You are correct. An ANOVA would be used if you had a continuous dependent variable. Since your dependent variable is categorical (woman vs. not woman), an ANOVA is not appropriate here. I can't conduct the supposed logistic regression since I don't have the raw data You could recreate raw data, based on the information you have. You can make one column be called woman and coded yes or no , and then another column denoting the group , being a , b , or c : # make columns of yes and no for each group group_a Then, you can run a logistic regression: model Which will return: Call: glm(formula = woman ~ group, family = binomial("logit"), data = dat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2992 -0.6681 -0.6681 1.0603 1.7941 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.28185 0.06387 4.413 1.02e-05 *** groupb -1.66815 0.10103 -16.511 The intercept is the log-odds of being a woman for people in Group A. You can see this by taking the inverse logit of the intercept and seeing that it equals the proportion of women in Group A: > exp(0.28185) / (1 + exp(0.28185)) [1] 0.5699997 The groupb and groupc coefficients are both the comparison in log-odds from Group A. If you wanted to compare groupb to groupc , I know you could get the difference between the two conditions and then use vcov(model) , but I can't remember right now how to calculate the standard error between two different regression coefficients. ( Note: I'd appreciate it if someone could point out in a comment below how I could get the SE for the difference between coefficients groupb and groupc .) So instead, you could just change the reference category to get the difference between Group B and Group C: summary(glm(woman ~ relevel(group, ref = "b"), dat, family = binomial("logit"))) Which returns: Call: glm(formula = woman ~ relevel(group, ref = "b"), family = binomial("logit"), data = dat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2992 -0.6681 -0.6681 1.0603 1.7941 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.38629 0.07828 -17.710 The last coefficient, the one with c , shows you the last pairwise comparison. I wonder if this is the case for beta-regression? Beta regression assumes that your response, conditioned on the predictors, is beta distributed. This is not the case with categorical dependent variables (as you do in your example). The beta regression is most used for instances when your dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1, like ratios or proportions. (Although I think it can be used in interesting ways for other types of responses).
