The highest signed 64 bit int is 922337203685477587. That's but a tiny bit more than the number in question. Surely there's an overflow somewhere in pg_size_pretty . Based on the code mentioned in a comment, pg_size_pretty is attempting to round the number and does so using an intermediary value that's larger than the max signed 64-bit int. 9223372000000000000 + 1024*1024*1024*1024/2 = 9223372549755813888, which is larger than 922337203685477587. Update : Added second paragraph and clarified that the overflow isn't in the caller.
