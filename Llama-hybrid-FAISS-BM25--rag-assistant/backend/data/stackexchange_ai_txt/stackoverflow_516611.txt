Here are some principles I would recommend as a user but also as a web designer and developer: Try to avoid horizontal scrolling. Most people have a mouse scroll wheel that only works one direction. Horizontal scrolling is often considered very irritating. Vertical scrolling is usually acceptible now. Column size matters in long paragraphs. I would normally recommend a width of about 15-20 words, but feel free to experiment. The link from alphadogg is an interesting read, but I'd have to say it's hard to go by the term "inches" in web development. Words or characters is perhaps a better measurement, which leads me to the next item: Use relative units for width. This lets you keep the width at a certain amount of words in most cases. Helpful hint: the problem with a relative unit is that the page can be expanded past the width of the page. You can reign that in with most browsers by specify a max-width property in css of 90% or so. So when the text is big on someone's display, they still don't have to horizontally scroll. Again it is not recommended simply to flow content to 100% of the browser width most of the time. And I think as displays get larger, you'll see a lot fewer people maximizing browser windows anyway.
