Since you have only one instrument and one treatment, you can use the Anderson-Rubin (AR) confidence interval by inverting the AR test. The AR test is uniformly most powerful unbiased in this setting, and it has correct coverage rates regardless of the strength of the instrument. This review might be useful. This and other "weak-instrument robust" methods are implemented int he ivmodel R package.
