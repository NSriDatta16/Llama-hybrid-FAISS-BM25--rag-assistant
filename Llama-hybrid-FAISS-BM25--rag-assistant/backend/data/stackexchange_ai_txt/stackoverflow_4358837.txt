Interaction between classes

In my main Actionscript file i have a instance of a body class that moves the person body arms legs etc. and a gun class which has methods and properties to do with the person gun. Right now i have a function in the Main class which is called move gun and looks like this and is called everyframe to move the gun to the bodys arm. I was hoping to move this function to the guns class so i could call it like gun.moveGun(); but the body dosent exist inside the gun variable. so i wonder if i could call the body.getArm(); function from inside the gun. I know i could call the function and pass the bodys arm location to it from the main file. But don't know if this is the best way to do it. private function moveGun():void { gun.x = body.getArm('left').x; gun.y = body.getArm('left').y; } It seems like keeping the gun related functions inside the gun class is the best way to organise everything but i dont know how to do this. Also depending what button someone clicks at the start the person will either have a basketBall or gun in there hand. Ive added the swf online at Here so you can see how it works. i just wanna change how its organised because the main file is very full and though i should learn how to organise things better. There are lots of other part of the program that would be organised better if i knew how to get the object to interact or what is the best way to do it. Starting to think passing the x,y coordinates to the moveGun function inside the gun Class is the best way. If so just tell me please and ill do that.
