PHP beginner: Best practice for inserting into multiple tables with foreign key

I'm learning basic PHP MySQL right now. As of now I have 2 tables; a zoo table (parent table) and a species table (child table). The zoo table contains ID (PK) and animal_name . The species table contains an ID (PK) and animal_id (FK; zoo.ID) and species_name . My question here is what is the best practice to insert into a multiple table when I create a row in the zoo table. Currently, the idea that comes to my mind is to have 2 SQL statement and the process is like this:- Insert animal_name to zoo Get last ID in zoo table. Close cursor Insert animal_id (last insert ID of zoo) and species_name to species table Close cursor Is this the best practice? Is there anyway I can improve this process with scalability in mind? (i.e. when I add more tables with foreign key referencing to zoo table in the near future? I have searched around here and some comrades suggested triggers but however it is not supported in MyISAM storage engine. I'm using MyISAM engine with PHP PDO MySQL object.
