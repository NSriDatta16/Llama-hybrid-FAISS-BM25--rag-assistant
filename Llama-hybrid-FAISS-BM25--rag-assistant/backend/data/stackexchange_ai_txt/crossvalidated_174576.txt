1) How do I structure this data for statistical analysis/Is it structured correctly as is? I think the data is structured well enough already (as I can clearly differentiate different columns and also the number of rows in each column) 2) What sort of model/analysis should I look at knowing the data structure for my variables of interest? (and if you have a link that provides a starting point or basic walk-through for that it would be much appreciated) Firstly, I do not think 14 games is enough data for predicting the team performance and/or form. I have done a similar research on cricket, where I had predicted the performance of a team depending on a bunch of features. So, for that, I had to take in 10 years of data into consideration. But, as a learning project, this data is good enough. You can use neural networks for predicting the ticket cost, depending on the input variables, which include form, days prior and opposition salary. You can also predict how fast the tickets would be sold out (days prior), depending on the type of teams playing, and also the probable price of the ticket given the demand. So, the models which would be useful to you are: Neural Networks : The features can be taken as the inputs and the result can be taken as the output of the network. Start with a single layer ANN Regression Analysis Decision Trees : Decision trees are a wonderful model to estimate whether your ticket sales would be on the lower or on the greater side, depending on the value of the input variables. There are various models which you can construct out of them, but I suggest you start with the basic one.
