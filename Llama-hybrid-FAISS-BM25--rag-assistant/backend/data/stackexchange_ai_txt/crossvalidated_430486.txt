How do I find the standard deviation that results in a specific probability coverage in a truncated normal distribution?

Given a truncated normal distribution $X$ with mean $\mu$ , lower limit $a$ , and upper limit $b$ . How can I pick a standard deviation $\sigma$ such that $P(\mu -x\leq X \leq \mu+x)=y$ for some arbitrary $x$ and $y$ . For a standard normal distribution $N$ , $$P(\mu - \sigma \leq N \leq \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.68$$ More generally, $$P(\mu - z\sigma \leq N \leq \mu + z\sigma)= erf({z \over \sqrt 2})$$ By substituting $x = z\sigma$ we get, $$P(\mu - x \leq N \leq \mu + x)= erf({x/\sigma \over \sqrt 2})$$ Then if we want the standard deviation that gives a probability of $y$ for the range $\mu - x$ to $\mu + x$ we can just solve for $\sigma$ in $$erf({x/\sigma \over \sqrt 2}) = y$$ How can we do the same for a truncated normal distribution. Example: Say I want a truncated normal distribution between 1 and 100 with mean 15. Additionally I want the area under the graph between 10 and 20 to be 0.7 (i.e. $cdf(20) - cdf(10) = 0.7$ ). How do I choose a standard deviation that fits the requirement.
