I must admit that I too often click on "OK" or whatever I'm conditioned to do for a dialog to go away without thinking. Usually this occurs when there are just too many of them. Without claiming to be a psychologist of any kind, I think it is natural to pay attention to unusual things and filter away repetetive things. With that in mind it is maybe worth considering to make less important dialogues less intrusive so that the real important ones get more attention. I think toaster messages and the way google handles messages in it's online apps are real nice examples of how to notifiy a user of something inessential. --EDIT-- Now that I re-read my post, I remember reading this in "Don't Make Me Think". A brilliant little book (few tens of pages) that's full of nice and easy to understand usability things. Somewhat focused on online usability, but defenatly applyable in offline applications too.
