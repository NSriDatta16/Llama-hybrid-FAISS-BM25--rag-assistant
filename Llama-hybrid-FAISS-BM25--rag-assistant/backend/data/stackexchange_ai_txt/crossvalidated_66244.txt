Unfortunately, there is no direct way to get such information with SVMs/NNs. If you want, you can estimate the contribution of a single variable ad hoc by training a model on all variables except that specific variable. The difference in performance between that model and the one with all variables may then be considered the marginal contribution of that variable. If time permits, you can perform this procedure for all variables.
