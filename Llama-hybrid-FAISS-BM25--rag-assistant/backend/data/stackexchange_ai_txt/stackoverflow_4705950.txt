You can use reflection to get the property by name. In your example you can use: var pi = obj.GetType().GetProperty(PropertyName); var val = pi.GetValue(obj,null); In order to obtain the value of the property which name is PropertyName. You should check for pi != null because if a requested property does not exists null is returned. If the function you are writing is time critical, you should anyway pay attention that reflection has some performance drawbacks.
