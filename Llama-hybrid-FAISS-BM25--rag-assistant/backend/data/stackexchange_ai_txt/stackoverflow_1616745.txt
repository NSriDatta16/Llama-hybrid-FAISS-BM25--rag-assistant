Try to set the Handled property of KeyPressEventArgs to true. Not sure if it'll fix your issue but it is good form. More info here private void frmmain_KeyPress(object sender, KeyPressEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyChar == Convert.ToChar(Keys.Space)) { cmdPlay_Click(null, null); e.Handled = true; } } If that doesn't work then keyboard event hooks definitely will. Though hooking events is a much larger and more dangerous undertaking.
