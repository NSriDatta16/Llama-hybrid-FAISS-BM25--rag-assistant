Passing Params to Symfony Routes

I have a defined route that displays a dynamic page: page_show: url: /:domain_slug/:slug class: sfPropelRoute options: model: Page type: object method: doSelectByDomain param: { module: page, action: show } requirements: sf_method: [get] This works great, but now I want my homepage URI to route to a specific page. To do that, I assume that I have to pass the :domain_slug and :slug values of the page I want to display as the homepage. That's fine, but I can't seem to track down any documentation or example that shows me how to go about doing that. Is it possible to specify specific variable values in a route? In this case, I want to pass :domain_slug => portal, :slug => dashboard (that syntax doesn't work, btw). Essentially, I want to create a homepage route that looks something like this: homepage: url: / class: sfPropelRoute param: { module: page, action: show, array( :domain_slug => portal, :slug => dashboard ) } options: model: Page type: object method: doSelectByDomain But different enough that it, you know, works. :-) I suppose I could create a simple route to a different method, modify the request parameters manually and forward to the executeShow() method, but that's a hack I'd rather avoid if a more elegant solution is available. Thanks.
