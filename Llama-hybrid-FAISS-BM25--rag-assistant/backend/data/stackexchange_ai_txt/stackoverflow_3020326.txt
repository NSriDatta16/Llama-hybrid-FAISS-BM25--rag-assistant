SL 3 navigation not working!

I converted all my existing Silverlight app UserControls to Pages so I could use the Navigation Framework. Anyway so I created a UserControl called MyFrame, which would host all the pages. In my App.xaml.cs I have the following to make sure that MyFrame is loaded when the App loads: private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e) { this.RootVisual = new MyFrame(); } My UriMapper class resides in App.xaml and looks like the following: Within my 'MyFrame' class, I have the following And within the callback for my HyperlinkButton's event handler, I have the following: private void HyperlinkButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { ContentFrame.Navigate(new Uri((sender as HyperlinkButton).Tag.ToString(), UriKind.Relative)); } The Login.xaml file is in my root folder (right under Project). This navigation does not seem to work! The exception I get reads like so: Navigation is only supported to relative URIs that are fragments, or begin with '/', or which contain ';component/'. Parameter name: uri The Login page does not load. There is no problem with Login.xaml as when I set this.RootVisual = new Login(); the page loads just fine. I also tried setting the NavigateUri attribute of the HyperlinkButton to "Login." No cigar. I'll appreciate any help! Thanks a lot in advance
