No, simply since the only system that FPC uses is gettext. Lazarus afaik uses gettext, also on OS X, but obviously the FPC one, not the delphi one. I suggest you devote some more attention to getting the gettext solution to work, maybe asking specific questions here. In reply to your comment: If I look in the LCL, I see in the translate routines stuff that translates properties of tpersistents, but only for special "TTranslatestrings" fields. So it doesn't seem to translate full forms directly. Did you have a look at this:? http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/DxGetText
