You can calculate some statistic of a given multi-variate time series using boot::tsboot . According to the documentation for boot : The replicate time series can be generated using fixed or random block lengths or can be model-based replicates. library(tidyverse) library(magrittr) library(mvtnorm) library(boot) set.seed(123) sigma $x, xy$ y)} xy %>% cor_xy() ## Examine the correlation using bootstrap (b = boot::tsboot(xy, cor_xy, R = 1000, l = 20, sim = "fixed")) plot(b) BLOCK BOOTSTRAP FOR TIME SERIES Fixed Block Length of 20 Call: boot::tsboot(tseries = xy, statistic = cor_xy, R = 1000, l = 20, sim = "fixed") Bootstrap Statistics : original bias std. error t1* 0.07804724 -0.003418753 0.05543288 The bootstrap results can be visualized immediately using plot() . Discussion about the general bootstrap method can be found in How do you do bootstrapping with time-series data? . See Understanding the output of a bootstrap performed in R for detailed interpretation of output in boot::tsboot . The way I simulate the multivariate time series is from How do you simulate two correlated AR(p) time series? . For now, I don't know how to extract the samples from the bootstrap, which might be important in some cases. I am not sure if the algorithm is similar to that for univariate time series. Also, I don't know if the method applies to a time series and a categorical series.
