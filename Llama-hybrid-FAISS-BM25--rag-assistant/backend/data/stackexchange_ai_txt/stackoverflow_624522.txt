Have you considered the Office Ribbon? The Ribbon gives you a lot of flexibility on how to show and organize functions and it's highly visual. Here is a good link about the Ribbon and also here To use the Ribbon you have to license it from Microsoft. You can do that online. Providing the user with ketboard shotcuts is usually a good thing too. I also like to provide the user with an "autocomplete" field on the menu so that they can can find the function by name (or part of it) and be able to navigate directly to where they want to go.
