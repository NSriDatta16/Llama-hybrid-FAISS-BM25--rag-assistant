Intermittent Error Message in Eclipse Console Window

I'm starting to learn the Eclipse environment, and occasionally when I type in some code and hit "F11" (to save, compile & run), I get a successful compilation and run of my program, followed by this in red text at the bottom of the console window: ERROR: JDWP Unable to get JNI 1.2 environment, jvm->GetEnv() return code = -2 JDWP exit error AGENT_ERROR_NO_JNI_ENV(183): [../../../src/share/back/util.c:820] It only happens sometimes, and I've yet to find a pattern (open windows or perspectives, saving before or not, etc). A minute ago, it was happening every other time, and now I can't get it to happen at all. In all cases, the (very simple) program is running to completion correctly. I'm guessing it has to do with the way I've got the environment set up, but really, I just downloaded the darn thing off the internet and ran it, so whatever I have should be pretty "vanilla". Doesn't really hurt anything, I guess - just curious. I tend not to like random error messages popping up during the software development process that I don't understand. Relevant details, in case it helps: Eclipse SDK, Version: 3.4.2, Build id: M20090211-1700 Eclipse Java Development Tools, Version: 3.4.2.r342_v20081217-7o7tEAoEEDWEm5HTrKn-svO4BbDI, Build id: M20090211-1700 Eclipse Platform, Version: 3.4.2.R342_v20090122-9I96EiWElHi8lheoJKJIvhM3JfVsYbRrgVIWL, Build id: M20090211-1700 Eclipse Project SDK, Version: 3.4.2.R342_v20090122-7O7S7GApJ3_vCyk7ETmsfcmjhz0eHnqw7MIjk9Vdhe4Ic Build id: M20090211-1700 Thanks!
