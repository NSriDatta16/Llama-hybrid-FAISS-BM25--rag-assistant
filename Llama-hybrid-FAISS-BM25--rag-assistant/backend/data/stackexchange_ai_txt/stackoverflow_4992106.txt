Dissapearing radiobutton on Windows Classic theme

my application has standard controls - textboxes, statics, and a few option buttons (radio buttons). When windows theme (XP) is set to "Classic", and user presses TAB on the form, radio buttons disappear, that is, they are not drawn. Dragging something over my window redraws them. Any ideas?
