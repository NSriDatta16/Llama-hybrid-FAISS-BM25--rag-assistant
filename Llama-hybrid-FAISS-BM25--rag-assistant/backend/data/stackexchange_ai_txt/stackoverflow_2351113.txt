I think that Mr. Crowder is on to something. As far as I can tell from the jQuery source, if your returned HTML fragment doesn't contain any tags, and doesn't have a couple of other not-too-likely characteristics, then jQuery is probably trying to stuff it into your element by using the "innerHTML" property. IE doesn't like that. What you might have to do is wrap the whole in a dummy and then rebuild the entire thing from your HTML fragment.
