This is a question that requires more than an answer on StackOverflow to explain. To learn about this all the way from the most basic electronic components up to basic machine code, read The Art of Electronics, by Horowitz and Hill . To learn more about computer architecture, read Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessey . If you want to get into more advanced topics, read Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, by Hennessey and Patterson . By the way, The Art of Electronics also has a companion lab manual . If you have the time and resources available, I would highly recommend doing the labs; I actually took the classes taught by Tom Hayes, in which we built a variety of analog and digital circuits, culminating in building a computer from a 68k chip, some RAM, some PLDs, and some discrete components. You would enter machine code directly into RAM using a hexadecimal keypad; it was a blast, and a great way to get hands on experience at the very lowest levels of a computer.
