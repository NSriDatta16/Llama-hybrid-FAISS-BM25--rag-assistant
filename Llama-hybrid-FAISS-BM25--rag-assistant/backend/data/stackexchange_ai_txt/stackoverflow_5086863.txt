BGRA on iPhone glTexImage2D and glReadPixels

Looking at the docs, I should be able to use BGRA for the internal format of a texture. I am supplying the texture with BGRA data (using GL_RGBA8_OES for glRenderbufferStorage as it seems BGRA there is not allowed). However, the following does not work: glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, **GL_BGRA**, w, h, 0, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, buffer); ... glReadPixels(0, 0, w,h, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,buffer, 0); While this gives me a black frame: glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, w, h, 0, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, buffer); ... glReadPixels(0, 0, w,h, **GL_BGRA**, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,buffer, 0); And this does work, but the blues/reds are inverted (I supply BGRA data to the texture): glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA,w, h, 0, GL_BGRA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, buffer); ... glReadPixels(0, 0, w,h, **GL_RGBA**, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,buffer, 0); ...why can't I just use BGRA throughout? I do notice that glRenderbufferStorage does not seem to accept any BGRA formats...I'm really confused. BGRA is the only suitable format my data is in, as it comes from the iphone's camera.
