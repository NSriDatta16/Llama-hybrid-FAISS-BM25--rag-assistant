.slide:hover > div > span is more efficient than .slide:hover div span . However, you're never going to notice the difference with average size pages. If you used the Child Selector instead of the Descendant Selector everywhere in your stylesheet for a really freaking massive/complex page, you could shave off a noticeable portion of the render time (see comment by @Boris Zbarsky). With average size pages, you might shave off a few milliseconds . There is one disadvantage to using the Child Selector - IE6 does not support it. For 99% of sites, IE6 support is not an issue, but some people still do use it: http://ie6countdown.com/
