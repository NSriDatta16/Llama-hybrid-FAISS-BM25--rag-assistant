Is it possible to use a normal copula after the Johnson transformation?

I have a sample, log-returns of a finance time series. The sample size is n=252 . I'd like to estimate a distribution in order to modeling dependence with a copula . The binned histogram of frequencies, cumulative frequency counts, and qq-plot are below: I have applied the normality hypothesis test (Anderson-Darling test) and the null hypothesis was rejected at level 0.05 (p-value is 0.003905). I have applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the null hypothesis can't rejected at level 0.05 (p-value is 0.21769). But the null hypothesis should be rejected based on the Shapiro-Wilk test (p-value is 0.211e-4), the Chen-Shapiro test (5% critical value is 0.00356). Original data is here CFC.csv mydata = read.csv("CFC.csv") # read csv file log_returns Problem. Data is not normal. Add I don't know how to specify a distribution to modeling dependence with a copula. My attempt is: I have applied the Johnson's transformation to normalize the data. # require library(Johnson) #Applying Johnson transformation log_returns_JT Here are the binned histogram of frequencies, cumulative frequency counts, and qq-plot after the Johnson's transformation: I have applied the normality hypothesis test (Anderson-Darling test) and the null hypothesis can't reject at level 0.05 (p-value is 0.2304269). Edit. I'm reading the papers recommended by @user25459 but, unfortunately, I don't find the answer for my question yet. Questions. Is it possible to use a normal copula to modeling dependence and set the marginal distribution as the normal distribution? After the modeling I'm going to apply the inverse transformation.
