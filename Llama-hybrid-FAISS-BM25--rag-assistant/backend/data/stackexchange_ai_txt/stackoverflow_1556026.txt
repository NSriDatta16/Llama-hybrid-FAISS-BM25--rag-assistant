IIS7 + ASP.NET MVC Client Caching Headers Not Working

I've deployed an ASP.NET MVC app on IIS7 and Windows Server 2008. I've read posts on here, and around the web, but can't get the darn client-side caching to work. I'm trying to cache everything in the /Content folder. So far I've select that folder in IIS manager, and set the appropriate HTTP Response Headers (under Common Headers). I've also checked the web.config file in the /Content folder and the values there are being set. All resources in /Content come back with this (from FireBug): Cache-Control no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate Pragma no-cache Content-Type image/png Expires -1 Last-Modified Sun, 11 Oct 2009 19:01:40 GMT Accept-Ranges bytes Etag "f318d643a54aca1:0" Server Microsoft-IIS/7.0 X-Powered-By ASP.NET Date Sun, 11 Oct 2009 20:40:01 GMT Content-Length 620 Note the Cache-Control and Expires values for this static image being requested. The site is currently compiled in Debug (this will change), but surely that wouldn't make a difference? Obviously I'm overlooking something, any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks
