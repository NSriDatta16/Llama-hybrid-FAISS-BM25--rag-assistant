Is Woe Transformation is required for all variables in a logistic model

i am trying to build a logistic regression model. I have a doubt regarding using woe ( weight of evidence ) transformed variables. I wanted to know if it is ok to use a few woe transformed variables and a few original variables (not woe transformed) in the logistic model or is it like, if we use one woe transformed variable, we have to transform all the variables by woe for the model?
