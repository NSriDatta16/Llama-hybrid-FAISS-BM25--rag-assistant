svmtrain function in Libsvm takes the options together as a whole string. For example, in your case your option string must be '-t 4 -v 10'. Not separated as two parameters. If your Kernel matrix is correctly formatted, you should have no problem. And keep in mind that, in any usage type of usage violation, the library returns an empty model; and there should be a warning message on the console, indicating the problem. A final warning: please check that your current library version supports type 4 svm, i.e. '-t 4'.
