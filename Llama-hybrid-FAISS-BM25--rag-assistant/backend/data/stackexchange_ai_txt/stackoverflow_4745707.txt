Data Storage Options in j2me

I am creating application in j2me. There is a huge data with whom I have to deal. I have used RMS but speed of retrieving a data from RMS is tedious process. It takes long time then normal speed. I can't use File because it requires permission every time whenever I fetch data or store data. so is there any other options for storing large data in j2me. Thank you....
