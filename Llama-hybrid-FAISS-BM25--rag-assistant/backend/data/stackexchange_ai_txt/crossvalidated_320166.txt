Within the GridSearchCV you may choose your scoring type, ie "explained variation", "area under the ROC", etc... The "sklearn model evaluation" module is highly complex and allows to choose between a complex set of evaluation approaches. By default, the scoring method is set to None, taking the default estimator's scoring method if available. When training a model with the train method, xgboost will provide the evals_result property that returns a dictionary which "eval_metric" key returns the evaluation metric used. Also, when fitting with your booster, if you pass the eval_set value, then you may call the evals_result() method to get the same information. For more details and ways of exploring this, I suggest you visit xgboost's API page and sklearn model evaluation pages on Internet.
