static means exactly the same thing in Objective-C that in means in C - it has internal linkage and static storage duration. You get an error without the static in this case because you will have a duplicate symbol globalStr in each object whose source code included ClassA.h . You're not sharing anything - you're getting a new copy of globalStr for each compilation unit. Don't put object definitions in your headers and you'll be better off. If you want a single global string, you need to put extern NSString *globalStr; In ClassA.h , and define it in exactly one implementation file as: NSString *globalStr = @"HelloWorld";
