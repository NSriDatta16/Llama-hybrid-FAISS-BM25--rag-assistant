there are different kinds of Regularization, you don't know what exactly the author meant... for huge multicollinearity problem - in statistics it is recommended to use Principal Component Analysis as unsupervised dimensionality reduction method. You need to do it prior classification with your model or use in sklearn Pipeline (doing pca first, then logistic regression) and besides: as so as "Regularization attempts to reduce the variance of the estimator by simplifying it, something that will increase the bias, in such a way that the expected error decreases." -- that is: removing multicollinearity really aims to decrease the bias, but regularization leave the bias anyway - thus it is hard to say that regularization helps to cope with multicollinearity, just to prevent overfitting objectives
