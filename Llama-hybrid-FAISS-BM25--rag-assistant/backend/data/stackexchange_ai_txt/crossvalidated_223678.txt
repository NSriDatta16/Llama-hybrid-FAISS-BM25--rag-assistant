Data Transformation Needed for Logistic Regression?

I'm planning to do logistic regression with my dependent variable as either with injury or no injury with one of my independent variables as average computer use. I have attached a sample distribution of the average computer use - majority of data points are close in the .3-.5 hour range then another peaked in the 2.9-3.1 range. Questions: Do I need to transform this data first before I run the logistic regression? I noticed that my other independent variables also exhibit this distribution shape. There seems to be a lot of outliers after the 6 hour range - how should I treat them? Any suggestions or comments will be appreciated.
