SVM is Parametric. Parametric models are something with fixed finite number of parameters independent of dataset size. Anything which is not parametric model is non-parametric model. ANN is non parametric. Also ANN has 'deep architectures" which can represent "intelligent" behaviour/functions etc more efficiently than "shallow architectures" like SVMs. ANN may have any number of outputs, while support vector machines have only one.
