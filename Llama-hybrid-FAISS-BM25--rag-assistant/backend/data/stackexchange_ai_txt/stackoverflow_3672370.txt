Variable height div with custom background-image - what is the best technique?

I'd like to produce something like the 4 boxes at the bottom of the apple.com home page, except I would like them to be variable height . The simplest techniques I can think of is having two divs. The first one containing everything except the bottom 'cap' in its background-image, and the second div with the bottom cap, like so: /-----------------\ ^ | | | | | | | top-and-middle | | But this seems to me to be not so elegant.. it there a better way? Maybe just one div? Preferably with just CSS, but possibly PHP or Jquery too.
