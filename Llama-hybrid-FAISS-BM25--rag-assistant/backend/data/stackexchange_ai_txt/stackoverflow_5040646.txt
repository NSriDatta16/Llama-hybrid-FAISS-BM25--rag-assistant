Magento: Checkout redirects to cart before 'Place Order' is pressed (should go to payal)

this is my first actual post on StackOverflow. I'm on here quite often because you guys always solve my queries! We have a problem in a checkout cart on a Magento site. We have Magento version 1.4.1.1 and are using the one page checkout and Paypal Standard Checkout. The problem appears when a customer adds lots of different products to their cart (say 7 or more). When they click on the 'Place Order' button, they should be taken to paypal to complete the order. But instead they are redirected to the cart (the default failure URL) The checkout works fine when you buy a few items or many of the same item. It doesn't work when you buy multiple different items. Any help/advice/solution/anything! would be much appreciated! Thanks, Heather
