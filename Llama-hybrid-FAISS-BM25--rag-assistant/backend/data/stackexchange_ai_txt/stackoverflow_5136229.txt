I suggest that instead of writing your own implementation using the Blend SDK, that you use the Silverlight Toolkit ListBoxDragDropTarget control. The reason the item disappears in your element is that the MouseDragElementBehaviour is simplistically applying a render transform to affect the movement. However the ListView places its item panel inside a ScrollViewer which clips its content to its viewport.
