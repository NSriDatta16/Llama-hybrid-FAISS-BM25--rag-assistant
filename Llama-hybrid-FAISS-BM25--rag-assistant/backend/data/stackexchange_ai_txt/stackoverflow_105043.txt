We test private methods by inference, by which I mean we look for total class test coverage of at least 95%, but only have our tests call into public or internal methods. To get the coverage, we need to make multiple calls to the public/internals based on the different scenarios that may occur. This makes our tests more intentful around the purpose of the code they are testing. Trumpi's answer to the post you linked is the best one.
