Degrees of Freedom as Defined by Discipline

I've just begun a machine learning course and I've been confused over my professors use of the degrees of freedom terminology. I've picked up that while in statistics talking about degrees of freedom typically assumes you are referencing the degrees of freedom of the error term (observations not taken up by your estimated parameters), machine learning uses degrees of freedom in almost the opposite sense (DoF being the number of parameters you have). It bothers me a bit, because although I see post after post claiming machine learning is NOT statistics (in fact when asked about this, my professor's default response was "I am not a statistician"), I still fail to see how machine learning could exist without statistics, and so it surprises me that one would completely disregard the terminology (as far as almost choosing an opposite definition), of an more established discipline. Can anyone provide some insight into this lexicographic quirk? Thanks!
