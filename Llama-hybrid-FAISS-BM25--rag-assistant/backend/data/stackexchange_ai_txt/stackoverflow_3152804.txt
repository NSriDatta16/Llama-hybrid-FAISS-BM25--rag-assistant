The only way to accomplish cross-domain sessions is to use a unique identifier associated with each user's account. The concept here is to generate a hash that is unique to that user's account and pass it via the URL to the destination. The new site will then auto log in the user based on this hash. Once they're logged in, a new one is generated and replaces the old one. On the user side, this will "carry" the login over multiple sites. If you actually need to carry data over then you'll need to store it in a database. Other layers of security for the auto login can include browser-agent checks as well as IP checks. If any of this information changes, it's a different computer and you shouldn't log them in. I used this method on SC-Source.com to carry a login between the various sites.
