Set the display to an empty string instead of specifying "table-row" or "inline". This will give the elements a default display, so unless they are specified display:none; in a stylesheet the user agent will negotiate the proper display. clockType.style.display = ""; clockSource.style.display = ""; This also eliminates the need to execute a browser check which is not good practice. EDIT: I misunderstood your question before. However, I tested your code here and it seems to work fine (tested in FF 3.5.3, Chrome 4, IE8).
