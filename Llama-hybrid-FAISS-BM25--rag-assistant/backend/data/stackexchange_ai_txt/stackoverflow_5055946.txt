Block is unfinished

This code fragment is compiled: let test = let x = 1 printfn "%A" x If the last line is removed, there is the following compilation error: error FS0588: Block following this 'let' is unfinished. Expect an expression. What does this message mean? In C#/C++ I would expect the "Unused variable" warning in such situation, but F# gives something different.
