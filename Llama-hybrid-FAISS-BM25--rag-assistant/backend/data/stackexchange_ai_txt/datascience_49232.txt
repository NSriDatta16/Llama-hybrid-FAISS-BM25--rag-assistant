Understanding notation of Goodfellow's GAN objective function

What is the meaning of $V(D,G)$ ? How do we get these expectation parts? I was trying to understand it following this article: Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (D.Seita) , but, after many tries, I still can't understand how he got from $\sum_{n=1}^{N} \log D(x)$ to $\mathbb{E}(\log(D(x))$ .
