Averaging data for points in close proximity with SQL Server 2008

I have an application which receives GPS data from a mobile device as well as receiving co-ordinate data it also provides signal strength from the GSM network. I am trying to plot the points on a map to display areas of good signal strength and areas of poor signal strength. When I have a few points it all works well, the points are retrieved from the database and a square is built around the point with the top left corner 0.5km from the point. I then display the square shapes on the VE map using colour coding for signal strength. The problem is that there may be thousands and thousands of readings and I need a way to average out those readings that are less than 0.5km from each other or I need to build the square (or circle perhaps) in SQL Server and average out the intersections. I have no idea where to begin with this so any pointers to decent articles or some tips would be much appreciated. Thanks.
