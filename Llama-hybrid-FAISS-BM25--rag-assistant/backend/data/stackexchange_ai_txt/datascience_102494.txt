One predictor variable and 3 response variable (categorical and continuous)

If I have predictor variables which are a mixture of continuous and categorical, and a response variable that is continuous. What approach should I apply? Linear regression, logistic regression or k means clustering. For example, Response variable: Probability of developing a disease (continuous) Predictor variable: Food Class Intake (categorical), Age (continuous), freq of exercise (continuous) Hence, what would be the best approach based on the 3 machine learning models?
