Converting Risk Ratios to Odds Ratio in case-crossover trial for meta-analysis

I am doing a meta-analyss of case crossover & time series studies. so the problem is some studies have reported the RRs, & I need ORs. The data I have is not enough which is -Total sample size (there is no separate N for cases/controls) -Risk ratio Is there anyway I can calcualte the RR from just these 2 parameters? Thank you in advance (:
