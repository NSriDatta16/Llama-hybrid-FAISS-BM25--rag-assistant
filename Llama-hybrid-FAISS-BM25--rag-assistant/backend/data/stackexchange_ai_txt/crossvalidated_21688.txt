I think the answer mentioned by @Glen is very imporntant however you do need some books to start with. With regards to R I believe you need 3 books. First, for doing statistics with R i can recommend you R in Action . Robert maintains a very active R site and blog (http://www.statmethods.net/) and his book and efforts are fantastic. Second, you may need a book for programming in R, as R is not only a statistics program but also a mighty language. Programming is very helpful when doing complex analyses or when combining analysis, or for writing functions that perform the same thing on different datasets. I can only recommend you The Art of R Programming . No major statistics are presented here, but you will get a grip how to combine, connect and automate your analyses. Third, you will need a reference book , an encyclopedia. I can recommend you The R Book . This is not the book you will read from start to finish but its the book you open now and then to see if some things are possible, if there are other ways to analyse data etc. And most important stop using anything else and try to tackle all your problems in R. Solving problems in the best way to learn. Also, before I forget. There are some wonderful blogs from some fantastic people writing about all sort of stuff one can do in R. Search and you will find. Highly recommended is the aggregation site http://www.r-bloggers.com/ where R relevant blogs are gathered. Have fun!
