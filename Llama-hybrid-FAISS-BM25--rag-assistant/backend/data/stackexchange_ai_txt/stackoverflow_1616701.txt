Override Keybindings

I'm trying to make it so no matter what, when I push Space, a certain block of code is executed (cmd_play, to be exact). However, it only seems to work once if you do it using Form Keypress: private void frmmain_KeyPress(object sender, KeyPressEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyChar == Convert.ToChar(Keys.Space)) cmdPlay_Click(null, null); } any ideas?
