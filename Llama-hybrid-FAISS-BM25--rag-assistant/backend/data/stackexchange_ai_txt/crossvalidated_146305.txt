Wouldn't it make more sense to just use the outputs of your hidden layer as new features? It makes more sense to me to cut off the output layer. It's important to be aware of the fact that the weights in a neural network behave quite randomly. If you use a different seed for initialization, the weights will converge to different values (in the best case they will be comparable but permuted). There is no implicit order in the weights of hidden nodes even when a clear structure can be retrieved every time (unlikely).
