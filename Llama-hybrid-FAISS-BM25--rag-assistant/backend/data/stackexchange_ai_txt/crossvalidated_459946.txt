I have discussed the bootstrap for multi-variate in How can you draw samples from a multidimensional time series? . If your n * m data set only correlation every row, you can draw a sample with fewer rows using simple random functions like sample() in R . Just make sure that all m elements in some selected row are set as one observation, which is illustrated in How should I bootstrap multivariate variables? . For elements in the column with different rows, block bootstrap can be used to preserve the dependence. For example, if a 9 * 2 multi-variate time series to be sampled, it is divided into blocks first. Then, blocks are sampled and connected. If you want to draw a sample with fewer rows, just choose fewer blocks. Note that the connection of selected blocks does not have to follow the original sequence. x y 1 -1.49475115 -0.54611868 2 1.13926435 0.74103376 3 1.41939200 2.67440879 4 1.30836462 -3.11768804 --------------------------- 5 -0.15411482 0.30669856 6 1.68698582 0.80915333 7 1.76670354 -0.03077288 8 0.92443653 2.92956932 --------------------------- 9 0.83239816 -4.41182710 When the number of blocks is small, slightly complex methods have to be introduced, which are discussed in books in other answer.
