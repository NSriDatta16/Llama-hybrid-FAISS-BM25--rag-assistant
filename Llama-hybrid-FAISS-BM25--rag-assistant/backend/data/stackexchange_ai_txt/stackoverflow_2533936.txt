VS2010. Dropdownlist Autopostback works in IDE, not when deployed

I have a VS2010 RC ASP.NET web page,when a user changes the drop down selection on an auto postback dropdown, it refreshes a small grid and a few labels in various places on the page. I know wrapping a whole page in a big UpdatePanel control will cause horror from many of you, but that's what I did. I really didn't want a full page refresh and I didn't know how to update a table on the client side using Javascript and I figured it would be a big change. Suggestions for avoiding this are welcomed, but my main desire is to understand teh error I am getting. When I do the auto postbacks in the IDE, everything works fine, but if I deploy the code (IIS 5.5 on XP), the second auto postback works but the seconds one gives me his error. Ajax is one big nasty blackbox to me. Can someone help, please?
