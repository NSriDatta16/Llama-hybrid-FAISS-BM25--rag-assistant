I've not used all those frameworks, but I looked at RhinoMocks and Moq, and went with Moq because it feels more elegant and much simpler. I am using the trunk version which includes a must-have fix for the 4 argument limit imposed on callbacks in the most recent 4.0 beta release. I especially like the default Moq behavior, which doesn't behave like a strict Mock Object failing tests when unexpected calls are made. You can configure it to do this if you want, but I find that requires me spending way too much time setting up expectations and not enough time testing.
