If your goal is to learn how to create new or improved data science methods, then working from scratch may be a good idea. The advantage is that you will learn the detailed inner workings of the algorithms, and you will learn enough to think about new methods or features. Other people may come to know you as an innovator. If your goal is to apply data science tools to solve problems, then I encourage you to use published/shared tools such as scikit-learn and others. The advantage is that the code has been examined, tested, debugged, and updates by the community, so the likelihood of hidden errors is decreased. Nothing is perfect, but community code is often closer to perfect than code that is newly made from scratch. Other people may come to know you as an analyst who uses proven, quality methods, and whose results are worthy of trust. Good luck!
