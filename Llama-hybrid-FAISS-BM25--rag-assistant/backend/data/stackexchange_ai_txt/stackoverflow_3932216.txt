How to determine whether cameraDevice is available?

In my current application I have allowed the user to submit an image to an image service online. I allow the user to select from either their Photo Album or take a picture with the Camera. However, I have an issue. If the device that is being used doesn't have a camera and the user selects to take a photo, the application crashes. I need to be able to determine whether or not the device has the ability to use the cameraDevice. Below is my current code for presenting an UIActionSheet which allows the user to select the different options. #pragma mark - #pragma mark UIImagePickerController - (IBAction)ImagePicker { UIActionSheet *sheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:@"" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel" destructiveButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@"Choose An Existing Photo", @"Take A Photo", nil]; sheet.actionSheetStyle = UIActionSheetStyleDefault; [sheet showInView:self.view]; [sheet release]; } - (void)actionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex { if (buttonIndex == 0) { //Okay the UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum displays the NSLog(@"Album"); UIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; picker.delegate = self; picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum; [self presentModalViewController:picker animated:YES]; [picker release]; } else if (buttonIndex == 1) { NSLog(@"Camera"); UIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; picker.delegate = self; picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera; [self presentModalViewController:picker animated:YES]; [picker release]; } } Thanks in advance!
