Surprise: Why is my factor not significant?

I am analysing the performance of a large population in exams using a binary (pass / fail) outcome. In the majority of exams, women out-perform men. However, when gender is included with other factors in multiple logistic regression, it is not a significant predictor of performance. I have some conceptual understanding of why this is but want to know the best way of explaining this to seniors. It goes against general understanding that gender is not an influential factor. Happy to expand following questions.
