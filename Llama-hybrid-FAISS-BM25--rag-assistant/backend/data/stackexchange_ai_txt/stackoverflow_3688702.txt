Can't give you concrete numbers right now, but I use SVN and git and the last one is way faster. More propaganda: http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/#git-is-fast Git can use four major network protocols to transfer data: Local, Secure Shell (SSH), Git, and HTTP. ... The Git protocol is the fastest transfer protocol available. If you’re serving a lot of traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn’t require user authentication for read access, it’s likely that you’ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project. From http://progit.org/book/ch4-1.html And an informal memo describing the protocol: http://git-scm.com/gitserver.txt
