Comparing two mean values to check for statistical significance

This is a very simple question but it has been years since I have done statistics. I am also new to this website (was recommended by a friend) so apologies if this question has been done 'wrongly'. I am comparing several criteria between two different treatment methods of a certain disease. I have the following table as an example of results. Treatment A Treatment B 14 23 8.2 8.1 17.4 17.1 0 2 The first row is the amount of patients I have on each treatment. The next 3 rows are the average results of different criteria. Basically, how do I check if the difference in results of each criteria are statistically significant? Currently, from searching around on the interwebs I believe I am supposed to do a T-test. I have been using this website: http://www.quantitativeskills.com/sisa/statistics/t-test.htm I input the mean result of treatment A and B, the amount of each data, the standard deviation (calculated using excel with the =stdev() function) and with a width of C.I. set to 95%. The website then gives me a lot of jargon which I do not understand. However, for some of my results it has given the conclusion that 'Difference not significant at 5%' and some of my results do not show that line, which signifies to me that the results are indeed significant. Have I gone about this the right way?
