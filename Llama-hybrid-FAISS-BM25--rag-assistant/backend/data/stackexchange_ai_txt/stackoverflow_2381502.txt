You say that you can't see the procedure. Do you have access to the database, and can you make changes to it? If you can't access the database and/or can't make changes to it, I think your options are limited to: Increase the timeout, and Encourage the outside vendors to address the problem. As others have said, increasing the timeout is not a good solution for all sorts of reasons. Encouraging the outside vendors to help (by, for example, threatening to replace their application with a competitor's, or refusing to pay license fees until your problems are addressed) may be your best bet. As a rule, the person you want to talk to about this is the SALES GUY, not the technical staff. The techie's do not, in general, give a hoot about losing revenue because it doesn't affect them directly. The sales guy DOES care because if you bail or refuse to pay it probably has a direct impact on his paycheck, so he has a vested interested in keeping you happy, and he probably has some level of influence over the tech's. Key catchphrases for dealing with sales guys are "...performance is unacceptable in our environment...", "...unable to support the business using your application...", "...will not pay one cent more for this application until it meets our needs...", and the always popular "...we will be evaluating alternative solutions...". Remember, the sales dude is there to be your interface to his company - so get inter his face - or better yet, have some manager type chew on the sales dude for a while. (That's what managers are for...). The squeaky wheel gets the grease... If on the other hand you can modify the database it might serve you well to do as @Adam Munsch suggested and figure out what SQL statements are running so doggone slow. You might be able to dramatically improve the situation by adding an index or two. Good luck.
