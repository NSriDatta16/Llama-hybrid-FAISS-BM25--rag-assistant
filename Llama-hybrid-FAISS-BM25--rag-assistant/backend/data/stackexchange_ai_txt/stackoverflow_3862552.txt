If iPhone/ iPad supports three and four finger touch what are the gestures supported? Both support at least 4 Touches. Though there are no gestures for 4 fingers, you might have 2 pinch-gestures going on at the same time. In my experience I'd still advise to limit the amount of possible touches, especially if you're using the "touchesBegan/touchesMoved/touchesEnded". (Just throw away the third, forth touch, when you already have 2) Imagine two simultanuous pinches on the same image, since both essentially define a transform, the image will constantly jump between the two transforms! Also additional touches could just be random fingers that landed on the screen accidentally.
