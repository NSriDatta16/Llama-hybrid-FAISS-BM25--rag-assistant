If you want to use precision and recall for clustering, which isn't always used to evaluate the clustering, here is a useful link with a good example of how to find them for clustering: http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html I will work through the relevant part of the linked example for finding TP, TN, FP, FN; adding details where necessary. As stated in the linked site: A true positive (TP) decision assigns two similar documents to the same cluster, a true negative (TN) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to different clusters. There are two types of errors we can commit. A (FP) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to the same cluster. A (FN) decision assigns two similar documents to different clusters. Consider the following example, Here we have three actual groups: x's, o's, and diamonds which we have tried to cluster into cluster 1, cluster 2, and cluster 3. Some mistakes were made. For example, cluster 2 has an x, four o's, and a diamond included in it. Now to quantify the TP's, FP's, TN's, FN's. We will consider all pairs of documents, of which there are $N(N-1)/2=136$ , since we have $N=17$ documents. Now for TP+FP (all positives), we need to find out all pairs of x's, o's, and diamonds (not necessarily matching types) that exist in the same cluster. $6 \choose 2$ pairs of anything in cluster 1, etc. This gives us $TP+FP = {6 \choose 2} + {6 \choose 2} + {5 \choose 2} = 40$ total positives True positives are only the pairs that are of same type. For example, pairs of x's in cluster 1 is $5 \choose 2$ . This gives us, $TP = {5 \choose 2}+{4 \choose 2}+{3 \choose 2}+{2 \choose 2}=20$ This leaves $40-20=20$ FP's. Now for the total number of negatives, which is not in the link I provided. The total negatives plus positives must equal the total number of pairs, and thus $Pairs-totalPostives=totalNegatives$ . So there are $136 - 40 = 96$ negatives in total. The number of FN's can be found by looking at pairs that should be grouped together, but are not. I will do the x's first. Cluster 1 has 5 x's each paired to three mismatches ( $3*5=15$ ) plus cluster 2 has 1 x that is paired to two mismatched x's in cluster three that have not been accounted for ( $2*1=2$ ). The o's are the same. Cluster 1 has one o, which is paired to 4 mismatched o's ( $1*4=4$ ) in cluster 2. Now for the diamonds. Cluster 2 has one diamond, which is paired to 3 mismatched diamonds in cluster 3 ( $1*3$ ). Add them up, $FN = 3*5+2*1+1*4+1*3=24$ Since total negatives is 96, there must be 96-24=72 TN's. The final confusion matrix is (as per the website): And as Karl said precision and recall are:
