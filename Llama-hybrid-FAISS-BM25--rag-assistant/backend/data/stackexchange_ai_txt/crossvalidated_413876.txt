Hyperparameter-free method for Moving Average/ Exponential smoothing?

I want to find hyperparameter-free method for Moving Average/ Exponential smoothing. Is there any related paper or python code? S(t)= alpha * F(t) + (1-alpha) * S(t-1) Any methods can avoid the choice of alpha? Or automatically update the alpha? Thank you.
