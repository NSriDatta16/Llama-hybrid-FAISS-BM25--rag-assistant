Estimation of a state-space model using Bayesian analysis with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

I have the following state-space model: $$\begin{aligned} y_t&=c+Ax_t+q_t, &q_t \sim \mathcal N(0,Q), \\ x_t&=\mu+Bx_{t-1} + v_t, &v_t \sim \mathcal N(0,R), \end{aligned} $$ where the series $x_{t=1}^T$ is latent. I am interested in estimating $\Phi=[ x_{t=1}^T, A,B,R,Q,c,\mu ]$ via Bayesian analysis using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. That is, I want to estimate the following distribution: $$ f(\Phi|y^t) \propto f(y_t|\Phi)f(\Phi). $$ $f(y_t|\Phi)$ is a maximum likelihood function which can be constructed with the Kalman Filter algorithm. I am unsure about the second function: $f(\Phi)$ (the prior). What is the proper prior for the whole series $x_t^T$? Also, as $f(\Phi)=f(x_t,A,B,R,Q,c,\mu)$ I am not sure if it makes sense to have independent priors as $\mu$ and $R$ are not independent of $x_t^T$.
