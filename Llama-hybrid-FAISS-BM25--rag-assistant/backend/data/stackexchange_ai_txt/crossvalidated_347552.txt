In this answer of mine you can find you can find an example of DAG of the Bayesian model described in JAGS language. The thing to remember is that DAG's describe the statistical model, while Stan is a programming language designed to describe and then estimate such models. What follows, there is no one-to-one translation between the code and the probabilistic model. Stan is a programming language that can be used to define many things that go beyond the definition of the model (many stuff happening in the generated quantities , or transformed parameters , also the parameters section is just about defining internal Stan objects). Your DAG looks almost fine, but there are two things that are incorrect: You don't need the nodes for x_new and y_new , since they are just random draws from your model, they are neither parameters, nor data. Your definition of the priors for mu_x and mu_y is incorrect, since you define them only in the parameters section, what means for Stan that you assume uniform distribution for them (rather then normal, as in your DAG).
