Something could always be wrong with your code, but this type of behavior would be consistent with a model that was similar to a random walk. A random walk (without drift) would be specified as follows; $$ y_t = y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t $$ where $E[e_t] = 0$. Thus $E[Y_t|y_1,...,y_{t-1}] = y_{t-1}$. So when you graph your predictions against actual observations, it will look as though your predictions are delayed by one unit, when in fact the forecasts are just using the contemporaneous observation as next periods prediction. Not knowing anything else about your neural network model and code, my best guess would be that the model converged on something similar to a random walk (the graph does suggest that there are additional trend/drift components at work too though).
