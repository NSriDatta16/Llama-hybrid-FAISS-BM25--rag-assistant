Having problems getting data out of an xml element in Python

I am parsing xml output by another program. Here's an example of the xml fragment: MultipleTestTool1 MultipleTestTool1 Passed I want to get the data out of the element. Here is my code snippet: import xml.dom.minidom mydata.cnodes = mydata.rnode.getElementsByTagName("comment") value = self.getResultCommentText( mydata.cnodes def getResultCommentText(self, nodelist): rc = [] for node in nodelist: if node.nodeName == "comment": if node.nodeType == node.TEXT_NODE: rc.append(node.data) return ''.join(rc) value is always empty, and it appears that the nodeType is always an ELEMENT_NODE, so .data doesn't exist I am new to Python, and this is causing me to scratch my head. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
