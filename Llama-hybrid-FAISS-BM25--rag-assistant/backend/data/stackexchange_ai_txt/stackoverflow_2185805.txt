Your Perl installation seems to have been messed up in one way or another. I am not familiar with xampp, but I have a hard time believing they bundled just the perl.exe without the rest of the distribution. Under G:\xampp\perl , there should be subdirectories such as lib , site etc. strict is a core pragma and its absence indicates that you do not have a proper Perl installation. In fact, I just downloaded xampp and it does contain lib and site\lib under xampp\perl (it is missing the documentation, but that is not essential to running Perl scripts).
