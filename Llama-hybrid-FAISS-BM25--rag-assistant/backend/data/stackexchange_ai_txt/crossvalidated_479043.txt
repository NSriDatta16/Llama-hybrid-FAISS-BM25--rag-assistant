The basic intuition of a CNN is that it is a modified neural network which uses a trick of parameter sharing to capture more abstract patterns in the images which are then used to classify different classes like dog and cat in your case. So, the purpose of a CNN architecture is feature extraction in an efficient way. Each layer in CNN captures different abstract patterns which add to the overall differentiability among the classes. These extract features can be then fed to a fully connected layer which acts as a classifier and finally classified using a sigmoid(binary classification) or softmax function(multi-class) which produces in terms of probabilities. You should look at which class has maximum probability in the output layer. Ex. if your output layer has .2 for cat and .8 for dog, then final output of your model is a dog. If you feed an image of a cat in input layer and your output layer produces .95 probability for cat label in output layer then you can know your output is a cat.
