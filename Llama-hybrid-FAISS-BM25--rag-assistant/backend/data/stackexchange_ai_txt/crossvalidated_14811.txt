First I want to reiterate what others have said in the comments: this is in general a difficult problem with no easy solution. With that in mind, one way of assessing model fit with logistic regression models when your primary interest is simply predictive power is to plot ROCs. Here's an example (with caveats) using the pROC package in R: library(pROC) #Fit three logistic models m1 The basic idea is that more area under the curve indicates a "better" model, from the perspective of prediction only. Note that my example is meant only to illustrate how to make such a graph, as I've plotted these curves using the in-sample fitted values, rather than those obtained using cross validation, bootstrapping or a hold-out test set, which in general is preferable. I'll end by repeating my warning that this is far from the way to assess model fit. It is just a way that is limited to assessing predictive accuracy.
