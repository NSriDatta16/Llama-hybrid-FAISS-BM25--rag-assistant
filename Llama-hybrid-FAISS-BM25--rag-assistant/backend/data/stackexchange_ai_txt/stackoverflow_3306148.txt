Sounds like a strange implementation of MVVM you have there. Your ViewModel should be completely independent of the View. If you want to create dynamic columns on the grid then why not expose a relevant property collection on the ViewModel, and iterate through it in a relevant method on the View code behind e.g. //Used with an Infragistics XamWebGrid control private void BuildGrid() { foreach (var dataItem in **ViewModel**.MyDataCollection) { var myCol = new TemplateColumn { HeaderText = dataItem.ItemNm, Key = dataItem.PrimaryKey }; MyGrid.Columns.Add(myCol); } } You really shouldn't be passing controls from the View over to the ViewModel. The ViewModel should have no knowledge of any controls on the View.
