You simply can't have a do-while statement inside an expression in Standard C++ (there's a GCC-specific extension http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html ). But what are you really trying to achieve? - we may be able to find an elegant alternative... In C++0x, you can get close, ala... #include int main() { int a = 10; std::cout int { do { a--; } while (a > 10); return a; })())
