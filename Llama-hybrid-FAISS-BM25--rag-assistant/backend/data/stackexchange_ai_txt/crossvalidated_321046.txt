The formulas are from Wikipedia . Note that sensitivity and specificity depend on what you have defined as a "positive" in true positive and a "negative" in true negative. In a 2x2, once you have picked one category as positive, the other is automatically negative. With 9 categories, you basically have 9 different sensitivities, depending on which of the nine categories you pick as "positive". You could calculate these by collapsing to a 2x2, i.e. Class1 versus not-Class1, then Class2 versus not-Class2, and so on. An example: using the glass identification database, and Weka software, we get a confusion matrix for the 7 types of glass: === Confusion Matrix === a b c d e f g And we get a true positive rate (sensitivity) calculated for each type of glass, plus an overall weighted average: === Detailed Accuracy By Class === TP Rate FP Rate Precision Recall F-Measure MCC ROC Area PRC Area Class 0.714 0.174 0.667 0.714 0.690 0.532 0.806 0.667 build wind float 0.618 0.181 0.653 0.618 0.635 0.443 0.768 0.606 build wind non-float 0.353 0.046 0.400 0.353 0.375 0.325 0.766 0.251 vehic wind float 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 ? ? vehic wind non-float 0.769 0.010 0.833 0.769 0.800 0.788 0.872 0.575 containers 0.778 0.029 0.538 0.778 0.636 0.629 0.930 0.527 tableware 0.793 0.022 0.852 0.793 0.821 0.795 0.869 0.738 headlamps 0.668 0.130 0.670 0.668 0.668 0.539 0.807 0.611 Weighted Avg.
