Top-N ranking loss is difficult to optimize directly. Why?

Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering paper tells: "Recommender systems are often evaluated using ranking-based measures, such as mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. Top-N ranking loss is difficult to optimize directly" (Thanks to whuber ) What kind of difficulty is there in optimizing them? Can someone explain this with an example?
