You can use operator overloading in Delphi (since Delphi 2006) only on records not on classes, and not on built-in native types like strings. The reason is that Delphi does not have garbage collection, so operator overloading is limited to value types (types that are not living on the heap). You can download the replay of my session "Nullable Types with Records, Methods and Operator Overloading" at the CodeRage III Replay download page . Just search for the session name. There is also a page with the download for the session samples and slides . It contains quite a few examples that get you going, including a description of some issues in the Delphi 2006 compiler that have been solved in Delphi 2007 and up. See also this question: Can I overload operators for my own classes in Delphi?
