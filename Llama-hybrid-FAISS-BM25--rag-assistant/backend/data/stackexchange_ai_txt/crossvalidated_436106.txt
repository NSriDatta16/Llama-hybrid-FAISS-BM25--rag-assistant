Answer : A decent first pass would be a generalized ARMA model followed by the analysis of impulse response functions (IRFs). Interesting IRF measurements: peak, delay until peak, halftime of peak decay, cumulative response (AUC, area under the IRF's curve, as mentioned by @AdamO). In R VGAM package seems to do the job. Construction of confidence intervals for chosen statistics might need a moderate amount of additional coding. Details: If I understand correctly, each period each individual in you sample is exposed to some random shock (you call it stimulus, e.g. seeing a banner of random appearance, shaking hands with the contaminated person etc.). Upon a shock the individual may react (click on the banner, contract a desease) or not to the shock. It is reasonable to assume that continuous exposure to shock for several period increases the likelihood of reaction (the degree of this relation is to be inferred from the data). And you are seeking to gauge how this sensitivity to shocks changes with some treatment. Assuming you have binary outcome data, i.e. $y_{i,t} \in \{0,1\}$ . The model would look like: $$ \begin{cases} p_{y^k_{i,t}=1}& = & f(z^k_{i,t})\\ z^k_{i,t} &= & \alpha_0 + \sum_{s=1}^m \alpha^k_s z_{i,t-s} + \epsilon_{i,t} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta^k_s \epsilon_{i,t-s} \\ \epsilon_{i,t} &\sim_{iid} & N(0,\sigma^2) \quad \forall i,t, \end{cases} $$ where $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1] $ is some function mapping the hidden variable $z_{i,t}$ into the probability of reacting to stimulus (e.g. logit), and $k\in\{\text{treated},\text{nontreated}\}$ is the index of the group and $i$ is the index of the individual. Less explicit assumption is that the shock $\epsilon$ hits everyone and at all periods evenly (i.e. it's variance does not depend on treatment nor on the identity $i$ ), which may be relaxed if data allows and/or the initial formulation is deemed insufficent. Estimation may be performed by likelihood maximization or Bayesian methods. Upon estimation, two impulse response functions , derived from estimates $\{a^k_s, b^k_s\}_s$ of $\{\alpha^k_s, \beta^k_s\}_s$ can be obtained, one per $k$ . You can compare their peaks, delay of the peak, cumulative response, half-time after the peak etc (for more ideas one may check the litterature on linear time-invariant systems ). Judgements about statistical significance can be based on the Bayesian or bootstrapped confindence intervals. Quick search showed some examples of packages able to handle this kind of model gave VGAM package, wich seems to be well maintained and even accompanied by a book.
