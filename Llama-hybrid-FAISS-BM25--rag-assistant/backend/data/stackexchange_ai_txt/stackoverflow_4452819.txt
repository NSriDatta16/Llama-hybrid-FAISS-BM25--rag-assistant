What I'm doing in a project I'm working on is taking a cue from Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate and assigning conditional styles to the entire page . He goes into it in detail here , but briefly, the idea is to add conditional checks in the HTML of every page on your site, applied to the body tag. Like so: IE browsers will read these comments and apply those styles. Other browsers will ignore it. The genius of this is you can design standards compliant websites, use PNGs, whatever. And then, in your CSS, add additional styles placed AFTER your standard styles to give IE browsers what they want. For instance, one style I'm working on uses a PNG background image. To make this play nice in ie6, I COULD use javascript/htc to replace them, apply one of the many hacks out there. OR I could do this: .someStyle { background: url(/images/someFile.png) no-repeat; background-position: -0px -280px; } .ie6 .someStyle { background: url(/images/someFile.gif) no-repeat; background-position: -0px -280px; } By feeding a GIF to my ie6 users, there's no CPU hogging workaround processes, which is actually a very big issue if you've ever tested on the kind of POS machine likely to be running ie6. And, I haven't given up any quality for my nice users with nice browsers. It does require two separate files, but I think it's a much cleaner implementation than most. Also, instead of a separate ie6.css file, using .ie6 .whatever keeps your fixes right next the the styles they apply to, which I find cleaner and easier to use. It also encourages you to consider ie6 users as you go, instead of finishing your design and then looking back in horror
