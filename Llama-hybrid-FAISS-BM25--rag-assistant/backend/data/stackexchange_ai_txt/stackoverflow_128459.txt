XML is a super-language, meaning that it is the basis for any XML-based language (makes sense, right?). Think of XML as a pen that can write any sentence, in any language. It all depends on the writer, and preferably the language should be known to the reader. An XML namespace is basically the name of the language, much like "English" or "עברית". I helps the recipient of the XML document to parse it and extract the information within. Let's say that I have a furniture factory and you have a furniture store. your storage application and my supply application are completely unrelated, but when they communicate through XML messages, the messages should be understandable and easily parsed by both sides Therefore, both systems need to know the Schema , which defines the language syntax and agreed restrictions. Think of the schema as the dictionary and grammar textbook. The schema is the document that both systems should know, that whomever writes the parsing code in each system must know, and that includes the declaration of the namespace. Each namespace is named as a URI, which in most cases is the location of the schema document that defines it. Of course, not every XML document needs a namespace, especially when it is not used to convey information to a remote system. For example, when you serialize objects into XML for persisting in your database.
