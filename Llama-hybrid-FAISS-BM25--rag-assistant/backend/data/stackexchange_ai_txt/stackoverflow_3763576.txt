Is it possible to put a custom GUI on top of an Excel spreadsheet?

A friend of mine has a very complex Excel spreadsheet with many formulas and lots of data that he uses for work. He wants to put a custom GUI on top of it and then wants to sell it to other people in his profession. Basically he wants to make some freestanding software out of his spreadsheet? Is there any way to put a custom GUI on top of an Excel spread sheet? The spreadsheet would just reside in the backend and be a kind of database and do the calculations necessary. I know this is definitely not an elegant solution but I told him I'd look into it. Any ideas?
