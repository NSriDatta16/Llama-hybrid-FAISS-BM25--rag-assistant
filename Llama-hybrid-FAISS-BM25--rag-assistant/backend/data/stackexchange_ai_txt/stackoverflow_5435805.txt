In your example there were some problems that caused this not to compile for me. After I fixed the issues I was able to drag png files onto the component and each successive drop changed the image correctly. Here are the changes: Original DropTarget target = new DropTarget(fLblArtWork, ops); became: DropTarget target = new DropTarget(lblImage, ops); Original Image i = new Image(Display.getCurrent(), filepath); became: Image i = new Image(Display.getCurrent(), filenames[0]); Original Image i = new Image(Display.getCurrent(), data); became Image i = new Image(Display.getCurrent(), (ImageData) event.data); I also create my label the following way: final Label lblImage = new Label(shell, SWT.NONE); but that shouldn't make a difference.
