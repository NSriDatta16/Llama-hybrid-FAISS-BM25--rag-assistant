You will need to store a reference to the window that you opened to be able to access it. If you control the HTML/Javascript of the main main, you could insert something like this into the block: var popupref; and window opening function: function openWindow() { popupref = window.open(/*your params here*/) } and then in your ExternalInterface to open your window ExternalInterface.call("openWindow"); and to call your popup window ExternalInterface.call("popupref.myfunc"); I don't know off the top of my head, but you could potentially be able to make the ExternalInterface.call(...) by embedding the the whole popupref = window.open(...) call in it. Be aware thought that the window that you opened has to come from the same domain and port otherwise the cross-domain browser security will not let you make the calls.
