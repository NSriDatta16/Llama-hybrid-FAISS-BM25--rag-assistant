RexM - firstly I must state that I'm a front-end developer so can't even touch you for skill and knowedge of coding C#. However - I did implement your solution using the Page object and encountered a problem. Yes, sorry I'm a "pleaseSendMeTheCode" leech in this instance, but neverless, thought it was important to detail the "bug". I'm building a site that uses a nested UL to display menu items and allows the user to re-sort the menu however they want. My menu has the following data fields: pageID, parentID, pageOrder, pageTitle Page order refers to the order in which the pages appear in a node. So my query for SelectAllDataFromTable_OrderedByParentIDAscending(); was: SELECT * FROM [pages] ORDER BY [parentID] ASC, [pageOrder] ASC I then use jsTree to make the menu items draggable and droppable. I re-ordered a few pages and discovered a bug: Say my structure is like so: home cars usa muscle cars suvs europe colours directions vertical horizontal up down If I move "cars" (and all it's children) inside "down", the children of "cars" no longer display in the menu. That's the "bug". I have checked the db and parentID and pageOrder are all correct under "cars", I also tried changing my SQL query, starting from scratch, all sorts of testing directly on the DB (all the above with jsTree turned off so I can see the basic nested UL) - but with no success. Just wondering, as I've seen other forums pointing to this page for solutions to turning hierarchical sql data into nested UL's, it might be worth somebody looking into it. As my whole site is based on the use of Javascript I've now implemented a Jquery.ajax solution (which, very badly commented, is on my site here) to build the nested UL but as I said, just flagging as potential problem. Thanks very much though for a kick start in my own finding of a solution!
