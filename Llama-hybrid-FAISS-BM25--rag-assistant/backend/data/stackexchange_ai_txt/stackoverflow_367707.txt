Thoughts about using Silverlight In Desktop Apps?

To summarize, as we all know, a) Silverlight is expected to be hosted by a browser, and runs in an isolated sandbox so that there won’t be any security issues Silverlight don’t have direct access to the file system, other than the isolated storage area There is no direct way to open common dialog boxes like File Save in Silverlight (Though Opendialog box is supported). b) Silverlight can’t access local resources like a printer What are the ways to go beyond the sandbox, so that I can host a Silverlight application locally, to read files and save them back if required, to hand over data to a printer, and so on.. Update: Is full WPF is not an option for me? No. I'm also interested in a cross platform solution - for instance, you could host Silverlight in Mono Web browser control, so that you can run it virtually anywhere. The idea is to re-use the same application that I'm building for web in my desktop as well, by providing separation of concerns at some areas - like persistence, resource access etc. Scenarios: 1- Some kind of gadget container, with access to local resources. 2 - A desktop Silver light based media application Update: I just did a POC to enable me to access printer and save files locally, of course through a shell where I'm hosting my Silverlight application. If you wan't you can have a look at the post here in my blog
