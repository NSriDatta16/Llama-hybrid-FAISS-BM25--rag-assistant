Interpreting the mean first passage matrix of a Markov chain

Consider the following first passage matrix: I just want to know whether one can give a good interpretation to this matrix. All I know to say is that it takes this long to go from this state to that. Is there anything more that can be said? Any help will be much appreciated thanks alot!
