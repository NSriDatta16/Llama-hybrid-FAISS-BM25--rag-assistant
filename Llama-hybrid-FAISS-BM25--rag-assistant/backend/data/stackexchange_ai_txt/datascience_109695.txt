First of all, start with shifting your data with 30 or 60 or 90 days. Each one is a different model meaning that you can't use the trained model of 30 to predict 90. Start with 30 and you can just change the parameters. Since you have different features, this is more of a regression problem. Or you can forget your features and use timeseries (LSTM models). The other part will be just googling and finding ressources. If you are not familiar with machine learning, I would suggest to learn the basic before. Learn what does it mean train, test split especially on time indexed dataset. If you are already familiar with this, learn about tensorflow and how it is different from sklearn. The learning curve is a little bit more difficult. If you master this you can easily decode every avalaible notebook out there.
