iPhone Google Analytics SDK delegate and multiple accounts problem

I am implementing google Analytics SDK in my iPhone application. I had it working with following code: AppDelegate .m : [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-xxxxxxx-1" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:nil]; if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:string withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"Error happened with google analytics tracking 2, %@", error); }else { NSLog(@"OK"); } In my analytics account I was getting the wanted results. Then I decided (don't ask me why) to try to send my tracking data to 2nd analytics account too. For curious ones: One account is used for web page and iPhone app stats and the other one is supposed to be just for iPhone. My ingenious plan was to create 1st sharedTracker, dispatch it, stop it and do the same for the second one: AppDelegate .h: @interface AppDelegate : NSObject //implementation AppDelegate .m: //1st tracking account [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-xxxxxxx-1" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:self]; if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:string withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"Error happened with google analytics tracking, %@", error); }else { NSLog(@"1. GAnalytics: OK"); } [[GANTracker sharedTracker] stopTracker]; //2nd tracking account [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-zzzzzzzz-1" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:self]; if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:string withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"Error happened with google analytics tracking, %@", error); }else { NSLog(@"2. GAnalytics: OK"); } [[GANTracker sharedTracker] stopTracker]; - (void)trackerDispatchDidComplete:(GANTracker *)tracker eventsDispatched:(NSUInteger)eventsDispatched eventsFailedDispatch:(NSUInteger)eventsFailedDispatch{ NSLog(@"For the love of Got, why don't you say something?"); } I added the delegate method in order to get some clue what's being dispatched, and to find out if SDK is making two different requests, but it seems I can't get my delegate method invoked! Removing the second tracker's code doesn't help either I also tried putting the dispatch period to 0 (and -1 with manual dispatch call) but I had no luck with this eitherâ€¦ So, my questions are: how to implement 2 gAnalytics accounts and how to make my delegate method do what it's supposed to do - get called after dispatch :) Thanks in advance, Luka
