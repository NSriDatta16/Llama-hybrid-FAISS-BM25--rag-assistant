How do I build an image carousel in CSS & jQuery?

So I want to get an understanding of how a carousel works, and what I need to know (specifically) when I am building one. E.g. what Math functions to use, and why. Somethings I would like to be able to do with the carousel is change the number of images that you can see at once (starting with 1, and going up to MANY). As you increase the number of images, it should resize the others. Perhaps you can put an upper limit on the number of images that you can see at the same time. Feel free to include HTML5 technologies, like local storage or anything that can make the carousel very lightweight, and fast. Also, given that I have never done this before, I would love if you could break it down for me in various levels of complexity. Basic, Advanced, Complex, More Complex. Thanks in advance.
