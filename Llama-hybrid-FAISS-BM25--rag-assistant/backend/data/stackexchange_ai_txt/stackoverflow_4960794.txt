I don't think async is a good way to achieve high performance. Read manually and ask for larger chunks of data in each pass. If you have a low number of concurrent connections you can even dedicate threads to them so the sockets have your full attention. Async operations has a lot of overhead compared to a direct aproach. If you need really high throughput consider setting the thread priority. Also note that the .Net priority is only relative, so you may want to set process priority too. Optimization settings in project properties can have a noticeable impact on performance if you are looking at high throughput speeds.
