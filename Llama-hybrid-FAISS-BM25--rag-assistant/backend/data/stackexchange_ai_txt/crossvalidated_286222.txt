Low loss and low accuracy. What is the reason?

We have trained two different neural networks for MNIST dataset. Here are the losses and accuracies obtained by these networks for the training data: net0: loss: 20780.8291187 net1: loss: 209.928699374 net0: TRAIN ACCURACY 0.985890040888 net1: TRAIN ACCURACY 0.835298627336 The used loss function is the cross-entropy. We expect higher accuracies for lower losses, but here, the loss for net1 is about 100 times lower than net0 but its accuracy is lower. What is the reason?
