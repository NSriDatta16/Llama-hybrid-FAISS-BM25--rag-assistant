If the HTML string can be parsed as XML, you can do this (after clearing the element of all child nodes): $fragment = $doc->createDocumentFragment(); $fragment->appendXML($html_string); $element->appendChild($fragment); If $html_string cannot be parsed as XML, it will fail. If it does, you’ll have to use loadHTML(), which is less strict — but it will add elements around the fragment which you will have to strip. Unlike PHP, Javascript has the innerHTML property which allows you to do this very easily. I needed something like it for a project so I extended PHP’s DOMElement to include Javascript-like innerHTML access. With it you can access the innerHTML property and change it just as you would in Javascript: echo $element->innerHTML; $elem->innerHTML = ' example '; Source: http://www.keyvan.net/2012/11/php-domdocument-replace-domelement-child-with-html-string/
