what if we could remove some of them â€” the less relevant ones? The keyword you're looking for here is "ensemble pruning" (not to be confused with pruning nodes off an individual tree). See for example adnan_OptimizingNumberTrees_201 6` and the references in the introduction. could there be a way to assign weights to each of them? Check out bernard_DynamicRandomForests_2012 and the follow-up xu_ImplementationPerformanceOptimization_2017 . See also this question on Dynamic Random Forests including some clarifications by the author. Complement Random Forest might also be interesting. (I'd appreciate if you shared any other findings you make, I'm looking into this topic myself currently). I also pasted some personal notes with references here .
