How could PageRank be used to rank paragraphs in relevance to keywords?

I have a data set with keywords describing paragraphs in a car manual and the actual paragraphs. I want to rank those paragraphs by that keyword using PageRank algorithm. How would I rank these paragraphs in relevance to the keywords? The keywords are given an ID number while the paragraphs in the manual are texts. Let's say there is a keyword with ID number 89 and I have about 15 paragraphs that the keyword describes. How would the paragraphs be ranked in relevance to the keyword? Can I even use PageRank for this problem? I understand for ranking websites, backlinks are used to sort the websites into ranks but for paragraphs of texts, how would I link and rank them?
