You cannot touch UIKit (meaning UIScrollVIew ) in a secondary thread - you need to reorganize so that the fetch takes place in a secondary thread but you make a NSData object (containing the image binary) available to your primary thread for each thumbnail so that it can do everything related to actually displaying them. Apple repeatedly warn in documentation that UIKit is not thread-safe.
