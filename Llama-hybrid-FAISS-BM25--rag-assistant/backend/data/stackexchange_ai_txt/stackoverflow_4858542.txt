jquery resizable append image size problem

I have the simple code below which appends an image to #container when button is clicked. The problem is when i first click on the button, image size is not properly appended. But when button is clicked again then we get the appended image with correct image size. This doesn't happen if we remove resizable() from the equation. Why is the first click not getting the proper image size. Code below: add me $('#test').live('click',function(){ var elm = ' ' $(elm).appendTo('#container').resizable().parent().draggable(); });
