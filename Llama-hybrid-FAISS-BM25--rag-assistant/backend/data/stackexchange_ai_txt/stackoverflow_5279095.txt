Pass form to template after registration

I'm using django-registration app to perform registration. After registration (no matter if successful or not), I'd like to return to whatever page the registation app would redirect, but I want to pass a login form to that template. Something like this: def register(request): registered = reg_views.register(request, backend='registration.backends.default.DefaultBackend', template_name='zzz/index.html') login_form = AuthenticationForm() return render_to_response(registered, { 'login_form': login_form }) and then in the template have the ussual: {{ login_form.as_p }} Here's what I am trying to achieve: I want to leverage the functionality of the registration app. However, after a (un)successful registration, I need to be able to display the login form on the page. This login form should be passed from the view (DRY principle). Thanks, Matyas
