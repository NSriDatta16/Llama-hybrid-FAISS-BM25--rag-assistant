Cloud Computing need some regulations?

I was involved in couple of cloud computing platform recently. First of all please note that I am not trying to criticize any platform. Cloud computing is large area but to make my point simple and understandable. Let me come up with very simple scenario and that is data storage services hosted on the cloud. If you take any storage service like Amazon EC2, SQL Data Service(SDS), Salesforce.com services. If you want to consume any of such data storage service platform goal of all such service are same and that is to serve requested data on demand. Without warring about how it store and where it stored and who is maintaining it etc... (all cloud goodies) Now my area of concern is the way ANSI-SQL regulated platform venders to make sure they follow similar language across all the product canâ€™t they regulate similar concept across service providers? Why no such initiatives?? Any thoughts appreciated
