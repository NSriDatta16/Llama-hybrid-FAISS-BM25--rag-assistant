You can create the new content programmatically (by creating nodes etc), or you can use a templating system to map data into pre-coded HTML templates. When you hide portions of a form, you can find all the inputs and disable them (set the "disabled" attribute to true ) to prevent them from being submitted. To be "unobtrusive", if you go with a templating system you need to have the templates organized somehow. Some people like coding them into the page, sometimes as raw uninterpreted text by sneaking them into a tag with a type that keeps the browser from trying to interpret it: Alternatively, you can serve up the templates embedded into JavaScript or JSON data, possibly by server-side facilities that respond to dynamic requests for templates. How you do it depends on what your needs are.
