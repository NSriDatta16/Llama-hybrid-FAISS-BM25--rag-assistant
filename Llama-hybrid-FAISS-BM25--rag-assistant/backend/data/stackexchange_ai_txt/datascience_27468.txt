Product classification in e-commerce using attribute keywords

I am working on a product classification problem (E-Commerce) in which I have to identify product category based on keywords. Say for example, if input is given as ' Samsung Galaxy On Nxt 3 GB RAM 16 GB ROM Expandable Upto 256 GB 5.5 inch Full HD Display ' , It should correctly identify it as 'Mobile' . The problem here is that I have certain key-value pairs on which I have to train the model. Previously, I was doing the same problem by training model on product level using LinearSVC and it was giving satisfactory results. Details about data: I have 39 classes/ categories currently, which might increase in future. I am using a csv file which is of around 10 MB and it has around 7000 rows.(Refer below structure) I am using LinearSVC from sklearn.svm I have the following structure for training now: -------------------------------------------------------------- | Attribute_Names | Attribute_Values | Category | -------------------------------------------------------------- | Brand | Samsung, Nokia, OnePlus | Mobile | | RAM, Memory | 2 GB, 4 GB, 3 GB, 6GB | Mobile | | Color,Colour | Black, Golden, White | Mobile | -------------------------------------------------------------- | Fabric, Material | Cloth, Synthetic, Silk | Ethnic Wear | | Pattern, Design | Digital, floral print | Ethnic Wear | -------------------------------------------------------------- I have the following queries: 1 - Which Model to use for this problem ? 2 - How would you handle such problem ? 3 - Any similar problem you have seen. Any help is much appreciated. EDIT: step 1) - merge column(attribute_names, attribute_values) step 2) - Cleaned the data(removing stopwords,special characters, steming) step 3) - Feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english',lowecase=True) step 4) - OneVsRestClassifier(LinearSVC(loss='hinge',penalty='l2')) This are the steps we have performed till now,and the results are not good enough (miss-classification still exist) format/structure of data is same as we mentioned above.
