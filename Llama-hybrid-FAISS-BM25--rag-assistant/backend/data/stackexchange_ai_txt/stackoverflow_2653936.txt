Independant of the new developer agrement, the effects of which are still unknown (for example people assumed that PhoneGap and Appcellerator were dead which is not the case ); you are still better off in my mind targeting Objective-C on the iPhone OS platform. The thing is that there are a lot of very powerful frameworks in Cocoa. By using Objective-C, you are also learning to think like the framework designers which means you'll have a much easier time understanding the patterns used, and also over time learn to anticipate abilities and names within the framework wince you have a clearer grasp over stylistic standards in use. You are also instantly ready to leverage new abilities within the language and frameworks (like blocks or multitasking) rather than waiting for the framework writer(s) to figure out how to present some new feature to you. Given the acceleration of platform features, that could be a significant advantage. Also, on a personal level - you are simply better off as a programmer the more languages you deeply understand, and the more you push outside your comfort zone to learn something truly new. That broadening helps your mind in other ways and makes you a more flexible thinker. I have nothing against those who use other languages like Mono on the platform, I just think it makes the most sense to really use the tools and languages that are primary to whatever platform you are targeting. If I were to move into Android development I would switch to all Java in a heartbeat rather than seeking an Objective-C bridge.
