Multiple Regression Multicollinearity issue

So using the multiple regression model, I am working on finding the relationship between several x factors and the average life expectancy at birth. x1= adult education level (age 25-64) x2= infant mortality rate (per 1000 live birth) x3= CO2 emission rate (megaton) y= average life expectancy I got the data from OECD statistics and World Bank and conducted a multicollinearity test and the values are just so high and shows multicollinearity. Does this mean I have to change all x factors? I mean the data just shows like this. I mean CO2 emission and Infant Mortality Rate doesn't seem to have any relationship, or not that I know of.... Am I missing some part or do I have to change x factors? Thanks
