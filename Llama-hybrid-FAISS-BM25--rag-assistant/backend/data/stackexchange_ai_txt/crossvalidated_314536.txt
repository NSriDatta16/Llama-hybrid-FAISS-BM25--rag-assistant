Fitting MA(q) and ARIMA(q) model

I know, that fitting an AR(q) model can easily be done by OLS. Now I wonder, how to do it for MA(q) and ARIMA(p,q), but cant find enything useful, except, that one uses Maximum Likelihood and needs many iterations. But how exactly is it done? My guess would be (for MA(q)), to initialize a time series of random white noise (the errors), and than perform a first fit, to obtain a first model, than calculate the errors compared to the actual data, and than fit it again with the newly obtained errors, compare it to the actual data to obtain new errors and so on. Similar with the ARIMA model. Is that correct, or completely wrong? And where does the maximum likelihood come in, since the fit could be also done with OLS?
