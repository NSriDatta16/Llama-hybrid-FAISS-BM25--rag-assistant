any legitimate way to bypass maxlength on HTML text field?

I saw an entry in our web app's exception log which seems to indicate that a user somehow submitted a web form in which an was filled in with more characters than was specified in the maxlength attribute for the field. The only result of this was generating a SQL exception to the log and presenting a generic error page to the user (i.e. the user did not see the SQL error), so no damage was done. But I am curious as to how this happened. I know there are "hacking" ways to circumvent this (submitting through a custom client, munging the HTML with Firebug, etc) but are there any legitimate ways that this can happen (perhaps using a certain browser), that I can address through a code change? Just to be clear... if it was generated through hacking, no change is needed... the SQL error protects the system from harm. However if a user legitimately hit this somehow, I'd like to fix it. In case it matters... the User Agent on that request was Safari / Mac (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_5; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.19.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.3 Safari/533.19.4 ) I could not reproduce the issue on Windows Safari and I don't have access to a Mac.
