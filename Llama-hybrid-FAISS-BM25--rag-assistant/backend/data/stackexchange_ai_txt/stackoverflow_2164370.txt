The Simpson's paradox only occurs when your group sizes are different. Actually, the ginal results is a weighted average for the results from each group (and on this weighting, the paradox may come up). It's not actually caused by external factors or stuff. It's simply because one group is much more significant (because has more elements in the group). If you provide some more info, we could probably help better.
