Actually, your approaches A and B are not mutually exclusive. Here namespaces come to help. The primary purpose of namespaces is to disambiguate otherwise same names that are used in different context or, as the linguists say, in different topic worlds . Therefore, I would use: snap:head and ds:head where snap: and ds: are namespace prefixes that are bound, respectively, to the namespaces I have defined: "headBody:Data SnapShot" and "headBody:Data Set" . This approach has the following advantages : Puts every name in its own topic world. Avoids name conflicts. Keeps names short, readable and meaningful. Encourages hierarchical thinking and modeling.
