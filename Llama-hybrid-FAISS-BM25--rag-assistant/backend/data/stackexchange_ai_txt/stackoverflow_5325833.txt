Umm yes.. Depending on where the data is coming from, I am going to assume it is a db of some sort and you have it in an array(): $databasevalue = array(); //stuff from database goes here / dragons echo " "; for ( $counter = 0; $counter ".$databasevalue[$counter]." "; } echo " "; Can't offer more without better question details.
