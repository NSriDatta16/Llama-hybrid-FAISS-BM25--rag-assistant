Manipulating time series

I have a lot of data from Trading Economics which have, for some reason, the dates in the following format: 1919-09-30T00:00:00 Is there a handy way to elaborate this preserving the format of the data in R? I'm a very beginner with R, I figured out this but everything become string cbind(substr(inflation[,3],1,10),inflation[,4]) column 4 contains inflation rate related to a certain date (in column 3) I am sure there is a smart and quick way to work on the dataframe. Any ideas? Thanks!
