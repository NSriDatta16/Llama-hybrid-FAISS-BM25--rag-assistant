How can i unserialize a string?

I have a menu system that uses a drag and drop tree structure to make it easy for a user to modify. When the javascript serializes the string, it does it in the following way: // Assume each of these items has an ID on with the respective numbers attached Menu Item 1 + Menu Item 2 + Menu Item 3 + Menu Item 4 Menu Item 5 Menu Item 6 + Menu Item 7 This will then get serialized as: 1>2>3>>4#5#6>7 The problem with this is that there could be an arbitrary number of sublevels, which makes it difficult to unserialize. I'm using PHP server side to unserialize it but I am at a loss as to what to do. Any suggestions welcome, even to the method of serialization, Iâ€™ll just hack the code.
