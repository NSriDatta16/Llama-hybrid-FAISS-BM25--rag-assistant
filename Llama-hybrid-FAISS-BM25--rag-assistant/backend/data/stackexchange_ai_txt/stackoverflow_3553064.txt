Probably the easiest is to use operator and operator>> with a stringstream (you can initialize a stringstream from a string , and use the stream's .str() member to retrieve a string after writing to it. Boost has a lexical_cast that makes this particularly easy (though hardly a paragon of efficiency). Normal use would be something like int x = lexical_cast (your_string);
