Gantt view or hierarchical grid

Is there any any free Gantt view grid control or hierarchical grid view available in WinForms? I require a grid that looks like an MS project task list, but it should not contain a right side calendar view as in MS project. My requirement is just to maintain hierarchical data with multiple columns. Could you please suggest where can I get this?
