Use sp_spaceused, table, 1 . That reports the table and each index separately. DIviding the data space used by the rowtotal will give you one value for the actual row length (not counting fragmentation, which is based on the lock scheme and activity). Use sp_help table_name . That will give you another value , the intended or average row length. Using the info provided, do the simple arithmetic with the column lengths; then estimate what they will be re the Datatype changes you intend. Note the variable length columns require 4 additional bytes each. If a column is Nullable, it is stored as Var Len. Now create the new table (even temporarily), with the same columns, with the new Datatypes, and repeat (2). This will confirm your estimates. sp_estspace has a different purpose.
