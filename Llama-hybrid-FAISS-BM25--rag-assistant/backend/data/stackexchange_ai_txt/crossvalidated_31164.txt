Solving simultaneous linear equations with R

Am trying to solve a system of linear equations involving three variables using R . However, I get an error as shown below: > A = matrix(data=c(-0.4, 0.4, 0.15, 0.3, -0.55, 0.6, 0.1, 0.15, -0.75), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE) > A [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] -0.4 0.40 0.15 [2,] 0.3 -0.55 0.60 [3,] 0.1 0.15 -0.75 > > b = matrix(data=c(0, 0, 0), nrow=3, ncol=1, byrow=TRUE) > b [,1] [1,] 0 [2,] 0 [3,] 0 > > solve(A, b) Error in solve.default(A, b) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.04615e-17 When I work them out using substitution method, I get the variable values as: 0.456, 0.4027, 0.1413 respectively (not exactly precise values). The sum of all the variables should be 1. How could I solve such a system? Background: These equations come from solving a Discrete Time Markov Chain. In reality, there could be around 20 such simultaneous equations on 20 variables.
