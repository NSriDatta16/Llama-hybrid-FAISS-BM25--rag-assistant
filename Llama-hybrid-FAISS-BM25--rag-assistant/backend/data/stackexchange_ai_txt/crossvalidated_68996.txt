Probability Questions

I've got a 2 advanced probability questions that I'm having trouble with so just asking to confirm an answer/method A computer company provides an insurance policy for one of its systems. If the system fails during the first year the policy pays £3000. The benefit decreases by £1000 each year until it reaches zero. If the system has not failed at the beginning of a year, the probability that it fails during the year is 0.1. How much should the company charge for the insurance policy so that, on average, its net gain per policy be £100? A man aiming at a target receives 10 points if his shot is within 1cm of the center of the target, five points if it is between 1cm and 3cm, and three points if it is between 3cm and 5cm. What is the expected number of points scored if the man's shot is uniformly distributed in a circle of radius 8cm centers on the target?
