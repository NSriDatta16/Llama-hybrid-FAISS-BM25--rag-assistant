Oh dear, maybe one day you'll see the error of your ways, in the meantime..... By default, PHP writes its session data as a serialized array into a file named according to the session. The session is identified usually by a cookie with name PHPSESSID. So in PHP to manually read the session: $imported_session=unserialize(file_get_contents(session_save_path() . '/' . $_COOKIE[session_name()])); The format of the file is very straightforward and simple to parse. However its quite easy to implement your own PHP session handler to write the files in any format/to any storage you like (have a look at auto-prepend for how to associate the revosed code with every page without having to rewrite each one). Or change the name the cookie used to store the session. C.
