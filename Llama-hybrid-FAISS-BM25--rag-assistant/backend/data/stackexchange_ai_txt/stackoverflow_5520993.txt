It isn't that redundant. If you just detect for Javascript, people can still boot up instances of Selenium and pretend to comment. The number of spam bots doing that now is in the minority, but as the spam wars evolve, you can bet spam bots will move on to other methods such as using a browser. If you detect for Javascript AND make them drag and drop something, it'll definitely prove you're a human. But I think this implementation is just not practical because there is still a % of people that have JS off for whatever reason. I hear this % is 2 or 3%, which is still a good amount when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of visitors. An alternative is to have a noscript option that asks the user to activate Javascript if he/she wants to comment on the blog.
