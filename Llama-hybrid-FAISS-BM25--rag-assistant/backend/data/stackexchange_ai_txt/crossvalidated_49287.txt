How important is domain knowledge in our profession?

or: Does selecting a domain when entering a job narrows your future options for domains and hence jobs ? To make this question as broadly applicable as possible ... profession refers to all kinds of data analysts, from statisticians over machine learner programmers to data miners. imagine you were asked to give an advice to an audience containing both students and professionals of different age classes Maybe a starting point: The competitions on Kaggle have shown that outsiders can outperform the models created by company employees (see e.g. here ). On the other hand, my (limited) work experience has led me to the conclusion, that understanding how and where the data has been generated is absolutely mandatory to create an abstract environment where something like a Kaggle competition can happen. Furthermore, without domain knowledge, I find it hard to report the results to other layers / departments. Some associate the last skill as key to the "new" profession "Data Science" (see e.g. here or here ).
