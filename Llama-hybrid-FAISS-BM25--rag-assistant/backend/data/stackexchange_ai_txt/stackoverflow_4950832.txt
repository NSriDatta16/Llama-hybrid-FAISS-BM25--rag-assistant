Is the XML in a string, or is it in an object like a DOM reference? I believe IE8's localStorage can only take strings as keys AND values...or primative values that can be automatically cast to string...so you'll have to stringify the object. If you're worried about size constraints in IE8, check the value of localStorage.remainingSpace (IE-specific property). I'm not sure why Safari isn't working for you if it works in Chrome. Maybe it can only take strings too.
