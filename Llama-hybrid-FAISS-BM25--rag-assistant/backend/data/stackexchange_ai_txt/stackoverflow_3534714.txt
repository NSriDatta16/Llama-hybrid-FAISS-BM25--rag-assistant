python equivalent to perl's qw()

I do this a lot in Perl: printf "%8s %8s %8s\n", qw(date price ret); However, the best I can come up with in Python is print '%8s %8s %8s' % (tuple("date price ret".split())) I'm just wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing it? I'm fine if you tell me that's it and no improvement can be made.
