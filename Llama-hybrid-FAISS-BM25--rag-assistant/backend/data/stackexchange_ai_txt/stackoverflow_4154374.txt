What's the best way to generate a (nice looking) roadmap?

I'm using internally a simple text list to represent roadmaps. But that's not enough when it comes to present the roadmap to some powerpoint accustomed decision makers. Do you know of any techniques to generate (nice looking) development roadmaps? How do you produce your roadmaps? Update: Started a bounty to draw a little more attention.
