Cross-validation is a simple way to estimate reliability of your curve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics) Propagation of uncertainty with partial differentials is great is you really know $\Delta E_{0},\Delta V_{0},\Delta B_{0}$, and $\Delta B'$. However, the program you are using gives only fitting errors(?). Those will be too optimistic (unrealistically small). You can calculate 1-fold validation error by leaving one of your points away from fitting and using the fitted curve to predict value of the point that was left away. Repeat this for all points so that each is left away once. Then, calculate validation error of your final curve (curve fitted with all points) as an average of prediction errors. This will only tell you how sensitive your model is for any new data point. For example, it will not tell you how inaccurate your energy model is. However, this will be much more realistic error estimate mere fitting error. Also, you can plot prediction errors as a function of volume if you want.
