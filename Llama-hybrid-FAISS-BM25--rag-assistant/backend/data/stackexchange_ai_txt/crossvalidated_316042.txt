I suspect that what puzzles you is that you make the fair assumption that someone's sex and the weather are uncorrelated; someone does not become more female when the sun [shines][1]. In linear regression adding a uncorrelated explanatory variable does not change the effects of other explanatory variables. In logistic (or probit, or other non-linear models) it does change these effects. Many consider that a problem, but I don't. A brief hint of why that is the case is that with logistic regression you model how some numerical representation of how likely we think it is that a certain event happens (the odds). Such an assessment of how likely something is naturally depends on the available information. The available information in logistic regression is represented by the variables included in your model. More on that here . [1]: It may be possible that when the sun shines women are more likely to go out than men, and you collected data outside, so that my end up causing correlation in your data, but for argument sake, lets assume that is not the case.
