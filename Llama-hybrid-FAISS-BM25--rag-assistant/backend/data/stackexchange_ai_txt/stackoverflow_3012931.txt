Depending on the size of the application (single user vs. enterprise), shutting down the application might be a bad idea. First of all, I'd suggest saving the initial state of the information being changed in the 3 external apps to storage local to your own app. That means you can at least determine what the rollback state is supposed to be should your app crash/the rollback fail/etc. Once the transaction has successfully committed you can then delete this data. What to do when one of the operations fails depends on the functionality of the 3 external systems. Let's assume that one of these systems holds employee data. Shutting down the application simply because one employee's address is wrong due to a failed transaction is overkill. It's much better to simply check the failed transaction log (ie. the local storage to which you saved the initial states of the 3 external apps) whenever an employee's data is accessed. If that employee data is flagged as invalid, throw an error indicating that the record is in an invalid state and cannot be retrieved. However, if the entire external system will be thrown into disarray by a failed transaction, then yes - there's nothing you can do here but shut down your app until the problem is fixed.
