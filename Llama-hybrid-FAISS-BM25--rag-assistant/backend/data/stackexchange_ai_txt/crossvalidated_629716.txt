Regarding motivation, recall that for a model $y_i$ with prior distribution $\theta\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta,\Sigma_\theta)$ , the components required for getting the posterior parameters are the scaled mean $\Sigma^{-1}_\theta\mu_\theta$ and precision $\Sigma^{-1}_\theta$ . These two are the sufficient statistics for the approximating distribution $g(\theta)$ (see Gelman p. 338). The exact formulae in step 5 use $\frac{M_i}{V_i}$ and $\frac{1}{V_i}$ , which are the scalar equivalents of these statistics. As in some other Bayesian methods (such as EM), the rigorous theory requires matrices to be PD but in practice you can settle for PSD. As I understand it, this is why you can "live" with $\det\left(\Sigma^{-1}_i\right)=0$ .
