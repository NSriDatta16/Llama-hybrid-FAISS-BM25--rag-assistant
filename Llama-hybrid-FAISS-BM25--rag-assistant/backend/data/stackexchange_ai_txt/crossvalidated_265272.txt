Fitting ARIMA with replicates of non-time varying exogenous variables

For simplicity, let's consider an AR(1). The model I want to fit is \begin{align*} Y_{t} = \mu + \beta X + \phi Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \end{align*} where $X$ does not vary with time. So how is $\beta$ even identifiable? Well, I have $K$ replicates of these time series, each at different levels of $X$, so ultimately I have something like \begin{align*} Y_{t,k} = \mu + \beta X_k + \phi_k Y_{t-1, k} + \epsilon_{t,k} \end{align*} So ultimately, my response matrix $\{Y_{t, k}\}$ is $T\times K$, and my exogenous predictor $X$ is $1 \times K$. I know the standard fitting in R uses arima0(y, order = c(1, 0, 0), xreg = X) But this assumes $X$ itself is time varying, while here I just have different values of $X$ on $K$ independent time-series chains. If it helps, I'm willing to assume $\phi_k = \phi$ constant. The setting this problem came up is rather trying to predict, say, $Y_{t_\text{new}, k}$ for a previously-observed $k$, I'm trying to predict $Y_{t, k_\text{new}}$ at a previously-observed $t$, but new predictor $X_k$. If it helps, in economic intuition, $Y_{t, k}$ may represent GDP at time $t$ in a country with population $k$, and I retrospectively want to estimate $Y_{t, k'}$ at time $t$ had a country had population $k'$. Bonus Question : Is there a way to fit \begin{align*} Y_{t,k} = \mu + \beta X_k + \phi Y_{t-1, k} + \psi Y_{t+1, k}+ \epsilon_{t,k} \end{align*} So clearly, the above is no longer a valid time series. But again, I'm not trying to predict in the $t$ direction, but rather in the $k$ direction, so I already know the values of $Y_{t, k}$ at $t-1, t+1$.
