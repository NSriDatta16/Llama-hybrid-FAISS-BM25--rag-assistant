Stan logistic regression with binary independent variables

I am developing my very first Stan (MCMC) model and naturally got hit by a problem. This is probably a very basic issue, but I did not find an answer in Stan documentation so asking your help now. My model is logistic regression. The data-block of my model is the following, and I get compiler error "No matches for: real * int[ ]" m1 N; // number of observations int Result[N]; // binary dependent variable vector[N] RealValVar; // real valued independent variable int BinaryValVar[N]; // binary valued independent variable } When I changed the last variable to vector Stan compiler is happy. .... vector[N] RealValVar; // real valued independent variable vector[N] BinaryValVar; // binary valued independent variable .... My question is, what is the correct Stan way to include binary independent variables into the model?
