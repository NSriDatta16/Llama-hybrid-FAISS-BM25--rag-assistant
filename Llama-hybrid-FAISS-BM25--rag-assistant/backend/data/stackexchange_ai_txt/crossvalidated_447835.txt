When $X$ is $n\times d$ , the scatter matrix (the scaled covariance) is $S=X^TX$ . When it is $d\times n$ , $S=XX^T$ . And, in the latter case, the rows of $X$ are mean-centered as opposed to the former. The logic is always to calculate $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_ix_i^T$$ where $x_i$ is one data sample of dimension $d\times 1$ . Covariance matrix is typically estimated as $S/n$ or $S/(n-1)$ , since it's just a scalar, in PCA it doesn't matter.
