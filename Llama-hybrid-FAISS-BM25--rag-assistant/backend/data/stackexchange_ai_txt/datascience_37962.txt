What is the difference between multi-layer perceptron and generalized feed forward neural network?

I'm reading this paper: An artificial neural network model for rainfall forecasting in Bangkok, Thailand . The author created 6 models, 2 of which have the following architecture: model B: Simple multilayer perceptron with Sigmoid activation function and 4 layers in which the number of nodes are: 5-10-10-1, respectively. model C: Generalized feedforward with Sigmoid activation function and 4 layers in which the number of nodes are: 5-10-10-1, respectively. In the Results and discussion section of the paper, the author concludes that : Model C enhanced the performance compared to Model A and B . This suggests that the generalized feedforward network performed better than the simple multilayer perceptron network in this study Is there a difference between these 2 architectures?
