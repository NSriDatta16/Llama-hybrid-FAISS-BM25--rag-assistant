As discussed on Meta, I think it's a rather unusual person who could follow a mathematically rigorous treatment of Probability & Statistics without having previously studied them in a shallower, more heuristic fashion. If you're that person ... For rigour the pair Lehmann & Romano, Testing Statistical Hypotheses Lehmann & Casella, Theory of Point Estimation would be hard to beat, but would still leave you needing a book on Probabilityâ€”so three books, not one. Cox & Hinkley, Theoretical Statistics is one I'd like to recommend, for clarity of exposition & for their take on foundational issues, but it tends to assume a fair amount of familiarity with the basics, has nothing on Probability; & though it's thorough, I couldn't put my hand on my heart & say "rigorous". On the whole I'd probably go with Casella and Berger, Statistical Inference ; its opening chapters cover enough Probability & the later ones on inference are still pretty rigorous. Rather scanty on Bayesian analysis though.
