Magento - Trouble with setting up Model Read Adapter

I was following through on Alan Storm's tutorial on Magento's Model and ORM basics and I've run into a bit of a problem. When I get to the portion where I load from the Model for the first time I get this error "Fatal error: Call to a member function load() on a non-object...". I've reset everything already and tried again from scratch but I still get the same problem. My code looks like this: $params = $this->getRequest()->getParams(); $blogpost = Mage::getModel('weblog/blogpost'); var_dump($blogpost); echo("Loading the blogpost with an ID of ".$params['id']); $blogpost->load($params['id']); As you can see I dumped the contents of $blogpost and it shows that it is just a boolean false. My guess is that there's either a problem with the connection to the database or, for some reason, the code for Mage::getModel() didn't get installed correctly. EDIT - Adding Code There's so many that I just decided to pastebin them lol app/code/local/Ahathaway/Weblog/controllers/IndexController.php app/code/local/Ahathaway/Weblog/etc/config.xml app/code/local/Ahathaway/Weblog/Model/Blogpost.php app/etc/modules/Ahathaway_Weblog.xml
