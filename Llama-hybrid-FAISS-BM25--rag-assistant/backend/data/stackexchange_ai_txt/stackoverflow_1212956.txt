Jquery: one call triggered by multiple events

I have a simple search page with a single input box. I want to be able to trigger the search action either by clicking "Go" or by pressing Enter in the input box. I did it like this: $("input[name='entry']").keyup(function (event) { if (event.keyCode == 13) { search_phone(); } }); $('a#go').click(function () { search_phone(); }); Is there a more elegant way to do this? Like with bind and trigger, or fling. If so, how?
