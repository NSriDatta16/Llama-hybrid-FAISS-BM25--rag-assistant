How can I tell if I am overtraining my support vector machine?

I am trying to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify various items into 5 categories. I have trained two SVM classifiers, however, I am concerned that the accuracies and F1 scores do not change when some parameters are changed. SVM Classifier 1 Parameters: c = 0.001, kernel = poly, degree = 5, coef0 = 2.5, tol = 0.001, gamma = auto SVM Classifier 1 Results: Accuracy = 100% F1Score Weighted = 100% If I were to change some of the parameters such as... SVM Classifier 2 Parameters: c = 1.0 kernel = poly, degree = 1, coef0 = 0.0, tol = 0.001, gamma = auto SVM Classifier 2 Results: Accuracy = 100% F1Score Weighted = 100% Is it at all concerning that changing some of the parameters like C, degree, and coef0 do not change the overall results?
