One thought might be to take moving averages of varying time ranges (daily for weeks, months, years; weekly for months, years; etc) and compare them to moving averages now. The individual averages would also give you an easier comparison.. if consecutive items in the averages are in some normalized form (say from 0..1 to account for splits, etc), you can compare consecutive elements in the vector to each other inside some range epsilon , and get a potential of a match. Just a thought. Mathworld ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ ) should also have some take on curve comparisons.
