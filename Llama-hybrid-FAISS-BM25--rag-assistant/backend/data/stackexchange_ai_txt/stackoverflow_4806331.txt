Bamboo Vs. Hudson(a.k.a. Jenkins) vs Any other CI systems

Anyone out there have experience with both Hudson and Bamboo? Any thoughts on the relative strengths and weaknesses of these products? Okay, since folks keep mentioning other CI products I'll open this up further. Here are my general problem. I want to setup a CI system for a new project. This project will likely have Java components (WARs and JARs), some python modules, and possibly even a .NET component. So I want a CI server that can: Handle multiple languages, Deploy artifacts to servers (i.e. deploy the war if all the unit tests pass.) I would also like something that integrated with a decent code coverage tool. Good looking reports are nice, but not essential. Multiple notification mechanisms when things go wrong. I'm not worried about hosting. I'll either run it on a local server or on an Amazon instance. Also, this maybe pie in the sky, but is there something that can also build iPhone apps?
