Make a function that evaluates and stores the result in a cache object for asynchronous retrieval: var Cache = { } ; function evalString(string) { var evaluated = eval(string) ; Cache.evalResult = evaluated ; } You may then call that code like this: Cache.evalResult(/* arguments */) ; On a side note, "eval is evil" as http://www.jslint.com will tell you, since it may open the door for external manipulation of your content. Why do you need to eval that function it in the first place?
