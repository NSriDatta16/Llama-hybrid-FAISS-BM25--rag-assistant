Get user attention without stealing focus

I have a program that lets the user open several forms. Once a given event occurs (ex : 30 seconds have passed) I need to get user attention on the Form that triggered the event, without stealing the focus. I already get the form on top with: f.TopMost = true; but I'd like to implement some alternative to that. Since changing the border color of the frame seems a nearly impossible task ( this solution would have been the best one), does anyone has an idea on how to get attention without stealing focus?
