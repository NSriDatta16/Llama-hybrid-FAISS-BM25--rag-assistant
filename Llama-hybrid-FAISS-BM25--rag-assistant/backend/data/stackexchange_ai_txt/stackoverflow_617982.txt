C#: How can i elegantly and or simplistically make cross threaded calls?

i have a tcp server that, when a client connects, it makes a new thread and adds them to it but everytime i try to access information about the connection or anything about it, say even keeping a count of how many clients are connected, i get a cross-thread illegal exception or something like that. ive read several tutorials on things called delegates, invoking and reflection but all the examples or tutorials simply confuse me as doing one invoke a certain way fails in another. is there an elegant or simplistic way of doing this? do i need to learn how to do something else first? or am i just making things way more complex than they are? any suggestions, links or tips are most appreciated and accepted.
