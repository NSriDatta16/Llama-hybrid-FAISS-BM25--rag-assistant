I agree this is odd, but I suppose it could be caused by tied scores showing up in particular quartiles. Suppose we have 100 subjects that get scores from 1 to 100 in 1-point intervals, except that everybody who would have had a score between 26 and 50 instead gets a score of 30. In this case, the average score percentile among the second quartile is either 26 or 50, depending on how you handle endpoints in the percentile calculation. For a dataset with only distinct scores, the average percentile of the second quartile must be 37.5, but it would be possible to find a different average percentile within a quartile that contains tied scores. Not sure if this is the case, or if it's just an error in plotting - even Figures 1 and 4 don't look exactly the same in "actual test score" values (the second quantile in Fig 1 is near 35, but it's closer to 40 in Fig 4).
