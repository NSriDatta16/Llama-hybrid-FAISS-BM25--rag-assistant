SVC classification not working at all on MNIST dataset

I'm sure I probably did something stupid but I'm trying to fit a simple SVC classifier on MNIST dataset as an example, and it completely failed by only predicting result 1 (sometimes 7 depends on how I slice the data) for all testing set. to get data from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1) X, y = mnist["data"], mnist["target"] y = y.astype(np.uint8) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = X[:60000], X[60000:], y[:60000], y[60000:] to train a SVC data from sklearn.svm import SVC svm_clf = SVC(gamma="auto", random_state=45, probability = True) svm_clf.fit(X_train[:5000], y_train[:5000]) # y_train, not y_train_5 svm_clf.predict_proba(X_test[0:100]) to save time I only trained on a small subset of training data, and tested on a small subset of testing data. however all prediction results are "1". svm_clf.predict(X_test[0:100]) Out[14]: array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=uint8) I tried to train a random forest on same training set from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier forest_clf = RandomForestClassifier() forest_clf.fit(X_train[:5000], y_train[:5000]) forest_clf.predict(X_test[0:100]) and at least I'm getting reasonable results and a reasonable accuracy rate without any fine tuning. forest_clf.predict(X_test[0:100]) Out[39]: array([7, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 4, 9, 2, 9, 0, 1, 9, 0, 1, 5, 9, 7, 5, 4, 9, 6, 2, 5, 7, 0, 7, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 6, 7, 2, 7, 1, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 3, 9, 5, 2, 0, 4, 1, 9, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3, 9, 5, 5, 4, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 1, 7, 3, 7, 9, 7, 7, 6, 2, 7, 2, 4, 7, 3, 4, 1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7, 6, 9], dtype=uint8) y_test[0:100] Out[41]: array([7, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 4, 9, 5, 9, 0, 6, 9, 0, 1, 5, 9, 7, 3, 4, 9, 6, 6, 5, 4, 0, 7, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 7, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 3, 5, 5, 6, 0, 4, 1, 9, 5, 7, 8, 9, 3, 7, 4, 6, 4, 3, 0, 7, 0, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, 9, 7, 7, 6, 2, 7, 8, 4, 7, 3, 6, 1, 3, 6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 1, 7, 6, 9], dtype=uint8) so my question is, what am I missing here that the SVC completely failed predicting anything useful? I understand that fine-tuning is required to achieve good results but it's strange to think SVC completely failed at predicting anything and output all results regardless how I sliced trianing/testing set. thanks
