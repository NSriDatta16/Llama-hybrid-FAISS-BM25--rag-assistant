Try using splitView:constrainMaxCoordinate:ofSubviewAt: and splitView:constrainMinCoordinate:ofSubviewAt: instead of splitView:constrainSplitPosition:ofSubviewAt: . The former two methods are called once as the user drags the mouse and they give enough information for NSSplitView to know how to change the cursor during the drag. The latter is called repeatedly as the user drags the splitter, so NSSplitView doesn't have enough information to know that you're returning a constant value each time and therefore can't change the cursor.
