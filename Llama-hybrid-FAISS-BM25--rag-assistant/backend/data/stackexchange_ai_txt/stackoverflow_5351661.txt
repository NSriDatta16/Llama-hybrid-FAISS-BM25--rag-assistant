Access to BerkleyDB replication log

We are writing home grown search service based on BerkleyDB JE and Lucene. BDB used for storing original documents and Lucene for searching. We are planning to replicate BDB storage to achieve high availability and balance read requests. But there is a problem. When documents are replicated on BDB slave, application needs to know which documents should be reindexed in Lucene index. As far as I understand replication log already contains these entries (primary key is all I need in fact). So my question is there any way to access Berkley DB replication log and to calculate which records are changed in replication stream?
