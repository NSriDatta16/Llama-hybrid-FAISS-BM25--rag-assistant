AR model on SMA(k)

If I were to regress Yt+1 on the simple average of Yt , Yt-1 , ..., Yt-k , would I have results similar to a AR(k) model? More specifically, is there any literature on the characteristics of this breed of models (e.g. momentum in finance), and how do they compare to the AR(k)/MA(k) counterpart?
