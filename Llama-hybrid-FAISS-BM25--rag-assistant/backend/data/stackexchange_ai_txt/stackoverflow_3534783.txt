I'd review what you should know first (at least a little) before going on to new material. You'll need a good foundation in algebra, and at least some exposure to calculus before trying Concrete Mathematics or even The Art of Computer Programming. If you want to go from the practical side of computing Robert Sedegwick , has written some books that have source code explaining computer algorithms and theory.
