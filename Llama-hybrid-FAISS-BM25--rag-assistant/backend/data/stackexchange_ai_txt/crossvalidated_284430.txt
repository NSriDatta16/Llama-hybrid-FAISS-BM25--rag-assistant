Given that you want to use logistic regression as a classifier - It would make sense to define accuracy in terms of correctly predicted (CP) observations . To evaluate model performance, you could then compare the % of CP with chance level (~50% in binary case). Because of the shape of the logistic curve, keep in mind that it becomes increasingly difficult to improve %CP,such that a 70-80% CP would already be a good perf.
