There are tons and tons of architectures that you can try even in convolutional neural networks. If you have a sufficiently good amount of data, you can apply any of the ResNets (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50 etc..), ResNEXTs, or any light image architecture is sufficiently good for such tasks, it gives a great balance between performance and time of execution. But if you want to achieve a really high score and have a sufficiently huge amount of data, you can refer to Efficient-Nets for your models.
