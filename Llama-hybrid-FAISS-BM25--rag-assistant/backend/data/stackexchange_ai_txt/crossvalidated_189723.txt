Time series of variance

If the mean or total of a variable studied over time displays seasonality, should I expect that the variance of that variable should display seasonality similar to the mean? Why or why not? The data are company assets. There is no max value. Nor are the data strictly positive, but the vast majority of the data is positive. I'm not sure if it is relevant, but it is very left skewed (simply because more small companies exist than large companies).
