GIT - Cross platform smudge/clean filters?

I'm part of a fairly large organization with developers distributed geographically and using a mix of Windows, OSX, and Linux development environments. I've asked a previous question that leads me to want to use clean/smudge filters: Mark a file in the GIT repo as temporarily ignored But... what's the best way to do cross-platform filter scripts? I'd prefer not to require developers to install extra scripting environments. Are there any best practices around this? Any way to make the filters run on the server side (we use github)?
