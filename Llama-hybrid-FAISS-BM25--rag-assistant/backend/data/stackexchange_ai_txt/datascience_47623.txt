How feed a numpy array in batches in Keras

I have the data in the following format: 1: DATA NUMPY ARRAY (trainX) A numpy array of a set of numpy array of 3d np arrays. To be more articulate the format is: [[3d data], [3d data], [3d data], [3d data], ...] 2: TARGET NUMPY ARRAY (trainY) This consists of a numpy array of the corresponding target values for the above array. The format is [target1, target2, target3] The numpy array gets quite large, and considering that I'll be using a deep neural network, there will be many parameters that would need fitting into the memory as well. How can I push the numpy arrays in batches for trainX and trainY
