The interpolation method to use depends on what you are trying to achieve: CV_INTER_LINEAR or CV_INTER_CUBIC apply a lowpass filter (average) in order to achieve a trade-off between visual quality and edge removal (lowpass filters tend to remove edges in order to reduce aliasing in images). Between these two, i'd recommend you CV_INTER_CUBIC . CV_INTER_NN method actually is Nearest neighbour, it's the most basic method and you'll get sharper edges (no lowpass filter will be applied). However this method simply is like "zooming" the image, no visual enhancement.
