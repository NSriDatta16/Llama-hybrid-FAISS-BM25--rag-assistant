prophet holiday effect

I use prophet to do time series forecasting. During Christmas season, the data rise from 12/22, reach peak on 12/23 and 12/24 (positive effect), then drop a lot on 12/25 and 12/26 (negative effect). I want the model to capture both the positive effect and negative effects around Christmas time, should I define the Christmas holiday as one holiday(12/25, lower_window=-3,upper_window=1)? Or define two 'holidays's, one before_Christmas (12/24, lower_window=-2,upper_window=0) and one Christmas (12/25, lower_window=0,upper_window=1)? Thanks!
