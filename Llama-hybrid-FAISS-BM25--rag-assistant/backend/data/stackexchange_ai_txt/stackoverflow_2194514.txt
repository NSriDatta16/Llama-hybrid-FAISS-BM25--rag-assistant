It sounds like you are just interested in fetching and displaying objects. In this case, you do NOT use a search display controller. The search display controller is used with a search bar to help with allowing user-entered text searches of your content. Typically you use a fetched results controller to aid in your implementation of the table view datasource and delegate methods. Also, you create and use a fetch request for your fetched results controller. This is all boiler-plate (see the template code provided by Apple when you create a new project with the "Use Core Data for storage" option selected). It is in the fetch request that you can create and specify a predicate. This will allow you to filter the objects that your table displays. For example: // only fetch objects with myAttribute set to someValue NSPredicate *pred = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"myAttribute == %@",someValue]; [fetchRequest setPredicate:pred];
