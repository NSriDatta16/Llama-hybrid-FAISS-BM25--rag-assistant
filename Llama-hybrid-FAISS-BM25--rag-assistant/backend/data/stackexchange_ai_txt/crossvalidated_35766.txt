Cental limit theorem for average of iid variables

The Wikipedia entry on the CLT states at one point: "For fixed large $n$ one can also say that the distribution of $S_n$ is close to the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac1n\sigma^2$." $S_n = (\sum_{i=1}^nX_n) / n$ and $X_i$ are iids with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. I don't quite see how this follows from the other, more formal definitions. Is this statement true and what is the source/proof?
