That's a great question. I once spent a long time trying to figure this out. Of course, we are assuming you can not (easily) return from Main. The correct answer on the desktop is System.Environment.Exit ; But that method is conveniently not supported on CF. An apparent second option is Application.Exit . That is on CF, but only applies to WinForms, and is in fact not guaranteed to exit your application. So, throw an unhandled exception. ;) EDIT: To kill it programatically from another app, you can look at Process.GetProcessById , and Process.Kill . Both of these are available on CF. You will have to somehow let the "killer" app figure out the "victim"'s ID. More convenient methods like Process.GetProcessesByName are not available on CF. This technique isn't that elegant, though, and there may be permissions issues. You could also consider some kind of IPC (inter-process communication), perhaps one overviewed in this previous Windows Mobile answer .
