The distinction made in the Wikipedia article isn't particularly meaningful, especially given that some of the methods that appear in their own sections also appear under "Time series methods" (e.g. what they called "average approach" and the page for "moving average" are the same thing). One useful distinction, and what the article may have been trying to get at, is the one between methods which: Provide only a forecast function , that is, a mapping from the data to a point forecast. The "naive" method falls under this category. Define a complete probabilistic model for the dynamics, typically in the form of the transition law $p(Y_t|Y_1, ..., Y_{t-1})$ . In that case, a forecast function can be derived from this probabilistic model, usually as the solution to an optimization problem (e.g. the conditional expectation is optimal in a least squares sense). Models in this category allow for a natural quantification of forecast uncertainty in the form of prediction intervals. ARIMA models fall in this category. So, while there is indeed an ARIMA model which produces the exact same point forecasts as the average, naive or drift method, conceptually they are entirely different approaches.
