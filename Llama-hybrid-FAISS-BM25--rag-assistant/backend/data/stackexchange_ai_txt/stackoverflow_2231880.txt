It's too long when the name of the method wraps onto another line and the call to the method is the only thing on the line and starts pretty close to the margin. You have to take into account the average size of the screen of the people who will be using it. But! If the name seems too long then it probably is too long. The way to get around it is to write your code in such a way that you are within a context and the name is short but duplicated in other contexts. This is like when you can say "she" or "he" in English instead of someone's full name.
