Check out this script which, as far as I can tell, is supposed to enable or disable multiview. While it is written in a scripting language, it does leverage normal WinAPI functions, so you should be able to find out what is happening by looking at them. As far as I can tell, it appears that disabling a second monitor is done by calling ChangeDisplaySettingsEx on the second monitor and providing a width, height, colour depth and refresh rate of 0. To reenable it, one would call ChangeDisplaySettingsEx a second time with valid parameters presumably. Anyway it would probably be best to try the script (the interpreter is available for free on the homepage) and see if it achieves the functionality you're looking for (note that the script is hardcoded for two particular monitors, you will have to replace them with the names of your monitors to get it to work).
