This is a bug in Magento, and there's some chance that this bug will be fixed in next release 1.5.0.0. But I'd not rely on that. Currently there's no easy way to cope with it, as logic for this is hidden and separated across abstract EAV and Customer attributes models. The basic approach is to 1) Show date in backend in medium format with YYYY instead of YY and then either 2) Write your custom input validation filter that will validate date in medium format for DOB 3) Change input validation filter from default 'date' to yours (it's done in table customer_eav_attribute) or 2) write code to set _dateFilterFormat of 'dob' attribute to medium
