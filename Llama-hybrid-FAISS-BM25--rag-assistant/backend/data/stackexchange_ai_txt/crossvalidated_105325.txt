How can one construct a cumulative probability distribution function from 2 others?

I dip into project time estimation and can't find intuition. What is the cumulative probability distribution of an event when two independent tasks both complete successfully (when performed in parallel)? We have two cumulative probability distribution functions on 2 independent random variables that represent duration from project start to possible finish date (more time â€“ more likely that a team completes a task): $$F_1(x) = P(\xi_1 \le x)$$ $$F_2(x) = P(\xi_2 \le x)$$ What is: $$F(x) = P(\xi_1 \le x\ \&\ \xi_2 \le x)$$ How can it be derived or represented from/by $F_1$ and $F_2$? UPDATE I agree that $$P(\xi_1 \le x\ \&\ \xi_2 \le y) = P(\xi_1 \le x) \cdot P(\xi_2 \le y) $$ for event $(\xi_1, \xi_2) \in R^2$ But misconception come from expected value of joint event: what is average time to complete both task? I think that it is: $$E(X) = \int_0^\infty xf_1(x)f_2(x)dx$$ Previously I think that it will be $E(\xi_1)\cdot E(\xi_2)$ - but this is wrong (you get time^2 unit!!) and so doubt about multiplication low as think that something wrong in that part.
