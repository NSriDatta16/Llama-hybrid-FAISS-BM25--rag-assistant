How to transform a non-stationary time series with short spikes to stationary?

I used ADF test to test stationarity: ADF Statistic: -7.8345728860708865 p-value: 6.163993342051128e-12 Critical Values: 1%: -3.4317832926440612 5%: -2.8621733470784583 10%: -2.56710713369859 The p-value is very high, so I can't reject the null hypothesis. Then I applied log transformation to my dataset. Here is the ADF results: ADF Statistic: -5.96668063663575 p-value: 1.98016390368094e-07 Critical Values: 1%: -3.431782350810031 5%: -2.8621729309985806 10%: -2.5671069122000763 Even so, the p-value is much larger than 0.05. Finally I tried to use differencing: ADF Statistic: -5.375440230205101 p-value: 3.813633376803356e-06 Critical Values: 1%: -3.4319060752453483 5%: -2.862227588385493 10%: -2.567136009040254 My time series plotted: Why the p-value is so high? Is it because of the short spikes? How can I make my time series stationary? EDIT : I had not realized that the p-value is in scientific notation, so my p-value
