According to The Queen Of Indexing - Kimberly Tripp - what she looks for in a clustered index is primarily: Unique Narrow Static And if you can also guarantee: Ever-increasing pattern then you're pretty close to having your ideal clustering key! Check out her entire blog post here , and another really interesting one about clustering key impacts on table operations here: The Clustered Index Debate Continues . Anything like an INT (esp. an INT IDENTITY) or possibly an INT and a DATETIME are ideal candiates. For other reasons, GUID's aren't good candidates at all - so you might have a GUID as your PK, but don't cluster your table on it - it'll be fragmented beyond recognition and performance will suffer.
