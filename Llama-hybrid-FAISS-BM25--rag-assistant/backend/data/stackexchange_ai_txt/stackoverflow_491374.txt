C# - Can someone tell me why and where I should use delegates?

I think I understand the concept of a delegate in C# as a pointer to a method, but I cant find any good examples of where it would be a good idea to use them. What are some examples that are either significantly more elegant/better with delegates or cant be solved using other methods?
