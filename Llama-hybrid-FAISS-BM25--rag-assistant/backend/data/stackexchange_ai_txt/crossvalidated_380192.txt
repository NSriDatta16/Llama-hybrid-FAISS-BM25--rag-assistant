There is a correspondence between regular linear regression and a generalized linear regression model with a probit link function. So this answer doesn't apply to the logistic regression model with a logit link. Assume $\tilde{Y}$ is your home price, $x$ is your nonrandom predictor, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are your coefficients, and $\epsilon \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2)$ is one of your spherical error terms. If $$ \tilde{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon $$ then $\tilde{Y} \sim \text{Normal}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x, \sigma^2)$ . We have normality, so we can come up with probabilities. Let $Y \in \{0,1\}$ be your binary predictor that tells you when a home price is greater than \$100,000. Or in other words, $Y=1$ whenever $\tilde{Y} > 100,000$ . Then \begin{align*} P(Y=1 |x) &= P(\tilde{Y} > 1e5) \\ &= P( \epsilon > 1e5 - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x ) \\ &= P( \epsilon Coming from the other end of things, a probit model estimates $$ P(Y=1|x) = \Phi(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x). $$ Both models, if used to predict the binary outcome, predict with a function formed by composing the normal cdf with a linear transformation of $x$ . The coefficients are not quite the same, but you can see the relationship: $\alpha_0 = (-1e5 + \beta_0)/\sigma$ and $\alpha_1 = \beta_1 / \sigma$ . This means the models should give you the same predictions roughly for whether a house is expensive, but not the same parameter estimates.
