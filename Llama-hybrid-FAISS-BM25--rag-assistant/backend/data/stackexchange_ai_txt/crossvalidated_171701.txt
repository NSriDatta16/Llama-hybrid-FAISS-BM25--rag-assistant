The major branches of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, there are some target values. In classification problems, you have categorical target values. In regression problems, you have continuous target values. For example, there are support vector classification (SVM-C) and support vector regression (SVM-R) algorithms. In unsupervised learning, there are no target values, and no "correct results".
