EM algorithm to estimate discrete Markov chain transition probabilities

I'm surveying algorithms to estimate the transition probabilities of a discrete Markov chain and I found that EM approach could used. However I am not able to find any simple description on how to implement the EM algorithm to fit a discrete Markov chain giving a data sequence. Is there any R function that does this?
