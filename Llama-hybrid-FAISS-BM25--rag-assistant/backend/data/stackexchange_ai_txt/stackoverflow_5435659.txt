This is because you are comparing it to the string representation of undefined, rather than undefined itself: localStorage['asdf'] >>undefined localStorage['asdf'] == undefined >>true localStorage['asdf'] == 'undefined' >>false So you have two options, you can 1) typeof localStorage['asdf'] != "undefined" or 2) localStorage['asdf'] != undefined
