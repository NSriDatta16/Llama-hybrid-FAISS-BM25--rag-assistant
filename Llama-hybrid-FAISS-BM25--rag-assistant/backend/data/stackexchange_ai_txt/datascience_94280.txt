How to understand Xgboost model dump

Noticed that spark xgboost does not have a API trees_to_dataframe() as that in Python API, I am trying to parse the getModelDump result, but I am confused on its format, which fields represents what etc. // train xgb_model in spark version of xgboost scala> xgb_model res18: ml.dmlc.xgboost4j.scala.spark.XGBoostClassificationModel = xgbc_89286dd04aa3 scala> xgb_model.nativeBooster.getModelDump(null, true); res19: Array[String] = Array("0:[f1 res19.size res20: Int = 200 My Model parameter settings is below : xgbParams = {'n_estimators': 200, 'max_depth': 2, 'eta': 0.05, 'lambda':1, 'gamma':4, 'alpha':0.1, 'subsample':0.8, #'min_child_weight': 1, 'colsample_bytree':0.8, 'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'colsample_bylevel':0.8, 'eval_metric':'logloss', 'seed': 1122, 'missing': -999999999} I think the res19.size = 200 makes sens, as I have set n_estimators to 200. I am confused on each string in res19 , which all formatted as below: I think f2 must represent some certain feature, but how can I find the examply feature name ? Also, what does 0 , 1 , 2 represent? and what does yes=3, no=4 mean ? I have also checked understanding-python-xgboost-model-dump-output-of-a-very-simple-tree but that posts only explain the value represented by the leaf node. Thanks in advance !! 0:[f2 ```
