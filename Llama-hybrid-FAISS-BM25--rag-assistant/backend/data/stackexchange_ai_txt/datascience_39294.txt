Deep Learning Model apply for prediction real values

I have a dataset following structure: Dataset Trainig_Set Folder_ID_1 Folder_ID_2 Folder_ID_3 . . . Foder_ID_125 Each folder has no equal images, i.e, Folder_ID_1 = 600, Folder_ID_1 = 750, ... , Folder_ID_45 = 450 . I has label value following structure: {"Folder_ID_1": 12.1, "Folder_ID_2": 9.1, "Folder_ID_2": 10.5, ... , "Folder_ID_125": 8.5} Question: (1) How can apply Deep learning Model for prediction such like real value?
