You could define ochan_= so that assigning a new value to ochan closes the old channel (similar to std::auto_ptr<> in C++) but I don't see how you can encapsulate that in a child class of Option[Channel] because the storage is in your class. The solution wouldn't change the code much at all, it would just make disconnect implicit by assigning ochan .
