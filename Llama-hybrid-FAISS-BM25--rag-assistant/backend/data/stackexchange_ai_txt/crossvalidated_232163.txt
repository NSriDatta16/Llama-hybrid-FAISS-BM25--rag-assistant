Gaussian process regression vs deep learning

I have the following analytic function. $y =e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^2} \left(4 \sin^2 6 x + 3 \cos^2 x \sin^2 4 x + 1\right)$ My goal is to create $(x, y)$ pairs from this function where $x = [-2, 2]$ and use nonlinear regression to fit a curve to the data. This is for mere educational purpose. Which one of Gaussian Process Regression and deep learning (using TensorFlow) should give me better RMSE?
