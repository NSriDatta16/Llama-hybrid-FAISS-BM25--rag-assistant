Does it make sense to rewrite Perl and shell scripts in java?

I have a bunch of scripts - some in perl and some in bash - which are used for: Creating a database (tables, indexes, constraints, views) Parsing spreadsheets and loading the data into the database Getting info about a bunch of files and loading that into the database. These scripts are used in conjunction with a much larger application that is written in java, and my manager has requested that I rewrite the scripts in java. His reasoning is that it is easier to work with, port, manage, understand, and support if it's all in one language, and that too many separate pieces is a design issue. My initial reaction is that this is a bad idea. The scripts are beautifully concise and fast, and tasks that are trivial in the scripts - such as using regexs to find and replace invalid values - will be so much more verbose and very likely slower when done in java. The one drawback of the scripts is that when they run on windows they require cygwin in order to run. Therefore I would like to give a counter proposition that I port all the bash scripts to perl so that they can run on windows without cygwin, and that I spend time organizing and documenting the scripts. The problem is that a "gut reaction" type of response is not going to be enough to convince my manager. I come from a linux background, he from Windows, and we have some of the classic linux vs. windows differences in approaches. So I have two questions: Is my "gut reaction" correct? Is java slower, more verbose, and harder to maintain for database management, spreadsheet parsing, & file processing tasks? If the answer to the first question is yes, what is the best way to present my case? EDIT: Thanks everyone for the insights. I'd like to make one clarification: the scripts are not full-blown apps hidden away in obfuscated scripts. They are, for the most part, tasks that had been done manually that I automated via scripts and later embellished as the requirements developed. And the reason I used a scripting language instead of java to start with is because these tasks were so much easier to do in scripts. For example, one script runs a bunch of queries, formats the results, and outputs them to a file. How many LOC do you think it would take to do that in java?
