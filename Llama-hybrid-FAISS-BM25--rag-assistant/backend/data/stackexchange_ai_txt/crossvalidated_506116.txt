Extreme collinearity for Random Forest?

My data have 450 observations and 2200 predictors that I want to use to train a RF model to classify 4 classes. However, about 2165 of the predictors are very highly correlated to each other. The way I found it was running the following code: cor_matrix = cor(training[, -1]) # ignore y highly_correlated = caret::findCorrelation(x = cor_matrix, cutoff = .9, names = T) length(highly_correlated) As most of my variables are highly correlated, what would you suggest me to do? Should I go ahaed and train my model without worrying too much about it or should I choose another algorithm? I ran RF model both with and without doing preprocessing (PCA) and all I could achieve was about 36% accuracy. What are my options? #my model without PCA model_rf = caret::train(class ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 3)) #my model with PCA trc = caret::trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, preProcOptions = list(thresh = .95)) model_rf_pca = caret::train(class~., data = training, method = "rf", preProcess = c("pca"), trControl = trc) ```
