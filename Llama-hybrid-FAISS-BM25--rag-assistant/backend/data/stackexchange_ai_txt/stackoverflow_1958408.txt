IP address alone is not sufficient : Several users can have the same IP address (users behind a proxy at work, for instance) A single user can have several IP addresses (that was the case a couple of years ago for AOL users, for instance) In that kind of situation, I generally use something based on a combinaison of : IP address And several other HTTP headers, like, for instance : User-Agent (for instance, it can be as complex as " Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7pre) Gecko/20091221 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.6 ") Accept (for instance, " text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 ") Accept-Language (for instance, " fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 ") Accept-Charset (for instance, " ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 ") If only on of those is different from the previous request, I consider it's OK ; but if more than 2 or 3 of those are different, it's strange, and it often mean it's not the same user.
