Not sure if you can do it remotely as such, but you could "fake" it. Look at the MSDN documentation for the Windows Update Agent API , specifically the article called Searching, Downloading, and Installing Updates . That contains a script that among other things lists the updates ready to be installed. If you take that bit of the script and amend it to instead write a list to a file, then you could copy the script over to a remote computer, execute the script remotely, then read the file (and finally delete the file and the script from the remote computer to clean up). You can execute a script remotely using WMI, see this CodeProject article for details for doing so from C#: Create a Remote Process using WMI in C#
