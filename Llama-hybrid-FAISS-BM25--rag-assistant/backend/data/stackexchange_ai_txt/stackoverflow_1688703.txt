You're better off hiring an actual pen-testing contracting agency to look for vulnerabilities in your site. Sure, you could run automated scanners, but they can only do so much. You'll probably waste more money and resources attempting to learn and implement proper pen testing then you would just hiring someone else to do it. The fact that you're asking this question means that you are not qualified to give the kind of confidence or complete coverage a commercial application would need before launch.
