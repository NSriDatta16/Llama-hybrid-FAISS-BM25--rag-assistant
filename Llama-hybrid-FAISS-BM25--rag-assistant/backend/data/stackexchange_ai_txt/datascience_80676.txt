you know, when they say the business team needs insights, it doesnt always imply machine learning. You could also do a lot of exploratory analysis and visualize spending trends, seasonality among the demographic spending, when the customers are most active during the day, highlight the towns with the highest income growth rate, which age group is your largest customer base, your most profitable merchants in terms of volume as well as income. these are some of the insights the business team could use to make business strategies. you could also cluster customers based on their spending patterns, age group, location etc to identify the most profitable customer groups. lastly, this is basically time series data, so you could apply some traditional machine learning models like SARIMA or deep learning models like LSTMs or GRUs for time series forecasting the company earnings.
