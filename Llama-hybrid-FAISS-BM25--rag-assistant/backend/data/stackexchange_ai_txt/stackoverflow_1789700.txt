The only way I can see you achieving this is through Javascript. I know you didn't tag/ask for JS but I can't think of a straightforward, elegant CSS solution. With JS you could capture the onpropertychange event of the header div, check to see if the property changed was offsetHeight/clientHeight and adjust the top style property of the content div. The content div would also need to have position:absolute; and bottom:0px; . Sorry if you're not interested in a JS solution, I just don't think there is a CSS one without accepting a user experience below what you're trying to achieve.
