Calculating the true error comprised of two probability distributions

Let $X$ = {0,1,2,3,4} and $Y$ = {0,1}. A probability distribution $D$ defined on $X\times Y$ such that $D_x$ = Binomial(4, 0.5) and $D_{y\mid x}$ = Bernoulli(0.5). Given the predictor: $h(x)$ = $0$ if $x$ is even, $1$ if $x$ is odd, find $L_D(h)$ , where $L_D(h)$ represents the true error of a prediction rule, or the probability $D({x : h(x) \ne f(x)})$ . So because $D$ is $X\times Y$ , I have D defined as ${4\choose k}(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})^k(\frac{1}{2})^{4-k}$ , and $X\times Y$ has 10 valid points in $[0,4] \times [0,1]$ . After this, I am unsure how to further approach the problem in order to calculate $L_D(h)$ . For reference, I am learning machine learning off of this textbook (we have covered Ch2 and most of Ch3): https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf Any guidance is appreciated. Thank you.
