I think in this case you should consider offline caching: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Offline_resources_in_Firefox#Specifying_a_cache_manifest You can also store user input data in localStorage or sessionStorage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#sessionStorage https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#localStorage Don't use globalStorage (not a standard).
