Modifying gcal embed CSS with Jquery?

So I've got an issue with google calendar embedding. I hate the white border and I'm trying to get rid of it but I can't modify the css inside the iframe. I'm wondering if there's a way to do it with jquery? Maybe using .ready() or something? I've tried selecting the child of the iFrame with jquery but it doesn't work. The part I need is in inline css on the body tag in the iframe, like this: Any ideas?
