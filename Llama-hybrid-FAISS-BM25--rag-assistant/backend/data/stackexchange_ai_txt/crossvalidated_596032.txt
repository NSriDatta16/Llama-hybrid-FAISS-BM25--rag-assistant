Weird spike and steady state in loss function

I have trained a CNN based pose estimation network that outputs segmentation masks and keypoints. I have used Adam optimizer, 1e-4 learning rate and cyclical learning rate scheduler . As shown on figure, on 40th epoch there is a extreme spike and then there occurs a steady state loss for all epochs. What could have caused this?
