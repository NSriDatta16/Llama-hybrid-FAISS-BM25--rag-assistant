Tidying up a list

I'm fairly sure there should be an elegant solution to this (in MATLAB), but I just can't think of it right now. I have a list with [classIndex, start, end], and I want to collapse consecutive class indices into one group like so: This 1 1 40 2 46 53 2 55 55 2 57 64 2 67 67 3 68 91 1 94 107 Should turn into this 1 1 40 2 46 67 3 68 91 1 94 107 How do I do that? EDIT Never mind, I think I got it - it's almost like fmarc's solution , but gets the indices right a=[ 1 1 40 2 46 53 2 55 55 2 57 64 2 67 67 3 68 91 1 94 107]; d = diff(a(:,1)); startIdx = logical([1;d]); endIdx = logical([d;1]); b = [a(startIdx,1),a(startIdx,2),a(endIdx,3)];
