HTML5 number input step bug

I am trying to use the new HTML5 number input for users to input a price. I want the step to be "0.01". This should be fairly simple, and my code looks like this: Well if you click on the arrows a bit, you'll get numbers like 1.1400000000000001 or numbers like 1.1 which both don't make sense for dollars. Does anyone know of a way to make the number field actually step by 0.01, and to have a consistent number of significant figures? Or if anyone has a more elegant solution for allowing users to input prices, I would love to hear it. Thanks
