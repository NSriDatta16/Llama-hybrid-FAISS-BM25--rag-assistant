One possibility is a Boyer-Moore string search: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm You'll have to adapt it to your image search problem, of course. Supposing the large image has N pixels and the small one M pixels, you'd be looking at an average case performance of N/M, which is rather good.
