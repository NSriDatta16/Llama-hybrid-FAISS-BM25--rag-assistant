Are shapefiles what you're referring to? Here's a quote from a Wiki article about them: The shapefile format is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software. It is developed and regulated by Esri as a (mostly) open specification for data interoperability among Esri and other GIS software products. The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile **** Edit **** Here's a paper that may be close to what you're looking for by Elizabeth Roberto, Spatial Boundaries and the Local Context of Residential Segregation . Here's the abstract: Spatial boundaries are a defining feature of a city’s social and spatial organization. Rivers, highways, and train tracks create excess distance between nearby locations and often mark social separation – they become dividing lines that are well known to residents. Qualitative studies are rich with insight about the local significance of boundaries, but they have been largely ignored in the quantitative segregation literature. I advance existing scholarship by integrating spatial boundaries into the way we measure residential segregation for city populations. I introduce a new method that measures the proximity of residential locations and the reach of local environments around each location using road distance. This is more realistic than straight line ("as the crow flies") distance, because it captures the connectivity of roads and the distance imposed by physical boundaries... https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0cb0/4b5d06078f50c0d6c561e67b4543f26c91ea.pdf
