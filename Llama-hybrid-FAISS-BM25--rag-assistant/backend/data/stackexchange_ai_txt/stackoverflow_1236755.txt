IF you are absolutely positively sure that your web server will always have access to the file system hosting the images, then go that route. Maybe. However, if at any time you think you might need to, i don't know, create an image server because the hard drive on your web server is running out of space OR that you need to run multiple web servers, then save yourself the trouble and store them in a database. The hard part in storing on a file system is the security requirements of crossing the network. Also, bear in mind that not all database servers are created equal in this regard. SQL 2008 introduced a FILESTREAM data type which actually stores the images on the local file system while allowing all read / write access through the db server. This has the added benefit of allowing you to run virus scanners on the incoming files while in storage. Oracle has had some nice file storage facilities for awhile now. MySQL? I don't think I'd want to try, but you might be okay. As to the second question: save a thumbnail along with the image. This process occurs only once per image and saves on presentation bandwidth. Using HTML to size an image down really does nothing for the client.
