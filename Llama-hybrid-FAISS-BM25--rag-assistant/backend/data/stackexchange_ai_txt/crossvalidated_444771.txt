Likelihood of Poisson R.V with Bayesian Inference

In Bayesian Inference. Say I have a Poisson distributed R.V. K which denotes the observed number of some event over a specified time period. The rate of this Poisson distribution is given by the linear model (with parameter vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^{D+1}$ ) as: $$f(x;w) = w_0 + w_1x_1 + ... + w_Dx_D$$ The likelihood of the n'th data is given by: $$p(k_n|x_n,w) = \frac{f(x_n;w)^{k_n} e^{-f(x_n;w)}}{k_n!}$$ For values of $k_n \geq 0$ , where values $k_n . How would I go about computing the likelihood of an entire data set given the above setup? If I assume that $k_n$ is conditional independent given $x_n$ I would be able to compute the likelihood over the entire data set as the product of each individual data-point: $$p(k|x;w) = \prod_{n=1}^n \frac{f(x_n;w)^{k_n} e^{-f(x_n;w)}}{k_n!}$$ Which could also be expressed as: $$p(k|x;w) = \frac{f(x_n;w)^{K} e^{-n \cdot f(x_n;w)}}{k_1!k_2!...k_n!}, K = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i$$ But I am uncertain if this likelihood is correct (for the entire dataset) as I fail to incorporate the constraint $k_n in the above. So can I assume that the above likelihood indeed cover the entire dataset, or should I add the constraint saying this is only true for $k_n \geq 0$ ? And that any datapoints $k_n would just be 0, and thus not change the product of likelihoods? So what I really struggle with, is if I should somehow define for the constraint $k_n what influence that particular data-point has on the likelihood estimation above (as this is a product of likelihoods, if $k_n would equal $0$ then the product would also equal to $0$ , as we would have some products of likelihood values times $0$ ).
