Eclipse CDT toolchain question

I want to use Eclipse CDT as an editor. I work in windows machine (since it more poserfull compiuter), while the toolchain resides on the linux box. Now I open Eclipse, create empty project in the proper directory (disk on linux machine where the sources reside) and I add the sources (just drag-n-drop) into the project. All I want is ability to make crossreference and to colorize the syntax. Now I need to add the proper include directories and ... I have only the "cygwin gcc" with preconfigured include pathes, that I cannot remove. I want to define my own enviroment with include pathes, compiler etc. How to do it? Thanks
