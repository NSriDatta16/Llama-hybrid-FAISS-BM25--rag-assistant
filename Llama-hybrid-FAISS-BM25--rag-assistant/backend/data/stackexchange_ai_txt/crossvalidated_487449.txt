"It was the correct play even though I lost"

*sorry if this isn't the right SE community, maybe it's more philosophical* You often hear this refrain in games like Poker or Hearthstone. The idea is that making play A this game resulted in a loss, but always making play A in the long run/limit is the best odds/EV. My question is: Why does this idea seem to require a frequentist approach, yet at the same time, even if this is the ONLY game played, the same play is still "correct". Are there any situations in the physical world were frequentism and bayesianism make separate predictions? (I know QM interpretations get into objective vs subjective nature of probability, but that won't be settled anytime soon). How can I reassure myself taking a frequentist approach is always the best for right here and now?
