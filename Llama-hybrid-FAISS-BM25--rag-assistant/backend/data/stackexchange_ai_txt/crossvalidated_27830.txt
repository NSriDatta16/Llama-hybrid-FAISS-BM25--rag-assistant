Logistic quantile regression – how to best convey the results

In a previous post I’ve wondered how to deal with EQ-5D scores . Recently I stumbled upon logistic quantile regression suggested by Bottai and McKeown that introduces an elegant way to deal with bounded outcomes. The formula is simple: $logit(y)=log(\frac{y-y_{min}}{y_{max}-y})$ To avoid log(0) and division by 0 you extend the range by a small value, $\epsilon$. This gives an environment that respects the boundaries of the score. The problem is that any $\beta$ will be in the logit scale and that doesn’t make any sense unless transformed back into the regular scale but that means that the $\beta$ will be non-linear. For graphing purposes this doesn’t matter but not with more $\beta$:s this will be very inconvenient. My question: How do you suggest to report a logit $\beta$ without reporting the full span? Implementation example For testing the implementation I’ve written a simulation based on this basic function: $outcome=\beta_0+\beta_1* xtest^3+\beta_2*sex$ Where $\beta_0 = 0$, $\beta_1 = 0.5$ and $\beta_2 = 1$. Since there is a ceiling in scores I’ve set any outcome value above 4 and any below -1 to the max value. Simulate the data set.seed(10) intercept fake_ceiling + abs(diff(range(linpred)))/2 | linpred fake_ceiling] To plot the above: library(ggplot2) # Just to give all the graphs the same look my_ylim Gives this image: The regressions In this section I create the regular linear regression, quantile regression (using the median) and logistic quantile regression. All estimates are based on bootstrapped values using the bootcov() function. library(rms) # Regular linear regression fit_lm The plots To compare with the base function I’ve added this code: library(lattice) # Calculate the true lines x fake_ceiling] fake_ceiling] The contrast output Now I've tried to get the contrast and it's almost "right" but it varies along the span as expected: > contrast(boot_rq_logit, list(gender=levels(gender), + xtest=c(-1:1)), + FUN=function(x)antilogit_fn(x, epsilon)) gender xtest Contrast S.E.
