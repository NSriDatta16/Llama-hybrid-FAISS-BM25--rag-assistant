The power of an array is that it allows you to put a group of things together so that you can perform the same operation on all of them with less code. Sorting is one example of an array operation, and is like having a box of index cards that you are putting in order. Or if you had a collection of letters that need to go out, being able to write a loop that stamps each letter and then sends it is better than writing out Take first letter, stamp it. Mail it. Takes second letter, stamp it, Mail it. Basically anything you'ld use to refer to the first, second, third, fifth, etc, is basically like an array. And then indexed/hashed arrays are like having an index in the book - you know the author describes the Defenistration of Prague somewhere in the volume, but looking in the index shows that it's on page 255.
