Identifying similar data points

I have a data set where customers who are non-delinquent with us have defaulted with others. So from the total data set, 30% are those who defaulted with others but 70% are those who are good with us and other others as well. With the help of 30% customers who defaulted with others (being good/non-delinquent with us), can we identify the similar customers (matching in profile) from the remaining 70% customers who are currently good with us as well as with others, and also to any new customer? This is required so that we can have an early indication that who are the customers (from remaining 70% & any new addition) most likely turn bad in near future? I am not sure how to apply any machine learning algorithm (as we just have 1 class defaulted with others) to identify similar customers.
