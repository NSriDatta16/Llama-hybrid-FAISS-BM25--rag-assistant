I would not do this for three reasons: As Jeff said, your possibly handing out the keys to the kingdom You don't want attention drawn to your network unless you have the ability to mitigate a decent sized DoS attack. You never know when the content you host is going to tick off someone else resulting in this. That means, your whole network could (in theory) be cut off from the outside world. Even if a compromise is contained to the DMZ, you run the risk of having that server sending out SPAM all over the world. You do NOT want the pain of getting that IP out of a DNSBL while outgoing company mail goes to a black hole. Its just too cheap to pay for hosting or co-location of a small server somewhere else. EDIT : Added reason #3
