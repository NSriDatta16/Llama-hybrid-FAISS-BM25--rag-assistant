You seem to want a prediction interval. A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values of the average $y$ for a given $x$ , while a prediction interval gives a range of plausible values of the observed $y$ for a given $x$ . In R software, you can do the following. set.seed(2023) x pred.int fit lwr upr 1 0.23080914 0.20559627 0.25602201 2 0.05810088 0.03209494 0.08410681 3 0.05231177 0.02604125 0.07858229 4 0.15941019 0.13563641 0.18318397 5 0.27036802 0.24339181 0.29734423 The chart tells you that the estimated/predicted value is in the first column, while the lower and upper limits of the prediction interval are in the second and third columns, respectively. The "level" argument is analogous to the confidence level, so these would be $95\%$ prediction intervals (since level = 0.95 ). In math, the prediction intervals are calculated by the following: $$ \hat y_i \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-p}s\sqrt{1 + x_i\left(X^TX\right)^{-1}x_i} $$ $\alpha$ is one minus your desired level, so $\alpha = 0.05$ for a $95\%$ interval, $\alpha = 0.1$ for a $90\%$ interval, etc. $n$ is the sample size, so $5$ in this case. $p$ is the number of parameters in the regression equation, so $2$ in this case (slope and intercept). $t_{\alpha/2, n-p}$ is the critical value for a two-sided confidence interval at the $(1-\alpha)100\%$ -level, for a $t$ -distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom. $s$ is the estimated error variance from the regression. $x_i$ is a vector of $1$ followed by the imperfect measurement. $y_i$ is the predicted value. $X$ is the model matrix, $X = \left( \begin{matrix} 1 & 0.219\\ 1 & 0.04 \\ 1 & 0.034 \\ 1 & 0.145 \\ 1 & 0.26 \end{matrix} \right)$ , in this case. The $1$ is added inside the square root so that the prediction interval never shrinks to have a length of zero as the sample size increases, which contrasts with a confidence interval that does shrink to have zero length as the sample size goes to infinity.
