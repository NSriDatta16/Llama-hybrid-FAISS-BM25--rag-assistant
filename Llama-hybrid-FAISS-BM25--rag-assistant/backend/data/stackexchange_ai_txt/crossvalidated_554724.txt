Is there an official procedure to compute mIoU (mean intersection over union)?

Although it sounds silly, I'm not finding an official source to compute mean intersection over union (mIoU) . I'm realizing a semantic segmentation task, and I want to compute the mIoU over a dataset. My doubt is, should I compute the mIoU of each image and average the results in the end, or should I build a giant confusion matrix of all image results and compute the mIoU from there? APPENDIX : In case, anyone finds it later, it really seems to have multiple implementations that will differ on results for mIoU . On this issue is pointed out some divergences. It's also noted differences on the implementation of fastai and Cityscape .
