Bayesian Hierarchical Model - Exact Conjugate Solution?

I was hoping to get some help. In understand how to compute an exact numerical solution ( http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/lectures/lecture5.pdf ) for the following Bayesian model: $$ \tau \sim Ga(\alpha, \beta)$$ $$\mu \sim N(m ,p)$$ $$Y_i \sim N(\mu, \tau)$$ where the data is $Y_i$. I am performing a meta-analysis where my data are $Y_i$ from each study, and $\tau_i$ from each study. The problem is described by a hierarchical model: $$ \tau \sim Ga(\alpha, \beta)$$ $$\mu \sim N(m ,p)$$ $$\theta_i \sim N(\mu, \tau)$$ $$Y_i \sim N(\theta_i, \tau_i)$$ Is there any way to solve this model analytically? Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
