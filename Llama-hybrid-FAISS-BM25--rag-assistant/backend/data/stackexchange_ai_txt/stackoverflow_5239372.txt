I solved two of three problems: When animating the entire page (like scrolling to content), you must target both the html and body tags like so: $('html, body') . Previously i had only $('body') so the code didn't work in IE. Chrome needs 'body' while IE needs 'html' so in total you need to include both. Also, comments are stripped from ajax calls so my flash embed, that uses special conditiontionals with html comments for IE, comes back with the wrong tags for IE. That is why no video is played in IE. The last problem that still persists: firefox fails to re-organize the boxes on my site properly after opening a box. Who knows why!
