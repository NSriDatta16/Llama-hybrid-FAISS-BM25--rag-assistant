I'm currently using Nanoc , and I'd definitely recommend starting with a static site generator. This almost completely cuts out many types of issue. It also enables you to store your content as text files on a filesystem, rather than dealing with a database and special editor interfaces. If you need server-side programming then move up to something that uses Git as the storage, again really to avoid locking your content into a database. It's well worth looking at Compass to help you with the CSS - Compass will work with whatever you choose. Compass does require you to spend a little time learning it, but can makes CSS much easier in the longer-term. For example, it has helpers that let you set up CSS3 effects.
