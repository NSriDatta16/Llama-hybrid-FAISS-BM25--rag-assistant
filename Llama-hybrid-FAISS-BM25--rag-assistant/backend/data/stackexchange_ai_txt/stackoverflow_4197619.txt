I'm the tech lead for EclipseLink MOXy , I'm very interested in your versioning requirements. You can reach me through my blog: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/p/contact_01.html MOXy offers a means to represent the JAXB metadata as an XML file. You can leverage this to create multiple mappings for the same object model: http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/MOXy/EclipseLink-OXM.XML
