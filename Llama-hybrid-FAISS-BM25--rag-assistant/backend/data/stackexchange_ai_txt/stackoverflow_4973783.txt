R Plotting - groups of lines with known colors

I have done very little interesting plotting in R so I'm looking for a little help. Thanks in advance. I have two data.frames: > dim(MyDates) [1] 371 1 > dim(SumData) [1] 371 30 MyDates holds 371 Monday-Friday dates. SumData holds 30 different data streams aligned properly against MyDates. The data is clustered in 6 groups defined as such: groups=list(1:5,6:10,11:15,16:20,21:25,26:30) I would like to create one plot with all 30 columns in SumData plotted as (I think) solid lines. The X axis must be MyDates in ascending order. I would like to color each group differently. group1 = red group2 = yellow group3 = green group4 = cyan group5 = blue group6 = magenta 1 plot, 30 lines, 6 groups, 5 lines/group, each group a pre-defined color. How can I accomplish this? Thanks!
