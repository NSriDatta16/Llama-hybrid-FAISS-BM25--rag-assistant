As Alberto pointed out, it's common to use -n to check to see if a string has a non-zero length, but in the case where the string may be empty or contain only whitespace, you'll want to quote the variable: if [ -n "$line" ] # ... Similarly, you can check to see if it has a zero length with -z : if [ -z "$line" ] # ... Negation is also supported when it makes more sense: if [ ! -z "$line" ] # ... Edit: And since you're using bash, you can actually use some other nice features such as: Double brackets (e.g. [[ expr ]] ), and Regular expressions (e.g. [[ cat =~ ca[bat] ]] ) See the conditional constructs section in man bash for more information.
