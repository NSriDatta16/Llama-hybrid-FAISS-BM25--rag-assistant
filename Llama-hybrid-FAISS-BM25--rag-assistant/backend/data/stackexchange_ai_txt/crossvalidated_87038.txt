A similar thing with bootstrap replication is implemented in the "bolasso" function of the R package "mht" (for multiple hypothesis testing), and published here http://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/pdfs/icml_bolasso.pdf but they take the intersection of the sets of predictors with nonzero coefficients from all the replication samples, and then fit unregularized least squares estimators using only those variables. You pointed out the problem with taking the union of the supports, that you lose the advantage of dimensionality reduction, and your Lasso estimates are still biased.
