I found a solution to this myself: You need to overload the const_iterator lower_bound() method to include a BulkRetrievalOption argument just like begin(). This will internally create the interator instance using that argument just as begin() does but then move the iterator to the lower bound of the key value supplied. Same would apply to a db_map::find
