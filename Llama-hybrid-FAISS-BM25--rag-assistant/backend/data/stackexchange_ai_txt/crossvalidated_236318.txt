Need advice on classification.

I would be grateful if someone can provide some insight into classification. I have a data set which has a large number of feature > 5000 and 60 observations, with 13 classes. My data set has classes which repeat, lets say for example, I have the classes: A,B,C,D,E. In my data set I have A,A,A,A,A,B,B,B,B,B,C,C,C,C,C,D,D,D,D,E,E for the classes alone, each of which has different feature values. Should I treat this as one dataset to train for classification? or should I spilt the data so each class is repeated only once? Another question I have is that I am using KNN classification and would like to cross validate KNN using K-fold to find the optimal K value. Should I apply PCA on the entire data set first, find the PC and use the rotation values from PCA as my input for the cross validation. I am really stuck, any advice or help to apply me to solve this will be much appreciated. P.s. if what i have written doesn't make sense i'll happily try my best to explain it differently - it is my understanding of it so far. Many thanks in advance, hp
