One very common task in astronomy is image processing , concretely solving inverse problems which are under-determined . That is, given a distorted signal by an unknown process, estimate the original signal. A standard approach is to solve it though the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt). The paper by Steve Gull "Bayesian Inductive Inference and Maximum Entropy" explains it in great detail. Very nice paper. He was pioneering in popularizing those methods.
