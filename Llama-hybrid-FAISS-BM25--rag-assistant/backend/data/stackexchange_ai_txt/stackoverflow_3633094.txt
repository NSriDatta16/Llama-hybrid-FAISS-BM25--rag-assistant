The DotNetNuke user manuals are now available online here . I believe an update for 5.5.0 is coming soon. As the newest member of the DotNetNuke Corp. development team (about 2 months now), I can assure you that there is no secret API documentation. I have a copy of the same API docs that are on codeplex. It's no surprise that API documentation is limited, the vast majority of DNN was written by volunteer developers who would rather code than write comments, this problem is not rare among open source projects. My only advantage over the rest of the DNN developer community is easy access to some of the long time core team members who know how things are meant to work. There is a project to extend the API documentation underway, DNN corp is taking part and as always community contribution is highly encouraged. Ernst Peter Tamminga has being blogging about it recently here .
