I am new in Time series analysis (TSA), but my basic understanding is that the main aim of TSA is forecasting. A time series is made up of several components: Trend, Seasonal, cyclical, and irregular. By transforming or 'stationarizing' the series, its statistical properties (mean, variance) are easily forecasted as they remain fixed. The trend and seasonal components remain unchanged. The analysis is then mainly concentrated on forecasting the irregular component. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.
