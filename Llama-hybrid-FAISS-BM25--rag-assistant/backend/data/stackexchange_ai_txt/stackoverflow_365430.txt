I'd recommend you start partioning your table by ID or date. Partioning splits a large table into several smaller table according to some defined logic (like splitting it by date ranges), which makes them much more managable performance and memory wise. MySQL 5.1 has this feature built-in, or you can implement it using custom solutions. In implement storage in a flat-file, you lose all the advantages of a database - you can no longer perform queries involving the data.
