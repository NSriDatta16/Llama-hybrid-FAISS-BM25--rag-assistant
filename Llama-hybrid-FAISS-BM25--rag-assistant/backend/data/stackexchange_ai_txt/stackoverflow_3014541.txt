T-SQL How To: Compare and List Duplicate Entries in a Table

SQL Server 2000. Single table has a list of users that includes a unique user ID and a non-unique user name. I want to search the table and list out any users that share the same non-unique user name. For example, my table looks like this: ID User Name Name == ========= ==== 0 parker Peter Parker 1 parker Mary Jane Parker 2 heroman Joseph (Joey) Carter Jones 3 thehulk Bruce Banner What I want to do is do a SELECT and have the result set be: ID User Name Name == ========= ==== 0 parker Peter Parker 1 parker Mary Jane Parker from my table. I'm not a T-SQL guru. I can do the basic joins and such, but I'm thinking there must be an elegant way of doing this. Barring elegance, there must be ANY way of doing this. I appreciate any methods that you can help me with on this topic. Thanks! ---Dan---
