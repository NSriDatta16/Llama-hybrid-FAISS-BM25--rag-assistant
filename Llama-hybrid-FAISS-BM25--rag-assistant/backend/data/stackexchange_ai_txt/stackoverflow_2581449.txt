How about one of the System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshall.PtrToString* methods? Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi - Copies all characters up to the first null character from an unmanaged ANSI string to a managed String, and widens each ANSI character to Unicode. Marshal.PtrToStringUni - Allocates a managed String and copies all or part to the first null of an unmanaged Unicode string into it.
