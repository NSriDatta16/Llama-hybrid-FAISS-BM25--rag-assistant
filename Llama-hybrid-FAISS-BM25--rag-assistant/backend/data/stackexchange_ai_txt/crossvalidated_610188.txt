I've never heard of that plot. It may already exist and have a name, however, I suspect it would not be persuasive to a reasonable skeptic, if it's sufficiently esoteric. Simply based on human psychology, people will find things they're familiar with persuasive and be skeptical of someone trying to persuade them of something based on something they've never heard of. For what it's worth, I do think it's interestingâ€”I like plots and thoroughly exploring data to ensure I understand them fully. In your actual case, I gather you want to argue for the simpler model even though the AIC for the full model is ever so slightly lower. I have heard various times that an AIC that isn't more than 1% lower shouldn't be trusted, but I certainly don't have a citation for that. Instead, I think there may be a simpler solution. You state that the models are nested. You can perform a nested model test / simultaneous test of all added variables in the full model. For logistic regression, that would be a likelihood ratio test. In R, the code would be something like: anova(simple.model, full.model, test="LRT") @Glen_b has shown that a lower AIC corresponds to a p-value of approximately .16, so such a test is unlikely to be significant by conventional standards.
