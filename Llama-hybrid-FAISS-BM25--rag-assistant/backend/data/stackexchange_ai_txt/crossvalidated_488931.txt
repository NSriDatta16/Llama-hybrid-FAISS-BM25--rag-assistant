How to take into account seasonality if using a sliding window for predictions

Imagine you are training a model to predict some future value, like in time series forecasting. Say we are not able to train on all the data because there is too much (too computationally demanding). The solution is to use a sliding window so that the model is always being trained on the most recent subset of data, say 2 months. But if we use a sliding window there is a chance we are missing out on some seasonality in the data. How can one account for possible seasonality while only training a model on a subset of data? Or is this actually already account for , since the window would slide with the seasonality anyway?
