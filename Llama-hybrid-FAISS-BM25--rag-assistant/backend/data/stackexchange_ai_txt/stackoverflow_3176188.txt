Access/Jet/ACE (and many other Windows components) use a window for interpreting 2-digit years. For 00 to 29, it's assumed to be 2000-2029, and for 30-99, 1930-1999. This was put in place to address Y2K compatibility issues sometime in the 1997-98 time frame. I do not allow 2-digit year input anywhere in any of my apps. Because of that, I don't have to have any code to interpret what is intended by the user (which could conceivably make mistakes). This also points up the issue of the independence of display format and data storage with Jet/ACE date values. The storage is as a double, with the integer part indicating the day since 12/30/1899 and the decimal part the time portion within the day. Any date you enter is going to be stored as only one number. If you input an incomplete date (i.e., with no century explicitly indicated for the year), your application has to make an assumption as to what the user intends. The 2029 window is one solution to the 2-digit year problem, but in my opinion, it's entirely inappropriate to depend on it because the user can change it in their Control Panel Regional Settings. I don't write any complicated code to verify dates, I just require 4-digit year entry and avoid the problem entirely. I have been doing this since c. 1998 as a matter of course, and everybody is completely accustomed to it. A few users squawked back then, and I had the "it's because of Y2K" as the excuse that shut them down. Once they got used it, it became a non-issue.
