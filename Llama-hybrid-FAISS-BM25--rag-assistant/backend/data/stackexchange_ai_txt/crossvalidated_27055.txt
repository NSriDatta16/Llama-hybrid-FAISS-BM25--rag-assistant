Does good calibration surpass roughly met assumptions and mediocre discrimination?

My question arises from my current task to develop a clinical prediction model using ordinal logistic regression (with rms), but applies to any kind of regression analysis. The proportional odds assumption (difficult to assess...) is only roughly met. (I am aware of the continuation ratio approach). Results of measures of discrimination (another difficult topic) are not overwhelming. But the calibration plot is quite nicely. So, do I have to worry about 1 and 2 or does the very good calibration surpass basic assumptions and discrimination?
