What you're talking about sounds a lot like Git . I think it would pretty much do what you're describing. Just implement the process of "backing up" as git commit . You can then restore to any previous version with git checkout . It is amazingly storage efficient and extremely fast for transfering content, which would probably save you a lot of time on your backups. As a bonus, it's free, portable and already debugged!
