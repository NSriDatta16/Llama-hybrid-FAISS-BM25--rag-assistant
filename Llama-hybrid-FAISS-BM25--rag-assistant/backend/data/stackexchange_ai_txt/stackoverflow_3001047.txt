OK, since nobody has answered the question, I'll try to do it myself. I wrote all the start/end element handlers and it looks like libxml does not create the DOM any more. At least, the returned document pointer is NULL. It still insists on html and body elements, but I can live with that. One major problem is that libxml preserves all whitespace nodes, no matter what. So I have to parse text content to eliminate ignorable whitespace. It's ugly, but it works. Should I mention that parsing UTF-8 is the kind of fun you rarely miss? To be honest, libxml documentation is atrocious. My advice to anybody who ever tries reading the docs: read the source code instead. The code is much more readable and documented. Thanks for attention.
