Any reason why you are not using UIGestureRecognizers ? It will save you a lot of work if you just use a UIPanGestureRecognizer and a UIPinchGestureRecognizer . In any case, iOS has always behaved like that. Unless you touch with both fingers at the exact same millisecond, you will detect a one finger touch first then detect two finger touch. You need to employ some sort of a cancelling mechanism in your code if you still want to go the -touchesBegan..., -touchesMoved..., etc., method.
