Replace {SOME_REALLY_COMPLEX_QUERY_THAT_HAS_TO_BE_IN_RAW_SQL_BECAUSE_LINQ_GENERATES_CRAP_IN_THIS INSTANCE} with a stored procedure then have Linq to SQL import that function. You can then call the function directly from the data context, get the results and pass it to the view model. I would avoid making a property that calls the data context. You should just get the value from a service or repository layer whenever you need it instead of embedding it into one of the objects created by Linq to SQL.
