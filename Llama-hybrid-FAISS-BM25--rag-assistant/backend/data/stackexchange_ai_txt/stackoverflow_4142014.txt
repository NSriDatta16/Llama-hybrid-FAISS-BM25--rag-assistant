AFAIK, directories don't have a notion of total space and free space, that depends on the disk the directory resides on. To know the space used you can use du -s 'directory name' . You can use df 'Directory name' to find the available space on that storage media and probably combine the two. For example, consider the directory '~/Desktop' [foo@bar ~] df -h ~/Desktop Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on foobar:/vol/arbit/foo 126G 84G 43G 67% /home/foo Clearly ~/Desktop has not used 84G, [foo@bar ~] du -sh ~/Desktop 30M /home/foo/Desktop which is the correct usage. You can use awk to grab required fields and populate your information.
