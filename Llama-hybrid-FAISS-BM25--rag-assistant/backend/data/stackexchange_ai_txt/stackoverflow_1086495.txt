looking at various mod_rewrite solutions for iis 6

I have inherited a iis system with predominately php-mysql sites. We are looking to put in a few sites (mod-x and wordpress) where we need mod_rewrite for our iis 6 on 2003 win server. I am quite keen to choose a solution where we can might be able to just port over the standard install of the above systems to a lamp box without changing too much of the config, ie re-write the rewrite rules. So ideally I guess we need some kind of plugin that will read the .htaccess files and compatible with mod_rewrite syntax. I just wondered if people can recommend any of he solutions out there and recount their experiences? I am currently looking into ModRewritePro from http://www.micronovae.com/ and ISAPI_Rewrite from http://www.isapirewrite.com/ Cheers!
