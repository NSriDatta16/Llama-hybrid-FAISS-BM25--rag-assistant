There is a Time Series Task View that aims to summarize all the time series packages for R. It highlights some core packages that provide some essential functionality. I would also recommend the book by Shumway and Stoffer and the associated website, although it is not so good for forecasting. My blog post on "Econometrics and R" provides a few other references that are useful. Then there is my own book on forecasting using R: Forecasting principles and practice .
