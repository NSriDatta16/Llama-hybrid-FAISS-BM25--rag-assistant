Sanitizing HTML is a pretty hard problem to get right. Spammers and other nasty people come up with new ways to smuggle HTML through sanitation all the time. The safest option is to define a white list of harmless tags and rigorously filter out all other tags with a true HTML parser ( not with regular expressions). There are a couple of template tags and filters on djangosnippets.com, e.g. this or this one . When selecting a filter, pay attention that it uses a white list and an HTML parser like lxml.html (preferably lxml.html.clean ) or BeautifulSoup .
