ASP.NET MVC: How to allow some HTML mark-up in Html Encoded content?

Is there some magic existing code in MVC 2 to Html.Encode() strings and allow certain html markup, like paragraph marks and breaks? (coming from a Linq to SQL database field) A horrible code example to achieve the effect: Html.Encode(Model.fieldName).Replace("&lt;br /&gt;", " ") What would be really nice is to overload something and pass to it an array (or object) full of allowed html tags.
