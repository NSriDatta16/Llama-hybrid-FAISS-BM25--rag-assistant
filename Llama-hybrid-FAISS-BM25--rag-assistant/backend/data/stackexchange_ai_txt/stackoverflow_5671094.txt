You could try running tcpdump directly on the device's command line. Then you can specify arbitrary filters and options as shown in the man page for tcpdump. Then, for example: adb -e shell tcpdump -w /sdcard/capture.pcap host 10.0.2.2 When you're done: adb pull /sdcard/capture.pcap Make sure your emulator instance has enough sdcard space for the capture.
