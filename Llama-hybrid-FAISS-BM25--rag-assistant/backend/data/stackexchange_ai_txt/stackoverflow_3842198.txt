I'm the guy at NetQuarry that worked up the MasterPage-derived class. I don't know if you've solved your problem or not. I can certainly understand your concern about my MasterPage approach. I was concerned that it might be fragile as well. However, it's been working well now for about a year and half on about half a dozen different web applications that are built on our platform. That said, since they're all built on our platform, they do have certain similarities. The code also continued to work without issue when we moved from .Net 2.0 to .Net 3.5. Recently however, we did find a that the approach does not work with UpdatePanels and have not been able to remedy the situation. While researching that problem I discovered that .Net 4.0 provides much better control over ClientID's than .Net 3.5 and I suspect that with 3.5 it will be pretty simple to fix this kind of thing. Here's a good article from Scott Guthrie about this: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/03/30/cleaner-html-markup-with-asp-net-4-web-forms-client-ids-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx Edit: It just occurred to me that in this case your problem might be solved by simply rendering each comment respond button with a unique ID based on the primary key of the related comment record. That way on a postback the ID of each existing button never changes. Hope this is helpful. Cam
