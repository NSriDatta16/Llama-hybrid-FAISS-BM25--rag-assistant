As you pointed out yourself, in general, there is not sufficient data available to estimate the covariance $\Sigma$ . One could think of the situation where there is lots of dense data where some binning technique would yield sufficient data to approximate $\Sigma$ , but this is not possible in most cases. So the whole point of GLS in the general situation is to incorporate expert knowledge like, as you mentioned, information about time series properties like being autoregressive. This is also pointed out on the Wikipedia page you cite, in the section on Feasible generalized least squares .
