A Question About Cost Estimation With Neural Networks?

First of all, I just entered the topic of artificial neural networks, I'm sorry if my question sounds ridiculous. I want to estimate social return to education for Argentina using neural networks. But there's not sufficient data set for Argentina. So I want to train my neural networks with another country's data set, for example Brazil. If that's possible, my estimation for Argentina will be consistent? So I'm curious whether country-specific data sets important for neural network analysis. If I trainneural networks with the data of a country, can I get generalizable results when I make predictions for a different country? Thanks in advance.
