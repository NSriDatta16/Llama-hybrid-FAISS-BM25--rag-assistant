You can certainly calculate the correlation between two time series. That's a short answer. When, as true here and as true often, there is a marked trend in both cases, the correlation is likely to be extremely high. In general, it's not especially helpful. It's not as if there was serious doubt that there would be an apparent association; that's easily imagined from looking at the graphs of time series and thinking about the corresponding scatter plot. The P-value from conventional calculations is certainly not applicable, as independence of observations clearly does not hold. The correlation throws absolutely no light on questions of process or causation. It's just a descriptive measure of strength of linear association. What appear to be the same or similar data as in the question appear at How to interpolate a variable with frequency of 5 years to annual data? As an exercise I calculated the correlation between the variables parea and urea there as 0.9957; and between their logarithms as 0.9911. In fact, many of the classic examples of high but spurious correlations arise from situations where two time series both show marked trends, but for quite different reasons, including apocryphally the price of rum and the number of Methodist ministers. Here there seems likely to be substantive association, but that's not the main question.
