Any methods for clustering short time series data

I have around 200 different sets of time series data with a semi-annual periodicity. The length of each series varies from 1 to 6 years. I essentially want to build unsupervised clusters by grouping trends based on their magnitude and direction. Are there any clustering approaches that would apply well to this scenario?
