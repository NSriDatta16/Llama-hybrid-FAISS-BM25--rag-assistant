Random Forest partial plot

I have the following graph generated after I used the partial plot function of Random Forest in R. Now from this image, my understanding says that temperature has a linear relationship with my variable at y axis (the one I am predicting) for values between 0 - approx. 25. For values between 25 - 100 the relationship is linear also, but the effect of temperature is less due to less steeper slope. For values above 100, the temperature seems to have no effect on the variable I am predicting. Is this the correct explaination, or is there more to it then simply this.
