How many dummies should I create

I have sales data for different locations. My outcome variable is making a sale (1,0) and my IVs are about 200 different locations, handling time etc.. I ran a logistic regression using the class statement for locations in SAS. Some of the locations appear to be significant others donâ€™t. My problem is that with the class statement there is always a reference group. So any odd ratio for a particular location provides information how the odds for this location to make a sale compare to the reference group. Can I avoid the comparison to the reference group, by creating dummies for only the locations that appeared to be significant when using the class statement? I want to provide a more general overview of how a location performs instead of comparing it to a specific location.
