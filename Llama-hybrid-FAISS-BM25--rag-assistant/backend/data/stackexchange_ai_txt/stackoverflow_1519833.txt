The virtual memory limit on Win 32 is 2Gb. On Win 64, it's much bigger. malloc doesn't throw an exception - it returns NULL. NULL return, or exception, the memory manager can fail well before the 2Gb limit is reached if The paging file isn't big enough. If the paging file is limited either by policy, or by lack of room to expand: If memory allocations can't be met by page file availability then they will fail. Fragmentation. The underlying memory manager allocates memory in 4Kb chunks. Its quite possible, through patterns of allocations and deallocations to end up with a small amount of allocated memory, but a fragmented virtual memory meaning that there is no contiguous area large enough to meet a particular request.
