The UIColor class is quite amazing. It has a lot of nice, desirable colors available out of the box. For instance: [UIColor clearColor]; [UIColor redColor]; [UIColor greenColor]; [UIColor blueColor]; [UIColor lightTextColor]; [UIColor groupTableViewBackgroundColor]; On top of it, you can generate all sorts of nifty things with a little math and some macros. This one lets you generate colors from 8-bit hex values (i.e 0x000000 for black). #define UIColorFromRGB(rgbValue) [UIColor colorWithRed:((float)((rgbValue & 0xFF0000) >> 16))/255.0 green:((float)((rgbValue & 0xFF00) >> 8))/255.0 blue:((float)(rgbValue & 0xFF))/255.0 alpha:1.0] You can also load a UIColor object from an image. [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage.png]]; To use any UIColor object, you can simply do this: UITextField.textColor = [UIColor magentaColor]; Just note that the property you're assigning has to be a UIColor property (obviously). Edit: For what you want to do, this may be the best solution: Create a new code file. Call it something like VJColorConstants . Do this for each color you want to use: +(UIColor *)prettyColor{ return UIColorFromRGB(0x4A6B82); } There are about 100 spins on how to return a constant, but I like that one. After you have that file set up, you can do this: UIView.backgroundColor = [VJColorConstants prettyColor];
