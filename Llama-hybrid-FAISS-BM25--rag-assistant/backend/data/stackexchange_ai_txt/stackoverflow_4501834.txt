What's the best HTML5 tag to use for marking up blog excerpts?

It's a common pattern for blogs to have archive pages (eg by date or category) which list relevant blog posts, along with excerpts (a paragraph or) and a link. I can't quite work out which of the HTML5 elements it's best to use for the individual posts, however. The tag might seem like a good fit (and certainly would be if you were displaying the whole content), but I'm not sure whether it's appropriate for excerpts. The specification says: The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. Is an excerpt really a self-contained and independently distributable piece of content? I'm not so sure. Other options might be the tag (but it'd be weird to be quoting your own posts), or simply a list (ordered by publication date) containing headers and paragraphs. Any thoughts?
