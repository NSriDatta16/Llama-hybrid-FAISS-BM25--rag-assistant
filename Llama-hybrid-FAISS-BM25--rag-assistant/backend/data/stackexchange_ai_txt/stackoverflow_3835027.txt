Probably should have read the error message a bit closer. Looks like there just isn't a translation to SQL for the "Subtract" method, but you can in fact simply subtract one date from another to create a datetime like so: var query = from a in DB select (a.Date.Value - a.ForeignKeyReference.Date.Value); Meaning the solution was: var query = (from a in DB where a.Date.HasValue where a.ForeignKeyReference.Date.HasValue let ts = (TimeSpan)(a.Date.Value - a.ForeignKeyReference.Value) select ts.Days).Average(); Jonas Elfstr√∂m's response was right, I'm just adding this since it hits on the actual cause of the issue.
