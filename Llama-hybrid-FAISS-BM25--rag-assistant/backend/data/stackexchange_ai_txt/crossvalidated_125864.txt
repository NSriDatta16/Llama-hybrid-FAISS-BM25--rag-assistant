Zero p-value for Dickey-Fuller test

I feed sample time series data in statsmodels Dickey-Fuller test, and as a result I get exact 0 (zero) for p-value. I'm not sure how to intrepret that. I think that it doesn't imply stationarity as would non-zero value smaller then 0.05 imply, as I get strange results if I try to fit in ARMA model - prediction is constant value both for predicted value itself and confidence intervals too. Edit: Results from ADF test are these: Test statistic: -36.09998880430922, p-value: 0.0, Number of lags used: 0, Critical values: { '1%': -3.4349732785563161, '5%': -2.8635818545830376, '10%': -2.567857072940785 } I just realised that number of lags is 0, so that explains faulty 0 value in my case. Perhaps test can't find proper lag in interval and it reports 0. I'll try with differentiation...
