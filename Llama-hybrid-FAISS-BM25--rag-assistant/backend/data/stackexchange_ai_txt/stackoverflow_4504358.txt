Java APIs are distributed in JAR files (which are just zip files with a specifiec directory structure). Download the jar in question, put it in a known location on your disk (known location as in, pay attention to the name of the direcctory where you store the downloaded jar). There are two times you will need to reference a Jar file: During project compilation. This includes development of the project using an IDE like eclipse (they all compile the code to find errors). Option 1, add an external jar: Open the project properties in Eclipse Select Java Build Path Select the Libraries tab Click the Add External Jar button Browse to the location of the JAR in question. Select the JAR. Click the Open button. Option 2, add the JAR to your web project's WEB-INF/lib directory. During project execution. This will be after you deploy your application to a web container (perhaps tomcat). Store the JAR in question in the classpath of the appliction post deploy. For simple web applications, you can put the jar in the project WEB-INF/lib directory.
