For bioinformatics applications, the classic text on HMMs would be Durbin, Eddy, Krough & Michison, " Biological Sequence Analsysis - Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids", Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-521-62971-3. It is technical, but very clear and I found it very useful. For MCMC there is a recent (version of a) book by Robert and Casella, " Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R" , Springer, which looks good, but I haven't had a chance to read it yet (uses R for examples, which is a good way to learn, but I need to learn R first ;o)
