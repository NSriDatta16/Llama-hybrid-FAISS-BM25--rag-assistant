I believe from an architectural perspective a Datetime would be a more efficient data type as it would be stored as a two 4-byte integers, whereas your nvarchar(10) will be stored as up to 22 bytes (two times the number of characters entered + 2 bytes.). Therefore potentially more than double the amount of storage space is required now in comparison to using a Datetime. This of course has possible implications for indexing, as the smaller the data item, the more records you can fit on an index data page. This in turn produces a smaller index which is of course quicker to traverse and therefore will return results faster. In summary, Datetime is the way to go.
