Cocoa's MVC paradigm encourages both "model controller" and "view controller" objects. The data source object falls in the view controller category; it requests model objects from the data store depending on what UI element needs them, reformats the data a bit to fit , and passes it on to the UI. Usually the same object will also handle UI events and delegate methods.
