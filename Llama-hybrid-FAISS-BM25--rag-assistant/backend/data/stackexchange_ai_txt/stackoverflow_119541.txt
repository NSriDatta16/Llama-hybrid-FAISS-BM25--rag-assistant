In C#, a base class' constructor runs before the derived class' constructor, so any instance fields that a derived class might use in the possibly-overridden virtual member are not initialized yet. Do note that this is just a warning to make you pay attention and make sure it's all-right. There are actual use-cases for this scenario, you just have to document the behavior of the virtual member that it can not use any instance fields declared in a derived class below where the constructor calling it is.
