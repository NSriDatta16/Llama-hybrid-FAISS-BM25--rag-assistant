A standard t-test is handled exactly like a regression, just a very simple form of regression. So you didn't really avoid "a regression approach" at all. A t-test no more avoids assuming a causal direction than a regression needs to choose one. With your design you don't seem to be able to distinguish which is the cause and which is effect, so any analysis will just show associations. The most direct extension of your t-test would be a regression model that takes the different numbers of cases among individuals and the likely correlation of results within individuals into account. Your measure of facial muscle activity would be the dependent/outcome variable and the negative/positive assessment would be the independent/predictor variable. A mixed linear regression model, treating the individuals as random effects, is a common way to take the individuals into account. That's implemented, for example, in the lmer() function of the R lme4 package . This question seems similar to yours in this respect. A generalized least squares model might also work. Both approaches can be implemented via the R nlme package . You might want to consider whether you should include the trial number as a predictor in some way, to allow for a "learning effect" that might change the association between muscle activity and the negative/positive assessment as the individual becomes more used to the testing procedure. It might be interesting to turn the model around and use the facial muscle activity as the "independent" variable and the negative/positive assessment as the "dependent" variable. That could be done with a mixed-model logistic regression, e.g. via the glmer() function in lme4 . Then you could say that you evaluated the associations in both directions. You also could model the muscle activity flexibly with a regression spline, which might uncover some more subtle associations than you would find by just modeling the mean muscle activity as a function of the negative/positive assessment.
