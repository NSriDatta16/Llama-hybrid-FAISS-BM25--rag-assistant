I think that if you're refactoring your tests to reduce duplication then you end up creating your own framework as a by-product, and of course your test framework will have assert helpers that make sense in your context. An example I have in mind was when testing xhtml report we ended up with tests that looked something like: assertCoverageEquals(45.5); where behind assert coverage was something like: assertPercentage(COVERAGE_ID, 45.5); and then behind that was something that used xpath to get the value and another method that knew what the formatting was for percentages.
