Intuitive explanation of differences between TOST and UMP tests for equivalence

Hypothesis tests for equivalence differ from the more common hypothesis tests for difference. In tests for difference, the null hypothesis is some form of "separate quantities are the same", and extreme enough evidence prompts rejection in favor of a conclusion that "separate quantities are different." In tests for equivalence, the null hypothesis is some form of "separate quantities differ by at least $\Delta$ " and extreme enough evidence prompts rejection in favor of a conclusion that "separate quantities are equivalent within an interval defined by $\Delta$ ." Pro-tip: Combining inference from tests for difference with tests for equivalence rocks , because it places power and relevant effect size within the testing framework. Following Reagle & Vinod (2003), I adopt the nomenclature $\text{H}^{+}_{0}$ to refer to the positivist null hypothesis associated with a test for difference, and $\text{H}^{-}_{0}$ to refer to the negativist null hypothesis associated with a test for equivalence: I am comfortable enough articulating and calculating the two one-sided tests (TOST; see for example, Hauck and Anderson, 1984 or Schuirmann, 1987) approach to tests for equivalence (i.e. $\text{H}^{-}_{0}\text{: }\left|\theta\right| \ge \Delta$ translates the to one-sided tests $\text{H}^{-}_{01}\text{: }\theta \ge \Delta$ or $\text{H}^{-}_{02}\text{: }\theta \le -\Delta$ , and rejecting both of these implies $\text{H}_{\text{A}}\text{: }-\Delta ). However I am still undertaking the steep learning curve for uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests for equivalence. In intuitive terms: What is the motivation for the UMP equivalence tests? I gather that the interval hypothesis $\text{H}^{-}_{0}$ alters rejection probabilities by way of noncentral distributions. But I don't understand how that works in a general sense. Aside from regulatory preferenece for TOST, what considerations would lead to a preference from TOST versus UMP equivalence tests? One thing I like about TOST is that the equivalence term can be expressed and communicated easily either in units of the measured variable or in units of the test statistic's distribution, and these quantities are readily translated back and forth. Less clear to me are the units of the equivalence term in UMP equivalence tests. References Reagle, D. P. and Vinod, H. D. (2003).
