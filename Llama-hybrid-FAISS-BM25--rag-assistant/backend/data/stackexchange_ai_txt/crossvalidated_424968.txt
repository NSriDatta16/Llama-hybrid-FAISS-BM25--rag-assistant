Weighted average of sales

Suppose that I have 3 soda makers and I want to know their share of market. I am just given the total sales in a period (ex. this year) for all the soda makers and the total sales per soda maker. However one of the data points register very low sales and thus if I perform a simple average I will get a significant decrease of the share of market for that given soda maker. So I was wondering in my case how should I perform a weighted average (or if I need to perform something else) in order to avoid that data point that is skewing my data. As an example imagine I have the following data: soda maker Sales_in_store_1 Sales_in_store_2 Sales_in_store_3 coke $500k $550k $4k pepsi $400k $450k $4k bigcola $100k $0 $2k in this case I have a total sales of $2,010,000 and using a simple average I would get a share of market of approx 52%,42% and 5% for coke, pepsi and bigcola respectively. However the low sales volume in store 3 is skewing my data. My question is, should I use a weighted average to calculate a more realistic share of market? and if so, How should I do it? (I am confusing myself with which should be my weights) Any insight that you could provide me I will appreciate it
