If you are interested in constructing a histogram then there is no reason you need the samples from your MCMC to be (close to) uncorrelated. It is legitimate to take a long string of correlated values, discard the burn-in, and form a histogram with all the remaining values. Having said this, please bear in mind that a histogram is just a poor-man's kernel density plot; you are better off taking your MCMC values and making a kernel density plot with an appropriate kernel.
