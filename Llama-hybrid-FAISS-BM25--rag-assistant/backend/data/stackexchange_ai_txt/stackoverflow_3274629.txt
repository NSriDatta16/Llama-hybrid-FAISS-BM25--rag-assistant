Lazy loading WPF tab content

My WPF application is organized as a TabControl with each tab containing a different screen. One TabItem is bound to data that takes a little while to load. Since this TabItem represents a screen that users may only rarely use, I would like to not load the data until the user selects the tab. How can I do this?
