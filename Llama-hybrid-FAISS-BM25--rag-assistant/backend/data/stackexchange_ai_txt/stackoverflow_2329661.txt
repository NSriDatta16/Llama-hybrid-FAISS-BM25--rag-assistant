You should definitely use CALayer objects. Using a set of NSImageView subviews will very quickly become unmanageable performance-wise, especially if you have more than 100 images on screen. If you don't want to use Core Animation for some reason, you'd be much better off creating a single custom view and handling all the image drawing and hit testing yourself. This will be more efficient than instantiating many NSImageView objects. However, Core Animation layers will give orders of magnitude improvement in performance over this approach, as each layer is buffered in the GPU so you can drag the layers around with virtually zero cost, and you only need to draw each image once rather than every time anything in the view changes. Core Animation will also handle layer stacking for you. Have a look at the excellent CocoaSlides sample code which demonstrates a very similar application to what you describe, including hit testing and simple animation.
