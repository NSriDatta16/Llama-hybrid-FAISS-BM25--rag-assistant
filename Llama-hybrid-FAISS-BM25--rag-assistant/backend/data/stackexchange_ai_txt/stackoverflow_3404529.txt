svn list has an option -R or --recursive to include all subfolders. So, organizing your folder structure in a way that all required folders are subfolders of a main folder would reduce the number of calls needed. Alternatively, you can use the --depth option to control the depth of subfolders to descend. Extract from svn help list output: -R [--recursive] : descend recursively, same as --depth=infinity --depth ARG : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files', 'immediates', or 'infinity') I. e. organize you project in a way that the trunk and branches are relatively high in the folder structure, and the different phases are below that.
