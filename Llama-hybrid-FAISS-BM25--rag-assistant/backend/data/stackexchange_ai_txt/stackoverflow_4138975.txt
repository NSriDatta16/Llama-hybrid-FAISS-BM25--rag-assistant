The best way is through practice, and although it sounds corny, it is true. You can buy as many books on the subject as you want (and I'll suggest one or two), but the fastest way to learn is to dive right into the project. Just go ahead and create it. But first, play around a little with forms. Try dragging and dropping buttons onto a blank form, playing with event handlers, properties, etc. But then, I would just go for the project. You may need to redo it once you finish the first version of it (especially if it is something that is not just for fun), but hey, just another chance to learn. Book suggestion: For an in-depth look at C#, I would recommend this book: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-4-0-NET-Wrox-Programmer/dp/0470502258/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1289338782&sr=8-10 It has chapters on Windows Forms and Graphics. It's massive and very helpful, although it targets C# 4.0. I don't really see many (up to date) books that focus primarily on Windows Forms, but once you get going with them (even at a very basic level), all the other more advanced Forms topics become much easier. Again, just start playing around with Forms. Luckily for you (and me, and everyone), Visual Studio makes it really easy to design forms. And if that's not what you are using, download the Express edition to try it. Good luck!
