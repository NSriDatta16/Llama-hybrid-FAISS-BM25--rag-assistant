There are a few algorithms that are good for this: ARTMAP: groups via probability against each other (this isn't fast but its the best thing for your problem IMO) ARTMAP holds a group of common attributes and determines likelyhood of simliarity via a percentages. ARTMAP KMeans: This seperates out the vectors by the distance that they are from each other KMeans: Wikipedia PCA: will seperate the average of all the values from the varing bits. This is what you would use to do face detection, and background subtraction in Computer Vision. PCA
