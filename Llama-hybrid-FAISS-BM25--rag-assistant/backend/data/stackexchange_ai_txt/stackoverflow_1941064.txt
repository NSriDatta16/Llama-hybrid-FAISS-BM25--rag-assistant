Should I preallocate std::stringstream?

I use std::stringstream extensively to construct strings and error messages in my application. The stringstreams are usually very short life automatic variables. Will such usage cause heap reallocation for every variable? Should I switch from temporary to class-member stringstream variable? In latter case, how can I reserve stringstream buffer? (Should I initialize it with a large enough string or is there a more elegant method?)
