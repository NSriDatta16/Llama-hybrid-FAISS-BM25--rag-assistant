Red-Gate's SQL Compare as Aaron Bertrand mentions in his answer is a very good option. However, if you are not permitted to purchase something, an option is to try something like: 1) For each database, script out all the tables, constraints, indexes, views, procedures, etc. 2) run a DIFF, and go through all the differences and make sure that the small DB can accept them. If not implement any changes (including data) necessary onto the small DB so it can accept the changes. 3) create a new empty database from the schema of the large DB 4) import the data from the small DB into the nee DB.
