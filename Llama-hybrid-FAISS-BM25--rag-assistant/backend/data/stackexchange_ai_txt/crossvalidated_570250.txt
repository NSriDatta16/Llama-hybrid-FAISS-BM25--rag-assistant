Generating Autoregressive x(m) Terms in R

Attempting to create code that generates x1...xm values, time series plot, and autocorrelogram given certain coefficients and white noise. Code built so far: coeff I know this produces x1...xm values given coefficients and initial values. Having trouble manipulating it for only coefficients and white noise to solve for example: Xt = 2Xt-1 - Xt-2 + Wt
