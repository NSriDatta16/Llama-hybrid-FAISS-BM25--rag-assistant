Handling simple touch events works the following: You need an OnTouchListener in your Activity. Add it by implementing the OnTouchListener interface. You will have to override the onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) method. This will be called if a touch gesture is recognized. Now you get all the information about the Touch (in Android it is called MotionEvent) in the onTouch Method via the MotionEvent. Look at the MotionEvent-Class documentation to use the correct methods to handle your swipe gesture. You could first ask what action really happened. Call getAction(). It will return the type of action. The easiest way would be to react to ACTION_MOVE. Then ask for the origin of the touch event and the later position of the touch by using getHistoricalX(int)/getHistoricalY(int) and getX(int) and getY(int) (attention: these methods are only usable for ACTION_MOVE events - in your case it is ok). Now as you have the start and end coords of the swipe gesture, you can calculate the length of the swipe in pixels and the direction of the swipe and that is all what you need. Good Luck!
