My example here may help: When making inferences about group means, are credible Intervals sensitive to within-subject variance while confidence intervals are not? I modified the model slightly for your data. Note that with such little data your results will be heavily dependent on the priors you use so I would attempt modifying the priors on the group means and precisions (1/variance) and seeing the different results to learn. Here are the results I got: This is modified from John Krushke's example here: http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~dhuber/cr_SimpleLinearRegressionRepeatedBrugs.R He has a helpful website and blog: http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/DoingBayesianDataAnalysis/ #Note. To use rjags you need to first install JAGS from here: #http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/ install.packages("rjags") #run first time to install package require(rjags) #load rjags package #Format your data subID Edit: To see the percent of time the model predicts each runner will win we can take the mean and variance estimated for each individual at each mcmc step, then sample a performance from a distribution determined by those parameters. We can then simply count the number of times each runner had the highest performance. nSamps
