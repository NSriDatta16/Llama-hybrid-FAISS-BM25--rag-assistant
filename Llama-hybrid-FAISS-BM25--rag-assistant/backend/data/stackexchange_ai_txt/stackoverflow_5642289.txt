This paragraph: I was thinking of using a solid loop (1 image), plus 20 images with alpha transparencies to cover up the solid loop, so that a granularity of 0.5 (such as 4.0, 4.5, 5.0) are all covered, but the downside is that there are 21 images total (can put into a sprite, but still quite large). sounds like a lot of work :) Instead, I might be tempted to use Raphaël for this. Raphaël currently supports Firefox 3.0+, Safari 3.0+, Chrome 5.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Internet Explorer 6.0+. Here's a demo that looks vaguely like your image, and has animated concentric circles: http://raphaeljs.com/polar-clock.html
