I'm not a Magento expert yet, but out of a common knowledge of E-Commerce systems, I'm not sure this is a good idea. The product name is being used in numerous places around the system (e.g. in reports; in confirmation E-Mails ....) that would all have to be checked for limitations and breaking layouts. Would it not be conceivable to either Put the long name into a description field that already is of the type TEXT , and put a cut-off version into the name field Put the long name into a description field, and alter any needed layouts so that description field is shown in place of the product name?
