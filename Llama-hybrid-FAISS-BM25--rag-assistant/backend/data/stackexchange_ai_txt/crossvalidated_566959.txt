Neweywest test in R

Portfolio analysis is being conducted using R. We use the neweywest function belonging to the sandwich package, and the brief description is as follows. j How do I apply lag in neweywest test? There are five portfolios in the same time series and each portfolio contains 200 months of data. According to the rule of thumb, m=0.75*T^(1/3), so m is 4.38, and if floor is applied, it is 4. That is, since lag=m-1, is it right to apply lag=3? Or do I have to apply lag = 0? Is it the same when the regression coefficient by Fama-Macbeth cross-sectional regression analysis is expressed as neweywest-test?
