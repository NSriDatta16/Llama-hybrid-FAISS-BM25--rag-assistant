I maintain a C++ class library that is typically used as DLL on Windows, so it can be done. Regarding your issues: That doesn't happen in my library. Perhaps you need to be using the /MD and /MDd build options? That way your C++ run-time-library comes from a DLL, too, which is the sort of picky thing VC++ is famous for. Don't use throw-specs. They are evil . If you feel you must do it anyway, just put something like this in a header file that every module includes before it gets to code that uses throw-specs. #pragma warning(disable: 4290)
