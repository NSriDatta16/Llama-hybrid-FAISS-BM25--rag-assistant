MySQL: Select N rows, but with only unique values in one column

Given this data set: ID Name City Birthyear 1 Egon Spengler New York 1957 2 Mac Taylor New York 1955 3 Sarah Connor Los Angeles 1959 4 Jean-Luc Picard La Barre 2305 5 Ellen Ripley Nostromo 2092 6 James T. Kirk Riverside 2233 7 Henry Jones Chicago 1899 I need to find the 3 oldest persons, but only one of every city. If it would just be the three oldest, it would be... Henry Jones / Chicago Mac Taylor / New York Egon Spengler / New York However since both Egon Spengler and Mac Taylor are located in New York, Egon Spengler would drop out and the next one (Sarah Connor / Los Angeles) would come in instead. Any elegant solutions? Update: Currently a variation of PConroy is the best/fastest solution: SELECT P.*, COUNT(*) AS ct FROM people P JOIN (SELECT MIN(Birthyear) AS Birthyear FROM people GROUP by City) P2 ON P2.Birthyear = P.Birthyear GROUP BY P.City ORDER BY P.Birthyear ASC LIMIT 10; His original query with "IN" is extremly slow with big datasets (aborted after 5 minutes), but moving the subquery to a JOIN will speed it up a lot. It took about 0.15 seconds for approx. 1 mio rows in my test environment. I have an index on "City, Birthyear" and a second one just on "Birthyear". Note: This is related to...
