A Frequentist might say: If you have a concrete 95% confidence interval, calculated from an observed dataset, then the parameter either is or isn't in that interval. But a 95% confidence interval procedure [draw a random sample from a well-defined population, perform certain calculations on that dataset, and report the resulting interval] is designed to cover the parameter 95% of the time. I can never be certain whether any specific interval covers the parameter, so I've just decided to be satisfied when I know the interval came from a procedure with 95% coverage. But I wouldn't trust an interval if I knew it came from a procedure with unknown coverage [such as if the data arose from nonrandom sampling, or if there were bugs in the CI calculation software]. Similarly, in your card example: The card either is or isn't a club. But the procedure you used to choose the card [draw one card at random from a well-shuffled deck] is designed to choose a club 25% of the time. I can never be certain whether any newly-dealt, face-down card is a club, but in many card games I'm OK with being dealt a card using a process that has 25% chance of clubs. But I wouldn't want to play if I knew the card was dealt using a process with unknown chance of clubs [such as if the dealer cheated and didn't shuffle]. So is it legitimate – using frequentist philosophy – to say that the randomly chosen card that I have selected from a deck and placed face down on the table has a 25% probability of being a club? Ultimately, it depends on what you are trying to communicate. Often it's fine to say "There's a 25% chance that this face-down card is a club" and even a Frequentist will understand from context that it's just meant as convenient shorthand, not a misunderstanding of probability theory. But if you're working through a technical proof and you need to be carefully explicit, a Frequentist might prefer to say "This face-down card was selected using a process that has 25% chance of producing a club."
