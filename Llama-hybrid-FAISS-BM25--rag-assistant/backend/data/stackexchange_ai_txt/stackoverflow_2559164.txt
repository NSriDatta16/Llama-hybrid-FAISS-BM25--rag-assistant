An annotation needs a tool to react to it. If such a tool does not exist the annotation is merely a notation. The "tool" can be an APT based agent or some piece of code that uses reflection (for instance, JUnit's @Test ). Several annotations are recognized by the Java compiler and thus have pre-defined semantics: @Override , @Deprecated , @Target .
