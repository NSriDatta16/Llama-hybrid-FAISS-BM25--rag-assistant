SQL Server 2005 auto growth by size

I have been looking at the new database server we are setting up for a client and note the database files are set to grow by 1 meg everytime the file is full and the initial size is 100 MB. I have been considering this breifly and it doesn't sound right. I've checked a few sites on DB considerations and they didn't properly explain these values. I would probably only want the database files to extend once a month shall we say? So if i was to calculate the amount of data I expect to be inserted per day in megabytes and just multiply by 30 I should find a suitable figure? i.e. I do know approximately the size of 1 row and approx how many rows will be inserted in an average week per table. I know these are estimates from the ground up so you think once a month is a suitable approximation for the file to extend or is it preferable to extend every hour>? or never? We are using full back so we can recover to a point in time and transaction log backups are occuring and the recovery procedure seems to be 100% effective. Are these types of changes going to impact the backup and recovery in any way at all? Thanks.
