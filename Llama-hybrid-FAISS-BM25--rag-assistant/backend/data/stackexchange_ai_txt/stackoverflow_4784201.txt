You can use Atan2 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.atan2.aspx . public static double Atan2( double y, double x ) just pass y as delta between your mouse y coord and the center of the circle, and the same for x. Pay attention that the result is expressed in radiant.if it is a circle and you have X,Y relative to the circle you can pass radius-y,radius-x, if it is an ellipse you can pass height/2-y, width/2-x.
