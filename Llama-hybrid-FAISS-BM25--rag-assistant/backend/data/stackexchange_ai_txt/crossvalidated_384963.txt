Is my (repeated-measures) multilevel model correctly specified in R?

Objective: I would like to make sure I specified my multilevel model correctly in R using nlme package. Background: I have a rather simple within-subject (repeated-measures) design where participants answered an emotion questionnaire twice in two counter-balanced conditions : condition 1 and condition 2 (i.e., participants either did condition 1 first, or condition 2 first, but always did both). We're interested in predicting emotion (measured twice , i.e., the questionnaire completed after each condition) by personality (measured once , before the experiment began, i.e., a baseline measure) and to verify whether that relationship differs based on condition (and if there's an interaction). If I understand correctly, condition is crossed with subject. Sample Data: ID|condition|personality|emotion 1 1 2.5 5.0 1 2 2.5 4.9 2 1 4.0 2.6 2 2 4.0 2.3 3 1 3.3 4.3 3 2 3.3 2.9 4 1 4.2 1.0 4 2 4.2 1.0 I have taken a class on multilevel models, read many PDFs, did tutorials, and watched videos on YouTube. However, I'm still new to multilevel modelling and I cannot find an example identical to my situation to make sure I'm not doing an obvious mistake so I would just like someone to confirm I am doing this correctly. For the reference, here are a few other relevant forum posts I have consulted and that may be of some help: link1 , link2 , link3 , link4 , link5 , link6 , and link7 . I'm getting confused because many of these examples are much more complicated than my own situation. My Tentative Model Specification: lme(emotion ~ 1 + personality*condition, random=(~1|ID), data=mydata, method="ML") Question: Is my model correctly specified given my design?
