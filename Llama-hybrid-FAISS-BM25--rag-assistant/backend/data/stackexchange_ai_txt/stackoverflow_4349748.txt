C# XmlTextReader and DataSet causing Duplicate Name Exception

I'm trying to read a standard CNN news feed to put into a table, and it's telling me "duplicate 'link' column exception." on the line: cnnds.ReadXml(CNNfeed); Here's the whole code, and it stops the code and throws errors, when it should simply just ignore duplicate columns or use the last column. XmlTextReader CNNfeed = new XmlTextReader("http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss"); DataSet cnnds = new DataSet("CNN"); cnnds.ReadXml(CNNfeed, XmlReadMode.Auto); // read the XML feed DataTable CNNNewsFeedTable = new DataTable("CNNNewsFeed"); How do I resolve this issue? I've tried everything, and the only way to get this to work is to properly not use the CNN feed. I just changed XmlReadMode.ReadSchema and it got through this part but then it says cnnds.Tables[1] is an index out of range. Like as if it's an empty XML. Is there any easier way to read RSS feeds from other websites without all these exceptions and problems? Edit: It seems adding a try { } catch() around it, however redundant, seems to bypass this problem.
