Problem using dynamically added html-object from javascript

I have a problem with dynamically including an object-tag in my html. We have a external service which we call to get some html-fragment, it includes an object-tag, a script and a simple html-form. I take that content and add it to a div in my page and then try to execute the script that uses the included object. When i debug using Firebug I can see that the code is correctly inserted in the page but the script gets an error when it tries to access the object. It seems to me that the object isn’t initialized. Let me show you some code to exemplify what I mean. getFragment makes an ajax call using jQuery to get the content. var htmlSnippet = RequestModule.getFragment( dto ); $('#plugin').html( htmlSnippet ).hide(); The included content in plugin-div looks like this Browser: Chrome The javascript that tries to use the “signer” object looks like this: function doSign(){ var signer2 = document.getElementById("signer"); retVal = signer2.SetParam('TextToBeSigned', 'some value...'); ... and then some more } It’s when i call the signer2.SetParam method that I get an error saying Object # has no method 'SetParam' But when I use the original page where the content is loaded when the page loads the script works so I know that the ‘SetParam’ method exists on the object and that the script works. But somehow it doesn’t work when I dynamically add it to the page afterwards. I’ve Googled this a lot the last couple of days with no luck. Does anyone have any idea on how to get this to work? Best regards, Henrik
