If the above is the case, then all the views displayed with the same request?. Because, we are always seeing the same URL in the address bar. If it concerns a HTTP POST request and the JSF bean action navigates to a different view, then per saldo you will indeed have two different views in the same request. One for the initial view which is been used to gather/convert/validate the necessary request parameters and update the model values and other for the result view which is been used to show some result. Is it that the values in the previous request is retained for the new request? In a forward there's no means of a new request. It's the same request. In this case, if every request is same then is it like storing in the session, for long time. I am bit confused on the view handling by JSF. Want to understand more internal work flow of JSF. This is definitely not the case. As to your confusion, it may help to put JSF aside for a while and go playing with plain vanilla JSP/Servlet (which is what JSF is using under the covers). I think the following links may help in getting new insights about how basic JSP/Servlet works and how the average MVC framework on top of JSP/Servlet works: Servlets tag info page Design patterns Java web applications When we use the in faces-config.xml , will the URL in address bar get changed? Yes. A HTTP redirect sends a HTTP location: newpage.jsf header which in turn instructs the webbrowser to fire a new HTTP GET request on the given location. This get reflected in the browser address bar. You may want to install a HTTP debugging tool like Firebug or Fiddler2 to track HTTP traffic. You'll see that a forward happens inside the same request and a redirect comes with a new request.
