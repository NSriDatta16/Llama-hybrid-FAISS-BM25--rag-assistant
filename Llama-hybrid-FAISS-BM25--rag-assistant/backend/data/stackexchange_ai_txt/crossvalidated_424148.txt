Logistic regression: Interaction continuous/categorical variables and multiple comparisons

I am fitting a logistic regression model with two independent variables, one continuous (length, here lun) and one categorical (Year = 2013, 2014, 2015). My dependent variable is the maturity stage of an individual (stage, 1= mature & 0= immature). The aim is to understand if the resulting logistic curves among the three years are statistically different. Here the code: confronto_mod |z|) (Intercept) -9.15307 2.13656 -4.284 1.84e-05 *** lun 0.29703 0.06505 4.566 4.97e-06 *** Year2014 -6.86345 2.95156 -2.325 0.020053 * Year2015 -11.58898 3.43635 -3.372 0.000745 *** lun:Year2014 0.21789 0.09202 2.368 0.017887 * lun:Year2015 0.39219 0.10985 3.570 0.000357 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 957.81 on 695 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 459.78 on 690 degrees of freedom AIC: 471.78 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 7 Now, as far I understand here we got the following. The increase of a unit in length in 2014 yields an increase in the odds ratio of a factor exp(0.21789)= 1.24345 , with respect to the reference taken by R here of 2013; the same in 2015 with an increase in the odds ratio of a factor exp(0.39219)=1.480219 . In 2013 a unit increase in length yields an increase of a factor exp(0.29703)= 1.345856 So the three Years appear to yields a significantly different increase of the probability of being mature for every increase in the length unit, is this right? The test behind is the Wald test right? How can I compare the three Years to explore more these differences? Basically to understand if 2014 and 2015 are significantly different. I tried to do the following but unsure if it is correct: library('multcomp') glht(confronto_mod, linfct=c('lun:Year2014 = 0', 'lun:Year2015 = 0', 'lun:Year2015 - lun:Year2014 = 0')) Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses Fit: glm(formula = stage ~ lun * Year, family = binomial, data = confronto_macro) Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) lun:Year2014 == 0 0.21789 0.09202 2.368 0.04674 * lun:Year2015 == 0 0.39219 0.10985 3.570 0.00103 ** lun:Year2015 - lun:Year2014 == 0 0.17430 0.10987 1.586 0.25005 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) Otherwise, it is sufficient to change for example the 2014 as a reference in the model and explore the resulting output? Thank you so much for your feedbacks!
