Interpretation of main effects in case of an interaction in binary logistic regression

I have a question about interpreting the main effects from an interaction in a binary logistic regression model. I used glmer() in R with a model with binary predictors only. The factors of interest for this question are the following: DV: accuracy (0,1) IV: A (levels: I, L) IV: B (levels: NS, S) An interaction of A and B shows that L leads to higher accuracies for NS compared to S. There also seems to be a main effect of A, meaning higher accuracies for L compared to I. I would like to report this effect as it is important for my hypothesis, but I don't know how. I read that in case of an interaction, a main effect only shows the conditional effect on the reference level, meaning that the main effect only reports the effect of A for either NS or S (depending on the chosen reference level). I'm not sure if releveling would be appropriate, as some of the coefficients change (for example the intercept). Some people write that in case of an interaction, you should not interpret main effects at all, but since this main effect is important, I believe it should not be ignored. Does anyone have advice on this issue? Many thanks!
