There is no way to tell without knowing more about your situation. Yes, you may have hit a plateau. Or there may be hidden structure in your data that will only become apparent with (much) more data. Or some of your predictors may need to be predicted themselves, and you may be able to do a better job at that. Or you may not have included a hugely relevant predictor that can increase your validation accuracy to 90%, simply because you don't have the domain knowledge. In general, it is very hard to say whether we have reached the end of the flagpole. See How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
