OP here. (created an account so I hvae a diff. name.) Your answer wasn't quite what I was looking for but it taught m3 how to use Visual Studio enough to get it done. (I didn't know there was a toolbox) Thanks again for the help:) Also, I couldn't figure out how to reply again so this is an "answer."
