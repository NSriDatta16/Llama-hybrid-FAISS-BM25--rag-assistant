The # indicates the anchor portion of the URL, which is used to identify a specific position within the document returned by the rest of the URL. It technically known as the Fragment portion of the URI. Everything following the # is part of that. Since it is only relevant once the document is returned and processed (again, it represents a position in that document) it is only interesting to the client. It has no meaning or value to the server and the client will treat the entire value as a single value (unless of course you provide additional custom code to break apart the value and extract additional meaning from it). If you need to pass the character # as part of a value in the URL, replace it with %23 - you can do this programmatically using URL Encoding , which will replace all "special" characters with ones that are acceptable for transport via URI.
