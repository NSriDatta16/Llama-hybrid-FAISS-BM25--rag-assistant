Why does Bayesian optimization work?

Bayesian optimization is used to optimize costly black-box functions. The idea is to use a surrogate model to model the black-box function and then an acquisition function is used to find the next point of evaluation. The goal is to get very close to the optimum values with very few evaluations of the black-box functions. Generally, Gaussian process or random forest is used as a surrogate model. Since we have very few values/data points of the black-box function, why don't the surrogate models in Bayesian optimization overfit? Would it make sense to use a deep neural network as a surrogate model? I think no because a deep neural network would probably overfit with so few data points.
