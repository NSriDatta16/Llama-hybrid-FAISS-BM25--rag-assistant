(Bayesian) estimation of the underlying population size knowing its upper bound after $x$ draws

Consider you have an initial bag of unique and identifiable items $(1.. K)$ . From this bag, someone used an arbitrary criteria to tag $N$ items. You don't know the chosen criteria (which can be anything, from odd numbers, to just the item 65) but you know $K$ . Your job is to estimate how many items were tagged (i.e. the cardinality of the tagged set, which is $N$ ). For that, you can sample (with and/or without replacement [1] ), any arbitrary amount of items from the bag and verify the criteria at will. I know how to estimate $N$ using a monte-carlo method (basically I keep drawing items and use the ratio of tagged/non-tagged to approximate the real cardinality). But I would like to provide an estimation as soon as one item is drawn, along with a confidence value (i.e. the probability of $N=n$ ). You can also assume that I can make an informed guess as a prior PDF of $N=n$ (e.g. uniform, or gaussian). Each method has a different computational cost, so I would love to get an answer for both methods, as to provide a chance on deciding the tradeoff.
