There is the offical documentation: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/ For a quick demo with code: http://html5demos.com/storage also more html5 demos at the root of that site. Note there are also things like the YUI 2 Storage Utility which abstract the storage for you (HTML 5, Google Gears, SWF) depending on what the browser supports: The Storage Utility provides a mechanism for storing significant amounts of textual data, client-side, whether or not your browsers supports the proposed HTML 5 Storage specification.
