Is logistic regression a non-parametric test?

I recently received the following question via email. I'll post an answer below, but I was interested to hear what others thought. Would you call logistic regression a non-parametric test? My understanding is that simply labelling a test non-parametric because its data is not normally distributed, is insufficient. Its more to do with lack of assumptions. logistic regression does have assumptions.
