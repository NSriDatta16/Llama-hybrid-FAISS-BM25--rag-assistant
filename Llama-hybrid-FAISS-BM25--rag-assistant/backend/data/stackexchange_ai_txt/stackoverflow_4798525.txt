Many-to-many relationship in NoSQL

I am trying to figure out how to best implement this for my system...and get my head out of the RDBMS space for now... A part of my current DB has three tables: Show, ShowEntry, and Entry. Basically ShowEntry is a many-to-many joining table between Show and Entry. In my RDBMS thinking it's quite logical since any changes to Show details can be done in one place, and the same with Entry. What's the best way to reflect this in a document-based storage? I'm sure there is no one way of doing this but I can't help but think if document-based storage is appropriate for this case at all. FYI, I am currently considering implementing RavenDB. While discussions on general NoSQL design will be good a more RavenDB focused one will be fantastic! Thanks, D.
