Difference-in-difference: case when parallel trends assumption is met but difference in levels lead to misleading treatment effect

I'm working on a diff-in-diffs analysis to look at the effect of a treatment on performance on standardized test. The treatment affected Hispanic but not white students, so I'm using white students as a control. Specifically, I want to study the raw scores obtained on the test and the passing rate. To give an example of the problem I'm facing: Letâ€™s say in the 5-years preceding treatment, raw scores for both groups had parallel trends but the average score for white students was 10 points higher. Further, both groups had a 100% passing rate. In the post-treatment period, both groups saw their scores decrease by 10 points (white students still scoring 10 points higher) Because Hispanic students already had lower scores than their white counterparts, this drop in scores was enough to put many of them below the passing rate threshold. The same was not true for the higher-performing white students. If I only looked at passing rates, I'd see a drop for Hispanic students but not white students and wrongfully attribute it to the effects of the treatment. I'm attaching graphs showing the above scenario. My question is: is there a way to deal with this in the analysis?
