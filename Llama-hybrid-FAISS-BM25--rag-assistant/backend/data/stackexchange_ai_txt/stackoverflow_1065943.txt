How do you suppress errors to a method call in C#?

I'm looking for an "elegant" way to suppress exceptions when calling a method. I think the following code is way too verbose: try { CallToMethodThatMayFail(3); } catch {} Is there some syntactic sugar I can use to say "I don't really care if this method fails"? I want to call the method and continue execution regardless of what happens with the method.
