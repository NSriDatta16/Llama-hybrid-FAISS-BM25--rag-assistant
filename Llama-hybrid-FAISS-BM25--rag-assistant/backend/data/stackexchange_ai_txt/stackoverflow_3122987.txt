It depends on what a std::string does. According to 27.2.1/1 The class basic_istringstream ... uses a basic_stringbuf object to control the associated storage. Since the class must use an object it must copy construct the string into that object. So the real question is not whether a stringstream copies the contents, but whether copy constructing a string will copy the contents or implement some sort of copy-on-write scheme.
