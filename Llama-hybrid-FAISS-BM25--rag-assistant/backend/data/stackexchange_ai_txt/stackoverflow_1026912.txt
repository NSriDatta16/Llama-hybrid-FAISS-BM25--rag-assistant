tabbed document interface in WPF using only on-board means?

I've seen two threads here about TDI & C#. Both of them didn't really answer the questions I have ... Since TDIs are pretty much like a standard nowadays, I can hardly imagine, that I have to buy a special control (like AvalonDock or SandDock). This must be possible with built in the tab-control(?) somehow! I don't need special features like dock- and draggable tabitems. Just open every form in a new tab. Thats it. Like putting every forms content controls into user controls and by request (button, menu click ...) add a new tab and put the corresponding user control on it ... something like this. How would you do it? This can't be THAT complicated (even for me) or am I missing something?! thanks a lot!
