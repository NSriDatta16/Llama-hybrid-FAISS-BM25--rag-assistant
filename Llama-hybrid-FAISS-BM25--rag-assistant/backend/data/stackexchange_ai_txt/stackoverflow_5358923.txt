Java: embedding script engines in an application: Is the JSR 223 (ScriptEngine) still a good solution?

I want to use one or many script languages in my Java application. From JRuby website I found that there are 3 ways: Using Java 6 (using JSR 223: Scripting) Embedding with Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) Directly calling $YOUR_SCRIPTING_ENGINE$ APIs As I need to support more than 1 script engine, I don't think option 3 will be good enough. When looking for solution 1. JSR 223: Scripting, I start to look for the zip archive containing all script engine integration Download and unzip the collection of jars from the documents and files section of the site (jsr223-engines.tar.gz or jsr223-engines.zip). But this file is nowhere on the net (dowload section of project home is empty. If I want I can download the sources and build my needed enngines integration. Sources code are looking old (2+ years for what I saw) Is the JSR 223 still alive and a good solution to choose? If not is the Bean Scripting Framework a good alternative ? This last have a very poor documentation page and only few script languages are supported (but it is supporting most of the language I want to have)...
