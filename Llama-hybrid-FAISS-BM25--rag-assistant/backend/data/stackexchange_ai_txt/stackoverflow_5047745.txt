this page talks about the different modifiers you can use on resource folders. It seems to indicate that the order of precedence is such that screen size(small, med, large, xlarge) is higher than density(ldpi, mdpi, hdpi). I would think that this means if you renamed your drawables-hdpi folder to drawables-large-hdpi even though the Galaxy tab has a medium density it will still use the drawables from this folder because it has a large screen. Edit: I just tested this out, it does solve your problem one way. They images inside the drawables-large-hdpi folder to show up on the Galaxy tab when running the app. But unfortunately adding the large qualifier makes it so they don't show up on medium sized screens with hdpi densities. Its looking like you might have to make separate folders and have 2 copies of your large resources if you want to get this functionality =(.
