The second site you cite looks a bit suspicious: It mentions normality of the data set but I feel like the author wanted to say normality of residuals. Please note there are two papers by Breusch/Pagan with a "Breusch-Pagan test": 1) Breusch, Pagan (1980). “The Lagrange Multiplier Test and Its Applications to Model Specification in Econometrics.” Review of Economic Studies, 47, 239–253. 2) Breusch & Pagan (1979), A Simple Test for Heteroscedasticity and Random Coefficient Variation. Econometrica 47, 1287–1294 The first is implemented by xttest0 in Stata (and in R in plmtest of package plm ). The second in Stata by hettest (and in R in bptest of package lmtest ) and - I believe - cannot readily be applied to panel models. The 2nd webpage seems to confuse both tests/use cases.
