How can subjective probability be useful?

The principle of indifference states that, In the absence of any relevant evidence, agents should distribute their credence (or 'degrees of belief') equally among all the possible outcomes under consideration. This means that two individuals with different amounts of "evidence" can come up with two different probabilities - that is, probabilities can be subjective. I can't think of a case where subjective probabilities might be useful in predicting the future. For example, say I have a biased coin that's biased towards heads but I do not know that it's biased and so I assign the probability of heads and tails to be both $\frac{1}{2}$ . But this probability distribution will be useless in predicting the future as in the long run, I will end up with more heads than tails since the coin's biased towards heads. I was wondering what are some examples of when subjective probabilities might be useful?
