Using System.nanoTime() twice consumes less than 1 micro-second. I suggest you run any benchmark for a number of second and take an average so a micro-second error won't be significant. Overall, I would suggest not making things more complicated than you need it to be. To have a built in warm up I often ignore the first 10%-20% of iterations. Something like long start; int count; for(int i = -count / 5; i
