The average correlation can be meaningul. Also consider the distribution of correlations (for example, plot a histogram). But as I understand it, for each individual you have some ranking of $n$ items plus predicted rankings of those items for that individual, and you're looking at the correlation between an individual's rankings and the predicted ones. In this case, it may be that the correlation is not the best measure of how well the algorithm is making predictions. For example, imagine that the algorithm gets the first 100 items perfectly and the next 200 items totally messed up, vs the opposite. It could be that you care only about the quality of the top rankings. In this case, you might look at the sum of the absolute differences between the individual's ranking and the predicted ranking, but only among the individual's top $m$ items.
