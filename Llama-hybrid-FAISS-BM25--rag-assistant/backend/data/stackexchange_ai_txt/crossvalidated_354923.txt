Normal approximation to poisson

got this question to do but I'm totally stuck. It goes as follows : People call car breakdown service at an average rate of 20 per HR. A Poisson distribution may be assumed to model this situation. 1) by using a suitable approximation find the probability that exactly 250 people call in 12 hrs. So I know that it follows a Poisson distribution with mean of 240. Ideally I think this is a normal approximation to the Poisson s distribution since mean>15 however the question asks for exactly 250 and as far as I know normal can't do exactly values. Also I don't see how to get a binomial from this since we don't have a value of n
