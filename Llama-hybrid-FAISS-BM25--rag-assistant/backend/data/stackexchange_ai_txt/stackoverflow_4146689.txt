Use SoapUI consume the WSDL and make a mock service. Point your app at your SoapUI mockservice, and you can capture your outbound requests. Now you can turn around and submit those requests to the service and see the response. That should give you an idea of where the message is coming from. i.e. is it coming from Delphi's SOAP library as a result of something that it doesn't understand, or is it coming from the web service itself, as a result of something that IT didn't understand in your request? Alternately, you can do this in Delphi: Intercept the inbound/outbound XML by leveraging the RIO_BeforeExecute/RIO_AfterExecute events of your HttpRIO object. If your traffic is http (harder with SSL but possible) you can also intercept with Fiddler2. Once you have the raw XML, submit requests with SoapUI, and see what you get. You may find that your requests need "tweaking", or if everything looks fine in SoapUI, you may need to tweak the responses before de-serialization.
