How to impose a global constraint on cost function of a neural network?

I have a training set of time series samples. Each sample is composed of a noise process (input) and the corresponding trajectory (output) which is the solution of the stochastic differential equation for the noise. Ideally a convenient neural network (like RNN) can learn the relation between the noise and the trajectory. But in this case, there is an additional constraint. The average of trajectories (outputs) over noise processes satisfies a function (let's call it, 'global function'. Note that, statistically speaking, the global function is present in each sample, but due to the presence of the noise, the neural network has a hard time finding it. The question is how can I incorporate the global function directly into the learning process so that the network satisfies this function?
