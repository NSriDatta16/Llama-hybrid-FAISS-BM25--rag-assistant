Estimation of variance using "peak" of normal distribution

My problem is a parameters' estimation of highly contaminated normal distribution. Typical estimators of variance such as IQR or MAD are based on the assumption that there are not that much outliers. But what if we have a lot of outliers, probably, more than 50% of points, but all of them are quite distant from the center of normal distribution so they affect only the tails? Can we, looking at the central part (that is not affected by outliers), estimate parameters of the normal distribution? It can be the case when the measuring device 1) outputs normally distributed values if it is functioning properly, 2) outputs quite big values weirdly distributed when broken (and it can be broken >50% of cases). I have such situation in biology so it is not just my interest, it has a practical meaning. Additional assumptions: In my situation the peak of normal distribution of interest is well-defined and can always be found with the mode estimation algorithm, so there is no problem with estimation of the center. I can also find the points when the outliers start to appear (vertical lines on the attached plot). On the plot I showed the uniformly distributed outliers, however, there is no assumption on their distribution, so it can not be solved just with EM mixture algorithm. I should really estimate the parameters based on something like kernel density estimation and I know that I have to cut tails since they are spoiled. UPDATE : reformulated question: I draw 6 points on the plot of standard normal distribution (ABCDEF). The distance between A and C is an IQR of the distribution. We can infer standard deviation from the length of $|AC|$ - we should just divide $|AC|$ with the ~1.3489. The question now is: how can we infer a standard deviation, if we move the perpendiculars $AB$ and $DC$ on the $x$-axis? We will know coordinates of all 6 points on both $y$ and $x$ axis, and will know that $EF$ is in the center of the normal distribution. Draft of the solution: $x$ is the value we are looking for (standard deviation). $dnorm$ is function that returns likelihood. $\hat \mu$ can be estimated from the data. When I use letter $A$, I mean the $x$-coord of the point. $\frac{|AB|}{|EF|} = \frac{dnorm(A, \mu=\hat \mu, \sigma=x)}{dnorm(\hat \mu, \mu = \hat \mu, \sigma=1)}$, $\frac{|AB|}{|EF|} \cdot dnorm(\hat \mu, \mu = \hat \mu, \sigma=1) = dnorm(A, \mu=\hat \mu, \sigma=x)$ We know everything in the last equation except $x$. SOLUTION : $\sigma = \sqrt \frac{-(A - \hat \mu) ^ 2} {2 \log \Bigl(\frac{|AB|}{|EF|} \Bigr)}$. Next question: this estimate is really non-efficient. Can it be improved by choosing different $A$ and averaging? I attach R code in case if smb wants to play with this estimator. Please, tell me about all improvements you can suggest.

Unbiased, accurate, efficient.
