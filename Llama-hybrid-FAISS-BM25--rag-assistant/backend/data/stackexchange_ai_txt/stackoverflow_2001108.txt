I have been programming in Java for many years, and Haskell and OCaml for the last two years. A few months ago I began developing a personal project in Scala, and it's wonderful. A real type system and all the Java supporting libraries. The ease of mixing Java and Scala means the language definitely has a future. Adoption costs for an existing Java project are very low.
