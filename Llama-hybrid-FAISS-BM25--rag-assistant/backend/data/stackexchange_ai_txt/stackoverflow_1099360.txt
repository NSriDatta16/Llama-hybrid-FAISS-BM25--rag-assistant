Java UI designer + framework similar to visual studio (drag and drop, floating controls)

I'm looking for a Java UI designer allowing me to drag and drop controls directly to the design surface in a floating mode (without the hassle of north, south etc that comes with SWT). Is there any such tool? Also, I'm only interested in tools offering a trial version. EDIT : I'm only interested in solutions allowing me to drag/drop items regardless of panels margin, LayoutManager stuff etc. The position should preferably be just relative to the window margin. Thanks in advance
