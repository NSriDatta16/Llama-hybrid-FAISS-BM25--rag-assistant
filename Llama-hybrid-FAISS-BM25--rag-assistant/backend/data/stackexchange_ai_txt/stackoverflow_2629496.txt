I have just encountered this same bug under IE8 (version 8.0.6001.18702). I also traced the problem using the IE8 Developer tools by turning off css statements until I found the one responsible. I an verify that having a background-color on a:hover causes the problem and overriding this with "transparent" does solve the problem. Unfortunately if you do want a hover background color on your links there isn't a generalised solution - the best you can do is to create a class for "imagelink" which you apply to all your anchor tags which surround an img tag: Then you can use the CSS: a.imagelink:hover { background-color: transparent; } This should work around the IE8 bug for your image links whilst allowing you to keep your hover background color on other hyperlinks. Not very elegant, but I didn't want to follow Jan's suggestion of using a meta tag to force IE8 to render as IE7 (there are lots of things IE8 does better than IE7 and I don't want to revert all the rendering to IE7 over this one issue). I find it astounding that despite all the hype about IE8 being so much better than older versions we still find bugs of this nature: a colour choice causing a layout issue . Unbelievable. And yet this thread was started back in July last year - and the bug remains unfixed, with more and more developers having to waste their time identifying the problem and dirtying their code with workaround hacks to solve an IE-only issue. It's like IE6 all over again.. Hopefully the EU's imposition of a browser-choice screen into new Windows installs will help open people's eyes to all the proper web browsers out there.
