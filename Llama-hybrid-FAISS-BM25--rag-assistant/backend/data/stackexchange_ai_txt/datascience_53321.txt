You can try to classify based on the presence of words in the name of the food/drink. For example, an item whose name includes "chicken" is probably going to be food, but if it includes "margarita" is probably going to be a drink (not necessarily, of course, because you might have items as "bloody mary with chicken broth" or "steak marinated in margarita", and that's where you will need your machine learning model for. Train your model in a comprehensive enough train set, it it might work.
