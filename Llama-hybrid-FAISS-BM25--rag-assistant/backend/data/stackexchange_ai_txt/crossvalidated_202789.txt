There is no reason, in theory, why you can't have a positive random effect and a 0 fixed effect. It would mean that the average slope was 0 (flat line) and the slopes for each person vary around this. It might make no physical sense in your use case, but that's another matter. Furthermore, the non-significance of the test does not mean that the fixed effect is 0 -- only that you can't prove that it's not with this method and these data. Your fixed effect might also not be significant because it is highly correlated with another fixed effect. You're basically trying to do model selection using Wald statistics, and that's a method known to produce ambiguous results. I'm sure there isn't a bug in lmerTest, but it might not be the right tool for the job. It's an approximate test whose results, I feel, would be hard to interpret with a model as complex as this one. If it were me, I would first get the children off the street. Average the response over each person and do a fixed-effects only model on those variables that are applied at the person level. I would then attempt to get rid of variables that had no impact -- possibly using a lasso, or a best subsets. Then I would model a random effects model that included the within-person variables and the between person variables that I had selected in the previous step. This approach is not guaranteed to produce the best model, but you're going to have to simplify something here if you don't want to get lost in all the variables. Another problem here is that lmerTest basically relies on classical likelihood theory to work its magic. But if you read the fine print, you can see that this theory assumes the maximum is at an interior point of the parameter space. This assumption fails when you are testing whether a random effect is zero ... because if it is, the true solution is on a boundary of the parameter space. So you want to be sure in advance that the random effects included in the model are actually greater than zero.
