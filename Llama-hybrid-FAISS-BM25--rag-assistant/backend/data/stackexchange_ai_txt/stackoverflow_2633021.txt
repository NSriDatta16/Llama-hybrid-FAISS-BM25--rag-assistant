Get attribute of JQuery ui.draggable

I'm using JqueryUI for drag and drop on one of my pages and for some reason I can't seem to get an attribute of the ui.draggable object being passed into my droppable drop event. ui.draggable.attr("src") and $(ui.draggable).attr("src") both return undefined, however if I type ui.draggable.html() I will get the html back. Any ideas?
