Fortunately, I found on these slides an example: The mapping $x = W z$ defines an embedding of an $m$-dimensional manifold in $p$-dimensional space where $x$ is the original data. Moreover, now I understand why it is like this: the low-dim. space is embedded into the high-dim. space though an embedding (given a low-dim. vector, one applies the embedding to obtain the embedded version of the low-dim. vector into the high-dim. space).
