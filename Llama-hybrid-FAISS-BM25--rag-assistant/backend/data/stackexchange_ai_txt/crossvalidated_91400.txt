You are trying to get a handle on the variance of the 5 minute data. So I would suggest calculating this variance within each hour. Then plot this variance against the hourly value for this particular hour. You may be able to see a linear or other relationship that may allow you to model the 5 minute variance as a function of the hourly value. I also assume that there is some seasonality, both yearly (higher electricity consumption in winter) and weekly (different residential/industry patterns between weekdays and weekends). Conversely, you may want to look into the literature on electricity forecasting, which is an active research field. People there usually work in 5 or 15 minute time increments, and they of course need to model variance in some way. Time series methods may help you quite independently of the hourly data.
