Taken from this question on Github and if you are using a tree-based classifier like XGBoost: This is because the XGBoost Tree SHAP algorithm computes the SHAP values with respect to the margin not the transformed probability. So the values you are seeing are log odds values (what XGBoost would output if pred_margin=True were set). This means, the values on the force diagram are not showing the probabilities and it totally makes sense if they are not between 0 and 1.
