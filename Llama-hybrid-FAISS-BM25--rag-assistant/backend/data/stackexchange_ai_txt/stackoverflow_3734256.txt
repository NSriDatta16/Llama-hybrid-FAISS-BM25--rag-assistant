HTML5 localStorage vs sesionStorage vs another typeof data storage performance

I need to fetch some chunks of data in a Javascript loop. The pieces will probably be small between 2 and 20 Kb but being in a loop I need speed. I can get these pieces of code from local storage: var code = localStorage.getItem(myVar); or even from jQuery .data() var code = $('#myDiv').data(myVar); I was unable to find info on localStorage or sesionStorage speed or if I can cache these values into memory. What would be fastest and better to use? Thanx
