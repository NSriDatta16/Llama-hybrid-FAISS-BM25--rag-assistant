Regular expression - Text between colons

I have a schema like this 5/2009 Question: This is the question I like to get the first part after the or always the string before the colon : --> Solution should be "Question" Attention: This words change - Sometimes its question, othertime may be big question .... I tried with (.{0,50}):(.{0,50}) but this returns to much (also the date) I'm not trained with regex, can anyone help me with this? Thank you alot.
