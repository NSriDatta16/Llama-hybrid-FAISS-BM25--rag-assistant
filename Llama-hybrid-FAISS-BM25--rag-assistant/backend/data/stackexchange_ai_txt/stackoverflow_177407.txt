For improved drawing speed at the cost of more storage and limited resolution, many applications will use a georeferenced raster format such as GeoTiff . Given the rather insistent comment by Zich below that "Data are in vector in all Navigation systems with no exception!" I thought I'd add a bit to the above. Firstly, I'd define a navigation system as a system that assists you how you get to where you want to go based on your current location, typically by costing a number of possible alternative routes and recommending the lowest cost one. Possible routes may be dictated by mode of transport, cars stay on roads for example whereas hill walkers don't. Costing of routes may vary by mode of transport too as well as user requirements. Cars might want to take quickest route based on road speed, trucks might want most fuel efficient route, hill walkers might want the safest direct route, boats or aeroplanes might want a route that avoids dangerous weather systems, while also minimising fuel cost and time spent. At the most simple level a map and compass is a navigation system. Replace the map with a small screen, a scalable raster map and a GPS and you still have a navigation system. Most low to medium end maritime navigation systems still work this way, with charts representing the coastline and seabed and GPS to give you location, and echo sounding for depth. At the more advanced end of the spectrum, autonomous robotic navigation systems such as the Mars Rover navigation system generate DTM models on the fly as a basis for short range navigation, and satellite gathered DEMs for longer range navigation. To suggest that all navigation systems work like consumer Garmin or Tom Tom devices is a rather naive presumption. FWIW, many modern Garmin devices also include raster based DEM data where low cost GPS heighting can be wildly inaccurate.
