Logistic regressioin - contradictory results?

I am using the glmer method in lme4 to build a mixed effect logistic regression model, the model is as follows: textbook.usage.glm When I run the summary summary(textbook.usage.glm) I got the following results: Generalized linear mixed model fit by the Laplace approximation Formula: textbook.usageSession ~ session.week * condition.player + (session.week | group.name) Data: dfAN AIC BIC logLik deviance 104.9 123.1 -45.45 90.9 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Corr group.name (Intercept) 0.45445 0.67413 session.week 0.17793 0.42181 -0.484 Number of obs: 99, groups: group.name, 6 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.6851 3.4607 1.354 0.1758 session.week -1.2304 0.8017 -1.535 0.1248 condition.playerDEFAULT 4.7845 4.2266 1.132 0.2576 session.week:condition.playerDEFAULT -3.1617 1.4026 -2.254 0.0242 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) sssn.w c.DEFA session.wek -0.976 cnd.DEFAULT -0.787 0.765 s.:.DEFAULT 0.515 -0.506 -0.926 From the above statistics, we can see only one significance for the interaction between session.week and condition.player. But there is no significance on the main effect (condition.player) alone. However, if we further build three incremental models as follows, and run anova to test the significance of each variable textbook.usage.glm.2 We get Data: dfAN Models: textbook.usage.glm.0: textbook.usageSession ~ 1 + (session.week | group.name) textbook.usage.glm.1: textbook.usageSession ~ session.week + (session.week | group.name) textbook.usage.glm.2: textbook.usageSession ~ session.week + condition.player + (session.week | textbook.usage.glm.2: group.name) textbook.usage.glm: textbook.usageSession ~ session.week * condition.player + (session.week | textbook.usage.glm: group.name) Df AIC BIC logLik Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) textbook.usage.glm.0 4 126.57 136.95 -59.284 textbook.usage.glm.1 5 125.43 138.41 -57.716 3.1376 1 0.07651 . textbook.usage.glm.2 6 109.48 125.05 -48.738 17.9548 1 2.262e-05 *** textbook.usage.glm 7 104.91 123.07 -45.452 6.5716 1 0.01036 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Here, we see, by adding condition.player in the model 2, it is significant as well, in addition to significance to the interaction effect. How can I report the result? Is the condition.player variable significant or not? I've seen many logistic regression examples with the first approach, what is the difference between that and the second approach where I compare models?
