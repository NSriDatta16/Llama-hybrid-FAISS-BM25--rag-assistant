SQL Server Agent error - Connection "DatabaseName" is not found?

Some modifications were made to an SSIS package and I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. The SQL server agent job which involves execution of one of these packages was running fine until a couple of days ago. The error I am seeing is this... Executed as user: domainname\serviceaccount. ... for 32-bit Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1984-2005. All rights reserved.

This occurs when an attempt is made to resolve a package ... The package executed successf... The step succeeded. I did not get any alerts that the job had an error because as the last line suggested, the step succeeded. Because of this, the job did not run "properly" for a few days and I'm scratching my head as to what may be the problem. Has anyone seen this error before?
