Update: In Python 3.8 -X pycache_prefix=PATH command-line option enables writing .pyc files to a parallel tree rooted at the given directory instead of to the code tree. See $PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX envvar credits: @RobertT' answer The location of the cache is reported in sys.pycache_prefix ( None indicates the default location in __pycache__ [since Python 3.2] subdirectories). To turn off caching the compiled Python bytecode, -B may be set, then Python wonâ€™t try to write .pyc files on the import of source modules. See $PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE envvar credits: @Maleev's answer Old [Python 2] answer: There is PEP 304: Controlling Generation of Bytecode Files . Its status is Withdrawn and corresponding patch rejected. Therefore there might be no direct way to do it. If you don't need source code then you may just delete *.py files. *.pyc files can be used as is or packed in an egg.
