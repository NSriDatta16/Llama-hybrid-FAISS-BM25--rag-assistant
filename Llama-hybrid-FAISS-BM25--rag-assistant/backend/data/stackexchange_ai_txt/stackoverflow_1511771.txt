Depending on the flavor of COBOL (I use AcuCOBOL) you can accept data into a working storage variable from a command line option like so: ACCEPT WS-CMD-LINE FROM COMMAND-LINE. You can also set an environment variable like you are trying to do and ACCEPT it like so: ACCEPT WS-ENV-VAR FROM ENVIRONMENT "TRAP". Hope this helps!
