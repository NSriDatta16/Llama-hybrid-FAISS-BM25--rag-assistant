Since setting the properties with javascript never seemed to work, but setting using Firebug's inspect did, I started to suspect that the javascript ID selector was broken - maybe there were multiple items in the DOM with the same ID? The source didn't show that there were, but looping through all divs using javascript I found that that was the case. Here's the function I ended up using to show the popup: function openPopup(popupID) { var divs = getObjectsByTagAndClass('div','popupDiv'); if (divs != undefined && divs != null) { for (var i = 0; i (utility function getObjectsByTagAndClass not listed) Ideally I'll find out why the same item is being inserted multiple times, but I don't have control over the rendering platform, just its inputs. So when debugging issues like this, remember to check for duplicate IDs in the DOM, which can break getElementById . To everyone who answered, thanks for your help!
