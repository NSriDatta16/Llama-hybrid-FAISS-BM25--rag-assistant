I suggest first reorganizing your data so you either have 1 treatment variable with levels of Phosphorus, Nitrogen, and Both, (Which would be useful to model), or three treatment variables, each of which represents one of the three treatments. One of the things you might try to do is to create an interaction plot. This can be done in R with the command interaction.plot(Treatment1, Treatment2, result) Leaving the interaction (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) off this plot. The idea being that if the two lines on the graph intersect, then there is some interaction between your variables. If they do not (and do not appear likely to), then your variables do not interact. I'm not entirely sure how helpful this will be with your data, but I think it's worth a shot . You could also model the result based on your three terms, and take a look at the Î² value to assigned to your interaction term (in this case treatment 3). Something like: lm(Result ~ Treatment1, Treatment2, Treatment3, data) Or, if you have just one treatment variable with multiple levels: lm(Result ~ I(factor(treatment)), data) The idea being that if the interaction term is 1) insignificant and 2) close to zero, then there's not much interaction going on.
