Proper Design of a MVC Project

I've been using Kohana for a couple months now, and am still relatively new to the MVC style of organizing your code/presentation/db-layer. Unfortunately, while there is plenty of documentation on how to create a controller, establish a view, and interact with a db via a model, I've not found many resources that deal with clean, and suggested development patterns. Let me give a quick example: My latest project has one controller, because I'm not sure if I should be making many more than that...or when I should make a new one. How exactly do I determine when a new controller is needed, along with when a new model is needed?
