You would ordinarily use a view controller to load an external NIB from within interface builder. However, it does not seem to be possible to refer to this NIB's view once you've loaded it. It does not seem to be possible to add the external view to a spot deeper in the hierarchy purely visually. You could however create a class that would automatically load an external NIB during -viewDidLoad: and add it as its one and only child, hence simulating the effect. Then simply drag a UIView and change its class when dropped on the scene.
