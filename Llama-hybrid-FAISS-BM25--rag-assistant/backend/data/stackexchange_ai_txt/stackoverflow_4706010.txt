Kimball's method uses (collection of) data-marts with a common "dimension bus" as a data-warehouse. Inmon's method has a subject-oriented normalized structure as a warehouse, and then from that structure the data is exported to data-marts, which may (or may not) be star-shaped as Kimball's. For very large warehouses, those two architectures converge -- at least become similar -- due to introduction of master-data management structure/storage in the Kimball-type architecture. There is a white paper on Inmon's site called A Tale of Two Architectures which nicely summarizes the two approaches.
