In the standard's terms, it is a storage class specifier (like "static"), a type specifier (like "unsigned"), or a type qualifier (like "const"). The difference is very roughly that if it were either kind of specifier, you could not write BOOL * WINAPI CreateProcessA(...); but if it were a qualifier, you could. Regardless, it is a nonstandard feature of compilers for Windows. (I see that other people have pointed out that in fact "WINAPI" is a macro, but it's a macro provided by the implementation, so you're supposed to treat it as a language feature and not look at what it expands to.)
