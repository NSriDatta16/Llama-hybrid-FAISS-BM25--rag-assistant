How to include external configuration for webstart application

I have webstart application that needs external configuration. Configuration must be external, because it will be changed manually by our customer. I considered adding another jar with this configuration. Application is signed and giving our keys to customer is not a option. I'm leaning towards placing this file to be accessible from web server. How retrive codebase url from webstart application inside or is there a way to configure webstart jnlp file to add other file than jar to classpath? I use maven for complete build, if it is a clue. Any others ideas are acceptable.
