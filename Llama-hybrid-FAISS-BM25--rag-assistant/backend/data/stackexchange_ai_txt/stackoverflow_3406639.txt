Creating Java Classes from Ontology

I have an ontology file (in RDF) which expresses the entities in the app that I am writing. I am using Jena, and can access the Concepts and create/access the resources by directly manipulating triples. To make things easier, I created a set of Java classes, one for each type of resource in my ontology, keeping in mind their inheritances, and properties. E.g. public class Agent{ } and public class Person extends Agent{ private String name; } If the ontology contains two types of resources, Agent and Person , with the latter being a subclass of the former. I realized that the process of creating these classes (and the methods to extract them) are very monotonous. If I was writing an application on databases, I would have used a config file for Hibernate and let it take care of the details. My question is: Is there a tool available that will take an ontology (in an RDF file) as input, and create a set of Java files representing the Concepts in the ontology, as in the example above? (or if Jena itself can do this, and I am missing something) Thanks.
