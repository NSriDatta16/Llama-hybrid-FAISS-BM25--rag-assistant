Generating CSV file and then forcing the file to download

I have an issue, my application works as follows. First echo to the user that the generating of the csv file has started. eg. echo 'Building of csv file started'; then I build the csv file. Now I want to force the file to download, and this works perfectly. this is my code header('Content-Type: application/csv'); header('Content-Disposition:attachment;filename='.$year.'_'.$month.'_'.'export.csv'); header('Pragma: no-cache'); echo readfile($myFile); No the first echo 'Building of csv file started' gets included in the CSV file and I do not know how to exlude it.
