What are the examples where parameter sharing make no sense in convolution network?

Where cant or shouldn't we use parameter sharing in a convolutional neural network? I have read here that : Note that sometimes the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another. One practical example is when the input are faces that have been centered in the image. You might expect that different eye-specific or hair-specific features could (and should) be learned in different spatial locations.In that case it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead simply call the layer a Locally-Connected Layer. So what exactly does this mean? Is it saying that we dont use parameter sharing at all in such cases ? or we just dont call it parameter sharing?! I'm lost here! If its the first one, how come face images are any different than lets say, classifying different birds! or natural images ? And aside from that, what happens if the images are not centered? does it only account for centered images? why ? And apart from faces example, what are other examples ?
