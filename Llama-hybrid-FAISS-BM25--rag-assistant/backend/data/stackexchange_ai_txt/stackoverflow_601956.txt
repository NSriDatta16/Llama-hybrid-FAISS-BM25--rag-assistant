What is the best way to deal with collections (lists or sets) in key-value storage?

I wonder what can be an effective way to add/remove items from a really large list when your storage is memcached-like? Maybe there is some distributed storage with Java interface that deals with this problem well? Someone may recommend Terracotta. I know about it, but that's not exactly what I need. ;)
