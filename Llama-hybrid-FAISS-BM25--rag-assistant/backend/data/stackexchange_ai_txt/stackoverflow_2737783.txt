How can I change the name of the goal to, for example, foo:bar ? (Why does neither display nor time appear anywhere in the XML fragment? How can you tell, from looking at the fragment, what goals it defines?) To be precise, in foo:bar , foo is the "plugin goal prefix" and bar is the "goal". And while the later is derived from naming conventions (or can be configured 1 ), the former comes from an annotation of the BarMojo , the class that implements the plugin logic. Something like this: /** * Do the wonderful bar. * @goal bar * @requiresProject false */ public class BarMojo extends AbstractMojo { ... } Changing the goal requires modifying the annotation of the mojo of a plugin and rebuilding it. Regarding the documentation you linked to, there is a clearly mismatch between the goal time and the XML fragment which binds a timestamp goal to the process-test-resources phase. This must be a typo. How can I manually run this goal? (For similar constructs, the equivalent of mvn display:time sometimes works, but this doesn't work consistently.) You can call it like this: mvn com.mycompany.example:maven-touch-plugin:1.0:timestamp You could make this command shorter by adding com.mycompany.example to the Plugin Groups in your settings.xml ( org.apache.maven.plugins and org.codehaus.mojo are declared by default in case you wonder how it works for those plugins) ... com.mycompany.example Then, because the plugin name matches the ${prefix}-maven-plugin or maven-${prefix}-plugin patterns, you could execute: mvn touch:timestamp Following the convention is recommended but, as I said, the prefix can also be configured . How can I see if this goal exists? Check the plugin documentation (derived from the plugin sources) or the plugin sources. 1 Note that there is also a typo at the bottom of the mentioned page of the Maven Book. The way to execute the plugin with a custom prefix should be mvn blah:echo (see MVNREF-145 ).
