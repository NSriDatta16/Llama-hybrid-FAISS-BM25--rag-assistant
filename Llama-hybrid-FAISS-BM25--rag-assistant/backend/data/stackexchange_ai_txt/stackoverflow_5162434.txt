Check this other StackOverflow question: Why is ASP.NET MVC ignoring my trailing slash? Quoting the approved answer: Legenden - there is no immediate solution to the problem. You may have run across Jason Young's blog post about the issue, which is very informative. Scott Hanselmann posted a reply to it here, basically stating that he didn't think it was a big deal, and if it is, you can leverage the new IIS7 rewrite module to solve it. Ultimately though, you might want to look at a solution that was posted by murad on a similar question on StackOverflow: Trailing slash on an ASP.NET MVC route . Another approach: http://typesafe.be/2009/08/29/solving-the-trailing-slash-problem-in-asp-net-mvc-using-a-custom-urlroutingmodule/
