What assumption would you be violating by including a dichotomous variable as a random effect? You have the mean level correlation between immigration and rioting across countries. Then you have the correlation between immigration and rioting within a country. To explain your predicament. You have a few countries with no correlation between immigration and escalation and a few with a really high correlation between immigration and escalation. The average of those is a moderate correlation I imagine. When you included a random slope, it shows that there is no real across country (global) effect of immigration on escalation. Instead, there are a countries where this is the case. To me, this seems to be the case where there is some hidden country level variable at play.
