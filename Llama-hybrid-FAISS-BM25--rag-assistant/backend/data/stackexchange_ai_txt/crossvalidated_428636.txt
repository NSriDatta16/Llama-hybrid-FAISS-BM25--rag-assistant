The following results are from my simulation in R. Assuming there are 6 rounds in total, the first two throws are always performed in each round, and after each round (the first 2) everybody resets. I will simulate the game for only one person, since we assume the players play independently. I will test which strategy performs better, always banking on the first throw, second, third, and so on. result=replicate(1e4,{ bank=rep(0,20) for(i in 1:6){ round_draws=sample(1:6,20,replace=T) first_two=which(round_draws[3:20]==2)[1]+2 if(!is.na(first_two)){ round_draws[first_two:20]=NA } new_bank=cumsum(round_draws) new_bank[is.na(new_bank)]=0 bank=bank+new_bank } return(bank) }) And the results look like this. The best result (in the long run, on average) is banking every 6 throws.
