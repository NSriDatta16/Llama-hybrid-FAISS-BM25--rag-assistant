With regards to embedding programs you don't have control over: I suspect you'll have a lot of trouble trying to do what you're describing, and if it's even possible at all (something I doubt), it would rely on a lot of low-level API calls and general nastiness. If you wanted to restructure your application somewhat, you could make your four programs into plugins, and create a fifth "host" application that could load any or all of them. I suggest you take a look at the JEDI plugin system, available for free from http://delphi-jedi.org .
