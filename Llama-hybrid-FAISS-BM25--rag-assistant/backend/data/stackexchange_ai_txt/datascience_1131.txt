The most direct and obvious transformation is from time domain to frequency domain . Possible methods include Fourier transform and wavelet transform . After the transform the signal is represented by a function of frequency-domain elements which can be operated on using ordinary algebra. It's also possible to model a time series as a trajectory of a dynamical system in a state space (see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9892.1980.tb00300.x/abstract , and http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A2n16.pdf ). Dynamical systems can be modeled symbolically at a course-grain level (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_dynamics and http://www.math.washington.edu/SymbolicDynamics/ ) Symbolic dynamics draws on linear algebra.
