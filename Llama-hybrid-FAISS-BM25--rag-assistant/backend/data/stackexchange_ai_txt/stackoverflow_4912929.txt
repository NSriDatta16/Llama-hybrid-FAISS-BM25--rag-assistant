Inside of an inner class this will get you the reference to the class you are currently in and not to the Activity. Initialize a Context object inside of your Activity 's onCreate() method to use it inside of the inner class. There is another possibility which is not encouraged. I'm only showing you the possibilities and repeat myself that it is not encouraged to use this method as you might leak the entire Activity depending on the code you are passing that context to. You could get the Activity like this MyActivity.this . It would work but don't do it that way as long as you are not 100% sure know that you are not going to leak it. UPDATE Your problem is something else in fact. You are setting the layout after accessing it which won't work. So you have to set the layout using setContentView() preferably directly after the up-call to super. The main problem is you are trying to access views that simply are not there yet which makes the application crash of course.
