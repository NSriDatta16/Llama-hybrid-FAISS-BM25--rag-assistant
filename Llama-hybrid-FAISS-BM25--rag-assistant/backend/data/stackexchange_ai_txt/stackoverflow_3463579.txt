Actually, it's Merge that modifies properties in place, and Update that replaces the entire entity. I believe the storage client library does a merge by default, but I think you can use SaveChangeOptions.UpdateAsReplace to modify this behavior. An easy way to test/verify this is to run a debugging proxy like Fiddler and just see what happens over the wire.
