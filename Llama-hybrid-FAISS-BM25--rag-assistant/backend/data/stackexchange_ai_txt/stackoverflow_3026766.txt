I would highly recommend using templates. Templates help to encourage a good MVC structure to your application. Python code that emits HTML, IMHO, is wrong. The reason I say that is because Python code should be responsible for doing logic and not have to worry about presentation. Template syntax is usually restrictive enough that you can't really do much logic within the template, but you can do any presentation specific type logic that you may need. ymmv.
