I don't know of specific UI widgets that do exactly what you are asking but here are a few UI paradigms that might be useful (depending on what you need to do with the subsets after they are defined): Color coded list box (allows user or program to highlight items with different colors depending on which subset they belong to.Being able to group items by color and displying a legend are useful in this model). Tree control (displays groups as children of nodes in a tree. Generally this would be a tree with only two levels - the top one being the partition, the next being the items in the partition. The ability to drag items between partitions (nodes) and being able to rename the top level partition can be useful in this model.) Hierarchical grid (similar to a tree control but shows additional columns of information to describe details of the items being displayed) Multi-column draggable lists (a set of multiple columns into which you can drag items. Each column represents one subset in the partition).
