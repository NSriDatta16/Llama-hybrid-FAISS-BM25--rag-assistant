If you have a subset of FIX messages you have to support (most exchanges usually use 10-20 types), you can roll your own classes to parse messages into. If you're trying to be more generic, I would suggest creating something like a FIXChunk class. The entirety of the message could be stored in this class, organized into keys and their values, as well as lists of repeating groups. Each of the repeating groups would itself be a FIXChunk.
