Simple Bayesian network

I have three variables: GENDER {“Male”, “Female”} AGE {“0-18”, “19-30”, “30-60”, “60+”} REGION {“Europe”, “Asia”, “Africa”, “America”} From the literature I “know” that: Males who live in Asia and who fall into 19-30 age group have 5% probability of having certain disease. Males in general have 3% probability of having the same disease Asian .. teenagers have average of 2% Americans 4% etc. The point is that I have some knowledge and I want to record it in a network “format” and I would like to use that network in future. I’m no R expert but I was reading lately about “bnlearn” package. It looks like it is exactly what I need but I can’t get my head around it! Am I on the right track? How do I specify my probabilities? library(bnlearn); net I actually have ~30 variables with up to 10 levels each.
