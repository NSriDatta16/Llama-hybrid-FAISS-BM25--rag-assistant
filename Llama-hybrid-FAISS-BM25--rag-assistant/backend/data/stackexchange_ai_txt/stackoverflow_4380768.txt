As @Amandir points out you could probably solve your problems by using a UINavigationController . I get a feeling that you are trying to abuse the modal view controller concept a bit and that's why it doesn't work as you expect. When you use presentModalViewController:animated: the intention should be that you are displaying a view that is modal, i.e. the user must interact and dismiss the modal view before she can continue. What the paragraph above means that when you present a modal view controller it shouldn't be possible to use the tab bar. Since you are using the word push I'm guessing that you would like change the view of Tab01 while still being able to use the functionality of the tab bar. The problem is that there isn't any built-in method of pushing view controllers besides UINavigationController . persentModalViewController:animated: should only be used in case where you want a modal view, which on the iPhone means a full screen view. The easiest way would probably be to use an UINavigationController and hide the navigation bar. Then you would get the functionality I think you are after. The other option is to manually add and remove sub views. [self.view addSubview:repVC.view]; and [repVC.view removeFromSuperview]; [self.view addSubview:mail.view]; You can use block animations if you want some fancy transitions.
