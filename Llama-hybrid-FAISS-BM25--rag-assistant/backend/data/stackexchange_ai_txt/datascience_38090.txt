It seems merging two neural networks does not make any sense. You may instead train one deep R-CNN or with just 2 different NN trained, You may classify as for a test case,if outputs of both NN agree, then output the common output, else the NN which outputs 1, its precision and NN which outputs -1, ratio of its correct negatives to total cases which it predicted negative(calculated in training), whichever is greater, output that NN's output. Hope these articles will help you.
