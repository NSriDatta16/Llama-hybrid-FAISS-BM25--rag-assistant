You can't check every possible combination. There are $2^{30} = 1,073,741,824$ of them, so unless you have a truly gigantic sample, you won't even be able to even find a case for each of them, let alone model them. A more tenable approach is to check for every effect of a single binary variable and assume no interactions, or only allow all the two-way interactions (of which there are a mere ${30 \choose 2} = 435$). Whatever combinations you want to check, you can fit a linear regression model with whatever predictors you want, then look at what the model says is the combination of covariates with the greatest conditional mean.
