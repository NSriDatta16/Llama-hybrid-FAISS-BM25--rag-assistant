Not sure if this should go as a comment but I believe I've found an answer to the first question. According to Tianjing et al (2011) : "When both direct and indirect evidence are available, the two sources of information can be combined as a weighted average when appropriate." So if direct and indirect comparisons exist ideally the authors should state if they have combined them. Frustratingly the NMA I'm reviewing doesn't state this either way so I'm not sure what they did.
