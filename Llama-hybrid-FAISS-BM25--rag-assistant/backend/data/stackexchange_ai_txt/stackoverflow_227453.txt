Generate the hash (SHA1, MD5, etc) for a key and hardcode the hash in your application. Distribute the key to your users. In your executable can check the hash of the user specified key against the hardcoded hash: bool CheckKey(string keyFromUser) return SHA1(key) == "ABC2983CF293892CD298392FG"; } This means that anyone that can get hold of the key from your organization (or another user) can run the application, It will practically difficult to determine the key by inspecting the executable. This is obviously not a very strong protection.
