How can I filter a large file into two separate files?

I've got a huge file (500 MB) that is organized like this: bunch of text here some more here bunch of text here some more here bunch of text here some more here I'd like to transform this into a new format where s1 goes to a new file with each s1 on its own line with a line break, and s2 goes to a new file with each s2 on its own line. Is Perl the way to go here? If so, can someone let me know how I can accomplish this?
