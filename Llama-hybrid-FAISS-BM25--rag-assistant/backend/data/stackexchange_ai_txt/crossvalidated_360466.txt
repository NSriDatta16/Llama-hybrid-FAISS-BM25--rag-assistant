Nothing has gone wrong, and you don't need to do anything about it. The paired sample t-test relies on the average of the differences of the paired samples being approximately normally distributed, not the differences themselves. The two statements are not incompatible; even if the differences are significantly skewed, the distribution of the sample mean will become "more normal" as the sample size gets larger, subject to a few conditions that are almost always met in practical applications. For example, consider the sample mean of twelve observations from a Uniform$(0,1)$ distribution. Clearly the U$(0,1)$ distribution is a long way from Normal, but the sample mean, even of only 12 observations, is not: > x for (i in 1:1000) x[i] hist(x) which produces: Not too bad, and with 10,000 draws, it would be better still...
