The most elegant way to do this would be to subclass UIScrollView , give it a UIImageView property. That way, you could access this UIImageView with something like: MyScrollView *myScrollView = (MyScrollView *)[scrollView viewWithTag:tagInt]; UIImageView *imageView = myScrollView.imageView; Hope this helps!
