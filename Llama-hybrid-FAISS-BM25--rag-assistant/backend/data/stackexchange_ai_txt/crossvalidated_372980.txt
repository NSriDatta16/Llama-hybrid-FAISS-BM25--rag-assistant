Why do we use k-fold cross validation? Cross-validation is a method to estimate the skill of a method on unseen data. Like using a train-test split. Cross-validation systematically creates and evaluates multiple models on multiple subsets of the dataset. This, in turn, provides a population of performance measures . We can calculate the mean of these measures to get an idea of how well the procedure performs on average. We can calculate the standard deviation of these measures to get an idea of how much the skill of the procedure is expected to vary in practice. This is also helpful for providing a more nuanced comparison of one procedure to another when you are trying to choose which algorithm and data preparation procedures to use. Also, this information is invaluable as you can use the mean and spread to give a confidence interval on the expected performance on a machine learning procedure in practice. reference
