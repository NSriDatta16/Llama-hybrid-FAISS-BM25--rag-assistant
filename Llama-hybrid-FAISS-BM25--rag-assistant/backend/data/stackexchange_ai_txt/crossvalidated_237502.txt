Regressing dependent variable on instruments

I am reading a paper ( News drought, News Floods, and U.S. Disaster Relief by Eisensee and Stromberg (2007)) in which they study the effect of news coverage on disaster reliefs sent by US. They instrument "news coverage" with other newsworthy events that may crowd out disasters from tv, i.e. "Olympics" and "World Series". My question is about a reported result, i.e. the results from a regression of the dependent variable "relief" on the two instruments . What's the point in doing that? I mean I thought that the only thing to do was to regress the endogenous variable "news pressure" on the instruments as a first stage of a TSLS approach. Moreover, my professor called it reduced form equation but looking around the net I found that this should not be the case. How should I call it instead?
