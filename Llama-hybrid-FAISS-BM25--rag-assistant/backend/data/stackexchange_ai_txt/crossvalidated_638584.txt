Selecting (or constructing) variables is very much dependent on the model, e.g. if trying to model a quadratic relationship with a linear model you need to include an additional variable to capture this, while a random forest (example) model would not need such a variable since it can learn this relationship on its own (although it doesn't necessarily hurt to include it). Another case is the one you mention, ridge can deal with multicollinearity on its own (although you might not like how it chose to handle it), while linear regression cannot, so you should probably do something about it.
