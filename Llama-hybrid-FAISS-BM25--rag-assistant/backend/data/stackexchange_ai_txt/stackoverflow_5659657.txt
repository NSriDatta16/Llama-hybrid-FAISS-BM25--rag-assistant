Objectify is a 3rd party Java data access API specifically designed for Google Cloud Datastore in the App Engine Standard runtime. It occupies a "middle ground"; easier to use and more transparent than JDO or JPA, but significantly more convenient than the Low-Level API provided for Cloud Datastore. It also integrates with the App Engine memcache and taskqueue APIs to simplify common patterns of working with Cloud Datastore. The Cloud Datastore low-level Java API for App Engine Standard is simple and elegant, neatly reducing your data operations to four simple methods: get, put, delete, and query. However, it is not designed to be used by the average developer: DatastoreService persists GAE-specific Entity objects rather than normal POJO classes. DatastoreService Keys are untyped and error-prone. DatastoreService has a machine-friendly but not human-friendly query interface. DatastoreService has an unnecessarily complicated transaction API. Objectify provides a convenient layer which addresses these issues, yet preserves the elegance of get, put, delete, and query.
