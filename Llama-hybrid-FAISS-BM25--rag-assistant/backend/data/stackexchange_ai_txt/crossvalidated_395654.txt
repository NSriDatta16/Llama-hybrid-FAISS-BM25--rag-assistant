How to improve this time series model?

I am trying to fit a time series model for household data which is a time series variable. Initially my data looks like this, Since the data does not seem to be stationary I differenced the data. When I plot the 2nd difference data, it looks like follows: The plots didn't improve when I took a higher order difference. So I used the 2nd difference data. The acf and pacf of the 2nd order data are as follows, To estimate the coefficients I used the yule walker method and following results obtained, Then I tried the different combinations of models with 2 coefficients. I fitted ARIMA models for original data by considering the parameter for difference as 2(D=2). Using the AIC criteria, I got ARIMA (1,2,1) as the best model. The model diagnostics results of this model as follows, When considering the plots, it seems that the results are reasonable except the normality of residuals. Can anyone suggest a way of improving this results? I am kind of new to time series so your advice will be a huge help for me. The data set for this problem is follows, I need to fit a model for the variable x4 Data set: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXokm4p5ED2I03o0qGyWdxex38P-157M/view
