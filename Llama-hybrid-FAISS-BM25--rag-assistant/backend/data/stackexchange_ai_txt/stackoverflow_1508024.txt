We had exactly the same problem with one of our magento projects. We found that the function in app/design/frontend/default/default/template/page/htmlhead.phtml had been commented out: helper('core/js')->getTranslatorScript() ?> After putting this in, it still did not work, because translations had not been inserted into translate file. Check out those two things and it should start working.
