Can't upload App - 'An error occurred uploading to the itunes store'

I'm trying to upload my app to the store. This isn't the first time so I'm familiar with the process. I've tried both through the Organizer (preferred method) and the Application Loader, but both offer vague error messages. I've recently updated to Xcode 4 in an attempt to fix it. My archived project validates fine and everything, but shortly after hitting submit, I get an error saying: An error occurred uploading to the itunes store But no other info. So I really don't know what could be wrong. I've appealed to Apple but nothing yet. What could be wrong? EDIT: I should probably mention that my project has 2 targets, but I have provisioning profiles for both, both for development and distribution, so can't see why this would be a problem. It's the only unusual thing about the project as far as I can tell. Still no word from Apple either... Thanks! Michael
