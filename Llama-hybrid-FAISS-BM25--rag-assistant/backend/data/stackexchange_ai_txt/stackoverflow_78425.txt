In absence of general statistics, collect your own. Check out http://fingerprintapp.com/email-client-stats for a ready-made statistics collection tool, and see http://www.mattbrindley.com/fingerprint-email-client-usage-1/ for a write-up about it. Matt Brindley also offers this gem: " So far only Outlook has proved as popular as we expected, the iPhone was a notable surprise for our own list, with Lotus Notes making an unexpected appearance as well. " Of course, provide both text/html and text/plain mime types so that readers can choose which version to view, and keep your html extremely basic until your statistics indicate that you can get fancier. If Fingerprint's fee is out of the question, you can collect your own statistics. Include hyperlinks in your HTML. When your CGI application receives requests from these hyperlinks, it can save the HTTP_USER_AGENT in a database for your statistical analysis. This method is not entirely reliable because some readers will stick to plain text, some will never click any of the hyperlinks, and some email clients will not include useful information in the user agent request header, but it may give you enough information to proceed. Sitepoint, a well-respected source for W3 information, has an article, http://www.sitepoint.com/article/code-html-email-newsletters/ , in which Tom Slavin points out: Use HTML tables to control the design layout and some presentation. You may be used to using pure CSS layouts for your web pages, but that approach just won't hold up in an email environment. Use inline CSS to control other presentation elements within your email, such as background colors and fonts. Slavin also recommends templates from Campaign Monitor and MailChimp to get you started.
