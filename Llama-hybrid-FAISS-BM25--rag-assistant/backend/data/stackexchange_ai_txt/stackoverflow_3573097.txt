A good rule of thumb for machine learning is: better features beat better algorithms. I.e if you feed the raw image pixels directly into your classifier, the results will be poor, no matter what learning algorithm you use. If you preprocess the image and extract features that are highly correlated with "caterpillar presence", then most algorithms will do a decent job. So don't focus on the network topology, start with the computer vision task.
