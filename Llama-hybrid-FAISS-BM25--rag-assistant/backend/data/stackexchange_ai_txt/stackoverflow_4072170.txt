You can also use a "masked edit" from Ajax. The Ajax control toolkit can be found at: http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/MaskedEdit/MaskedEdit.aspx Install Ajax. Follow the steps provided on the websites on how to add the AJAX controls to my Visual Studio. After that, drag the "MaskedEditExtender" Control to the textbox you want formatted. In the properties field that says "Mask" I typed (999) 999-9999 After this I found out that I had to add something called "TollkitScriptManager" In design view, drag and drop the control above the txtbox which is the textbox you want the formatting done in. I do not think you have to change any of the properties to this and I believe that this control HAS to be above the textbox you want to format. This may or may not be what you are looking for but it will allow a very specific format for a text box and force the user to only type in numbers or whatever you choose. This is very useful for formatting telephone numbers in the textbox.
