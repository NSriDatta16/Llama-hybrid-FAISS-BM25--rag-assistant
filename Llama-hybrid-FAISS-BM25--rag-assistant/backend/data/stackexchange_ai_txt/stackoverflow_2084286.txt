Why doesn't my Perl regex match what I think it should?

I tried the following code snippet from Robert's Perl tutorial ( link text ): > $_='My email address is > .'; > > print "Found it ! :$1:" if /( )/i; When I ran it, the output was: Found it ! :>: However, shouldn't the output be, Found it ! :m>: since 'm' matches "0 or more ' Also, $_='My email address is .'; print "Match 1 worked :$1:" if /( When this is run the output is: Match 1 worked :: $_=' .'; print "Match 2 worked :$1:" if /( When the above is run, the output is: Match 2 worked : But shouldn't the output be: Match 2 worked :: since the first match (i.e. $1) is "" rather than "
