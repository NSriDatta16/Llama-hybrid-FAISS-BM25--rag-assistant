Understanding Scales of Measurement

Looking through the various Stack Exchange groups, I think this may be the appropriate group. Apologies if I should have posted this elsewhere. I have been reading about Scales of Measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)as a way of describing why it’s invalid to do some things to some numbers. I have two types of numbers which I’m not sure about: Year of publication. It appears to fit in the Interval category (the difference between years is meaningful), but all of the descriptions omit the fact that adding these values is not meaningful. This would also apply to distances and dates in general. That is, would are some interval values addable and some not? Price per item. In all ways this appears to fit in the ration category, but again, adding these numbers is not meaningful. In a sense, price per item would classify as an average, and you can’t do much more with averages. Do the above categories adequately describe my two examples, or is there another dimension to this? I am aware that Scales of Measurement has had its critics. Further to this, the year of publication, or any date or any distance, can’t be added, but can be averaged, which is normally obtained by adding.
