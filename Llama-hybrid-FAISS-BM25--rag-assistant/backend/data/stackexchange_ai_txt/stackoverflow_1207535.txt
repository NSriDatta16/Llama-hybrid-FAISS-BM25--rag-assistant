Eclipse is also really slow if you're running a gargantuan project. Where I am we have a large core library that all the (much smaller) subprojects require. Rather than keeping that open, I just build it as a jar and link to the jar when I work on the satellite projects. Eclipse is much faster with 100 java files than with 1000+, even on a local box with plenty of memory.
