Is there an ItemsControl equivalent for text content?

I have some data that I want to present in a FlowDocument . This will basically be a view that explains the data in a friendly way, with section headers, paragraphs of text, etc., and which I will display in a FlowDocumentScrollViewer. To this end, I would like to create a bulleted list ( ) out of the contents of an ObservableCollection . I know how to do that with ItemsControl , but how do I do it for ListItem elements in a FlowDocument , since they're part of the TextElement class hierarchy rather than the Control hierarchy? Is there an equivalent of ItemsControl for text content inside a TextBlock or FlowDocument ? Edit: The article Sergey linked to is the perfect starting point. The only problem is that the article's code can only use a Section or a TableRowGroup as the items panel, and doesn't yet support using a . But that was trivial to fix -- just a matter of adding this code at the end of ItemsContent.GenerateContent , just before the final else : else if (panel is List) ((List) panel).ListItems.Add((ListItem) element);
