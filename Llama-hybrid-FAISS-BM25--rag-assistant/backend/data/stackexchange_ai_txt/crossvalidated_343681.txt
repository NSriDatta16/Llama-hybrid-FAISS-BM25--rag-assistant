lower tail z-test

This is an exercise from Freedman, Pisani and Purves’ Statistics, 4th ed. (p. 552/8) An investigator has independent samples from box A and from box B. Her null hypothesis says that the two boxes have the same average. She looks at the difference average of sample from A – average of sample from B. The two-sample z-test gives z = about 1.79. Is the difference statistically significant if the alternative hypothesis says that the average of box A is a) bigger than the average of box B? b) smaller than the average of box B? c) different from the average of box B? EDIT: I have found the English version of the book, so have deleted my previous version translated from Hungarian in order to avoid any misunderstandings that could be caused by wording. My solutions to the questions are a) yes, as p = 3.6% b) no, as p = 3.6% c) no, as p = 7.2% But according to the book's solution b) is incorrect because p = 96%. Is this a mistake? If not, then why is such a high p value given? In my understanding the area of the bell-shaped curve between z = 1.79 and -1.79 should be considered as evidence that the average of box A is the same as box B (or in a precise language: "We reject the counter hypothesis that the average of box A differs from the average of box B") because the observed difference is small, it could be due to chance error. Thus, it would be only the tiny left chunk area under the curve (z What am I getting wrong here? Thanks for any clarifications.
