SEO Url Redirect/Rewrite Using Database Managed Links

I have searched left and right. And I am trying to find a script or a method on how I can store links in database and use them for redirection. This is an E-commerce project and I am looking for something to manage product and system URL from database. Something similar like magento does. Basically anything after the domain say like domain.com/demo/12/my_iphone so now demo/12/my_iphone will be sent to database for query and in databases there will be a destination URL which could be productlisting.php?searchstring=iphones The user will see link domain.com/demo/12/my_iphone but actually he will be seing productlisting.php?searchstring=iphones Basically demo/12/my_iphone = productlisting.php?searchstring=iphones And tomorrow if the user wants to edit demo/12/my_iphone to demo/12/myiphone he can just do so using simple form which will update in the database. How can I achieve this?
