Scenario-Based Unit Testing: Organization

A friend and I recently came across the idea of scenario-based unit testing , which we think is a great alternative to the test-case-per-class methodology. It's especially attractive because it helps consolidate much of our setup code and reduces the time it takes to create tests. But creating a new test fixture for each scenario gives us a new problem: How should we organize these scenario test fixtures? If we create a new test fixture for each scenario, we will be creating a lot of fixtures. Where do we put them? In one single mammoth of a file? Or should we create a new file for each scenario, and place that file in a folder with all the other test fixtures? The reason I ask is because there is great potential for creating a big headache for ourselves when we have to maintain our code later, but we won't be able to tell it's a headache until after the damage has been done.
