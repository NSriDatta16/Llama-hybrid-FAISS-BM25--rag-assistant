How to insert (embed) a file object into Excel sheet

I need to insert (embed) a file object (.txt file) in MS Excel sheet using Java. The requirement is not to put the contents of .txt file into Excel. Instead I need to put the whole file as an embedded object into Excel. I am using Apache POI jar for this. I have seen all the examples present in poi-3.7-beta1 but was not able to find any example, to insert (embed) a file object in Excel sheet. I have seen POIFSFileSystem classes but was not able to find the appropriate class to use for this problem. I am facing issue in embedding file object into Excel. Please help me doing this using Apache POI or any other jar.
