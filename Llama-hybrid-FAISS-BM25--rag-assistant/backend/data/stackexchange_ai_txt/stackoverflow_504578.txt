For images and documents that are already in a specific format (excel, word documents, pdf files, etc) I prefer file storage. But for just raw text I would probably rather use a database. It is easier to replicate across machines for failover, you can do substring searches over the text and although I don't know of a specific algorithm to use to compress it, I would think that a database would be a better way to go. But only if you already have just the text and it is only text. Any other format of document I would prefer using file storage. And unless I am missing something I would use a CLOB instead of a BLOB, if it is only text.
