Prediction interval for number of biased coin tosses to get 2 consecutive heads

Suppose I am given a possibly biased coin, which turns up heads an unknown fraction $p$ of the time. Initially I flip the coin 10 times (e.g. generating data = TTHTTHHTHH). Next, I have to flip the coin repeatedly until I get 2 heads in a row. Let the number of flips I perform before getting 2 heads in a row be $F_{HH}$. My Question: How can I compute frequentest prediction intervals for $F_{HH}$ (assuming I have already performed the 10 coin flips)? NOTE : It seems to me the equivalent Bayesian answer to this question is fairly straightforward (??) -- but I am not sure of the best Frequentest approach. For clarity, I include the Bayesian approach below. Bayesian Approach: We have: $$P(F_{HH} | data) = \int_{0}^{1} P(F_{HH}|p)P(p|data)~dp$$. Computing $P(F_{HH}|p)$ should be straightforward (e.g. using a brute force approach like this one: Time taken to hit a pattern of heads and tails in a series of coin-tosses ) We can compute $P(p|data)$ using Bayes theorem: $$P(p|data) = L(data|p)P(p)/P(data)$$ where we specify the prior $P(p)$ (e.g. a uniform prior), compute the likelihood $L(data|p)$ from the binomial distribution, and $P(data)$ is just a normalizing constant. Given this, we can compute the integral to get the distribution $P(F_{HH}|data)$, from which various point/interval estimates can be constructed. But what about a frequentest solution, where we avoid specifying $P(p)$?
