Logistic Regression- Control Variable Not significant In Model 2

I am new to this site and it's my first post, so my apologies in advance if I have made any mistakes or did not follow proper etiquette. I am running a logistic regression analysis with six predictor variables and I have controlled for two variables (a total of 8 variables in my final model). In Model 1 with only the control variables included, both variables are significant below .05. However in Model 2 (the full model) with all of the predictor variables and both controls, one of the original control variables that was significant, dropped in its significance. I am so confused as to how this could happen. Any ideas? Also, how would I go about reporting my results? Am I still able to report this one variable that dropped from significance as being significant in Model, even though it was not significant in the final Model 2? Thank you in advance for anyone who can answer my question
