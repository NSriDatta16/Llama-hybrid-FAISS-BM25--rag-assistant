Logistic Regression - Bayesian Approach - Assessing Classification Accuracy

I have recently begun to read about bayesian statistics and I am playing around with the R2WinBUGS package. I'm trying to fit a logistic regression to the spam data (that can be found on the webpage of the elements of statistical learning) using R and WinBUGS. My approach was to first divide the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets. I can fit the model using the 80% set but I dont know how to write WinBugs code to predict on new observations (say the 20% test set) and I wonder if this approach to study model/classification precisicion make sense in a Bayesian Approach?
