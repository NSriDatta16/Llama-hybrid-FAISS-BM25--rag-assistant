The question seems to be asking you to formally state a hypothesis. The "hint" makes a critical fallacy of conflating a "test statistic" with the "effect of interest". In our case we're interested in average price of a phone, it's "expectation". So we either define the average price of either type of phone, or the difference between them. If I were grading and I see "beta" and "refb" without any definition, I'd mark it incorrect. The second point of consideration is the appropriate direction of effect under the null. We wish to prove that refurbished phones are more expensive. Therefore assume the opposite. As an example: $$\mathcal{H}_0 : \mu_{\text{used phone}} \ge \mu_{\text{refurbished phone}}$$ That is, used phones are either equal to or more expensive than refurbished ones. Providing evidence to the contrary and testing for statistical significance can be quantified with the $p$ value.
