How do we determine if the data has to be transformed to reduce skewness? Visually or metrics?

I am wondering what would be the normal way for a data scientist to validate if the data is skewed or not. Is it by plotting the histogram or by finding skewness/kurtosis value (ex:- using pandas methods etc)? What is the correct way? and what is the normal way it's done in real data analysis/machine learning work?
