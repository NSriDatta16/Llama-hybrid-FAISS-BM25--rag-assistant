There is another javascript library based on SVG. It is called Protovis and it comes from Stanford Visualization Group It also allows making nice interactive graphics and visualizations. http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/ Although it is only for modern web browsers UPDATE: The protovis team has moved to another library called d3.js (Data Driven Documents) as they said: "The Protovis team is now developing a new visualization library, D3.js, with improved support for animation and interaction. D3 builds on many of the concepts in Protovis" The new library can now be found in: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ UPDATE 2: "Rickshaw" is a JavaScript toolkit for creating interactive time series graphs. Based on d3.js that simplifies a lot the work with d3.js although is a little bit less powerful. http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/
