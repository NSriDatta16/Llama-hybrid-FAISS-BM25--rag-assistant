Yes, this is possible. Indeed, it's not just possible but a fairly common situation. For example I was looking recently at time series data (1987-2011) for world oil and natural gas prices (adjusted for general price inflation), and found that the correlation over the whole time period was higher than that over either half of the period. The reason is that both prices are on an upward trend, but the correlation coefficients for the shorter periods are more influenced by differences in fluctuations about the trend.
