The first question you should ask is 'how do I make sure any changes we make do not break the system?'. Yet your question does not mention tests at all. That's a red flag to me. I agree with others that tools are not the solution (not likely to turn up in the form you want, not likely to be 100% trustworthy on their own). Your goal should be to quickly identify the area(s) to be changed - I would do this via inspection and running the code (preferably in existing tests - do you have them?), and make sure you have comprehensive unit and system test coverage on them before you touch a single line. Without that base, you are going to be flying blind and deadlines are way more at risk. At the very least, if you don't have good tests, communicate this concern to your line upfront so that if things go pear-shaped you are seen to have raised the issue. You could look at something like this - not used myself though: Klokwork Architect
