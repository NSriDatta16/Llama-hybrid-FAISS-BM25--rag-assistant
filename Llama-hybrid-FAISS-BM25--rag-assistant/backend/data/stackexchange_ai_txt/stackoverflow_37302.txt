I know a lot of people think short code equals elegant code but that isn't true. The example you propose is perfectly solved in code, as you have shown so, what do you need a preprocessor directive to? You don't want to "preprocess" your code, you want the compiler to insert some code for you in your properties. It's common code but that's not the purpose of the preprocessor. With your example, Where do you put the limit? Clearly that satisfies an observer pattern and there's no doubt that will be useful but there are a lot of things that would be useful that are actually done because code provides flexibility where as the preprocessor does not. If you try to implement common patterns through preprocessor directives you'll end with a preprocessor which needs to be as powerful as the language itself. If you want to process your code in a different way the use a preprocessor directive but if you just want a code snippet then find another way because the preprocessor wasn't meant to do that.
