Regular expression to replace period in name portion of e-mail header?

I am attempting to send an e-mail in PHP and the system is rejecting the e-mail because the name portion of the e-mail address contains a period like below: Mr. Joe Nobody I am looking for an elegant solution to replace all periods that are not part of the e-mail address with either a space or no character at all. My problem is that the field I am replacing may contain more than one name/e-mail address combination like so: Mr. Joe Nobody , Mrs. Jane Noone Does anyone know of a way to do this in PHP using either standard string manipulation or a regular expression?
