Multi-Step Forecast for Multivariate Time Series (LSTM) Keras

I have been trying to understand how to build LSTM model for multivariate time series forecast using Keras but I am still unsure how to present the data in the correct shape. My Dataset: • 5 cities. • Each with 2 features. Temperature and humidity. • Daily records of the last 10 weeks(Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday) What I want to do: Given Monday’s record of the new week of a city, I'd like to forecast the Temperature and humidity for the remaining 6 days of that city. I.e. Multi-Step Forecast for Multivariate Time Series. Output shape(6,2) How I have started off: For each city, the input shape [(num_samples, num_time_steps, num_features) ] would be (10, 7, 2). For 10 weeks , I will have five unique samples(5-cities) with the same shape (70, 2) . So if I stack all vertically I will have (350, 2) or 3D shape (50,7,2). Then create a supervised series with lag 1, I will have a shape(244, 4) # Split train/test data. train on 7-weeks. So input_shape= 5*(7,7,2) = (35,7,2) test on 3-weeks. . So input_shape= 5*(3,7,2) = (15,7, 2) What I am confused about: The above layout seems to disregard the unique nature of each sample. I looked at this but still, a bit confused on how to transform it to a regression model. I want the network to train each city's data separately as in this pic I would appreciate any suggestion. Thanks
