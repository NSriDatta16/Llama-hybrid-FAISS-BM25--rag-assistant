.NET Application compatible with both standalone Windows and Azure

I need to design an MVC 2 or 3 app to work on both internal Win server and on Azure. The only problem I see is with the data storage. The app listens to some very chatty data feeds, like 10GB a day, and will have to write that data. So I'm looking for a way to have both Azure table and some other DB with minimal differences in code. Any suggestions for what DB to use? TIA
