Your interpretation is correct. However, the accepted answer contains incorrect information. First, your interpretation is correct even when $height = 0$ , as then the average score changes by $0.4$ . Second, the assertion in the accepted answer that the average predicted score will increase by $(0.4 + 0.8)$ , not by $0.4 + 0.8*height$ , is incorrect. To see this, set $age = 10$ and $height = 10$ , and observe that the average predicted score is $101$ . If $age = 11$ and $height = 10$ , the average predicted score is $109.4$ , an increase of $0.4 + 0.8*10$ .
