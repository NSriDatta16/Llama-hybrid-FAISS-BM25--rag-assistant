I agree that this is not strictly the place to ask this question. You may look at the many fine articles, resources, and tutorials on GameDev.net . I strongly disagree with Esko on the point of Blender : the software has significantly improved in recent versions and is undergoing a complete interface overhaul in the next release (2.50), currently available in alpha. The interface may be cluttered at present, but I find that Blender's interface design has a tendency to enhance rather than detract from my 3D production workflow. Even working on in-depth New Media projects, Blender has more than proven to me its worth and efficiency. It also has a quality 3D game engine with both drag-and-drop logic and Python automation.
