Can I prevent Java Web Start from modifying the system path?

I have noticed that when I start an application using javaws.exe pathtojnlpfile.jnlp , javaws appends the JRE's path to the end of the system's %PATH% environment variable. Is there any way I can prevent javaws from modifying the path in this way? I am using JRE1.5.0_15 on Windows Vista. I have read that older versions of the JRE do not do this.
