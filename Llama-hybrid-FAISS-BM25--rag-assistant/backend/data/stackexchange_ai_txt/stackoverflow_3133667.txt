According to the codestyle.org font survey , most Macs don't have Myriad Pro installed. (Nor Windows for that matter.) You should pick similar fallback fonts for all of Mac, Windows and Linux then specify a list of these fonts in your style. If you specifically need Myriad Pro then you could use images, or embed the font using sIFR (maybe not for menus though) or through @font-face font-embedding (thanks Olly!) instead.
