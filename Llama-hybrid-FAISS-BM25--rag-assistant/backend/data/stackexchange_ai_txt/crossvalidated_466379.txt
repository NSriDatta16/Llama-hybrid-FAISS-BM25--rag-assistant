Logistic Regression: how to reduce bias in data

I have a logistic regression model and my main goal is to predict probability of surviving using explanatory variables like age, gender etc. Each row in my data represents an individual and columns are age (an integer number), gender (M, F), exposure time i.e. how long a particular individual is exposed to the risk of dying (a number between [0,1]) and a response variable taking values of 0 or 1 to indicate death/alive. I used exposure time as weights for each observation. The data I am considering contains individual data from different countries. My model does not allow any country specific covariate to be included. Unfortunately, one country (e.g. country A) dominates the data significantly in terms of both 0's and 1's to the extent that almost 80% of my data is coming from country A. When I fit the logistic regression, the model performs well in country A (as expected) but not that well over other countries. Q: I would like to reduce the effect of country A in my model so that it performs OK but over all countries. Could anyone tell me what options do I have? As I said, I already used weights in the model. My thought : Maybe I can split data for country A into disjoint parts and combine each part to other countries and fit multiple logistic regression? Once I obtained these models, I take the average of estimated coefficients in each model to come up with a single model for the sake of predicting probability of surviving.
