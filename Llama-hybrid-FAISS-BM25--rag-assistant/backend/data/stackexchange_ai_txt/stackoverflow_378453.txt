I wrote 2 blog post detailling the pro and cons of counting Lines of Code (LoC): How do you count your number of Lines Of Code (LOC) ? : The idea is to explain that you need to count the logical number of lines of code instead of a physical count. To do so you can use tools like NDepend for example. Why is it useful to count the number of Lines Of Code (LOC) ? : The idea is that LoC should never be used to measure productivity, but more to do test coverage estimation and software deadline estimation.
