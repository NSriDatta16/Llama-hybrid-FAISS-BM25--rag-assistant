The session will live as long as the file is left on the server's file system. They are cleaned out by a garbage collector. The garbage collector is run approximately every hundred page loads on the server (this is rather random, the "every hundred" page loads is just an average). Also, the age of the session is inactive age, not total age. The timer will be reset for that session every time the user does a request.
