Will this safely delete my record?

I hate these three tables that. Two tables have a many to many relationship and as such it generates a third table. I'm using Linq-to-SQL and in the .dbml file I've dragged all the folder there to the graphic surface. Here is the method I'm using to delete an Area safely. Remember that documents are associated to an Area, so I can't just delete it and leave documents hanging. ScansDataContext db = new ScansDataContext(); /// /// Deletes an Area object from the database along with all associations in the database. /// /// Area object to save public void Delete(Area area) { db.DocumentAreaRelations.DeleteAllOnSubmit(area.DocumentAreaRelations); db.Areas.DeleteOnSubmit(area); db.SubmitChanges(System.Data.Linq.ConflictMode.FailOnFirstConflict); }
