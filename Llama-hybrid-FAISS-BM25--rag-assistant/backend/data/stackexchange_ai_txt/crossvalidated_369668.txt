The average is not a good summary of event times. Use a Kaplan-Meier (KM) over the study periods instead. It summarizes the whole distribution of events. Showing only completed events ensures more recent data does not display longer events (absolutely no context whatsoever, do events take longer than 3 months to do?). Methods for censored data should be applied if possible, again an argument for the KM. I don't think your interpretation "[there] appears to be a trend in event time reduction.". is correct. More shorter things, fewer longer things, are also possible interpretations. You can use non-parametric, semi-parametric, or parametric density estimation routines to estimate the distribution function of the event times over the study periods. If you can plot these, we can better advise forecasting and predicting.
