This is in the chapter on seasonal decomposition in Hyndman and Athana­sopou­los's textbook. Moving averages are used in seasonal decomposition to create an unbiased baseline. If we have a 5 period moving average, that moving average is symmetric because it includes the same amount of data before (2 periods) as after (2 periods). If we have an even order, say 4, there will be more on one side than another -- the average will reflect 2 periods before and 1 period after, which is biased (biased in favor of the before data).
