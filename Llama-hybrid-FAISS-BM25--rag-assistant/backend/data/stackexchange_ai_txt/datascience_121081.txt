Varying feature vector lengths for learning

[I am a total beginner in machine learning algorithms] I have 10 spectrograms (lines) for phytoplankton (each composed of 288 points). Each spectrogram is associated with a phytoplankton dendity data in the sample. Spectrogram array dimension = 10x288 Density array dimension = 1x10 Aim: To detect an anomalous spectrum, in an unsupervised way, given the spectra and the density data? Thanks
