why this naming convention for padding as "Same" and "Valid" in keras

I was going through CNN's and found that padding argument should be set to "Valid" if i need no padding and "Same" if i need padding. But, it doesn't make any sense to me. Why can't keras development team just put "Padding = True", is there a specific reason to choose this convention?
