I'm going to just answer about the difference between the two functions qcut and cut because it's a very important difference: the first qcut is indeed about quantiles, which means that it's about dividing the data into bins, each containing an equal number of points . For instance if you use deciles it means that there is the same number of people in the first decile as in the last (or any other), so the useful information is the range of values for each bin. For example if the first decile ranges from 0 to 500, then 10% of the people are paid less than 500. the second cut is not about quantiles, it simply creates bins which all cover an interval of values of equal length . For instance the first interval would be 0-500, the second 500-1000, etc. In this case the number of points in every bin is usually different, and that's the useful information. Typically this is how a histogram is built: equal intervals but possibly different frequency (number of data points) in every bin. [edit following OP's comments] Data points are reported salaries for each company role (actually, it is an average value reported ) Ok so the data that you have contains a distribution of the salaries for every role. The X axis, simply the id corresponding to each role It's not a very good idea to transform an ordinal/categorical variable into a continuous one, in a case like this you could instead plot a bar for every role (with the name of the role on the X axis). Even more precise, you could plot a boxplot for every role, keeping the order of the roles by mean salary. This way it would be possible to visualize not only the mean (usually replaced by median in a boxplot) but how much variations there are for each role. Another visualization idea would be to plot the full distribution of salaries with a difference color for every role. In this case X would usually be the salary, Y would be how many people are in this interval (bin) of salary, and stacked bars with different colors show the proportion by role. This would show not only the link between salary and role but also how many people are in each category. how to bin the distribution (qcut or cut) I suspect that this is the wrong question, because apparently you're not very familiar with these concepts and how to represent them. So I would suggest that you first play with the visualization ideas I mentioned: normally these don't require you to do any binning yourself, the library should take care of it (see examples in Python ). Knowing whether you need cut or qcut depends on what you want to do with the result. As I said above, quantiles are useful for solving questions such as "80% of the employees have a salary lower than X", whereas cut directly represents "X% of the employees have a salary between 100 and 150". Ultimately the two represent the same information, just under different perspectives. If the difference is still confusing, I'd suggest you start with regular bins with cut because quantiles are slightly more complex to interpret.
