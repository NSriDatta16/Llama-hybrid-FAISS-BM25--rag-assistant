How does GARCH compute the realized daily volatility to be compared to the output of the model, to compute in-sample MSE?

How do GARCH and GJR-GARCH models (as implemented in rugarch or in EViews) calculate the in-sample MSE if they use the time series of daily returns as the input and don't use a time series of daily variances: How do these models compute the realized volatility every day? Or are they using another measure of the actual volatility on day t that is then compared to the output of the model on day t?
