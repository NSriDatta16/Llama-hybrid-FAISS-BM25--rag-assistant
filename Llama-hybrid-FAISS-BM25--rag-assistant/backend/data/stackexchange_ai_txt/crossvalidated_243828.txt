How to do MC integration from gibbs sampling of posterior

I'm a beginner of MCMC. Two questions confused me. If I know the posterior distribution, and from the Gibbs sampling, I got the sampled parameter, so How to draw the histogram with y axis as marginal density in R ? How to further apply Monte Carlo integration on the resulting Markov Chain, which are sampled from this posterior. It seems I couldn't get a connection between these two. Could anyone give an example to explain this? Thank you
