You confusion comes from the fact that you are conflating the terms ' network ' and ' layer '. A neural network is always composed of layers, un input layer, and output layer, and possibly one or more hidden layers. If it has 2 or 3 layers (so at most one hidden layer), it is a shallow neural network , or simply a neural network . If it has more than 3 layers (so more than one hidden layer), then it is considered a deep neural network . (See here for why more than 3 is considered 'deep'). In either case, you are dealing with a single neural network . For some applications, you want to combine the results of multiple networks, for example when stacking neural nets or when resembling neural nets. In this case, the term single neural network is used to distinguish between one neural network vs. an ensemble or a stack of neural networks.
