If there are performance problems, then @DarkSquid's and @AlbertoPL's advice is right on. If not, though, perhaps your time would be better spent preparing the code for future modifications. Like analyzing test coverage, particularly unit-test coverage, like assessing cyclomatic complexity or simply looking at the classes with most reported bugs (or biggest classes, or some other simple metrics). Proactive analyses like these can make the maintenance easier when that time comes.
