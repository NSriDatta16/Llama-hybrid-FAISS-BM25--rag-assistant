I wouldn't necessarily combine the data for the two new websites as @BruceET suggests. There's some discussion under their response. CONFIDENCE INTERVALS I like @BruceET 's approach of looking at the confidence intervals for each proportion. It is easy and clear to present to an audience a plot of the proportion and confidence interval for each group. Looking at these, I would encourage your audience to not get too hung up about a magic cutoff value of p = 0.05, or perfectly non-overlapping confidence intervals. The proportions and confidence intervals suggest the newer websites are similar and perhaps better than the old site. LOGISTIC REGRESSION The way I would probably approach this problem is with logistic regression. This produces clear results, that will also be easy to present, but the analysis may be less familiar for your audience. The following example can be run in R. Lets start by calculating the non-paying counts Total = c(18789, 7842, 7570) Payment = c( 425, 205, 206) Nonpay = Total - Payment Nonpay ### [1] 18364 7637 7364 Install some required packages if(!require(car)){install.packages("car")} if(!require(emmeans)){install.packages("emmeans")} Input the data and run the logistic regression. The p value for the effect of Website is shown. It turns out it's just shy of meeting a 0.05 threshold. (And we still shouldn't get too hung up on the 0.05 threshold). Data = read.table(header=T, text=" Website Pay Weight Old Yes 425 Old No 18364 New1 Yes 205 New1 No 7637 New2 Yes 206 New2 No 7364 ") model= glm(Pay ~ Website, weights=Weight, data=Data, family=binomial(link="logit")) library(car) Anova(model, test="Wald") ### Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) ### ### Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) ### Website 2 5.9893 0.05006 If we wanted to compare pairwise among the individual websites, we could use estimated marginal means. If we translate these marginal means from the analysis back to their original, "response", scale, we will get estimates for the proportions and their confidence intervals. Note that in this case, everything is quite close to those given by @BruceET . library(emmeans) marginal = emmeans(model, ~ Website, type="response") marginal ### Website prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL ### New1 0.0261 0.00180 Inf 0.0228 0.0299 ### New2 0.0272 0.00187 Inf 0.0238 0.0311 ### Old 0.0226 0.00108 Inf 0.0206 0.0248 ### ### Confidence level used: 0.95 ### Intervals are back-transformed from the logit scale Now, pairwise comparisons among individual websites with a Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. pairs(marginal) ### contrast odds.ratio SE df z.ratio p.value ### New1 / New2 0.96 0.0960 Inf -0.413 0.9104 ### New1 / Old 1.16 0.0999 Inf 1.722 0.1969 ### New2 / Old 1.21 0.1040 Inf 2.204 0.0705 ### ### P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates ### Tests are performed on the log odds ratio scale If we wanted to look at these comparisons without the adjustment. pairs(marginal, adjust="none") ### contrast odds.ratio SE df z.ratio p.value ### New1 / New2 0.96 0.0960 Inf -0.413 0.6798 ### New1 / Old 1.16 0.0999 Inf 1.722 0.0850 ### New2 / Old 1.21 0.1040 Inf 2.204 0.0275 CHI-SQUARE TEST OF ASSOCIATION Another approach is to arrange the counts in a contingency and use a chi-square test of association. Here the p value is just less than 0.05, so quite close to the previous analysis. Input =(" Website Pay Nonpay Old 425 18364 New1 205 7637 New2 206 7364 ") Matrix = as.matrix(read.table(textConnection(Input), header=TRUE, row.names=1)) Test = chisq.test(Matrix) Test ### Pearson's Chi-squared test ### ### X-squared = 6.0033, df = 2, p-value = 0.0497 You might find some different different methods for post-hoc testing of chi-square test of association. Here, I'll suggest one approach: examining the standardized residuals. A standardized residual > 1.96 or p value of 0.05, and suggests that that cell is "interesting" relative to the expected values. Here, the cells in the Old row meet this criteria, suggesting that the cells in the Old row stand out "significantly" in the table.
