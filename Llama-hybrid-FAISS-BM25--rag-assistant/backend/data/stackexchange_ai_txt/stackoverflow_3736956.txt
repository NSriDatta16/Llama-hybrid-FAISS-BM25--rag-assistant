iPhone SDK: pushViewController crashing

I am having problems with getting a detail view to load using pushViewController. At first, I thought pushViewController was not working. BUT, then I tried using a different view controller and it worked. I can tell from tracing that the problem view controller is never loaded at all. In other words, I tried to eliminate the possibility that there was some error in the view controller by NSLoging in that object and I never see anything. Does anyone have any ideas? - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { /* NSLog(@"hsitkjsdfkljlkd"); if (childController == nil) childController = [[salesViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"salesView" bundle:nil]; //NSUInteger row = [indexPath row]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:childController animated:YES]; */ /* //modal = blocking salesViewController *otherVC = [[salesViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"salesView" bundle:nil]; //must set sale type otherVC.strSaleType = @"Voice"; [self presentModalViewController: otherVC animated:YES]; //No close. By design, it is up to the otherVC to close itself */ //tipCalcViewController *detailViewController = [[tipCalcViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"tipCalcView" bundle:nil]; salesViewController *detailViewController = [[salesViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"salesView" bundle:nil]; // ... // Pass the selected object to the new view controller. [self.navigationController pushViewController:detailViewController animated:YES]; [detailViewController release]; }
