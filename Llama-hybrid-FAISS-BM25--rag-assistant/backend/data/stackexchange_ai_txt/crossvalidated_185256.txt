Bayesian posterior marginal probabilities

I feel like this should be obvious, but I don't see the approach. This question comes from the philosophy of science, so I will pose it first in that context and then in a probability context. In the philosophy of science, often multiple hypotheses are needed to make a prediction. One hypothesis might be the hypothesis being investigated, while auxiliary hypotheses (such as how the instrument works, etc.) are also needed for a prediction to be made. Each hypothesis is either true or false, but these are unknown. Thus in the Bayesian sense, each hypothesis is assigned a belief $p(H_i)$. Assuming we have priors for each hypothesis, how should the belief in each hypothesis change if an observation (either confirmatory or disconfirmatory) is made? In probability terms suppose $p(A|H_1,H_2,H_3) = a$, $p(A)=b$, that $p(H_1)=h_1$, $p(H_2)=h_2$, and $p(H_3)=h_3$, and that each $H_i$ is independent, what should the probabilities $p(H_i|A)$ be? It is not clear to me that there's a unique answer; obviously answers have to be constrained such that $p(H_1,H_2,H_3|A) = ah_1h_2h_3/b$, but I don't see any further constraint. Am I missing something obvious here?
