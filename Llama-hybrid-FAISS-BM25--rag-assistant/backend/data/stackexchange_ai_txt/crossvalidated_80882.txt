Regarding the first question, you instead want to estimate a shrinkage factor that can be applied to your regression coefficients to arrive at your "final" model. Draw a bootstrap sample. Estimate your model (using your full modelling process, whatever this is) in this sample. In the original data, calcuate the linear prediction using the boostrap coefficients. In the original data, regress the outcome on the linear predictor you just calculated. Save the regression coefficent from this model. Repeat this process many times. Average all of the regression ceofficients from step 5. This is your shrinkage factor. Shink your "final" model in your original data using this value. Exactly how to do this will depend on what software you are using. See Harrell 1996 Also see Steyerberg 2001
