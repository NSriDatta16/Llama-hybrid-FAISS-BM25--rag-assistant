I'm not an expert in this area by any means, but I think you may want a Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling method such as the Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling algorithm. You can find some code samples online, and you might have to modify the code to do exactly what you want it to do. There's some good presentations on the topic, like this . Some software that might help you along are: JAGS OpenBUGS I don't know your familiarity with graph theory, so I'm not sure how difficult it would be for you to implement this. Hope this was helpful...
