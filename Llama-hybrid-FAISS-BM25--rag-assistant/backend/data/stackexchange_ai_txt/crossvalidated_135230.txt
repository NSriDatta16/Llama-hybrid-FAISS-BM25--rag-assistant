First, reg may not be the best option for regressing a time series, since they will tend to be autocorrelated. In Stata, you have quite a few options to deal with this, including prais , and arima . Try arima , arima lg L1.lg L2.lg L3.lg Make sure you have 12 rows at the end of your data with a blank lg , which you want to predict. Then look at predict arima , specifically the dyn option. You are wanting a dynamic prediction (where prior predictions are carried forward as lagged independent values) rather than a non-dynamic prediction where you specify the independent variables a priori. If you were using non-lagged independent variables, you'd obviously have to have values for them in the 12 rows.
