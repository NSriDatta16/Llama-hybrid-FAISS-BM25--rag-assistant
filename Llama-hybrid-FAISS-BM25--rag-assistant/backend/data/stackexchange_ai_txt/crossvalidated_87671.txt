Predictive model on categorical variable with high cardinality

So I have a categorical variable with ~ 8000 types (or levels, or cardinality). The dataset is rather large (a couple million records). Most machine learning techniques are failing do to memory limits on my computer, so I think an approach may be to run a loop and do individual regressions for each category step by step. Is there an easy way to do this in R? So for example, if the category was States in America, I would like 1 regression model for Virginia, 1 regression model for Texas, 1 regression model for Vermont, ect. Any other ideas for dealing with a very large categorical variable with a very large cardinality?
