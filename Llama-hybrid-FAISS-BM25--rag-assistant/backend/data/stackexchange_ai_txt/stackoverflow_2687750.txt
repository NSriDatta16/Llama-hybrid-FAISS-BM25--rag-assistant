Turn off "Just My Code" in Visual Studio's debugging options then you should see that there's more to the stack trace where the exception occurs. The line you referenced is raising an event which is being handled (probably by XtraGrid) for the purpose of updating the UI in response to changes in the bound objects. The line itself isn't throwing the exception. You will probably find a stack trace deep into the third party control. Hopefully DevExpress can help you resolve it. They're pretty good with support.
