probablistic output for binary SVM classification

I'm using libSVM for a binary classification problem. After a test instance is assigned a label (1 or -1), I also want to know how likely it is assigned such a label. I'm thinking about calculating the distance from the instance to the hyperplane in the feature space. The larger the distance is, the more likely the label assignment is correct. Is my idea correct? Or is there already such an option in libSVM for my purpose?
