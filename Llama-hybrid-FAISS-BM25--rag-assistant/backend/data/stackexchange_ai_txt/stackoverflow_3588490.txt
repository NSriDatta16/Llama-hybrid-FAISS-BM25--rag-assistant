VS2010 WPF - Can I create a menu with menu items just via the UI (not editing XAML?)

Just trying to drag my first Menu control onto a WPF application in VS2010. Is there a way to (via the VS2010 UI) setup the menu items etc? Or does one have to jump into the XAML to do this? Also it seems like the Menu control, after I drag it onto the window, exists at the top of the Window. However I was expecting it to be rendered as a typical Windows menu where it's right at the top associated with the window itself (not the window contents), if that makes sense. Does the VS2010 "menu" item from the toolbox give you the "traditional" windows application menu?
