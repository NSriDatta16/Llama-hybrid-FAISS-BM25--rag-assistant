Well, I guess I was too quick to post a question because I just found the phrase I was looking for: fuzzy classification . Apparently what I have are "mixed pixels" because they belong to two or more categories, and there are many papers about how to use artificial neural networks and support vector machines to classify these pixels effectively. There's also a really good overview of the topic in general in this paper . I did not seen much on using random forest for fuzzy classification. (Question not deleted in the hopes that others may find this useful in their searches)
