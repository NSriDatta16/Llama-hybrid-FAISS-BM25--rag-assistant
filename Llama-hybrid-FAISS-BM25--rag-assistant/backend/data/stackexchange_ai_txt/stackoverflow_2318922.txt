I would say that using SQL Server is the wrong tool for the job (search-wise) as it can't natively parse through the text stored in a binary document. I suggest looking in to something like Lucene.NET (the .NET port of the Lucene Search Engine...originally written in Java) which will allow you to easily search through your documents after they've been uploaded. You should be able to architect a solution that allows you to retain your document storage in SQL Server but use Lucene.NET to index and search the documents that you have stored there.
