Granger causality tests if a time series can be better predicted with the additional information from another time series compared to only the time series itself. The problem is that under certain conditions the test does not work, for example if the time series are integrated. Case 1: Time series are not integrated (easy case) The time series above do not look integrated to me, but be sure to carry out the tests for integration (KPSS, ADF, ...). If they are not integrated, and there is no structural break you can just carry out the standard Granger-causality test. For example you could use the vars package for that. So, set up are VAR model first and then use the causality() function. Case 2: At least one time series is integrated (more difficult): In this case you could use the Toda-Yamamoto procedure. Another (more demanding) method is the vector error correction model (VECM). HTH
