Google App Engine and EC2 are competitors. They do the same thing, although GAE provides an environment for your app to run in with strict language restrictions, while EC2 provides you a virtual machine ( think VMWare ) on which to host your application. S3 on the other hand is a raw storage api. You can use a SOAP or REST api to access it. If you want to stick with GAE, you can simply use the Amazon S3 Python Library to make REST calls from Python to S3. You will, of course, have to pay for usage on S3. Its amazing how granular their billing is. When getting started I was literally charged 4 cents one month.
