Logistic regression for a continuous dependent variable

I am trying to model a response variable, the weight of a variable (can't be thought of a binomial distribution as it involves no success/failures), that falls between 0 and 1. That is, the response variable always has to lie between 0 and 1. Here are my alternatives: Do a logit transformation of the response variable and fit a linear regression: $${\rm logit}(Y) \sim β_0 + β_1X_1 + \ldots$$ GLM with a logit link function What is the difference between the two approaches? In this case, the predictive accuracy of the model is more important than the interpretability of the variables.
