As design patterns are language agnostic, I would recommend reading one of the classic books on the subject. My favourites are: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler ( http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420 ) Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by the "Gang of Four" ( http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229278937&sr=1-1 ). This is a bit of a classic. However, these aren't beginner books by any means and you might get more value out of some of the many web resources and tutorials out there (Wikipedia has some reasonable explanations). My own experience is that the object model in javascript is a bit trickier to understand than others such as PHP or Ruby and hence, applying design patterns isn't always that easy. Libraries such as Prototype provide functions for making inheritance easier to work with and this makes programming Javascript in an OO way much easier. I recently used Javascript to implement the Active Record pattern using Prototype, which you can read about more about here if you want: http://codeinthehole.com/archives/6-Active-record-javascript-objects-using-cookies.html
