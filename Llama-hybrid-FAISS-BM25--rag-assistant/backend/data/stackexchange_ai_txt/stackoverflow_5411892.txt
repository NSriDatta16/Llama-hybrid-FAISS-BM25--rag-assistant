Is it necessary to hash passwords before sending them over HTTPS?

I'm new to both Web development (started this January) and Web security (started less than a week ago!), so please excuse me if my question is grossly uneducated, misinformed or plain simple stupid. The company I work for's main product is a good old-fashioned client/server system. To make it more appealing to our customers, I've been given the task of developing a bunch of simple-task-centric Web applications that complement the system's whole-business-process-centric design. For example, if an user's role in the organization consists in approving purchase orders and payment orders, they might find it easier to use the WebApprovals application than opening both the Purchases and Treasury modules, and using them to approve purchase orders and payment orders, respectively. Needless to say, all my Web applications have a login page. And, of course, I need them to be secure. For that reason, by design, these Web applications can only be used over HTTPS, never over plain HTTP. Now, I would like to know how secure it is to send passwords over HTTPS without any further security measures. Is it secure enough? What do people with experience in the security field have to say?
