feature weights in structured support vector machine

I like to find the weight vector for input-space features in a structured SVM . The idea is to identify the most important set of input-space features (based on the magnitude of their corresponding weights). I know that in a binary SVM the weight vector can be written as a linear combination of examples , and the magnitude of those weights represents how much they were effective for the prediction problem at hand. But how do you compute the same for an SSVM?
