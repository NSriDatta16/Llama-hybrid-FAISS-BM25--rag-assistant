Mapping a byte[] that can grow up to 400KB on MySql

I have the following: @Entity public class ExamplePhoto { ... @Column(nullable= false) private byte[] photo; ... } I am using Hibernate and a MySql database. I tried putting a mediumblob but got a "tinyblob expected error" message. Given the fact that the photo could be of up to 400KB the tinyblob won't do the job. How can I map this field? Is this the most elegant way of handling images? Thanks in advance!
