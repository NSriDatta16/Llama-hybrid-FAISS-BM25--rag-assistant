scrollbar action in java

I'm a beginner in Java. I have a text area and I have set only the vertical scrollbar to that text area. I'm appending data for every 1 minute to the text area. The problem is when new data appends to the text area the scrollbar will move up. To see the new data, every time I have to drag the scroll bar, but that is not the requirement. The scrollbar should not move up but should move down. How can I do this?
