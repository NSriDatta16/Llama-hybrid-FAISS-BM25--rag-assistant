How can I interpret variables in a bunch in machine learning?

I have 15 variables and 1 output and I have fitted a Random Forest Model. And then connected it to a SHAP intepretation framework. But, I want to find out the combined effect of three bunches of variables B1 - x1, x2 B2 - x3, x4, x5, x6 B3 - x7,..., x15 Variables in B1, B2, B3 have some physical connections with each other. So, I want to get to a point where I can comment that B1 can explain 30% of the model, B2 can explain 20% of the model etc. Any suggestions on how to proceed with this?
