Attachment_fu: how can I selectively prevent thumbnail creation?

I'm happily using attachment_fu to handle file uploads and thumbnail creation. However, for some (but not all!) cases I would like to suppress the creation of thumbnails. How would I hack attachment_fu to do this? Specifics: I have a traditional attachment_fu model class Pic :image, :storage => :s3, :resize_to => '200x600>', :thumbnails => { :thumb48 => [48,48], :thumb32 => [32,32], :thumb22 => [22,22] } validates_as_attachment end The user specifies the file to be uploaded in a form using a file input, and submits the form to an action where the pic is created using @pic = Pic.new(params[:pic]) In certain cases I'd like to be able to do something like @pic = Pic.new(params[:pic], {:generate_thumbnails => false}) and prevent the thumbnails from being generated.
