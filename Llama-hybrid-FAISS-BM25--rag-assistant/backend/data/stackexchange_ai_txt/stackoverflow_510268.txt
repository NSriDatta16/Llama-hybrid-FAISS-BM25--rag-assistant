Best strategy to style the same HTML when it appears on multiple pages

I have a simple HTML table with 2 columns containing text fields and headers for 'Name', 'Comments' and 'Email'. I'm looking for the best strategy on styling this HTML fragment if it were to appear on multiple pages - requiring different dimensions on each page. I've been reading a lot about CSS recently but havent stumbled across enough information yet that really makes me comfortable to know the best way to design such .css. For instance I might show the comments form at 50% width on the 'comments' page, but only at 20% in a sidebar in some additional places on the site. I am mainly concerned about styling the widths of the boxes - but of course the same approach applies for the text. For instance the name field should not be as wide as the email field. I'm thinking fixed widths are better than percentages. There are obviously many ways to style it. Assume I have 1 master css file already. 1) Put percentage widths on the input tags and then the outer div would be 100% width for whatever panel it is contained in. This requires no page specific css but I don't like the idea of percentages inside the td tags, plus I cant change the height easily of the textarea . 2) create styles for #Name, #Comments and #Email in each individual page as additional styles in * 3) style based on #Name, #Comments and #Email in a page specific css file. Are page specific files good or bad? I'm not even sure I like styling based on the ids here because they're dynamically generated and if for some reason they needed to change I'd have to update the css everywhere. 4) style based on #Name, #Comments and #Email but qualify them with a descendent selector specific to each page. So i'd have .faqPage #Name for when this appears on the FAQ page. Obviously these go in my master css file. 5) create class names for 'emailField , nameField and commentsField` [options 2,3,4 are repeated for this option] 6) create class names for 'shortField , fullWidthField and textInputField` [options 2,3,4 are repeated for this option] 7) you get the idea :) 8) something else I'm just a little overwhelmed with all the options. How do I go about deciding which is the best way? A specific goal is to be able to style the same HTML on multiple pages (obviously thats what css is all about though - but it does affect which options I can use). Name: Email: Questions: PS. The actual field names more specific such as CommentsName - its just easier to put Name here for readability.
