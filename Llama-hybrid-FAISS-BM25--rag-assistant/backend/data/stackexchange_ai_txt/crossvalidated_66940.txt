Top-coded survey data (Income)

Top-coded income data are often modeled with a Pareto distribution, but that is controversial. What would be wrong with declaring those values as missing and then using multiple imputation (MI) to generate values for those cases using a normal model while assigning a lower bound as is allowed in IVEware (as long as the number of missing cases is small, say IVEware uses sequential regression multiple regression imputation. From p.2 in the article below the algorithm is: The basic strategy creates imputations through a sequence of multiple regressions, varying the type of regression model by the type of variable being imputed. Covariates include all other variables observed or imputed for that individual. The imputations are defined as draws from the posterior predictive distribution specified by the regression model with a flat or noninformative prior distribution for the parameters in the regression model. The sequence of imputing missing values can be continued in a cyclical manner, each time overwriting previously drawn values, building interdependence among imputed values and exploiting the correlational structure among covariates. To generate multiple imputations, the same procedure can be applied with different random starting seeds or taking every P th imputed set of values in the cycles mentioned above. From p. 3 the conditional regressions are based on: Each conditional regression is based on one of the following models: A normal linear regression model on a suitable scale (for example, a BoxCox power transformation may be used to achieve normality) if Y j is continuous余 A logistic regression model if Y j is binary余 A polytomous or generalized logit regression model if Y j categorical余 A Poisson loglinear model if Y j is a count variable余 and A twostage model where zeronon zero status is imputed using logistic regression, and conditional on nonzero status, a normal linear regression model is used to impute nonzero values, if Y j is mixed.
