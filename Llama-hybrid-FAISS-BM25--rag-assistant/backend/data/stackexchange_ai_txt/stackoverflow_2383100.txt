Delphi project testing via TestComplete 7 on FinalBuilder

We've been using FinalBuilder as a continuous integration server for our Delphi project. Currently, we have our builds automatically triggered from subversion check-ins, dUnit tests run after the unit test executable is built and AQtime generating test coverage statistics while the unit test executable is run. Our next goal is to get our regression suite (developed in TestComplete 7) running as a nightly process. We have tried both a vbs script to start TestComplete via COM and the TestComplete task that comes with FinalBuilder itself. Both methods start TestComplete, and the application successfully when running the FinalBuilder project interactively. But when we submit the job to the FinalBuilder server, the TestComplete script crashes because TestComplete doesn't appear to be able to read the application screens. We thought this might be resolved by allowing each of the services (TestComplete and FinalBuilder) to interact with the desktop, but that didn't work. Has anybody been able to get a TestComplete 7 project to work correctly in FinalBuilder?
