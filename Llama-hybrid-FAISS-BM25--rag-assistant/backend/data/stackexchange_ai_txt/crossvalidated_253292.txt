Can a Recurrent Neural Network degenerate to a Feed-Forward Neural network?

Suppose I have a task X which is perfectly solvable by a Feed-Forward Neural Network. When I apply a Recurrent Neural Network to the same problem, may it "loose" it's internal loop-/backward-links (setting them to 0-weight during learning), basically becoming a Feed-Forward Neural Network? Is a Recurrent Neural Network with very few or very low-weighted backward-links an indicator, that a Feed-Forward Network might solve the problem just as well, with fewer links to compute (no backward-links need to be considered)?
