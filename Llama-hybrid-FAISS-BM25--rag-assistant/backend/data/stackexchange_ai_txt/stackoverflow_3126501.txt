The only problem I can see is an extra comma at the end of the gallery options: var myGallery = new gallery($('myGallery'), { ... showInfopane: false, At least Firefox and Chrome ignore the trailing comma, but it's a syntax error in Internet Explorer. After I fixed that, your code worked fine for me in Chrome, Firefox, and IE. Like Anurag mentioned in the comments, you are including MooTools twice. It didn't cause any problems for me, but you can remove the scripts/mootools.js script, and it should still work.
