Go with what interests you the most. The HCI stuff will be much easier to pick up later as needed, you'll likely never get another chance to learn about neural networks! For prospective employers (at least the good ones!) you need to show a passion and excitement about what you do. I'd sooner hire someone who can enthusiastically talk about neural networks than someone who has an extra credit in HCI.
