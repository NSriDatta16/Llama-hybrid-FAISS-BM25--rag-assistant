Recently, I see a paper in arXiv Neural Architecture Search with Bayesian Optimisation and Optimal Transport . The author use it to explore DNN and CNN by creating a pseudo-metric space consist of neural network by Optimal transport. I don't think it exactly answer your question, but it maybe helpful for you to design a space/heuristic to trade off between optimizing number of layers or nodes in each layer.
