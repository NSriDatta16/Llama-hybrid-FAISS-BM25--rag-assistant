Pure JavaScript equivalent of jQuery click()?

I am building a small app which captures mouse clicks. I wrote the prototype in jQuery but, since it is a small app focusing on speed, embedding jQuery to use just one function would be an overkill. I tried to adapt this example from JavaScriptKit : document.getElementById("alphanumeric").onkeypress=function(e){ //blah..blah..blah.. } but it didn't work when I tried this: document.getElementsByTagName("x").onclick What am I doing wrong?
