I've seen a demo of an HTML/CSS editor for Mac, using CSS selectors to generate HTML markup. Don't remember the name of the program, but it seems a very elegant and efficient way to write HTML. To give you an idea of how it works, lets say you write this in the editor: ul#navigation li a.active And press some magic shortcut key (or just Enter ) to transform it to this: To me, this seems like a logical use for CSS. Using it for metadata, as you described, could be useful if you want to have it separated. In your example however, the two are very close related. And setting the default values and conditions in the XML just makes sense (just like the param tag is).
