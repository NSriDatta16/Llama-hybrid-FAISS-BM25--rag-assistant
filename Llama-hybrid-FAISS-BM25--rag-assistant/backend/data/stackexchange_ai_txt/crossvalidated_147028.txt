You don't need cluster analysis to aggregate per country... Just select all data for that country, and average! Your data is an edge-weighted graph, with the nodes being the countries. You can likely find some clustering algorithms to run on this, but I don't expect it to yield much insights. They will mostly ignore the edge weights, which is usually a distance, but your data isn't.
