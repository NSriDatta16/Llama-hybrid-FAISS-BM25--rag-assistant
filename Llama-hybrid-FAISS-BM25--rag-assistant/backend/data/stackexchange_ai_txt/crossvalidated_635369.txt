In my case, I have managed to succesfully implement forecasting systems like the one you are describing (with a rolling window approach) in environments with considerably seasonal multivariate time series (you can check the results I obtained here https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10205609 ). ARIMA and SARIMAX might require more manual re-estimation when data patterns change significantly.
