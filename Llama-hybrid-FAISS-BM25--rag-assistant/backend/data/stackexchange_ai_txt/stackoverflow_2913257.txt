Why Controller doesn't recognize a public method which (yet) appears in the intellisense?

I'm using an helper class that I called CreateEditOrganizationService where I put all the helper methods. In my controller, I've createService as object of that class. So far, I've got 5 methods. Now, I've just defined a 6th method called Set_TypeOrganization . I'm getting the Set_TypeOrganization in the intellisense, but after I've chose it, I get the following error: CreateEditOrganizationService does not contain a definition for Set_TypeOrganization are you missing a directive or a reference? public List Set_TypeOrganization(string choice) { //Definition goes here... } and in my Controller CreateEditOrganizationService createService = new CreateEditOrganizationService(); //... ViewData["TypeOrganizations"] = createService.Set_TypeOrganization(choice); Unfortunately, VS shows me the error? Yet, the method appear in the intellisense when I type a dot after the createService object. Thannks for helping
