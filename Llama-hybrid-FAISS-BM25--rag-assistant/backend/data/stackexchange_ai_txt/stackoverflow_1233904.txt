How do I Attach or update a timestamp querystring parameter

I want to attach a timestamp to my querystring in order to ensure that the browser bypasses its cache when I refresh the page via javascript. I need to account for an existing querystring (which might already have a timestamp parameter in it) and for the hash tag ( http://www.example.com/?ts=123456#example ). I have written my own implementation but I suspect that its unnecessarily complicated. Is there a quick-and-easy or at least elegant way of accomplishing this?
