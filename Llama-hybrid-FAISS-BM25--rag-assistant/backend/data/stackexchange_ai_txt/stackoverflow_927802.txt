Here is how I try to reduce the pain of dealing with IE: Use a reset.css - Yahoo! YUI Reset or Eric Meyer's Reset CSS Be careful with floats, clears - they typically cause a lot of cursing. Be aware of hasLayout bugs in IE, typically adding a zoom: 1 or height attributes helps fix this. Read On Having Layout . Get the layout working in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc while keeping IE about 80% of the way there. Implement a IE6.css style and an IE7.css style if needed using conditional comments. Beer, Liquor or other adult beverages.
