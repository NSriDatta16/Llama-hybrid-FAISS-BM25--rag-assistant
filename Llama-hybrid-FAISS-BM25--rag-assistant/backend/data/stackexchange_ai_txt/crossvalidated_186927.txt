Google released sofia-ml , which allows for pairwise stochastic gradient descent SVMs, and it has been implemented in R ( RSofia ). SGD SVM should be very fast in most cases, as you can see in some of the references, such as Large Scale Learning to Rank , with improvements being on the order of many magnitudes. Note that RSofia is not as full-featured as many of the other available SVM packages, so you'll have to do things like centering and scaling on your own.
