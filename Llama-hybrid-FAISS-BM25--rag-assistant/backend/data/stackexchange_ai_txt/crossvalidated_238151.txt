Survival analysis with percentage data

I have 45 coral colonies undergoing three different treatments (n = 15) and surveyed their average survival after 1,2 and 3 months. I believe I cannot use Kaplan-Meier, as I do not know the exact time of death. In addition, mortality was low and usually only partially (e.g. 20% of a colony). The survival data look something like: Colony1: 100% (month0) - 99% (month1) - 97% (month2) - 97% (month3); Colony2: 100% (month0) - 96% (month1) - 96% (month2) - 94% (month3); ...etc Is there any survival analysis I can apply to such data, to distinguish survival between the three treatments. Or should I just try to analyse it with a repeated ANOVA?
