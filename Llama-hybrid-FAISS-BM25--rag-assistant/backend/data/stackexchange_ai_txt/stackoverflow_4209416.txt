How to deal with dynamic lists of data in a layout

I want to display contact information in a custom layout. My app lets the user select a contact, then I retrieve key pieces of info on that contact (phone #'s, email addy's, etc). I want to display them to the user so they look grouped logically. Sort of like a series of tables, so phone numbers, then email addys, then organization, etc. I have a table format that I've been using in a different part of the app where I know the exact number of rows I'm adding and I have defined styles for the rows already. I want to reuse those styles for this data, but android sdk won't allow for you to set the style attribute programmatically. I could create the tables in code and set all the attributes the same as in my defined styles, but it seems like a lot of extra coding. Any ideas on how I should approach this problem?
