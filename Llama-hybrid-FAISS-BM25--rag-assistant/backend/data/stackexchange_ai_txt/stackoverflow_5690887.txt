If you want to do it right (i.e. back button support) then you'll want to trap the hashchange event and act on that, this event is fired by modern browsers when the URL fragment changes. However, not all browsers support hashchange so you'd have to work around that. You're better off using a pre-built solution such as: Ben Alman's hashchange plugin . Sammy.js jQuery BBQ The basic hashchange plugin is probably your best bet unless you're building a JavaScript application with complicated routing and argument handling. You could look at location.hash all the time too. But, then you'd have to find the corresponding link and simulate a click on it to get the browser to behave. Once you start doing that sort of thing you're probably better off with one of the above plugins/frameworks and some sort of formal routing system.
