Can the Predictors be Count Variable for Logistic Regression?

I have a general question regarding logistic regression. May I know if the predictors of logistic regression (mixed effect with random variables) could be count variables (e.g., 6,10,20,21)? I understand that for logistic regression the outcome variable needs to be binary. However, my experiment explores the relationship between the number of times readers read a word to the chance of acquiring it (1 for learned, 0 for unlearned). May I know if I could still use logistic regression in such a case? If I can not, may I know what mixed-effect regression model I could use?
