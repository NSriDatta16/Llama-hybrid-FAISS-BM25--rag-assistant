I think the main problem with your question is that you ask for one thing, but I detect a different question lurking in the shadows. First, and foremost, addressable entities in the memory of a computer is organized as bytes, which are 8 bits each, so yes, each address can be said to refer to 8 bits, or a byte. However, you can easily group more bytes together to form bigger and more complex data structures. If your question is really "Why am I seeing an 8-digit value as the contents at an address in my stack dump", then the reason for that is that it dumps 32-bit (4 bytes) values. In other words, you can take the address, the address+1, the address+2, and the address+3, grab the bytes from each of those, and combine to a 32-bit value. Is that really your question?
