In my opinions, your issues are only the matter of how we will organize data structure. So let's have a look at each issue: 1. Write all the comments added to a separate XML file (AnimalComments.xml) where I can store all the comments that have been added for all the sub-entries I propose that in the animals.xml file you add an unique ID field for each animal , and in the animals file we use the ID as the foreign key to reference comments back to animals. For instance, we have a birds.xml like that Jack Sparrow Black Hawk Then the animalcomments.xml file should be like that: Hello world Hello world 2 Hello world Hello world 2 So you can generate the code based on that data structure, reading and writing to each element of the animalcomments.xml file. 2. In case of an application failure, I would like this same XML file(AnimalComments.xml) to pre-populate all the comments that I entered before my application crashed. In your HandleUnhandledException() method, saving all your comments before terminating the program. Once the program is reloaded, you can get all your comments back. Hope this help.
