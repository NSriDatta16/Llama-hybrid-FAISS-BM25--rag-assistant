Supervised learning model for extracting terror attack motives from attack summary (NLP)

I have a terror attack (tabular) data set. Each row is one attack and there are columns like: Date of the attack (daily resolution) Location of the attack (long/lat, as well as city/country) Number of casualties Attack/weapon type A few boolean columns like whether it was a suicide attack Furthermore, I have a text column that holds a 2-3 sentence description of the attack. This is the main column I want to use for training/predicting. There are several target columns of the form "is_left_wing", "is_right_wing", etc. The values are 0, 1, and -1. Here 0 means the attack didn't have the respective motive, 1 means it had the motive and -1 means it is unknown. In short, my goal is to build a model that is trained on the 0 and 1 values in the target columns and makes predictions about the -1s. The main thing I'm stuck on is how to extract features from the text column with the attack description. I have limited NLP experience and I want to use something more sophisticated than a simple bag of words model. I would appreciate suggestions about the general approach to this problem (also some good readings on the topic).
