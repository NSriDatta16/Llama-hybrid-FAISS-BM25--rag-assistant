The JSS paper for this package specifies: If not defined, default priors are used which are not proper and this can lead to both inferential and numerical problems. you can access the paper here: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i02 Note that default isn't the same thing as an uninformative prior but is indicative of the challenges that arise if you use an improper prior which is what I'd guess the uninformative prior you refer to would be. This is a general statement but is true with regards to mixed models, if you do not use proper priors you must be very careful otherwise you can end up with posteriors which are not valid densities b/c the integral does not converge. In particular, linear mixed models with uniform mean and variance priors (uninformative) can exhibit this behavior, so I'd guess that mixed model glm's would as well. The challenging thing for a practitioner here is that you likely wouldn't notice from a simple visual plot in your MCMC output. From a practical perspective you could compare a meaningful metric for your problem domain using the default prior setting and using difference mean/variance choices for normal priors and see if the choice matters in practice. The exercise I'd advocate is a bit like a sensitivity analysis on the prior specification.
