Natural Resource Management: How do I estimate the odds ratio and confidence intervals from model-averaged estimates?

I'm currently working on a model selection analysis in the field of natural resource management. My research question is: what variables are important to an avian species nest site selection. My variables include: vegetation metrics collected at the nest site and landscape metrics (e.g., % mature pine) collected at larger spatial scales. My sample size is 72 nests (used) and 72 random locations where I extracted the same habitat variables. I then built 18 models in R using the GLM procedure and a logistic regression framework. I then used the information-theoretic approach (Burnham and Anderson 2002) and Akaike's Information Criteria adjusted for small sample size (AICc) to compare models. The model with the lowest AICc was considered to be the best model, and all models with AICc How do you calculate the odds ratio and confidence intervals given that these estimates were derived from model-averaging and the typical code exp(cbind(OR = coef(results), confint(results)) will not work because this code relies on a model whereas the estimates above were derived from 4 different models.
