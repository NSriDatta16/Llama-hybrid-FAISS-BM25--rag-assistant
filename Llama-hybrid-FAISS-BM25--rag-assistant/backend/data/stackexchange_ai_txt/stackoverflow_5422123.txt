Adjusting a VB Script to Programmatically Create a Folder triggered by an E-mail

This is my first time asking a question to y'all. I'm a SQL Developer by trade, and am very green when it comes to VB. I manage a on-line database for my department, Quickbase, and with this website we manage report requisitions. I create a ticket for each one, and that ticket creates an e-mail notifying the dev. responsible for that assignment. We have folders set up for each request that comes in, and it is very laborious and frustrating to manually create said folders. So I asked and looked around, coming across a script that was able to do what I needed, or so I am told. However, I'm not sure how to customize it to my needs, nor implement it correctly. This is where I need your assistance, fair programming gods of SO, please help me slay this dragon, and all the riches of the realm will be yours*! Outlook VBA Sub MakeFile(MyMail As MailItem) myMailEntryID = MyMail.EntryID Set outlookNameSpace = Application.GetNamespace(“MAPI”) Set outlookMail = outlookNameSpace.GetItemFromID(myMailEntryID) MyArgument = OutlookMail.Subject Dim sMyCommand = “c:\makefile.bet ” & MyArgument Shell “cmd /c ” & sMyCommand, vbHide End Sub Makefile.bat @echo off cls mkdir %1 The webtsite URL is: www.quickbase.com The root folder path: h:///ntsp/data/reports - criteria/quickbase docs/[Folder to be created] *Riches are not monetary, but the feeling of goodness, and completeness only gained by helping a fellow nerd out, oh and it makes the e-peen grow might and strong!
