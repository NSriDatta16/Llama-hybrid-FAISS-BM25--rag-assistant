I had a similar issue with IE and it caching AJAX requests. (Why, God, why would you cache an AJAX request?) Worked fine in everything else, but IE required coercing via HTTP headers to not cache the AJAX request. I've long forgotten the URL, but see: http://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2006/03/an-ie-ajax-gotcha-page-caching/ Also, the HTTP headers that did it for me were: Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0 ...which I quite honestly gleaned off a website somewhere.
