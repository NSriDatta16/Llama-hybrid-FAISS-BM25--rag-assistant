I am adding to some good answers here that I gave upvotes to. I think there is a little more that should be said to completely clear up the conclusion. I like the terms accurate and correct as Efron defines them. I gave a lengthy discussion on this very recently on a different question. The moderator whuber really liked that answer. I will not go to the same length to repeat that here. However, to Efron accuracy relates to the confidence level and correctness of the width or tightness of the interval. But you can't talk about tightness without considering accuracy first. Some confidence intervals are exact; those are accurate because they have the actual coverage that they advertise. A 95% confidence interval can also be approximate because it uses an asymptotic distribution. Approximate intervals based on asymptotics are for a finite sample size $n$ not going to have the advertised coverage, which is the coverage you would get if the asymptotic distribution were the exact distribution. So an approximate interval could undercover (i.e. advertise 95% when its actual coverage is only 91%) or in the rare but less serious case overcover (i.e. advertised coverage is 95% but actual in 98%). In the former case, we worry about how close the actual coverage is to the advertised coverage). A measure of closeness is the order of accuracy which could be say $1/\sqrt{n}$ or $1/n$ . If the actual confidence level is close, we call it accurate. Accuracy is important with bootstrap confidence intervals which are never exact but some variants are more accurate than others. This definition of accuracy may be different to the one the OP is referring to but it should be clear now what Efron's definition is and why it is important to be accurate. Now if you have two methods that are exact, we can prefer one over the other if for any confidence level it has the smaller expected width. A confidence interval that is best in this sense (sometimes called the shortest) would be the one to choose. But this required exactness. If the confidence level is only approximate we could be comparing apples and oranges. One could be narrower than another only because it is less accurate and hence has a lower actual coverage than its advertised coverage. If two confidence intervals are both very accurate or one is exact and the other very accurate comparing expected width may be okay because at least now we are looking at just two varieties of apples.
