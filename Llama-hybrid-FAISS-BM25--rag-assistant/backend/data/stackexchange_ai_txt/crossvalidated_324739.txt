If your data are independent with the same mean and different variances then you can write $X_t = \mu + b_t \epsilon_t$ and \begin{align*} Y_t &= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{k=0}^{11} X_{t+k}\\ &= \frac{1}{12}\sum_{k=0}^{11} \mu + b_{t+k} \epsilon_{t+k} \\ &= \mu + \sum_{k=0}^{11} \theta_k \epsilon_{t+k} \end{align*} where $\theta_k = b_{t+k}/12$. If your data was from a causal linear process to begin with, then you can write your $X_t$ as a moving average process (who knows what the order is, though), and your $Y_t$ will always be a moving average process. However, it will not necessarily be of order 12. If you start with a linear process, and you filter it (which is what you're doing), you will always have a linear process as a result. Edit To answer your new question, I will assume your data are iid and I will shift the time index for $Y$ forward, which means $$ Y_t = \mu + \theta\epsilon_t + \sum_{i=1}^{11} \theta\epsilon_{t-i} = \mu + W_t + \sum_{i=1}^{11} W_{t-i}, $$ which is a non-invertible MA(11) process. \begin{align*} \gamma_Y(h) &= \text{Cov}(Y_{t+h},Y_t)\\ &= \text{Cov}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{11} W_{t+h-i} ,\sum_{j=0}^{11} W_{t-j}\right)\\ &= \sum_{i=0}^{11}\sum_{j=0}^{11}\gamma_W(j+h-i)\\ &= \theta^2(12-|h|) \end{align*} which means $\rho_Y(h) = (12-|h|)/12$.
