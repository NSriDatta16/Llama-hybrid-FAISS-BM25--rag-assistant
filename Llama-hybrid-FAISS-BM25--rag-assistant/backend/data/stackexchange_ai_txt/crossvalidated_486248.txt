How to simulate feature changes in machine learning

Situation I trained a machine learning model to predict whether a person will pay back their loan or not. There are about 150 features and 35,000 people in the dataset. Each person represents one row. Goal Now, I want to give personal recommendations to a person in the dataset, so that this person has a smaller risk of loan default. Out of the 150 features, 10 are influenceable in the short-term by the person. For example, a short-term influenceable feature is "$ spent on clothes per year". So I could take the row from the dataset for this person, enter a different value for this feature, and see how the probability of loan default changes. Issues One, correlation versus causation could be an issue. Two, if my model is a tree-based one, there might be hard cuts in the decision function. For example, the probability of default might be 20% for that person, but if I change the feature from $1000 to 1001 spent on clothes per year, the probability of default might jump to 60%, which is obviously not realistic. Question Is this something that has been done in research before? I could not find any papers that apply this methodology. If yes, how should I handle the issues mentioned above?
