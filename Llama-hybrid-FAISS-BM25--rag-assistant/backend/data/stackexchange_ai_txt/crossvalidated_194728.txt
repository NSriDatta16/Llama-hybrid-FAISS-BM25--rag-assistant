Support Vector Machine: Output simulation from mathematical equations

If I have trained SVM model using the RBF kernel, how do i simulate the SVM output using the trained model and mathematical equations? How do I transform the test data? I am trying to write a code for transforming the test data so that i can apply the trained SVM model on it.
