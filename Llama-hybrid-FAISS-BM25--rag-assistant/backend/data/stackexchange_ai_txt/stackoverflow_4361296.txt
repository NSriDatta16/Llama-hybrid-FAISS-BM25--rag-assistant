TabNavigation on window elements in WPF

In my WPF 4.0 desktop-based application, I want to add an ability to traverse through window elements by pressing Tab-button. Here is fragment of my XAML: What exactly do I need? I want to open this window and by pressing first time on Tab keyboard to set focus on Hyperlink block (with Image and TextBlock ) with TabIndex="0" and by second Tab pressing to switch focus on element with TabIndex="1" , also I want to cycle this switches. In other words, I want that user could navigate through elements in my window by Tab keyboard as we are regular to do this in any other normal WinForms application. What actually have I right now? When I press on Tab keyboard Hyperlinks don't get focus and I can't work with my window without the mouse. Please, let me know, what am I doing wrong?
