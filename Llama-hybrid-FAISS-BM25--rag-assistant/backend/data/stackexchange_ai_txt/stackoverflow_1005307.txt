Adobe Air Questions/Resources

I recently became quite interested in developing an adobe air application, and just had a few questions that maybe some more experienced air developers could answer. Firstly, what is the average time-frame required for an air project. Mainly I'm planning a somewhat ambitious project of porting a specific forum framework over to an air app. How long would you estimate this would take me to do personally? I want something more than just the standard browser inside an app, more along the lines of built in controls/features for all the standard functionality. Secondly, can apps be done completely with javascript/html/xml? I'm quite proficient with these 3 technologies, but have no real experience with flex/flash. This includes making the chrome as well. Do specific features require specific languages to be involved? Finally, any good books/articles you would recommend? Preferably more advanced books/resources that lay the groundwork for making professional quality applications. Any additional tips or insights on what you think may be useful are very much welcomed.
