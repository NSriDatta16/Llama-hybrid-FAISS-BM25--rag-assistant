It largely depends on how frequently your images will need to be changing, and the colored areas that they'll be covering. Because I'm guessing that you'll be needing to pay attention to IE6 compliance, most alpha-PNG solutions will cause such horrible jittery-ness that you'll spend more time in performance optimzation than you would have wanted to guess. To solve this in the past, since our images are modified less than once a month, we call the images through a caching-PHP script which automatically applies the shadow using a pre-defined background color so we don't have to rely on any transparency. This results in faster downloads (fewer HTTP requests) and a faster-interface because there's less Javascript/CSS magic in the works. I understand that this is a very old-school solution, and the above solutions would be entirely acceptable if your images were static, but being cross-browser compliant and animated will likely force you to do a solution of this style.
