Yes logistic regression or a loglinear model seem to be the approaches to take to this problem. The binary outcome is whether or not the respondent stayed drug free. All the variables that are potential confounders should be included in the model and you should also look at the interaction terms between the confounders and the treatments. If the treatment effect remains significant when including all these other variables then it would be safe to conclude that there is a real treaatment effect.
