Tomcat is not an EJB container, therefore you should use full blown JavaEE 6 server for that (such as Glassfish, Websphere, Weblogic, etc.). Tomcat can use Spring/Hibernate as this only requires relevant jars and configs/context definitions. Same applies for JSF. JPA is an abstract spec, and Hibernate (along others) is an implementation of this spec, therefore the answer is "yes, it can be implemented on Tomcat".
