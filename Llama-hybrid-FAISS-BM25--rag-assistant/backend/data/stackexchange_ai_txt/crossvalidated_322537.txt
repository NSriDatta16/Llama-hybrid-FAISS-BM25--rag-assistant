If the AIC and the BIC are asymptotically equivalent to cross validation, is it possible to dispense with a test set when using them?

Several sources I've come across state that the AIC and the BIC are asymptotically equivalent to cross-validation (see multiple answers here for example, and here ), . When training a predictive model, is this useful in practice, or is it just a theoretical consideration? Empirically, is there a sample size above which we can dispense with using a test set and use all the data we have for training, given this asymptotic equivalence? I've recently come across a professional demand forecasting which does automated forecast generation. Based on the documentation, they don't split their time series into train and test, they simply tain a bunch of models and then just take the model with the best BIC - which seems to hint at the idea that the AIC and BIC are useful in practice, but I'm not sure. Could the above mentioned equivalence between BIC and CV be why this package works this way - or is there another reason why they dispense with train/test split and simply go with the BIC as a model selection criteria? (note that this package is designed to handle millions of time series concurrently)
