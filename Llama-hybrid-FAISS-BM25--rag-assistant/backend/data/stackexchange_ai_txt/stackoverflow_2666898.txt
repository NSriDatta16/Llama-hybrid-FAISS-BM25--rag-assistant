Share c# class source code between several projects

I have written a class that will handle internal logging in my application. Now I want to use this class in another new and totally separate project. I could simply copy the file to the new project folder, but I would like to only have one copy of it to maintain so that all changes in it will apply to both projects over time. I can use the "add existing file", but where do I put the file so that the next developer knows that it is required. I have once had a "shared" folder for this but one time that folder was not brought into the next development computer. What is the best way to organize this so that it makes most sense for new maintainers and minimizes the risk for broken links in projects.
