PCA on a single time series can be done, of course. The result will be one principal component, which will be equal to the original series. Hence, technically it'll work, but it'll be pointless: you'll get your input series in the output. Here's a MATLAB example. I got the PCA of a random series, then plotted the only principal component against the original series to show that it's the same thing. I also show you the differences between to series (adjusted for mean) is zero. x=randn(10,1); [~,score,~,~,~,mu]=pca(x); scatter(x,score); max(abs(x-score-mu)) ans = 4.4409e-16
