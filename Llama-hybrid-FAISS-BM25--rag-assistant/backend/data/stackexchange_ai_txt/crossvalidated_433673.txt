Obvious demonstration of the posterior density of normal laws in bayesian inference

Given the observations' density $f(X|\theta) = \mathcal{N}(\theta,1)$ and the prior density $f(\theta) = \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ , it it is said that it is obvious that the posterior density is equal to : $\mathcal{N}(\frac{X}{1+\sigma^{-2}},\frac{1}{1+\sigma^{-2}})$ . I use following relation to compute the posterior density : $f(\theta|X) = \frac{f(X|\theta)f(\theta)}{\int f(X|\theta)f(\theta)d\theta}$ , but I dont find it obvious at all... Any help appreciated
