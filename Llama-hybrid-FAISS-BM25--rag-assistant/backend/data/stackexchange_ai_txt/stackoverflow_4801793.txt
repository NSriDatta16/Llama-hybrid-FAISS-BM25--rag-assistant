can't install windows usb driver - vodafone 845

My environment is: windows xp sp3, eclipse, all available software installed using SDK Manager. Following Android developer site's guide, I could write and run hello world app on Android 2.3 emulator. Then I wanted to see if I could run my app on a real device - vodafone 845 (huawei U8120?) in my case. Here I stuck for two days now trying to install windows usb driver for my device. When I connect my device through usb with Debug setting On, windows keeps to ackowledge it as usb mass storage. On Device Manager, I tried Update Driver, selected C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk-windows\google-usb_driver\android_winusb.inf file. it complained like: "The specified location does not contain information about your hardware" It's probably because of missing manufacturer/product information (VID_12D1&PID_1031) in inf file, right? http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html site lists supported devices and says that any additional devices will require Windows drivers provided by the hardware manufacturer but so far I couldn't any information. I guess many developers are facing this issue with their own devices that is not supported by Android SDK and I wonder how they overcome this issue - especially for vodafone 845 device. Thanks in advance Bob
