How do you get the solution directory in C# (VS 2008) in code?

Got an annoying problem here. I've got an NHibernate/Forms application I'm working through SVN. I made some of my own controls, but when I drag and drop those (or view some form editors where I have already dragged and dropped) onto some of my other controls, Visual studio decides it needs to execute some of the code I wrote, including the part that looks for hibernate.cfg.xml. I have no idea why this is, but (sometimes!) when it executes the code during my form load or drag and drop it switches the current directory to C:\program files\vs 9.0\common7\ide, and then nhibernate throws an exception that it can't find hibernate.cfg.xml, because I'm searching for that in a relative path. Now, I don't want to hard code the location of hibernate.cfg.xml, or just copy hibernate.cfg.xml to the ide directory (which will work). I want a solution that gets the solutions directory while the current directory is common7\ide. Something that will let someone view my forms in the designer on a fresh checkout to an arbitrary directory on an arbitrary machine. And no, I'm not about to load the controls in code. I have so many controls within controls that it is a nightmare to line everything up without it. I tried a pre build event that made a file that has the solution directory in it, but of course how can I find that from common7\ide? All the projects files need to be in the solution directory because of svn. Thanks for your help guys, I've already spent a few hours fiddling with this in vain. UPDATE: I set hibernate.cfg as an embedded resource. For each configuration I just simply make a new build configuration, debug, release, XYZ. In most cases I'd recommend embedding any files you depend on to run the program. It makes it much simpler to build an installer.
