Why use sampling instead of the mean value for policy in Reinforcement Learning?

I'm quite new in RL and I'm currently following David Silver's course on RL. But at the same time, I also want to get hands-on, so I followed this tutorial from Gymnasium documentation: https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/training_agents/reinforce_invpend_gym_v26/ I understand the general concept and Idea, but I'm curious about why we should model the policy as a distribution (a Normal distribution in this case) and then take a sample from that distribution as an action to be applied to the RL environment. Why don't we just use the mean value as an action instead of taking a sample from distribution as an action? Here's the piece of code that I'm talking about: def sample_action(self, state: np.ndarray) -> float: """Returns an action, conditioned on the policy and observation. Args: state: Observation from the environment Returns: action: Action to be performed """ state = torch.tensor(np.array([state])) action_means, action_stddevs = self.net(state) # create a normal distribution from the predicted # mean and standard deviation and sample an action distrib = Normal(action_means[0] + self.eps, action_stddevs[0] + self.eps) action = distrib.sample() prob = distrib.log_prob(action) action = action.numpy() self.probs.append(prob) return action As an experiment, I have tried to change the action from action = distrib.sample() to action = action_means[0] . But it turns out that the model isn't learning. Does anyone has an idea?
