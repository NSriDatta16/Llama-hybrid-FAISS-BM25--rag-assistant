Machine learning models for time-series?

I am trying to make prediction of univariate time series with functions from forecast package like: ets,auto.arima and nnetar.During modeling I divide data in traning and test set.So first I traning models with traning set and after with test set I calculate accuracy and so on so forth. My goal is to make prediction with machine learning methods but I am little bit confused.Namely my question is does this models are machine learnig models? I am askng this because I work wit time series which contain daily data.This data have sessonal patern,trend etc.So modelling data with other models (e.g random forest etc) maybe is not good choice because other models are maybe more for cross sectional data.
