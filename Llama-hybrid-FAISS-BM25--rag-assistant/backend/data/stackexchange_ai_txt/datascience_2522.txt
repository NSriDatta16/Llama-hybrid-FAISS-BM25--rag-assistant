Why not do an MSc in ooh... Data Science ? I wrote a quick review of UK Data Science Masters ' offerings recently. That should help you get an idea what is offered. Mostly they are mashups of stats and computing, but there are specialisms (health, finance for example) that might interest you. Note that list was compiled for courses that have already started, so some of those courses might not be available for starting next October, or have different syllabus contents.
