I would put another subview ontop of everything. This would grab all the touches that you were interested in and pass them back to the view controller. Your view controller would then iterate through all it's child UIViews, giving them the events. i.e. something like for (UIView *view in subviews) [view touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; though that's assuming that all the subviews you want to pass events to are children of your view controller.
