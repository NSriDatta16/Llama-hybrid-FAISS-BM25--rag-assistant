likelihood of latent state space model

Im trying to calculate the likelihood function of my latent state space model. My model has Poisson observations $p(y_t|\beta_t;x_t) \sim \mathcal{Poiss}(z)$ . where $z$ is the rate of the poisson process, $z = exp(\beta_t \cdot x_t)$ and $x_t$ are observed covariates on which the rate may depend and evolves as a linear dynamical system. $p(\beta_t|\beta_{t-1}) \sim \mathcal{N}(A\cdot \beta,Q)$ I'm trying to compare this model with a simpler model with fixed parameters (i.e. just a simple poisson regression). It is my understanding that to compare these models I need to calculate $p(y|\theta)$ in both cases but am unsure how to calculate this for the latent variable model. In order to fit the latent model I've used the EM algorithm outlined here, making a laplace approximation to adjust for the nonlinear observation process: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/course04/tr-96-2.pdf . The authors provide a closed form expression of the joint likelihood $p(x,y)$ of data and latent variables but I'm unsure how to calculate the likelihood. My current thinking is that I need to integrate out the latent variables $x$ ; i.e. $p(y|\theta) = \int p(x,y|\theta) \ dx $ The only way I can think of doing this, since there is no closed form equation for the $p(x|y)$ is some kind of (markov chain) monte carlo approach. Is this correct or am I just way off?
