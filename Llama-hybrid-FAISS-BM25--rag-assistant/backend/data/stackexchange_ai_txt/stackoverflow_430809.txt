REST interface for finding average

Suppose I want to create a REST interface to find the average of a list of numbers. Assume that the numbers are submitted one at a time. How would you do this? POST a number to https://example.com/api/average If this is the first number a hash will be returned POST a number to https://example.com/api/average/hash .... GET https://example.com/api/average/hash to find the average DELETE https://example.com/api/average/hash since we don't need it any more Is this the right way to do it? Any suggestions?
