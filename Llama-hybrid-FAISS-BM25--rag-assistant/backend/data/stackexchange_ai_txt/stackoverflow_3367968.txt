I have faced this SDK integration error a couple times, most recently when integrating a win32 console app with a library that uses Windows CoreAudio and the error occurred with a stdafx.h: // stdafx.h : include file for standard system include files, // or project specific include files that are used frequently, but // are changed infrequently // #pragma once #ifndef _WIN32_WINNT // Allow use of features specific to Windows XP or later. #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0502 // Change this to the appropriate value to target other versions of Windows. #endif #include #include // TODO: reference additional headers your program requires here #include #include Then to resolve the error, I added the following below the current includes: #include #if (MSC_VER #endif Hopefully this will help someone in the future facing this issue.
