In our project developers have the responsibility of writing and maintaining stubs right from the start. Even though stubs cost time and money, unit testing provides some undeniable advantages (and you agreed to it too). It allows for automation of the testing process, reduces difficulties of discovering errors contained in more complex pieces of the application, and test coverage is often enhanced because attention is given to each unit. With my experience I have seen that in projects where we had put unit testing at low priority had to suffer at a later stage where single change either break things or needs extra testing. Unit testing increases the confidence in me as a software developer.
