Ordinary Least Squares estimation is inadequate in the existence of heteroscedasticity- unequal and out-of-diagonal covariance terms among the observations. In your example, LST is a time-series which you assume to have autoregressive nature. Therefore, when using successive terms from this time series as regressors, you should be aware the OLS may be inefficient and yield over-optimistic error estimates. Two methods that address these issues are: Generalized Least Squares - This approach employs the observation correlation matrix (or in most practical cases, an estimate of the correlation matrix) and can be intuitively explained as equivalent to performing the regression in a transformed vector space where the observations are uncorrelated. OLS with robust variance estimation - With this approach, the regression coefficients (B in your example) are calculated the same way as with OLS, but the error terms' variance is estimated in any of the available techniques that make the estimation more robust to the existence of correlations and unequal variances. Googling "Generalized least squares" or "robust variance estimation" should get you useful resources. In addition, see Gretl User's Guide , chapter 17.
