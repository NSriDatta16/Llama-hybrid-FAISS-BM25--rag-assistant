GetLineStartPosition is able to return you the start of a line but not the end of a line. For that you will have to combine it with GetInsertionPosition . Here's how GetLineStartPosition works: GetLineStartPosition(-1) gets the start of the previous line GetLineStartPosition(0) gets the start of the current line GetLineStartPosition(1) gets the start of the next line You can also call it with larger integers to get lines further away. To get the end of a line just get the start of the next line, then get the prior insertion position. Basically it is this: pointer.GetLineStartPosition(1).GetInsertionPosition(LogicalDirection.Backward); However this does not work when you are on the last line of a document: GetLineStartPosition returns null. The easy way to fix it is to do this: var nextStart = pointer.GetLineStartPosition(1) var lineEnd = (nextStart !=null ? nextStart : pointer.DocumentEnd).GetInsertionPosition(LogicalDirection.Backward); The reason GetInsertionPosition must be used rather than just moving one symbol over using GetNextContextPosition or GetPointerAtOffset is that every element in the FlowDocument element tree is a symbol. So for example if your current line is the last line in a table, GetLineStartPosition(1) will return a pointer inside the first Run in the first Paragraph following the table, whereas the end of the current line is a the end of the last Run in the last Paragraph in the last TableCell, ... you get the idea. It is best to let WPF handle all the complexity of moving TextPointers around the FlowDocument , which means using GetInsertionPosition to find the end of the same line the original TextPointer points to.
