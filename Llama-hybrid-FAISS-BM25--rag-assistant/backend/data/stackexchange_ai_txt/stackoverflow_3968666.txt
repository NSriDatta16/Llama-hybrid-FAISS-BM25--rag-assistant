If you want to go with cookies after all, use an evercookie . evercookie is a javascript API available that produces extremely persistent cookies in a browser . Its goal is to identify a client even after they've removed standard cookies, Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects or LSOs), and others. evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of storage mechanisms that are available on the local browser. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available. Multi-browser cheating won't be affected, of course.
