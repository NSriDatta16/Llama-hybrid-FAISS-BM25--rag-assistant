Looking for better/elegant solution to this Jquery code

To continue along my elegant solution series I am trying to figure out how to do this in a better way. I am cycling through all the a tags and trying to modify the href. This code works but seems sloppy and would love to know how to do this more efficiently. $('a').each(function(){ x=$(this).attr('href').replace(/mls\_number/i,'interior=yes&mls_number'); $(this).attr('href', x); });
