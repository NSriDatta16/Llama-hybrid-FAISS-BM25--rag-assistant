My suggestion is that you consider one of the following: 1. Use a logistic model in which you have each of the 5 measurement points as their own independent variable in the model: $$Y \sim X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 + ···$$ 2. Use a logistic model in which you have the average and 4 of the deviation scores from that average: $$Y \sim \bar{X} + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5$$ where $d_i = X_i - \bar{X}$. You can't include all 5 deviation scores, but if you think some "spike" from the average may be indicative of something, this may be a reasonable approach. 3. Use some reasonable transformation of the variables within the model as the independent variables. For example, you may want to use the average $X$ for each person, the range of $X$ observed over the time, and maybe something like the count of values at or above some threshold. (The last one would dependent on the context and specific research questions.) Hope this offers some small benefit.
