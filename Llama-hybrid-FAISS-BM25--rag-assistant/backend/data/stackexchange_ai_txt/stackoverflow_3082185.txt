It doesn't look like you're doing anything to int[] nums in addRolls . Perhaps you want an nums[index]++; somewhere? On using foreach loop In most of your loops, you don't actually need an explicit index. In these cases, it'd be much more readable to use a "for-each" loop instead. Here's an example: int[] nums = { 1, 3, 5 }; int sum = 0; for (int num : nums) { sum += num; } System.out.println(sum); // prints "9" And for a 2-dimensional array (or rather, an array of arrays): int[][] mat = { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5 }, { 3, 3, 3 } }; for (int[] row : mat) { int prod = 1; for (int num : row) { prod *= num; } System.out.println(prod); } // prints "6", "20", "27" References Java Language Guide/The for-each loop Minor points Instead of writing variable += 1; You can just write: variable++; Also, please pay attention to indentation. Your indentation is highly inconsistent. Also, instead of using Math.random() and then doing funky formulas, you can also instantiate a java.util.Random once and call its int nextInt(int n) method in your application.
