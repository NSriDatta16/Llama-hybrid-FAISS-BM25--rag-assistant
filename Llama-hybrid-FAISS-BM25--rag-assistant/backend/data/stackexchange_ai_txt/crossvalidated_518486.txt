tl;dr â€“ Simpson's paradox isn't problematic unless correlations are inappropriately assumed to be causative. Background: Simpson's paradox only happens when causation was fallaciously assumed. Let's suppose these premises: Healthcare can help apparently-healthy people. Healthcare can help apparently-not-healthy people. People receiving healthcare are more likely to be apparently-not-healthy. Here we have an opportunity for Simpson's paradox: the bulk population has a negative association between apparent-health and receiving healthcare, despite each of the two sub-populations having a positive association. But it's not really paradoxical (confusing), right? I mean, obviously, the negative association is due to people seeking medical attention when they're apparently-not-healthy. The missing component is assuming causation. For example, if someone does a study on the correlation between apparent-health and receiving-healthcare, then assumes it causative, then they'd perceive a paradoxical situation in which: Healthcare helps healthy people. Healthcare helps not-healthy people. Healthcare hurts (healthy OR not-healthy) people. Absent false presumptions of causation, Simpson's paradox isn't a paradox. How to handle Simpson's paradox? Same thing you do when you discover that $1 = 2 :$ realize that someone messed up along the way. To be clear, a legitimate analysis can find correlations in which the total population has a different correlation than its component sub-populations, such as in the example above. But a legitimate analysis shouldn't be able to arrive at a situation where causative behavior is reversed.
