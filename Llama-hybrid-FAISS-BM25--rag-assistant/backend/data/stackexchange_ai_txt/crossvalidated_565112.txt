No, it is not a problem. Even if the determinant where exactly zero, pca can/will be useful. The point of PCA is to find linear combinations in the data with high variance, and the usefulness (or existence) of such is not contradicted by other linear combinations with low variance. See the comment by user whuber: The whole point of PCA is to analyze correlation matrices with zero or tiny determinant. If the determinant were noticeably nonzero, you could immediately conclude that the data are nearly spherical and that PCA would accomplish little or nothing. See the many examples at Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues and ponder what the determinants might be for each one.
