This depends on whether this is a windows application or a web browser based application. In either case you need to have some sort of container to manage the locations of controls. You can manage the position of controls inside of a container with their X and Y coordinates. You would handle the actual movement using the drag events. So you have drag start, while dragging (you might show a place holder graphic or change the cursor), and finally a drag end (set the control's x and y to the new position). Obviously these aren't the actual event names, but a search for "how to handle drag events" should get you started. In a web environment, I know jquery has dragging capability built in. So you might want to look at that. The one big thing you'll have to be careful of is maintaining the positions of your controls between postbacks. I'm not sure what would happen in this case.
