This always rubbed me the wrong way. It helps to draw some rectangles, though. Suppose you start with two identical point clouds, one centered on x and y and the other only centered on y. When drawing from the empirical distribution of these data, the contributions to $E[(X-\mu_x) (Y - \mu_Y)]$ can be shown as the saturated rectangles, and the contributions to $E[X(Y - \mu_Y)]$ appears as the less saturated rectangles (the blue one is partially hidden by its vivid counterpart). The contributions are positive if in quadrants 1 or 3, negative if in 2 or 4 (numbering CCW from top right). By failing to center the x coordinate, we have increased the blue contribution but decreased the red one. The exact amount of the increase is $|y_1|*\mu_x$ and the exact amount of the decrease is $|y_2|*\mu_x$, where $y_1$ ($y_2$) is the height of the top right (bottom left) point. These are not the same (!) but if you average over all the points, you get $\mu_x$ times the mean of y -- which is zero. This is what @whuber is trying to get you to prove algebraically -- sorry for spoiling the punch line, but what's a Q&A site without the A?
