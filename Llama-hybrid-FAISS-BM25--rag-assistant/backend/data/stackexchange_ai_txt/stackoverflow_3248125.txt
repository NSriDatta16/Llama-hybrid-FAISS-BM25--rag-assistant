In SproutCore the model layer provides full object-relational mapping and manages things like storage, state, querying and back-end retrieval of the data. Cappuccino does not provide a model layer in the same sense, so from what I've seen (e.g. http://github.com/suitmymind/cappuccinocasts-episodes/tree/master/009 ) you would instead directly send requests to your back-end and then load the results into objects and handle state, querying, etc. yourself.
