As mentioned here , that could be linked to a WTP installation issue. Try to see if you still have the problem with: WTP3.0.5 (compatible with your eclipse3.4.2) or with the J2EE package (all-in-one distribution, see here for ganymede - 3.4.2 - packages ) Note: in both cases, you can duplicate your eclipse 3.4 installation, points to a fresh workspace and do your tests here (in order to avoid modifying anything from your current setup).
