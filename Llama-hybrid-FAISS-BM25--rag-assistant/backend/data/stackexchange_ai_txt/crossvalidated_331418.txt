How many samples are needed to approximate the standard deviation?

Assume you have a random variable $X$ for which you want to compute a $1/4$-approximate $\sigma'$ of $\sigma = \sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)}$ (i.e. $|\sigma - \sigma'| \leq \sigma/4$). You can only get samples drawn according to $X$ (you have no other information on $X$). My question is: how many samples do you need to achieve this task (with constant success probability)? If the question was instead to get an estimate $\mu'$ of the expectation $\mu = E(X)$, then I can take $\mu'$ to be the average of $t$ samples, and the Chebyshev inequality gives $P\left(|\mu' - \mu| \geq \frac{\mu}{4}\right) \leq \frac{16 \sigma^2}{t \mu^2}$. Thus, $t = \frac{48\sigma^2}{\mu^2}$ samples will give me a $1/4$-approximate (with probability $2/3$). Is there a similar result for the standard deviation?
