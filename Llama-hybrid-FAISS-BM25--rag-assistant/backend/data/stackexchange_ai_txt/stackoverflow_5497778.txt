You asked this question on comp.lang.tcl , and the workaround is to specify --disable-xft when configuring Tk. I suspect that the real cause is a failure to link an XML parser, which was reported as being a potential issue on some recent versions of Linux due to a system change to the way that transitive dependencies are processed. (I forget which vendor is responsible; I wasn't paying that much attention to the developer discussion where this was thrashed out recently.) Can you report what ldd reports for the Tk library (without the workaround) and what exact OS you're building on? Also, exactly which version of Tk are you trying to build against? Also note that it is enormously more helpful to use the --enable-symbols configure option to Tcl and Tk when tracing down a problem, as that lets you get better information in stack traces.
