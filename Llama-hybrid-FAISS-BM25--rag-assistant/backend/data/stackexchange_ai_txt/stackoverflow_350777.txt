TinyMCE - Pasting from word

I'm trying to configure TinyMCE so that it accepts pasting from Microsoft Word and cleans it up in an expected HTML hierarchy. Most of our editorial staff use a single line break to denote a line break and a double return to indicate a paragraph. However, MS Word's output puts the next line in a separate paragraph (unless you shift-enter for a carriage return) and a blank paragraph with non-breaking space for two returns. Is there any way to sanitize this input? I've tried playing around with the plugins but can't find any magic combo.
