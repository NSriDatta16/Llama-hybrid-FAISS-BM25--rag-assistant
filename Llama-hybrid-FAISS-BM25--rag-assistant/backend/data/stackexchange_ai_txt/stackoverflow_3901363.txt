Embedding a Flash UI in a Java application

What's out there that lets you do this? Are there any OSS projects or maybe something a little more popular than this: http://www.jpackages.com/jflashplayer/ ? This does exactly what I'm suggesting (i.e. cuts out the need for Swing UI for the most part) but for a number of reasons I'd be interested in any better alternatives. Are there any? Any alternatives would need to support the Flex SDK.
