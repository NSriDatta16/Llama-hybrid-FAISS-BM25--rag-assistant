When dealing with databases and PyQt UIs, I'll use something similar to model-view-controller model to help organize and simplify the code. View module uses/holds any QObjects that are necessary for the UI contain simple functions/methods for updating your QTGui Object, as well as extracting input from GUI objects Controller module will perform all DB interactions the more complex code lives here By using a MVC, you will not need to rely on the QT Library as much, and you will run into less problems linking QT with Python. So I guess my suggestion is to continue using pysqlite (since that's what you are used to), but refactor your design a little so the only thing dealing with the QT libraries is the UI. From the description of your GUI, it should be fairly straightforward.
