Your data model should follow an EAV method. Medical systems are well suited to this approach as not all patients are going to have all this information filled in. This method allows you to fill in what is appropriate and populate your model. Makes organizing the data easier as well. As for organizing it in the view, I suggest you break it up into sections where sections are logically related to each other (past history, family history or by type of information), making the information easier to digest.
