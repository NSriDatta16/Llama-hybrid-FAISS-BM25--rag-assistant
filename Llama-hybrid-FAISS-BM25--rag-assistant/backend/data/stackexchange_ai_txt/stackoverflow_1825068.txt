When was this clock bought?

The clock on the gym wall also shows the day name and the day of the month. This morning it showed Tuesday - 23. The day obviously rotates through a cycle of 7 - and showed "Tuesday" correctly. The day of the month, though, presumably rotates through a cycle of 31 and showed "23" incorrectly - today is the 1st December (ie. not the 31st November). So this error has been slowly accruing over time. Given the assumption that no-one has ever reset the clock, what's the most elegant, quick, optimised way of suggesting some of the possible dates for when this clock was bought brand new. (Bonus credit for showing when the clock will again show the correct day/number combination.)
