jquery draggable element no longer draggable after drop

I want to be able to repeatedly drag and drop the same source element. At the moment when an image is dragged, it is cloned successfully - that is the original image stays put and the clone drops nicely into its new place, but the old image is no longer draggable. Inspecting the element shows class as an attribute (no value) i.e. not class="ui-draggable" As you'll see I've tried to re-enable draggability onto the original after the cloning, but its not working. Here's the code: var copy = 0; var dragOptions = { helper: 'clone', cursor: 'hand', revert: 'invalid' }; $(document).ready(function () { $("img").draggable(dragOptions); $("ul#bag > li").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { copy++; var clone = $(ui.draggable).clone().attr("id", "img_" + copy); $(this).append(clone); clone.css("left", 0).css("top", 0); $(ui.draggable).draggable(dragOptions); } }); }); li { position: relative; float: left; } img { cursor: move; } div, li { display: block; width: 160px; height: 123px; margin: 2px; border: solid 1px gray } .clear { clear: both; }
