gridview EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks

I put my gridview inside an updatepanel and my paging and sorting seem to be working well. If I set the property EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks = "true", it works equally well. What does this property do? For now my app is running on my laptop but will the settings of this property matter when I deploy? Thanks.
