The medoid has a pretty clear definition. It's the point with the smallest average distance to all other points. (It obviously does not matter whether you use the average or the sum.) If you have a similarity, maximize the similarity instead. If you do something else, it's not the medoid anymore. For example I have seen a "k-medoids" program which computed the multivariate mean (like k-means) and then chose the nearest data point of this. Which essentially has the same limitations as k-means...
