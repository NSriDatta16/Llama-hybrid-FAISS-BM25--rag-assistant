Registration Free Com and dll manifests

I'm trying to setup registration free COM, but have a slight problem in that I another COM object may be the client. App.exe----->COM Server/Client dll(registered or not)-------->COM Server DLL (NOT Registered) My questions is, is it possible to create a manifest for the second dll (COM Server/Client dll)? I do not have control of the executable, but if I did, this works if I create a client manifest for the executable and a server manifest for the COM server dll. this is the manifest file for the middle dll. I tried embedding it and tried it external. Still doesn't work. On further investigation, I can get this all to work as long as the middle dll is also registration free and the exe has an application manifest. As soon as I register the middle dll, and drop the application manifest (I do not have control of what exe will use my dll), the whole thing stops working. If the exe has no manifest, then the dll's manifest is not taken into consideration. I can prove this by setting up everything to work. Then putting a mistake in the assembly manifest. This pops up the usual message : Unable to create process: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem. If I then drop the application manifest, the application loads (albeit the CoCreateInstance fails because the dependencies are not taken into consideration)
