Supervised vs unsupervised for anomaly detection

My problem is detecting the good/bad car reparations given the repair cost. And then I can rank the car garages based on the percentage of 'good' repair he got. A first simple model is using supervised learnign to predict the repair costs (the RMSE is 500($) wich is a lot!), then a 'good' repair may be the one that got a real repair cost less than the predicted cost. We can also use supervised learning to rank the repairs (for example clustering using spectral analysis), I didn't look further in the supervised learning. I have a feeling that using the supervised way is not relevent in my problem. What do you think? And what is the advantage/disadvantage of each method? Thank you.
