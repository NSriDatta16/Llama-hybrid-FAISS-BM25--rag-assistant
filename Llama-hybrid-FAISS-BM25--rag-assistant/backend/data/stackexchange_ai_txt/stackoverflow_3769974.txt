Just recently began our conversion to 2010 and this was the biggest hurdle we've been facing. Fortunately they did reveal some long-standing problems where we were changing part of what made up the ordering of the set. In other cases, our solution was to use mutable and declare methods as const. When passing the dereferenced iterator to a function by reference (either pointer or reference) then we made the argument consst if it wasn't being changed. Dennis
