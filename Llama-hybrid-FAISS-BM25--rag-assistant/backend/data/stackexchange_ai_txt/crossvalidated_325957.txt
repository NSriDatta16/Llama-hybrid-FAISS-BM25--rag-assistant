I think a better approach would be to create three binary/indicator/zero-one variables: one for being in the bottom third, one for being in the middle third, and one for being in the top third of x distribution. Each neighborhood would have a one for one of these and a zero for the other two. Then run a regression of y on the first one and then the third one plus an intercept, since you will need to drop one in order to avoid the dummy variable trap. The coefficients will have the interpretation as the change in y in the top or bottom third relative to the middle. You could say something like "compared to the middle third, neighborhoods in the top/bottom exhibit a pregnancy rate that is X units lower/higher." This allows the effect to be nonlinear and more easily interpretable (at least to me) than using the average value of x directly in the regression. If you have no intercept or other variables in the model and use the all three indicator variables, the coefficients will give you the average y in for third.
