I would recommend that you fit an appropriate model for how your values depend on time and then interpolate. (This is actually what you have been doing.) An "appropriate" model will probably indeed involve periodic splines or harmonics to model seasonality, and potentially trends or other drivers, depending on your actual application. A very simple model, e.g., using linear splines, may impose a lot of assumptions - but it may still work best, because it has low variance. More sophisticated models may look more elegant, but they will vary more. Find which model is best by running cross-validation over a number of different ways to model your time series, using the values you already have. This will still only tell you how well your model performs in-sample. So if you have any way of actually obtaining some of the values you want to interpolate, these would be invaluable to check whether your interpolation makes sense. For all we know, the values you have never sampled are randomly drawn between 10,000 and 11,391.557, and all the interpolation is completely off the correct track.
