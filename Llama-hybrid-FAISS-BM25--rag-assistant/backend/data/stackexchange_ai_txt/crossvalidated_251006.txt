What is a stationary time series? What are some examples?

In my econometrics class, my teacher defined a stationary time series thus: "Loosely speaking, a time series is stationary if its stochasitc properties and its temporal dependence structure do not change over time." I am confused as to what some examples would be. Would temperature throughout the years be stationary, assuming that there isn't any trend? Does stationarity mean that the only movement in the data is attributed to random, white noise? What are some examples? I am at a loss for examples.
