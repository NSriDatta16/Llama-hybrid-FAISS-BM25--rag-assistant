Random forest regression for outlier detection

I am using Random Forest ( RF ) on a set of financial data. Normally when using RF, you split the data into a training and a test dataset. However, I just want to find outliers. When using RF to detect outliers, what is the best way to do this? Just run a normal model, and then use that model to predict on the same dataset as the model was built upon? Does it make sense to have a train and test dataset?
