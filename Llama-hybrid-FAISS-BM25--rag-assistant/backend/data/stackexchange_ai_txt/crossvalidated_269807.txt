Residual ACF of AR and MA models is the same

For Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models (ARIMA), if the residual autocorrelation function (ACF) of both autoregressive, AR(1), and moving average, MA(1), models is the same what does this imply? Also, which model do we choose and will the forecasts be the same?
