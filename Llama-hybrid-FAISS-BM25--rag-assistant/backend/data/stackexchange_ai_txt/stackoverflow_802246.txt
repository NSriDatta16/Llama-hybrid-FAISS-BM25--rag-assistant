I answered a similar question a couple weeks ago. There is example code in that question, but basically you can do something like this: (Note the capitalization of User-Agent as of RFC 2616 , section 14.43.) opener = urllib2.build_opener() opener.addheaders = [('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0')] response = opener.open('http://www.stackoverflow.com')
