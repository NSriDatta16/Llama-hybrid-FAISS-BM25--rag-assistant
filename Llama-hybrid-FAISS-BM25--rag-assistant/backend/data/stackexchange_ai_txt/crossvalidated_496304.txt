Calculate the power of a paired t-test in R manually

As an exercise I wanted to perform a paired t-test manually in R to refresh a lecture I had in the past. Everything went well, but then I thought about calculating the power of this paired t-test and that's where the trouble began. I know that the power is the area under the alternative distribution minus the area of the type II error ( $\beta$ ), which is delimited by the $\alpha$ significance level. So basically, in this example I need to find $P(X â‰¤ \alpha)$ of the alternative distribution that is centered around the observed mean difference I calculated, but to be frank I'm not sure how to construct that distribution. I tried to use the same procedure as for the t-statistic under the null, but that doesn't make sense, since the expected mean and the observed mean would be the same, thus the whole term would just equal 0 ( 1-pt((expMean - obsMean)*stdError, df ). And as far as I know, t-distributions are only used under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. From here on I'm just getting more confused and I think that I'm missing something obvious. I used the pwr.t.test function from the pwr package to compare my result. It would be very helpful if somebody could help me to do such tests manually, as most solutions I found elsewhere skip the part I'm trying to do manually and simply use some sort of power calculator. The code I used: # data aP ```
