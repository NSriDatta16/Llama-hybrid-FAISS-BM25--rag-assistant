Principal component analysis with factor loading restrictions

I'm interested in comparing the variance explained by the first principle component with a similar one that has factors loading values are specified. For example, using the Iris data in R, say I wanted to compare PC1 (below) with the variance explained by setting the factor loading values equal to [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1]. How do I do that? library(tidyverse) data(iris) iris % select(-Species) AlternateLoadings = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1) irisPCA4 More generally, how does one constrain some or all of the PCA factor loading values in a PCA when estimating the principle components?
