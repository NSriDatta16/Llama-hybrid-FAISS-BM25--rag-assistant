Matthew Flaschen's answer was a good start for me. Here is what I ended up using in the form of a method. I took a slightly different approach to the loop. This has been tested with empty strings passed to stringToCount and text and with the stringToCount occurring as the first and/or last characters in text. I use this method regularly to count paragraphs in the passed text (ie. stringToCount = @"\r"). Hope this of use to someone. - (int)countString:(NSString *)stringToCount inText:(NSString *)text{ int foundCount=0; NSRange range = NSMakeRange(0, text.length); range = [text rangeOfString:stringToCount options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch range:range locale:nil]; while (range.location != NSNotFound) { foundCount++; range = NSMakeRange(range.location+range.length, text.length-(range.location+range.length)); range = [text rangeOfString:stringToCount options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch range:range locale:nil]; } return foundCount; } Example call assuming the method is in a class named myHelperClass... int foundCount = [myHelperClass countString:@"n" inText:@"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country"];
