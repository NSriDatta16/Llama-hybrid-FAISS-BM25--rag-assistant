Having two different $y$ 's for the same value of $x$ will make the function not well defined , you can try plugging a data like this to a machine learning algorithm(say NN), if all your data is the same $x$ but all have different $y$ , the algorithm will try to approximate the function but will not succeed to converge! As for the mathematical analysis of machine learning, you can check PAC Learning You can try with this example(or tweak it) but it will not converge with this kind of data: from tensorflow import keras import numpy as np x=np.array([1 for _ in range(100000)],dtype=float) y=np.array([x for x in range(2,2+len(x))],dtype=float) model=keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10,input_shape=[1])]) model.compile(optimizer="SGD",loss="MSE") model.fit(x,y,batch_size=500) I hope this answer's your question!
