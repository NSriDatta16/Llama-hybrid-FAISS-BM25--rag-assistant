Denominator in pairwise similarities in symmetric SNE

I am trying to understand how symmetric SNE (stochastic neighbour embedding) works while reading the paper of Van der Maaten about t-SNE . However, I am a bit confused about the denominator in the following expression for the pairwise similarity: $$ q_{ij} = \frac{\exp(-\|y_i-y_j\|^2)}{\sum_{k\ne l}\exp(-\|y_j-y_k\|^2)}.$$ What exactly is it that we are summing over? What is $k$ and what is $l$ ? Is it the difference between any pair of $y$ -vectors among all $n$ datapoints in the low-dimensional space?
