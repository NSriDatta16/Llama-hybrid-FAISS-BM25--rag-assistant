If your inputting data, it will always be an input :). But it is definitely possible to add in certain inptus after the first hidden layer. But what is your reasoning behind this? Why would you want this? You should just input all your data in the first layer, let the neural network figure out how to use the data effectively itself. The neural network is like a black box, you put something in and something comes out - don't interfere too much by adding seperate inputs to the hidden layers.
