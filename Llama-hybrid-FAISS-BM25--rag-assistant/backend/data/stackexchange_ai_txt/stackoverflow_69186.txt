Personally, I've been using fink to install xemacs . It requires X but I've been using xemacs for so long that I need what it has. Additionally, I have installed gnu emacs . It's nice because it is a completely integrated mac os x application with a dock icon and everything. I find it useful when dragging a file on top of the gnu emacs icon to open it. Last, I should mention that mac os x uses the emacs keystrokes all over the place. stuff like ^A for beginning of text, ^E for end of text, ^N next line, ^P previous line, etc... These work in most text boxes throughout the OS.
