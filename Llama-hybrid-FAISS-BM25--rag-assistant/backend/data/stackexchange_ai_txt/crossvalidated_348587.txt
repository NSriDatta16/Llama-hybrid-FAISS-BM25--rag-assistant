LASSO: selection of penalty term: "one-standard-error" rule

I'm studying LASSO regression, in particular the choice of the optimal tuning parameter. The glmnet package and the book "Elements of Statistical Learning" offer two possible tuning Parameters: The $\lambda$, that minimizes the average error, and the $\lambda$, selected by the "one-standard-error" rule. I couldn't find any research or evidence on the "one-standard-error" rule, and which $\lambda$ I should use for my LASSO-regression. EDIT: From the textbook elements of statistical learning "Often a “one-standard error” rule is used with cross-validation, in which we choose the most par- simonious model whose error is no more than one standard error above the error of the best model."
