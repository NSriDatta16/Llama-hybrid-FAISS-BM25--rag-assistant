You seem to have forgotten to give the link to the article you're referring to. Apart from that, as you've rightly pointed out, it's going to be difficult to estimate the FPCA's own components with sparse longitudinal data (this is a term often used to refer to data such as the one you describe) without going through a so-called smoothing stage. In this case, what is usually done is to "pool" the data from all the curves at the same time and use them to reconstruct the mean function and the covariance kernel (required for the FPCA) by smoothing (local smoother). See for example equation (2.3) and (2.4) in Xiaoke Zhang, Jane-Ling Wang (2016) . Finally, an excellent tutorial on how to use this type of method in practice is available at the following address .
