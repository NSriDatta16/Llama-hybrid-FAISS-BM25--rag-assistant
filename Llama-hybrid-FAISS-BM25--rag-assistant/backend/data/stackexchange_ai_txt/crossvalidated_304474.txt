We rarely report or interpret the intercept in a linear regression model. In your case it is an extrapolation of the data. The intercept would be interpreted as a expected price for a product with width 0, an age of 1, and a height of 0. That is nonsense. A value of -9 is an artifact of the projection. If you want a more interpretable intercept, center the covariates. Then the intercept is the average price for all covariates taking their average values.
