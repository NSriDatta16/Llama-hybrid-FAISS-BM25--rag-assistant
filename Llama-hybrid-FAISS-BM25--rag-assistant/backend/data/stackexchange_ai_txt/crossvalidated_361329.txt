How to fit many datasets at once with a cross-validated pipeline?

Basically, I need to find a pipeline that will not only be the best on one dataset, but to be the best in average across an ensemble of dataset. How would you solve this problem using a cross-validated pipeline (e.g.: Scikit-learn)? The thing is that it's made for fitting only one dataset, but I have a list of datasets. Would you simply find the best classifier for each dataset, and then train another pipeline for fitting the problem of "x = dataset" and "y = estimated best hyperparameters for this dataset"? I'd still prefer something simpler but that would perform good enough. Would you have another solution? Note: this question is more about Machine Learning strategies than coding. The coding part here is optional. It's bad to see this question on hold. The reason for the question to be on hold is wrong. I don't see why this question should not be on the cross-validated stack exchange. Bad moderation on this question is wrong and would make this site poorer than it is already. If you believe this question doesn't belong here, please move it instead of putting it on hold. Thanks.
