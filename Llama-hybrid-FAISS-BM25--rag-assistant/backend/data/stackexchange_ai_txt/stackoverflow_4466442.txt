Whats the best way to keep track of this? The best way is to keep track of that in memory(redis/apc/memcached/etc)(back upped by any persistent store(mysql/mongodb/redis/etc). You should try to avoid to touch the disc(I/O) because that's very very slow compared to speed of memory. Redis You can configure redis two ways: write data back to persistent asynchronously(snapshotting) after certain time has passed and or keys have been modified. write data back to persistent store immediately(append-only). It's a trade-off(performance vs safety) APC/Memcached APC and Memcached don't have persistent storage so you have to do that using for example mysql.
