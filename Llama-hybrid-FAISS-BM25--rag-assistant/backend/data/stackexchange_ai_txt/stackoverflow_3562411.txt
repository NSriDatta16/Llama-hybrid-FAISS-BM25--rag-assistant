Queries are polymorphic in standard JPA. Here are the relevant sections from the JPA 1.0 Specification: 3.6.5 Polymorphic Queries By default, all queries are polymorphic. That is, the FROM clause of a query designates not only instances of the specific entity class(es) to which it explicitly refers, but subclasses as well. The instances returned by a query include instances of the subclasses that satisfy the query conditions. For example, the query select avg(e.salary) from Employee e where e.salary > 80000 returns the average salary of all employees, including subtypes of Employee , such as Manager and Exempt . And 4.4.8 Polymorphism Java Persistence queries are automatically polymorphic. The FROM clause of a query designates not only instances of the specific entity class(es) to which explicitly refers but of subclasses as well. The instances returned by a query include instances of the subclasses that satisfy the query criteria. So any query on a supertype will include subtypes in the results by default.
