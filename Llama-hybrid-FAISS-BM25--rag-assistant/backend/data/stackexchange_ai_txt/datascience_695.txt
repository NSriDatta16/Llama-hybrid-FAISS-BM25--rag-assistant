UPDATE: the landscape has changed quite a bit since I answered this question in July '14, and some new players have entered the space. In particular, I would recommend checking out: TensorFlow Blocks Lasagne Keras Deepy Nolearn NeuPy They each have their strengths and weaknesses, so give them all a go and see which best suits your use case. Although I would have recommended using PyLearn2 a year ago, the community is no longer active so I would recommend looking elsewhere. My original response to the answer is included below but is largely irrelevant at this point. PyLearn2 is generally considered the library of choice for neural networks and deep learning in python. It's designed for easy scientific experimentation rather than ease of use, so the learning curve is rather steep, but if you take your time and follow the tutorials I think you'll be happy with the functionality it provides. Everything from standard Multilayer Perceptrons to Restricted Boltzmann Machines to Convolutional Nets to Autoencoders is provided. There's great GPU support and everything is built on top of Theano, so performance is typically quite good. The source for PyLearn2 is available on github . Be aware that PyLearn2 has the opposite problem of PyBrain at the moment -- rather than being abandoned, PyLearn2 is under active development and is subject to frequent changes.
