Estimating mean and confidence interval for "stairs up, elevator down" time series

I have a time series which exhibits the classic "stairs up, elevator down" pattern of financial time series, i.e. slow rises up and quick drops. Given this series, I wanted to predict the next point as well as it's associated 95% confidence interval. Any thoughts on algorithms to use here?
