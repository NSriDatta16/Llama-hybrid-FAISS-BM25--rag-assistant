It's generally unwise in my opinion to launch activities unless the user has elected to run the app (widget press, notification select, launcher, etc). Your example is just one reason why suddenly changing the activity when the user isn't expecting it might cause problems. If the user isn't using the app the best way to get their attention is through the status bar notification system.
