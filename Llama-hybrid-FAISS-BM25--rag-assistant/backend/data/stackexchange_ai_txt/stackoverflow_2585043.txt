If I build a hash of all keys and store the average of the difference between consecutive timestamps of each key and a std deviation of the same, I might be able to make a pass, and report only the ones that have an acceptable std deviation(ideally, 0). However, it requires one bucket per unique key, whereas in practice, I might have very few really periodic patterns. Any better ways? Personally, I think this is probably the best you're going to get unless you can identify more structure to the problem.
