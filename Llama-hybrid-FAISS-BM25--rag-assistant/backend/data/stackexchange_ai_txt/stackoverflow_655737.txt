People who use Datasets actually use the IDE to create strongly typed datasets. Using this you have a visual query builder similar to SQL Management Studio's query builder. This generates function to load/save etc, with parameters. The fact that you see datasets everywhere is largely due to the fact that it was the only solution available up to now, short of hand coding SQL everywhere. ORMs are all the rage these days, and they do provide a really nice abstraction layer.
