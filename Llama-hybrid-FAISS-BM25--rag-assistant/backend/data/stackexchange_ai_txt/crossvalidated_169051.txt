Preprocessing via PCA in Caret, then fitting PLS

I am dealing with quite highly-dimensional data, and am using (in R) Caret's preprocessing 'pca' method to reduce the dimensionality. However, dependent on the number of components I choose, I seem to get quite different (and to me seem inconsistent) results. Firstly, if I choose to keep 400 principal components: set.seed(1) preProcSpectralPC The optimal number of PCs picked is 39: After I learned this, I decided that I probably didn't need to use 400 PCs, and hence chose to limit the number of PCs from preprocessing to 50: preProcSpectralPC It was my thinking that since 50 principal components is nested within 400, that I would get the same answer for the optimal number of PCs. However, this is not the case, and the number selected is 19: Does anyone know why I am getting this difference? The only thing I can think is that when it says '#Components', this doesn't necessarily mean the ordered PCs. This could mean that I am keeping let's say 1-19 when I choose 50, but say 1-10 and 60-88 when I choose 400. Is this the reason?
