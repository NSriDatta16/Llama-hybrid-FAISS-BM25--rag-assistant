My first question is whether [an ARIMA] seems reasonable or if there is a more straightforward way to get at the answer to the intervention effects. If there are seasonal effects or time-treatment interactions, you cannot naively employ an ARIMA. However, the basic approach of using a linear regression with an autoregressive term is a well accepted modeling strategy for time series data. should I be concerned about abrogating the effect size of my external events by seasonally differencing the data? Quite the opposite, in fact. Deseasoning the data will improve the efficiency of estimates of an intervention effect at a minimum. And, due to the imbalance of the intervention administration times, alleviate any possible bias. The correlogram should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect. The periodicity of a time series should really not be evaluated under visual inspection. Again, if you are able to fit a model which subtracts off the intervention effects (as well as random effects due to repeated measures within each mouse), the residuals can be used to inspect periodicity using an FFT or (even better) you as an analyst can simply state the periodicity is X. I know that mice are relatively less predictable in their circadian and other rhythms. Modeling blood pressure in humans, however, was easily a matter of stating that we follow a 24 hours cycle (in vivo). An FFT can complement your researcher perspective in that matter. Do you think it is more appropriate to treat each trial independently, segment the data and then find a way to average across trials?! You should absolutely do this. What constitutes a trial may not be clear here. If mice were measured continuously, the best structure would be to consider each day (or appropriate rhythmic block) an observation. Then days are nested within mice, and replicates within each mouse can be handled using random intercepts, seasonal trends can be handled with fixed effects (like a spline or similar), and intervention effects are time-varying covariates. Is it good practice to difference the entire data set anyway, even if I end up treating the trials independently? What you are describing sounds like a learning effect (rarely actually "learning" in a strict sense, but a tendency for experimental time to be a lurking factor). "Differencing the entire dataset" doesn't make sense to me, but you can run more complex models adjusting for experimental time as a second time, and its interaction with intervention, to determine whether there is a learning or growth effect.
