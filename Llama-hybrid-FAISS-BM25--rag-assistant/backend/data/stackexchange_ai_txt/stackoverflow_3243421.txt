I would actually make a user ID a character type since I'd rather log in as "pax" than 14860. However, if it has to be numeric (such as if you want the name to be changed easily or you want to minimise storage for foreign keys to the user table), an integer should be fine. Just how many users are you expecting to have? :-) I would always use varchar for character data since I know that's supported on all SQL databases (or at least the ones that matter). I prefer to stay with the standards as much as possible so moving between databases is easier.
