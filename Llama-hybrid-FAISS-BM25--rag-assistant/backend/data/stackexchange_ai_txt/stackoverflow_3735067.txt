better to use this in custom ScrollView class - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event if (!self.dragging) { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; } [super touchesEnded: touches withEvent: event]; self.nextResponder is scrollView subViews. so event other then dragging (scrolling) will be handled by your main viewController . in main View controller inherit touch event method. there u can check for touch event for particular view or image view.
