ARIS BPM tool - usage and advantanges

How is your organization benefiting from the usage of ARIS bpm designer tool (licensed version features)? I see a few posts on this site related to modeling being done using ARIS Express free edition. But I am curious to know the added benefit apart from creating a solid repository and methodology for modelling information. What are the tool's pro's and cons?
