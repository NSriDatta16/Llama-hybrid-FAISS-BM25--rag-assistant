lassevk, Thanks for that (semantic nitpicking aside :=) - however, maybe I wasn't as clear as I could be, I was trying to show rather than tell as to someone new to development, a block of prose like that means about as much as the average bit of Star Trek-esque technobabble. The page Grimtron linked to, and your text will certainly be useful once my newbie is more familiar/comfortable with .net and programming in general, I'm sure!
