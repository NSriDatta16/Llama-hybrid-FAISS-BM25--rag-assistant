Time series analysis (removing effect of external factor)

I'm currently working on detecting the response from a sensor with the following profile: The sensor responds to temperature fluctuations and I was wondering if y'all could suggest methods to "remove" the effect of temperature from the raw data so that we are only left the actual response from the the stimulus of interest. There is a about 1 minute delay between temperature change and it's effect on the sensor (inversely correlated too) Raw data on: http://pastebin.com/hE30KgWg
