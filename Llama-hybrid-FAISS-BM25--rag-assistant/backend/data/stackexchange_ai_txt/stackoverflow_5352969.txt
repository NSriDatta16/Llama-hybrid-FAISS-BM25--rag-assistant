I have the same mistake on my application. I saw on this site that this is an unofficial way of doing it and it will only work in cupcake (and maybe later version). The Android team does not guarantee that libmedia_jni.so, which the java file uses, will be included or have the same interface in future versions. http://osdir.com/ml/AndroidDevelopers/2009-06/msg02442.html I have updated my phone to GingerBread and it doesn't work anymore.
