Legal issues with Machine Learning

I'm confused with why people claim that current legal system cannot handle any wrongdoings of algorithms that involve Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The claim is that it is impossible to find who is liable for the wrongdoing. This claim seems strange: isn't it obvious that it's the company who developed the algorithm that is liable for any issues that this algorithm caused? Can someone explain where the current legal system/framework/laws break down when it comes to any harm caused by Machine Learning applications?
