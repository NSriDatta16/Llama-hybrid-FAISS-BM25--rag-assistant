MySql table design : Use lots of rows or store the information formatted in one text field per row?

I am trying to discover the best way to design my database to organize information related to events. I have an events table which contains all the information about the event such as, a unique id, title of the event, venue etc. Now each event can have multiple ticket types and the number and type of tickets will change with each event. Is it better to have a events_tickets table which has a seperate row for each ticket type e.g. event_id ticket_type price 1 standard 20 1 deluxe 40 1 cheap 10 Or is it better to have the table formatted so that the information is on one row? event_id ticket_information 1 standard:20,deluxe:40,cheap:10 If I use the first way I could end up with 10 rows per event which when multiplied by lots of events could become very large, whereas the second version could have problems with data integrity.
