I think it's an excellent question! as there's a "contradiction" of good practices. The first solution applies the rule: "try to pass the least number of parameters to a method (or constructor)" (Robert C martin mentions this rule in his book Clean Code) The second snippet follows the rule of Law of Demeter , which says That MyClass should know as little as possible about A. Personally I would go with the second option, but in some scenarios I might go for the first one.
