You can try Random Forest. You can have categorical variables with up to 32 distinct values. It is an ensemble method,a quick and relatively precise way for prediction. if you are comfortable with R, I recommend using Rattle GUI. You can install it like any other package. In Rattle you can do data mining in a point and click way and get the code afterwards, so you do not have to worry about spending too much time on different packages. You can try many of the algorithms including Random Forest there.
