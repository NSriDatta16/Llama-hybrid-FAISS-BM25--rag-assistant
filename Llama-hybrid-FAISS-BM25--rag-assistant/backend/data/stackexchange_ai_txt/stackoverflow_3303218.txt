Deploying Apps to IPhone without Dev Licence

Ive applied for the IPhone App developer license over a week ago but still havent heard anything back from apple as of yet. Im quite deep into the development of my application and am wondering if there is a way i can deploy it to a device for testing in the meantime (while waiting for apple to get back to me)? I cant jailbreak the phone because its not mine. Also, does anybody know the average time it takes for apple to "contact your legal representative" and approve the application process? Thanks
