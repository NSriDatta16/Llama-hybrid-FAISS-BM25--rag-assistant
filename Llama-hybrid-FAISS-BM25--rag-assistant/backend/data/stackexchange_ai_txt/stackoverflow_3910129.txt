What sort of link are you trying to establish (what's the nature of their relationship), and for what purpose? If one calls another directly then maybe you're after a dependency. If it's inheritance then try a generalization link. Edit: I haven't yet used EA for any forward-engineering so I'm not sure of the best way to do what you're after, but I did get it to partly work: Form a link between to classes by dragging the new path arrow from the child class over the parent class. From the context menu that pops up select generalization The "Overrides and Implementation" dialog should appear. Select the methods you want to bring across. I tried this and it worked - but only for the methods not for the attributes I'd created.
