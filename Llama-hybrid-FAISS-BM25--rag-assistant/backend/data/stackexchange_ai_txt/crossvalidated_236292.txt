Tolerance Interval for a Non-Random Sample

I have a sample of measurements representing the number of defects at a certain time point. I have 74 measurements over the past year. In addition, I have a limit of the maximum number of defects allowed for a single measurements. I have calculated a descriptive statistics, showing that the maximum is lower than the specification limit, and I have produced graphs over time (like time series). I was thinking how to add something inferential. Can I use a tolerance interval if the sample is not random, but systematic (about 6 samples a month)? Is there any other tool I can use to show that my measurements are OK? Just to clarify, I am not even close to the limit. Thank you.
