I did some research on MonoTouch for a client. MonoTouch has a minimum file size of 5.1mb because all the C# stuff. It doesn't seem to have affected apps store users willingness to download the MonoTouch based apps. In my research I didn't see any evidence that end users pay much attention to app size when making purchasing decisions. A lot of apps are first downloaded to non-Mobiles via iTunes and the difference in download time between a 1mb and 5mb is barely noticeable. A lot of end users are only vaguely aware that apps even have a size. My recommendation would be to try and prioritize the icons based on usage rate. Praeto's rule shows up in most data so you'll probably find that 20% of the icons get 80% of the use. Include that 20% most active icons in the app bundle and then download the rest.
