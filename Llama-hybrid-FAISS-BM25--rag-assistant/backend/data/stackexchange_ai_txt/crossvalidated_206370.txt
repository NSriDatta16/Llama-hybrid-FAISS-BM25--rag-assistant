One reason is that Bayesian statistics was frozen out of the mainstream until around 1990. When I was studying statistics in the 1970s it was almost heresy (not everywhere, but in most graduate programs). It didn't help that most of the interesting problems were intractable. As a result, nearly everyone who is teaching statistics today (and reviewing articles for journals, and designing curricula) is trained as a frequentist. Things started to change around 1990 with the popularization of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which are gradually finding their way into packages like SAS and Stata. Personally I think they will be much more common in 10 years though in specialized applications (SPC) they may not have much of an advantage. One group that is woking make Bayesian analysis more widely available is the group developing the STAN package (mc-stan.org).
