How to undo a SQL Server UPDATE query?

In SQL Server Management Studio, I did the query below. Unfortunately, I forgot to uncomment the WHERE clause. 1647 rows were updated instead of 4. How can I undo the last statement? Unfortunately, I've only just finished translating those 1647 rows and was doing final corrections , and thus don't have a backup . UPDATE [dbo].[T_Language] SET [LANG_DE] = 'Mietvertrag' -- ,[LANG_FR] = 'Contrat de bail' -- ,[LANG_IT] = 'Contratto di locazione' -- ,[LANG_EN] = 'Tenancy agreement' -- --WHERE [LANG_DE] like 'Mietvertrag' There is a transaction protocol, at least I hope so.
