How to deal with spelling errors in NLP classfier (low resource language)

I know there are questions on how to deal with spelling error NLP - but the question and solution are mainly focused on English where there are tons of library for spell-correction. Here I am curious what strategy are recommended to build a classifier which is more robust against spelling mistakes. I wonder if it makes sense to make the classifier with character level tokenizer ? or perhaps, upsampling correct data to be misspeled ?
