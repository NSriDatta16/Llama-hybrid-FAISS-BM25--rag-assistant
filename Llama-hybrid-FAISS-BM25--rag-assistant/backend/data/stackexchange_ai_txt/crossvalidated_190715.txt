Your simulator is correct. Since 15 minutes and 45 minutes intervals are equally likely, you end up in a 15 minute interval in 25% of the time and in a 45 minute interval in 75% of the time. In a 15 minute interval, you have to wait $15 \cdot \frac12 = 7.5$ minutes on average. In a 45 minute interval, you have to wait $45 \cdot \frac12 = 22.5$ minutes on average. This gives a expected waiting time of $\frac14 \cdot 7.5 + \frac34 \cdot 22.5 = 18.75$.
