You might want to look at the Atmel ATSAM3U-EK dev kit (approx. $200 from Digi-Key ). It has an LCD touchscreen, accelerometer, temperature sensor, analog inputs, JTAG, two serial ports, and USB 2.0 (built into the SAM3U). The thing I like about the SAM3 series is the easy bring-up. It has an on-board ROM as well as flash for program storage. From the factory, it boots the ROM (you later change it to boot from flash), which fires up the USB port, which declares itself to be a USB Communication Device Class (CDC), and runs the SAM-BA boot monitor. It also has an on-chip ERASE pin that resets the whole thing to factory settings. So all you have to do, to reprogram from scratch, is: Jumper ERASE for at least 200 ms with the power on reset and plug the board into a USB port run Atmel's SAM-BA program on either Windows or Linux select the serial port enable flash writing select your binary file and send it set it to boot from flash unhook the USB and hit reset again. No dongle or JTAG box needed. I know that reprogramming via JTAG through IAR is probably fewer steps, but I like knowing that there's a way to get to a known state if the other tools break. The IAR toolchain supports the SAM3 series, and there is a port of FreeRTOS to SAM3U + IAR (which I'm now trying to port to SAM3U + GCC since IAR's $5K licenses are too rich for us). Another neat thing about the SAM3U-EK: It has a NAND flash on board, and if you plug the board into a computer while it's running the demo, it will mount the flash on your computer as a "flash drive". On this flash you will find the documentation, schematics, demo programs and libraries for GCC, IAR, and Keil toolchains, and instructions and files for restoring the demo program to the board (useful in case you think you broke something).
