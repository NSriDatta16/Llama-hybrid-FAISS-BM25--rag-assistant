How to print a Map in Scala

Okay, this question seems to be really stupid one, but my point is that if you take a look on Scala 2.7.6 API, they had made mappingToString method deprecated. Therefore, there should be more elegant alternative for printing custom-formatted Map. Since for nearly any purpose, having equivalence method of mkString in Map is really handy. What do you guys think about it? What is your coding snippet for printing a Map except println?
