You could use a feature selector, Random Forests can be used as one, but first I think that you should transform those columns to a usable variable (numerical or categorical), for example, since you have dimensions, maybe create a column for height and another for width, to prevent unwanted behaviours. Other straightforward methods could be Forward Selection, Backward Elimination and some more resources here
