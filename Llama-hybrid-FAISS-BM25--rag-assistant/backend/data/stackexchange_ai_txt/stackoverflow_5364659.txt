How does AOP via ninject.extensions.interception relate to ninject?

I understand that ninject.extensions.interception can be used for AOP, but how does this project relate/leverage Ninject? Is it possible to use Ninject for DI and some other framework for AOP? Does ninject.extensions.interception do something special to make AOP work in context of also using Ninject?
