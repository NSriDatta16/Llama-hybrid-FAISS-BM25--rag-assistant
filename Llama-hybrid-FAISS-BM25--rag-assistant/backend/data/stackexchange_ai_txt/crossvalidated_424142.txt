As mentioned by Craig in the comment, mixed-effects model is appropriate. In short, multiple observations per participants = hierarchical data. On another note, your outcome variable (DV) is unlikely to be normally distributed, so you should not really run a linear mixed-effects model assuming a normal distribution. You stated that you are taking an average of counts (i.e., number of times participants made a mistake on a cognitive task) -- aggregating data should be avoided as it artificially lowers the variance. Treating the outcome as counts and running a mixed Poisson model is likely to be more appropriate given your data.
