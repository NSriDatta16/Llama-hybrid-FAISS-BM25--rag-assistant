Trying to understand Markovian coupling

In http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vigoda/MCMC_Course/MC-basics.pdf at one point it uses $P(X_0, \cdot)$ notation, but I don't understand what does it mean. I also don't understand how variation distance function ($d$) can accept $(X_0, \cdot)$ when it should take only distributions.
