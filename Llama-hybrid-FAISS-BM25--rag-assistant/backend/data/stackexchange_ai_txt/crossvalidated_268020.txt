Support Vector Machine - Classification or Clustering

I don't really understand if SVM are classification methods (like Logistic regression) or clustering methods. Since it's used for supervised learning, it should be part of classification methods right ? Or can SVM also be used for unsupervised learning, and would then also be part of clusering methods ?
