As you mention in nr. 8, I encourage you to use AVR, as it's a nice platform for learning and using assembler. Why? Because on my pc I'd not just run some self-written assembler program except in an emulator. I can't think of any regular program for the pc where it makes more sense to program in assembler than in a modern, sophisticated language. AVR or other microcontroller (µc) related programming is very close to the hardware, filling registers, shifting bit sets and so on. In a µc you get immediate results that you can show (flash some led! yeah.). Also, µc programs tend to be short and their speed profits from effective programming.
