Ruby Test Cases

I have a task of writing some test cases on Ruby. The task is as in example: Visit the some website. (Assert that certain page was displayed) Enter a text into a textbox Press the submit button (Assert that user was redirected to a right page) (Assert that user was presented with the right information) So, the question is: how to organize such test cases with a bigger number of asserts. Should I check for example whether step 2 occurred and only then pass to the next steps, because if step 2 fails, there is no sense to move further. I do no not know how to organize such test cases.
