file.exists() returning false when the file does exist

In an Android application I'm working on, the user should be able to create a new CSV file on the SD card, named using text they input in an EditText. The problem is that after instantiating the File using the directory and filename, file.exists() returns false , even when the file does indeed exist at that location. I have browsed to SD card using an Android file browser and through Windows Explorer, and the file does exist. Is this the correct way to check if the file already exists, and if so, what am I missing so that it returns true when it exists? String csvname = edittext.getText().toString() + ".csv"; File sdCard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); //path returns "/mnt/sdcard" File dir = new File (sdCard.getAbsolutePath() + "/Android/data/" + getPackageName() + "/files/"); // path returns "/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.phx.license/files" dir.mkdirs(); File file = new File(dir, csvname); //path returns "/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.phx.license/files/Test.csv" if(!file.exists()) //WHY DOES IT SAY IT DOESN'T EXIST WHEN IT DOES? { ... }
