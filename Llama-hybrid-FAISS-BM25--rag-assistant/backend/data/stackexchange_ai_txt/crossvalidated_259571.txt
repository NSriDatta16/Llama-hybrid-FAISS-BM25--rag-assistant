auto.arima "no suitable ARIMA model found" for measuring dependency between debt and GDP

In my studies I've been working recently on dependency between debt and GDP growth in USA from 1966 to 2015. I used logged and differenciated GDP time series data and combined it with 0/1 debt-to-GDP time series data which takes value 0 when the debt-to-GDP level is below some arbitrary value and 1 when it's above. I have made 41 such arrays, depending on arbitrary level, and tried to estimate ARIMA model through auto.arima method in "forecast" library and then I'd like to select the best model selecting the best information criterion (let's say Akaike). However, using auto.arima on series returned with No suitable ARIMA model found . Could somebody tell what is the reason for it and how can I estimate it? Here is the data I use: gdp time series: Time Series: Start = 1966 End = 2015 Frequency = 1 gdp [1,] 8.150000e+11 [2,] 8.617000e+11 [3,] 9.425000e+11 [4,] 1.019900e+12 [5,] 1.075884e+12 [6,] 1.167770e+12 [7,] 1.282449e+12 [8,] 1.428549e+12 [9,] 1.548825e+12 [10,] 1.688923e+12 [11,] 1.877587e+12 [12,] 2.085951e+12 [13,] 2.356571e+12 [14,] 2.632143e+12 [15,] 2.862505e+12 [16,] 3.210956e+12 [17,] 3.344991e+12 [18,] 3.638137e+12 [19,] 4.040693e+12 [20,] 4.346734e+12 [21,] 4.590155e+12 [22,] 4.870217e+12 [23,] 5.252629e+12 [24,] 5.657693e+12 [25,] 5.979589e+12 [26,] 6.174043e+12 [27,] 6.539299e+12 [28,] 6.878718e+12 [29,] 7.308755e+12 [30,] 7.664060e+12 [31,] 8.100201e+12 [32,] 8.608515e+12 [33,] 9.089168e+12 [34,] 9.660624e+12 [35,] 1.028478e+13 [36,] 1.062182e+13 [37,] 1.097751e+13 [38,] 1.151067e+13 [39,] 1.227493e+13 [40,] 1.309373e+13 [41,] 1.385589e+13 [42,] 1.447764e+13 [43,] 1.471858e+13 [44,] 1.441874e+13 [45,] 1.496437e+13 [46,] 1.551793e+13 [47,] 1.615526e+13 [48,] 1.669152e+13 [49,] 1.739310e+13 [50,] 1.803665e+13 debt (50% threshold): debt%gdp [1,] 0 [2,] 0 [3,] 0 [4,] 0 [5,] 0 [6,] 0 [7,] 0 [8,] 0 [9,] 0 [10,] 0 [11,] 0 [12,] 0 [13,] 0 [14,] 0 [15,] 0 [16,] 0 [17,] 0 [18,] 0 [19,] 0 [20,] 0 [21,] 0 [22,] 0 [23,] 0 [24,] 1 [25,] 1 [26,] 1 [27,] 1 [28,] 1 [29,] 1 [30,] 1 [31,] 1 [32,] 1 [33,] 1 [34,] 1 [35,] 1 [36,] 1 [37,] 1 [38,] 1 [39,] 1 [40,] 1 [41,] 1 [42,] 1 [43,] 1 [44,] 1 [45,] 1 [46,] 1 [47,] 1 [48,] 1 [49,] 1 [50,] 1 Then I intersect them and put into auto.arima model.
