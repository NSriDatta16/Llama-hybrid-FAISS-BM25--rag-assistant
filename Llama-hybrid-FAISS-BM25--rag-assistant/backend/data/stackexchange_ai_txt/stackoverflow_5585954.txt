Try setting your User-Agent header in your WebClient before you submit it to see if that fixes things. rar.Headers.Add("user-agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)") A lot of web servers are set up to simply ignore requests if the User-Agent header is missing.
