mvc script / content items 404 on page load

When I run my mvc 2 application locally everything works fine, and the request log looks like this: GET /Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.min.js HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Referer: http://localhost.:2846/ Accept-Language: en-us UA-CPU: x86 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) Connection: Keep-Alive Host: localhost.:2846 After moving the project to a remote test server all of the css and javascript files are coming back as 404 GET /Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.min.js HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Referer: http://vnt2k3qa3/NewEmployee Accept-Language: en-us UA-CPU: x86 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) Connection: Keep-Alive Host: vnt2k3qa3 Response HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Length: 1635 Content-Type: text/html Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Wed, 23 Feb 2011 23:18:32 GMT Anyone happen to know what is going on here? The site is setup for anon access, and I can manually enter the url for a script or css file and it pulls down just fine! Edit The script references in question are in the head section of the master page at /Views/Shared/Site.Master The views throwing the 404's for these are at /Views/Home/Index /Views/NewEmployee/Create (Basically all I have at this point) And the content/script folders are at /Content/Site.css /Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.min.js
