$[\rm I]$ defines the exponential family with the densities of the form $$ \exp\{A(x)B(\theta)+C(x)+D(\theta)\};\tag 1\label 1$$ $\eqref 1$ is natural exponential family if $A(\cdot) $ is linear. Consider $X$ following lognormal distribution. Then one can show $A(x) =\ln x$ and thus a lognormal family is not natural exponential family. Reference: $\rm [I]$ Unifying the Named Natural Exponential Families and Their Relatives, Carl N. Morris, Kari F. Lock, The American Statistician, August $2009,$ DOI: 10.1198/tast.2009.08145. Canonical forms are the building (cf. $\rm [I]$ ) blocks of exponential family of distributions. Formally, with a $\sigma$ -finite measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^n,$ a non-negative real valued function $h:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R, $ a set of $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak B}(\mathbb R^n) /\boldsymbol{\mathfrak B}(\mathbb R) $ measurable functions $\langle T_i\rangle_{1\leq i\leq s},$ for $\boldsymbol\eta\in\mathbb R^s,$ let $$ \Xi:=\{\boldsymbol\eta:A(\boldsymbol\eta) where $$ A(\boldsymbol\eta) =\ln\int \exp\left[\boldsymbol\eta^\top\mathbf T\right]h(\mathbf x) ~\mathrm d\mu.$$ Then the density $$p(\mathbf x;\boldsymbol\eta)=\exp\left[\boldsymbol\eta^\top\mathbf T-A(\boldsymbol\eta)\right]h(\mathbf x) \tag 1$$ is an $s$ -parameter exponential family in canonical form (cf. $\rm [II]$ ). $\Xi$ is the maximal parameter (cf. $\rm [III]$ ) space. One can make other parameterizations of the density by taking a mapping of the form $\boldsymbol\theta\mapsto \boldsymbol \eta(\boldsymbol\theta) $ from some space $\Omega$ to $\Xi$ to get $$p(\mathbf x;\boldsymbol\theta)=\exp\left[\boldsymbol\eta(\boldsymbol\theta)^\top\mathbf T-B(\boldsymbol\theta)\right]h(\mathbf x) \tag 2$$ where $B(\boldsymbol\theta) := A(\boldsymbol\eta(\boldsymbol\theta)). $ Family $\{p(~;\boldsymbol\theta):\boldsymbol\theta\in\Omega\}$ is an $s$ -paramter-exponential family. $\rm [IV]$ formalizes the process of building up an exponential family (for simplicity, we will be dealing with families with parameter one): $\bullet$ Start with a density $h$ w.r.t. the $\sigma$ -finite measure $\mu.$ $\bullet$ By exponential tilting, construct a family of densities proportional to $\exp(\eta x)h(x);$ consider $M(\eta) = \int_\mathcal X e^{\eta x}h(x)~\mathrm d\mu;$ if $M(\eta)$ is finite for $\theta$ in a nhood of $0,$ it is the mgf of $h(x).$ Take $\Xi:= \{\theta\in \mathbb R: M(\theta) If $\Xi$ is not degenerate, construct the family $\mathcal F_{ne}^1$ by $\eta \mapsto \exp\{\eta x- A(\eta)\}h(x),$ where $A(\eta)$ is the cumulant generating function of the distribution with pdf $h(x).$ $\bullet$ Let $T(x)$ be a statistic with cgf $A_T(\eta), ~\eta\in \Xi_T\subset\Xi.$ Then $\exp\{\eta T(x)-A_T(\eta)\}h(x)$ is a density for $\eta\in \Xi_T.$ $\bullet$ Consider a mapping $\Phi\to \Xi_T:\phi\mapsto\eta(\phi).$ Then the class of densities $$\exp\{\eta(\phi)T(x)- A_T(\eta(\phi))\}h(x) \equiv \exp\{\eta(\phi)T(x)- B(\phi)\}h(x)$$ is (full if $\eta(\Phi) = \Xi$ ) exponential family, denoted by $\mathcal F_e^1.$ $\bullet$ For each $\mathcal F_{ne}^1,$ there is an associated $\mathcal F_e^1$ induced by $T(\cdot)$ and parameterized by $\eta = \eta(\phi),$ that is $\exp\{\eta t- B(\phi(\eta))\}h_T(t)$ where $\eta(\phi)$ is assumed to be one-to-one with inverse $\phi(\theta).$ In a nutshell, as Wikipedia states By defining a transformed parameter $\eta = \eta(\theta)$ , it is always possible to convert an exponential family to canonical form.
