Rather than explicitly adding include paths to your project settings, an easier and more convenient solution for this kind of situation is to just drag the directory containing your .h files (/lib/irrlicht-1.6/include in this case) into the project files pane. This adds the headers to your project of course, and makes it easy to browse them and search for symbols, etc, and it also adds the directory path to gcc compiles, so that you don't have to manage include paths explicitly.
