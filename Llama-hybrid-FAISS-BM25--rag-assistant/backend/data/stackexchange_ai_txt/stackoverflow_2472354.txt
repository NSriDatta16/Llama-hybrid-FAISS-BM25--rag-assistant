Does the command "gem env" not report any gem paths? Mine reports a number of gem paths along with teh version of rubygems etc. that yours does not appear to be doing. RubyGems Environment: - RUBYGEMS VERSION: 1.3.5 - RUBY VERSION: 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [universal-darwin10.0] - INSTALLATION DIRECTORY: /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8 - RUBY EXECUTABLE: /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby - EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY: /usr/bin - RUBYGEMS PLATFORMS: - ruby - universal-darwin-10 - GEM PATHS: - /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8 - /Users/steveweet/.gem/ruby/1.8 - /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8 - GEM CONFIGURATION: - :update_sources => true - :verbose => true - :benchmark => false - :backtrace => false - :bulk_threshold => 1000 - REMOTE SOURCES: - http://gems.rubyforge.org/ You can edit the environment variables associated with gem by specifying them in your shell startup files, (.bashrc for bash). The relevant variables are all listed in the environment page of the gem web site. You will want to pay particular attention to GEM_HOME and GEM_PATH. You can check the current settings of these by typing echo $GEM_HOME at a shell profile I would suggest that your best action at this moment in time may be to go back to your default ruby installation as provided with OS/X and then download and install rvm (The Ruby version manager) and then watch Ryan Bates screencast
