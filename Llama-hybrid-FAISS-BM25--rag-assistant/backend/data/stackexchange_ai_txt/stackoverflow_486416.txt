Infragistics UltraCalendarCombo seems to be on drugs

I have an UltraCalendarCombo calendar control that I need to disable a set of dates in (weekends and public holidays basically). I iterate through the list of dates for that month and set all the corresponding dates to disabled, this makes the current month look alright, but when I click the next month button on the control and try to access a month past now + 3 or 4 it jumps back to this month. Has anyone any idea what this control is smoking, and where I can get some? DateTimeCollection badDates = getMeSomeBadDatesmonth, year); foreach (DateTime date in badDates) { myForm.CalendarInfo.DaysOfMonth[date.Day].Enabled = false; }
