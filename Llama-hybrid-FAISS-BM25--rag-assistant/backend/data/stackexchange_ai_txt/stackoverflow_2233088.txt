From the User Guide about deleting objects : Note that Grails does not supply a deleteAll method as deleting data is discouraged and can often be avoided through boolean flags/logic. If you really need to batch delete data you can use the executeUpdate method to do batch DML statements: Customer.executeUpdate("delete Customer c where c.name = :oldName", [oldName:"Fred"])
