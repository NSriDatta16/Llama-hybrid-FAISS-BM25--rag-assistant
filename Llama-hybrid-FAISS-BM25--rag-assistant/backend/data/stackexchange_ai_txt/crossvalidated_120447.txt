Random forests use bootstrap sampling to build many different decision trees on the same dataset. While each individual decision would fit the same model to the exact same data, you get a different aggregate model each run because you take different bootstrap samples each run. Edit: I misunderstood your question. First of all, when I run your code, I DO get the exact same results for credit.pred1 , credit.pred2 , credit.pred3 . Please start a new R session, re-run your code, and check your results. Furthermore, use this code to check equality: all.equal(credit.pred1, credit.pred2) all.equal(credit.pred2, credit.pred3) all.equal(credit.pred1, credit.pred3) if you STILL get different results, run sessionInfo() and post the results here.
