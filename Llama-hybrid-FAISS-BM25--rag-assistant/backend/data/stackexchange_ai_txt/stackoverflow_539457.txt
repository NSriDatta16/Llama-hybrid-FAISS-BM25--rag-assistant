If you're talking about Java (but rules for other languages are similar), it is like this: You can (down)cast an interface to a concrete implementation, iff the reference you cast actually is a reference to the specific concrete implementation. That means Vehicle v=new Car(); (Car)v // this is OK (Bus)v // this is not The error manifests itself as ClassCastException in Java. You can upcast a concrete implementation of an interface to the interface freely.
