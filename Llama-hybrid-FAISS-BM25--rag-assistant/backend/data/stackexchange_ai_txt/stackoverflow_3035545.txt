jquery image slider with image strip dragging

I want to create a image strip slider using jquery. I have used jcarousel plugin for my image gallery and light box plugin to get preview of selected image. Now, my task is when any of the image is selected i can drag to either side. i.e I can select the image and drag to any direction within that image container. If any one can help me on this??? Update from comment: $( "img" ).Draggable({ connectToSortable: 'ul#mycarousel', axis: 'x'}); //getter var connectToSortable = $("img" ).Draggable( "option", "connectToSortable" ); //setter $( "img" ).Draggable( "option", "connectToSortable", 'ul#mycarousel' ); Thanks
