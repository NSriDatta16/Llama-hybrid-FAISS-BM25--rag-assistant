Usually, most road shapefiles have a begin_address/end_address fields for each road segment where you can interpolate the addresses. The bottom line is that you have a GIS problem manifesting in gathering and organizing the address data, the NP stuff in my opinion is the simpler problem. Look into postgis . You can convert shape files to it. the irc room #postgis on irc.freenode.net is extremely helpful so is there mailing list.
