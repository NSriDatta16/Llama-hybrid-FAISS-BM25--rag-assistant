Question: Optimal D notation in Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)

I am completely new to Computer Vision and how Deep Neural Networks work on images in general. In particular, I have questions on the Discriminator component of Adversarial Generative Network (GANs). There are some things that are left unexplained to me: Optimal Discriminator is given by: $$ D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_G(x)} $$ where $p_{data}(x)$ and $p_G(x)$ are the probability distribution of samples of the original and generated dataset, respectively. However, assuming that $x$ is a $2\times2$ RGB image, how is $p(x)$ calculated in this case? In other words: $$ p(x) = p([R,G,B]) = p([[1,2,3,4],[4,5,6,8],[9,10,11,12]]) = ???. $$ And how is this different for $p_{data}(x)$ and $p_G(x)$ ? Assuming that both $p_{data}(x)$ and $p_G(x)$ returns a single value, resulting in optimal $D^*(x) = 1/2$ . If anyone could also give me a source that explains this well, that would be very much appreciated!
