Gaussian process regression: (i) fit evaluation; (ii) application to purely stochastic time series

I am just starting the learn about GPR, and have two questions which I've not seen addressed in the material I've read: (i) In my regression courses, emphasis was placed on the examination of the fit residuals, in order to ensure that the model was appropriate (e.g. non-random residuals show that a straight line does not model a quadratic very well). Is there an equivalent for GPR? In other words, are there goodness-of-fit procedures? (ii) Is there anything to be gained from applying GPR to purely stochastic time series such as ARMA processes?
