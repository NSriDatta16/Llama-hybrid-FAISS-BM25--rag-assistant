No. The compiler is free to order your varibles x, y, pointer and z in any way that it likes. ++pointer is not guaranteed to end up pointing to y, and in my experience is unlikely to in practice. laying out variables in an order different from their declaration seems to be quite common. dereferencing ++pointer is undefined behavior. If you need x and y to be sequential in memory, then you should declare an array of 2 ints instead of separate variables. If your compiler supports some sort of #pragma pack to control structure packing, then I would suggest that you convert your loose global variables to a struct to guarantee ordering.
