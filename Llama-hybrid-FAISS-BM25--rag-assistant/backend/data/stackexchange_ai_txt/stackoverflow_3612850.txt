I'd encourage a different approach - one that doesn't use update panels. Update panels require an entire page to be loaded, and transferred over the wire - you only want the contents for a single control. Consider doing a slightly more customized & optimized approach, using the MVC platform. Your data flow could look like: Have the original request to your web page spawn a thread that goes out and warms your data. Have a "skeleton" page returned to your client In said page, have a javascript thread that calls your server asking for the data. Using MVC, have a controller action that returns a partial view, which is limited to just the control you're interested in. This will reduce your server load (can have a backoff algorithm), reduce the amount of info sent over the wire, and still give a great experience to the client.
