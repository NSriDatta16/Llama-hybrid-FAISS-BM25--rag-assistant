you'll probably want: a user table user_info[], user_id a game table game_info[], game_id a user_game_join table that holds user_id, game_id, score, insertdate that way you have all the data to get high score by game, by user, by game & user, averages & whatnot or whatever else. always build extensibly. you never know when you will need to refine your code and redoing a database is a real PITA if you don't lay it our right to start with.
