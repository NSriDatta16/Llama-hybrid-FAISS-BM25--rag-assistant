A common way to input several features to an LSTM (or any RNN) is, as you did, to concatenate them in a vector. I suspect your NaN are related to a different issue in the code, and I recommend you to debug it and see when and why it happens. A different way of combining several features is using embeddings for each feature and combine them via concatenation. For example, for the note pitch, you have an embedding for each note, for the note duration, the same, and so on. The input to the RNN would be a concatenation of that. A third option would be to have an embedding to all possible combinations of the embeddings. That would be an embedding for each triplet of note pitch, note duration and offset. This representation can be also powerful. My recommendation is that you start with the easiest to implement, and if the result is not satisfactory in terms of model performance, think about the next one.
