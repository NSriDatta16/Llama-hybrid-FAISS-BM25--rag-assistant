Can't find this book

I came across the most comprehensive ML Mathematics book (700+ pages) with sections on Probability, Calculus, Linear Algebra and Mathematical Foundations of the famous tricks in Deep Learning on Twitter about a year ago. It was not available in print yet can anyone give me a clue as to which it could be? I can't seem to find it. P.S. It is not Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow.
