What is non-decomposable and/or non-differentiable loss function?

I have been reading some deep learning literature and came up with these concepts of non-decomposable and non-differentiable loss functions. My question is are these same thing? if not how are they different? How do we know if a loss function is non-decomposable/non-differentiable?
