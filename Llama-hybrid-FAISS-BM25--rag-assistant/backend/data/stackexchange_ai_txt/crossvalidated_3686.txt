Perhaps one of the simplest methods would be a graphical representation in which the x-axis is the number of groups and the y-axis any evaluation metric as the distance or the similarity. In that plot you usually can observe two differentiated regions, being the x-axis value at the 'knee' of the line the 'optimal' number of cluster. There are also some statistics that could hepl on this task: Hubert' gamma, pseudo-tÂ², pseudo-F or cubic clustering criteria (CCC) among others.
