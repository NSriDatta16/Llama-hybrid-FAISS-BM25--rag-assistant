1) Using the defaults for MatchIt, nearest neighbor matching matches on the propensity score as defined by a logistic regression of treatment on the covariates included in your formula. For each treated unit, it finds the one unmatched control with the closest propensity score, and then throws out the unmatched control units. There is no issue with continuous vs. categorical covariates here. Note King & Nielsen (2016) , who describe why propensity score matching can actually make balance worse, as in your example. 2) MatchIt creates matches for the ATET, but the Matching package, which also implements genetic matching, allows you to specify that you want the ATE. After matching, you can simply perform the regression analysis you would have had you randomly assigned your units (assuming balance has been achieved).
