Working with NSDate and Comparing with Dates in Objective C

"31-Dec-2010 9:00AM to 1:00PM" Take the above NSString for example, I need to convert it to 2 NSDates e.g. 31-Dec-2010 9:00AM AND 31-Dec-2010 1:00PM Then compare it with the current Date to see if the current date falls within the given dates. So 31-Dec-2010 10:00AM would fall within. I'm wondering What are the best practices/tricks are with Objective C to do this elegantly?
