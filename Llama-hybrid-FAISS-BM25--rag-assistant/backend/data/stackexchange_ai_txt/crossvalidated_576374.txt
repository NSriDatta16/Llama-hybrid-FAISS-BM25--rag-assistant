Lots of excellent answers are given here. Apparently, the results will depend largely on the models chosen. With that said, allow me to throw one more possibility to this old question based on a Bayesian time series decomposition model I developed, available in an R package Rbeast ( https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ). It assumes a model of the form Y = seasonality + trend + outliers + error ; for each component, changepoints are also detected, if any. Here is a test on the given example: library(Rbeast) out = beast(dat.change, season='none', ocp=8) # no seasonality with a max of 8 outlier points # out= beast(dat.change, season='none') # no outlier component is assumed plot(out) Below, the Pr(tcp) subplot gives the probability of having sudden changes (i.e., changepoint) over time. bcp is another great R package for Bayesian change detection.
