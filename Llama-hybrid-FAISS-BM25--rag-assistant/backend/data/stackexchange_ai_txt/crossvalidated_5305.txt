How to re-sample an XTS time series in R?

I have an irregularly spaced XTS time series (with POSIXct values as index type). How can I build a new time series sampled at a let's say 10 minute interval, but with each sample moment aligned to a round time (13:00:00, 13:10:00, 13:20:00, ...). If a resampling moment doesn't fall exactly on a original series value, I want to take the previous one.
