Where is the method that boxes an AnyRef into an Option?

In this blogpost by James Iry , he writes: Plus, Scala has an "option" method that promotes a value to either Some(value) or None depending on whether it's null or not ... I can't seem to find this option method anywhere in the scaladoc. Iulian Dragos 's gdata client project contains a method that is probably what James was referring to. def option[A Please point out where can I find this method in the scaladoc. P.S. I have a method that looks like this: def permutations(s: String): List[String] = ... I'm in 2 minds as to whether I should change it to: def permutations(s: Option[String]): List[String] = ... since the client can invoke it with null . Currently in the first instance, I expect a String parameter & I box it manually using the option method mentioned previously.
