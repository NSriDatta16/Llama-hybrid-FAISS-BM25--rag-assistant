Fitting polynomials to time series data (without prior theory) is in my opinion never a good idea and is definitely anachronistic (i.e. an outdated approach). See Does the p-value in the incremental F-test determine how many trials I expect to get correct? for @w.huber's wise reflection. Perhaps you have latent structure reflecting level shifts/multiple time trends or memory structure using lags of one or more series or even anomalous data points (pulses) or even non-constant error variance. Remedying these issues can often lead to reasonable models as @Sycorax and https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/11887/kjetil-b-halvorsen pointed out.
