Edited My bad about suggesting static , I clearly didn't pay much attention to your code before answering. DRAWTEXT doesn't show up anything because your object has not beed added to the stage. You have to call addChild() to see your diplsay object. As a side note, don't take this bad, buy you have been asking a lot of questions that show that you lack a basic understanding of how Flash and Actionscript works (and also you seem to be a bit too insistent on having it work the way you want). It's always ok to ask questions here (as long as you keep them on-topic, which seems to be the case with your questions), but I think you would be better off first learning the basics from some good books, tutorials, etc. These two posts contain links to good resources, I think you should check them out. Resources for Learning ActionScript 3.0 as a Professional Programmer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/168586/where-to-learn-actionscript-3-0 Also, what's with all these users with the same name? Right now I can see 9 users with the name 1101 here: https://stackoverflow.com/users/ , and I think all of them are yours. One is enough. Really. You don't need to create a new user everytime you want to ask a question. Also, try to follow up the questions you've asked to give some feedback to the people that bothered answering (this will be much easier if you have just one user). And when you want to comment on some response, leave a comment instead of adding an answer.
