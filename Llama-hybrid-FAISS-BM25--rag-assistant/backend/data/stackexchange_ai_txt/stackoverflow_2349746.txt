I derived the solution after reading this page How-To #0: How to Install Usb Driver on Your Computer . Though the listed instructions didn't work for me, it did lead me to the solution so: credit where credit is due. Vista automatically recognized the SD card and will install a USB Mass Storage Driver for that. Contrary to the instructions on the linked page, I did not have to remove this driver. Another comment in the text led me to needing to enable debugging mode (Settings -> Applications -> Development -> Debugging Mode). As soon as I enabled this (with the device connected), Vista immediately installed an "Unknown" driver for the connection and I was able to successfully update the driver. Works great!
