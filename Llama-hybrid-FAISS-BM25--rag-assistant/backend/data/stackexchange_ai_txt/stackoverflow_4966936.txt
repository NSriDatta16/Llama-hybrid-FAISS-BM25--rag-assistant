How do generate dynamic web page with in the same web application

I thought of re-framing this question once again, to make it clear. Thanks a lot the comments. I am developing a web application in which I am making use of widgets. Take a real use case scenario, suppose USER-A logins into the my web app and he uses some widgets say A,B and C widgets. He places Widget A in the center, WIDGET-B on to the top right hand side and WIDGET-C on to the left hand side of the page. USER_B logins into my system and uses the some widgets and places the widgets in different positions since widgets are made draggable and resizable. When the user publishes the page the widget should appear exactly in the same position exactly in the same position where he/she placed. We are using Jquery HTML5 at the front end and servlet and my sql at the back end.
