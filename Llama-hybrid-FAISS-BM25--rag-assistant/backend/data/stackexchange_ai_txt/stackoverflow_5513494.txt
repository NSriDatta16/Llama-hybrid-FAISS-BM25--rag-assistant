A brute force algorithm is as follows (3 variable case): int sum = 25; int a1 = 3; int a2 = 4; int a3 = 5; for (int i = 0; i * a1 To generalize this for the N variable case, you need to convert into a recursive form. This algorithm is O(f(size, a)^N) for some function f . We can place bounds on f as follows: size / MaxValue(a) . In the worst case (where all of the a[i] s are 1 ) f(size, a) is size . Either way, this is pretty horrendous for large values of N . So while the recursive N variable algorithm would be more elegant, it is probably not very practical. If you are willing to fork out 34 Euro's to Springer Verlag, here's a link to a paper which (according to the abstract) includes an algorithm for solving the N variable case.
