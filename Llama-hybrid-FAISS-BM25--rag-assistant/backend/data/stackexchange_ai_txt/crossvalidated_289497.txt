Completely ignore the classification table. The purpose of logistic regression is to estimate probabilities of events. You can interpret the predictive discrimination of the model using for example the $c$-index (concordance probability; area under the ROC curve). Also consider a calibration curve. Much has been written about these on stackexchange. Concordance is the probability that, of a randomly chosen pair of observations, one with and one without the event, the one with the event has the higher predicted probability of the event.
