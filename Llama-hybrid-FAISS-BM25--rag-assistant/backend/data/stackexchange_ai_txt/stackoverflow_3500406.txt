It's important that you upgrade your browser if you wish to use this API. IE6 is almost as bad as using Netscape Navigator, or Machine Code to browse the web. However, if you're doing this to cater for a client, I have run into similar issues where I thought I'd make sure it works in all browsers, but I couldn't find many people actually still using IE6 because when Windows Update gets released it automatically upgrades the browser to IE7 and even IE8 now. People still running IE6 may be in large organisations as their systems don't get upgraded as often, but you'll find that most people in these organisations would have downloaded and installed Firefox or Chrome. The bottom line is, as a Web Developer you no longer need to cater for IE6 as Microsoft have stopped supporting it.
