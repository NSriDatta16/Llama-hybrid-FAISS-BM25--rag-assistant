There exist subspace outlier detection methods, too. For example SOD and COP: H.-P. Kriegel, P. Kröger, E. Schubert, A. Zimek Outlier Detection in Axis-Parallel Subspaces of High Dimensional Data In: Proceedings of the 13th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD), Bangkok, Thailand, 2009 Hans-Peter Kriegel, Peer Kröger, Erich Schubert, Arthur Zimek Outlier Detection in Arbitrarily Oriented Subspaces In: Proc. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2012) Both are available in ELKI , which is where I've learned about them.
