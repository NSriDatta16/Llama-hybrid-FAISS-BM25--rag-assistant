Now that the data have been posted some simple analyses help make the situation clearer. Let's show (half of) a scatter plot matrix. There is a lot of scatter. A and B are clearly most similar; C is largely dissimilar to B but shows more relation to A. There aren't problems with extraordinary outliers or massive curvature. Concordance correlations quantify this without adding insight: A B 0.704 B C 0.363 A C 0.638 Concordance correlations measure agreement, not linearity, and are 1 if and only if two variables have identical values. The principal component analysis I would base on a covariance matrix, as it seems that the units of measurement are identical. These results (from Stata) don't match those in the OP's comments: . pca A B C, cov Principal components/covariance Number of obs = 70 Number of comp. = 3 Trace = .1942012 Rotation: (unrotated = principal) Rho = 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component | Eigenvalue Difference Proportion Cumulative -------------+------------------------------------------------------------ Comp1 | .153565 .123528 0.7908 0.7908 Comp2 | .0300363 .0194362 0.1547 0.9454 Comp3 | .0106001 . 0.0546 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Principal components (eigenvectors) ---------------------------------------------------------- Variable | Comp1 Comp2 Comp3 | Unexplained -------------+------------------------------+------------- A | 0.6037 0.1114 -0.7894 | 0 B | 0.4836 0.7360 0.4738 | 0 C | 0.6337 -0.6678 0.3904 | 0 ---------------------------------------------------------- So, with a covariance matrix input, PCA shows PC1 with 79% of the total. (Using a correlation matrix produces the same rounded result of 79% for the first PC; from the graphs it is evident that the variances of the variables are similar.) I wouldn't personally mush together A, B and C and take PC 1 as the best measure of a latent variable. Either C is the poorest measure and should be discarded and A and B combined; or there might be quite independent grounds for thinking that C is the best method, in which case it should be used. Consider three witnesses in court: two liars might agree with each other and disagree with one honest person. The majority need not be correct. Conversely, on a consensus or coherence criterion C looks poorest. EDIT: Here is a quantile plot, which underlines what the scatter plots do show, but less clearly, which is that C is typically smallest.
