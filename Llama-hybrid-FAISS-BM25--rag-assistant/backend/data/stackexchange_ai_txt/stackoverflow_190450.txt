How can I store multiple values in a Perl hash table?

Up until recently, I've been storing multiple values into different hashes with the same keys as follows: %boss = ( "Allan" => "George", "Bob" => "George", "George" => "lisa" ); %status = ( "Allan" => "Contractor", "Bob" => "Part-time", "George" => "Full-time" ); and then I can reference $boss("Bob") and $status("Bob") but this gets unwieldy if there's a lot of properties each key can have and I have to worry about keeping the hashes in sync. Is there a better way for storing multiple values in a hash? I could store the values as "Bob" => "George:Part-time" and then disassemble the strings with split, but there must be a more elegant way.
