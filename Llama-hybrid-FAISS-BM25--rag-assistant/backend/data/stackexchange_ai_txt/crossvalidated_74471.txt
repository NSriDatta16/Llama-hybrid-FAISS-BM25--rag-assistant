I had a brief run in with image recognition and classification. Random Forests is an easy to use technique. I've implemented it on R, it should be available on Weka as well. Ease of use trumps prediction accuracy though. If you have a large enough training set, it can classify multiple labels. It worked to recognize handwritten digits quite well, but if your images are more complex, then only a trial would tell you if it does well.
