I'd use the Template Explorer (Ctrl-Alt-T, or View | Template Explorer) in SQL Server Management Studio. There are a bunch of pretty good templates/examples there by default already, and you can easily add them, group them by function, etc. From there you can easily drag/drop them into scripts. There's even a search function (right-click, Search) within the explorer window.
