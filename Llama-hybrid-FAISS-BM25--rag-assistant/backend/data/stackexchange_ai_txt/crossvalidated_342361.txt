I found some papers from the R package plsRglm that get me most of the way there. In those cases the method of PLS for a GLM is formed (including binary and ordinal logistic regression) and thus I just need to modify the "link" function to be softmax. From the paper: The algorithm consists of four steps: computation of the $m$ PLS components $t_h$ (h = 1;:::;m); generalised linear regression of y on the m retained PLS components; expression of PLS-GLR in terms of the original explanatory variables; Bootstrap validation of coeKcients in the 6nal model of PLS-GLR. Hereinafter, the 6rst and the last steps are described in details while the middle two steps are shown directly in the examples as they are trivial.... published paper with detailed explanation R Package (updated algorithm from published paper)
