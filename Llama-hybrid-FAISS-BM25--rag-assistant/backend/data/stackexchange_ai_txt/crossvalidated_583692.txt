Parameterizing priors with related data-sets

I have a Bayesian model I'm using to compare two data-sets X_1 and X_2. I have a prior distribution I would like to use. This distribution could be parameterized by the mean and variance of some data-set X_p. I know better than to use X_1 as the X_p needed to create X_1's prior, but I don't have a particularly clear proof that it would be wrong to use X_2 to parameterize X_1's prior and vice versa. When creating priors for comparing two data-sets, is there a nice proof (or just a less-handwavy reason) that I cannot use the data-sets to parameterize the priors of each other? I expect the right approach here is to simply randomly divide X_1 and X_2 into a testing and prior set, and use the segregated data to set their individual priors, however I'm very open to someone less stupid than me showing a better way forward.
