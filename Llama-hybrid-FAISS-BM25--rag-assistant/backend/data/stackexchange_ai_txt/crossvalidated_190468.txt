Question 1 The way you calculate the density by hand seems wrong. There's no need for rounding the random numbers from the gamma distribution. As @Pascal noted, you can use a histogram to plot the density of the points. In the example below, I use the function density to estimate the density and plot it as points. I present the fit both with the points and with the histogram: library(ggplot2) library(MASS) # Generate gamma rvs x # Fit parameters (to avoid errors, set lower bounds to zero) fit.params # Plot using histograms ggplot(data = dat) + geom_histogram(data = as.data.frame(x), aes(x=x, y=..density..)) + geom_line(aes(x=dat$x, y=dgamma(dat$x,fit.params$estimate["shape"], fit.params$estimate["rate"])), color="red", size = 1) + theme_classic() Here is the solution that @Pascal provided: h Question 2 To assess the goodness of fit I recommend the package fitdistrplus . Here is how it can be used to fit two distributions and compare their fits graphically and numerically. The command gofstat prints out several measures, such as the AIC, BIC and some gof-statistics such as the KS-Test etc. These are mainly used to compare fits of different distributions (in this case gamma versus Weibull). More information can be found in my answer here : library(fitdistrplus) x @NickCox rightfully advises that the QQ-Plot (upper right panel) is the best single graph for judging and comparing fits. Fitted densities are hard to compare. I include the other graphics as well for the sake of completeness. # Compare goodness of fit gofstat(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma)) Goodness-of-fit statistics 1-mle-weibull 2-mle-gamma Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic 0.06863193 0.1204876 Cramer-von Mises statistic 0.05673634 0.2060789 Anderson-Darling statistic 0.38619340 1.2031051 Goodness-of-fit criteria 1-mle-weibull 2-mle-gamma Aikake's Information Criterion 519.8537 531.5180 Bayesian Information Criterion 524.5151 536.1795
