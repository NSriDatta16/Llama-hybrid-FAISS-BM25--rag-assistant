Generics confusion

Below is a question from Kathy & Bert Bates SCJP 5 preparation CD. I have posted this elsewhere too, but have not gotten a satisfactory explanation until now.... Please help me understand this: public class BackLister { //Insert code here { List output=new LinkedList (); for(T t:input) output.add(0,t); return output; } } Which of the following can be inserted at //Insert code here ? A . public static List backwards(List input) B . public static List backwards(List input) C . public static List backwards(List input) D . public static List backwards(List input) E . public static List backwards(List input) F . public static List backwards(List input) I understand that A and B are correct; however, not why are D and E also right. I can see that C and F are also incorrect. Can someone please tell me why D and E are correct.
