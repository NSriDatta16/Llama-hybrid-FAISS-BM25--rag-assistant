Normalising data with multiple methods

When training a neural network, I appreciate that data normalisation helps training. However, is it a good idea to normalise the data in multiple ways. For instance, is it a good idea to apply z-score normalisation on min-max normalised data? That is if the input data is already normalised to [0, 1], is it a good idea to train on the z-scores of that?
