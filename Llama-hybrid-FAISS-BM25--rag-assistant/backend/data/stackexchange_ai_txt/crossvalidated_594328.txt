For a true multivariate logistic regression with multiple binary outcomes, any of which can have a "success" for any one observation, you can use generalized estimating equations to estimate and take into account the correlations among observations. You effectively get a set of univariate models, but the correlations are taken into account for inference. The R geepack package provides tools for that. That is typically done for multiple binary observations over time for the same set of individuals, but the basic principle applies for any set of potentially correlated outcomes. This paper illustrates use of geepack with clustered binary outcomes. The suggestion you saw to use glmer() might have envisioned using the outcome type as a predictor in a logistic model (interacted with the predictors of interest) so that you fit the log-odds of a "success" in part as a function of the outcome type. In that case you would want to include the individuals or cases within which you think there are outcome correlations as random effects. There is no direct handling of multivariate binary outcomes in glmer() , so far as I know. If instead you have 6 potential mutually exclusive outcomes, only one of which can be a "success" at any one observation, you need to use multinomial or perhaps ordinal regression .
