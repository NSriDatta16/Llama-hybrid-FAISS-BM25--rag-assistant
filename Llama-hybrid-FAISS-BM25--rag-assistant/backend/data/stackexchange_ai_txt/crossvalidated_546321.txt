So $\textbf{y}_{\tau_{i-1}:\tau_{i}}$ are the elements of the time series going from changepoint number $i-1$ going up to changepoint number $i$ . Then $\textbf{y}_{\tau_{i-1}:\tau_{i}-1}$ (notice the additional -1 is not a subscript of the $\tau$ but rather a subscript of the $\textbf{y}$ ). So this time series starts at changepoint number $i-1$ and goes up to one element before changepoint number $i$ ( $\tau_i-1$ ). This is because you want to calculate the loss function from one changepoint to the next with no overlap.
