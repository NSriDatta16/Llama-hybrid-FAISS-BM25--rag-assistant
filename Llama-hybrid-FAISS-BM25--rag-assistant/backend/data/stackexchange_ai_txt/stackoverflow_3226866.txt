I sounds like you want to change the actual file using Javascript - this should be rather difficult. Javascript was designed from scratch as a web scripting language and as such it doesn't have any built in file/IO functionality. What you can do in Javascript is load ActiveX objects and plug ins. How this works depends a lot on which browser you're using. For instance in IE you could load an ActiveX object (written in VB or whatever) that could edit your file: var fileWriter = new ActiveXObject("My.FileWriter"); fileWriter.Update("myFile.htm", "inputName", "newValue"); You'd have to write your FileWriter utility though. Alternatively you could use HTML5's new data storage stuff - but then you're still limited on browser.
