Linux display average CPU load for last week

On a Linux box, I need to display the average CPU utilisation per hour for the last week. Is that information logged somewhere? Or do I need to write a script that wakes up every 15 minutes to copy /proc/loadavg to a logfile? EDIT: I'm not allowed to use any tools other than those that come with Linux.
