How to make an UIAlertView pop up when a bouncing image touches a draggable image?

How can I pop up alert when an bouncing image touches a draggable image the same way it's done in this app: http://tinyurl.com/kspnh6 Example: there is an image that is going up and down the screen and it touches an image that we can drag around. How can we show an alert view when that image touches the moving image?
