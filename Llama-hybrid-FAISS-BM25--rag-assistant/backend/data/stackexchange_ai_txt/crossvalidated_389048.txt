marginal distribution of normal $\mu$ with inverse gamma prior on $\sigma^2$

(From Bayesian Essentials with R by Marin & Robert) Given that $$\mu | \sigma^2 \sim N(\epsilon, \sigma^2 / \lambda_\mu)\,,$$ and $$\sigma^2 \sim IG(\lambda_\sigma /2, \alpha /2)\,,$$ we want to show that the marginal of $\mu$ is a T distribution. In solution, setting $\tau = \sigma^2$ as shortcut, \begin{align} f(\mu | \lambda_\mu, \lambda_\sigma, \epsilon, \alpha) &\propto \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\tau^{1/2}} exp{\Big\{-\frac{\lambda_\mu(\mu-\epsilon)^2}{2\tau}}\Big\} \tau^{-\lambda_\sigma/2-1}exp{\{-\alpha/2\tau\}} d\tau \\ & \propto \int_0^\infty \tau^{-\lambda_\sigma/2-3/2}exp{\Big\{-\frac{\lambda_\mu(\mu-\epsilon)^2 + \alpha}{2\tau}}\Big\} d\tau \\ & \propto \Big\{ \lambda_\mu(\mu-\epsilon)^2 + \alpha \Big\}^{-(\lambda_\sigma+1)/2} (*) \end{align} I cannot figure out how to go from the integration to eq (*). Any hints or suggestions would be much appreciated.
