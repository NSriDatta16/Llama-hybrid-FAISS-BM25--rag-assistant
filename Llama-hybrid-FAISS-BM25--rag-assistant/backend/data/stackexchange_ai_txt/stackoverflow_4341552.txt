There is currently no way to modify the SoftReference collection behavior. I'm not sure what you mean by "manually growing the heap to the max". If these are instances of the Bitmap class (as opposed to some custom bitmap implementation), the pixel data is actually stored on the native heap, but uses an annoying "external allocation" accounting trick, which complicates the situation further. (Notably, the storage is freed by a finalizer, not the GC, and finalizers have to execute in a separate thread after the GC completes. It's possible to allocate Bitmaps until you run out of memory, and the GC has no way to release the memory before throwing an OOM error.)
