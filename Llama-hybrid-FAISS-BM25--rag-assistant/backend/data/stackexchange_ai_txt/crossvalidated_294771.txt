Sparse coding vs. Autoencoder

I was reading the previous Q&As about sparse coding and sparse autoencoder differences but I am still confused what is the point in using sparse coding. It is said that sparse autoencoder give us a way to model the sparse codes (and thus generate them for every new input), while sparse coding is a way to calculate the codes directly for a given image, and we should repeat the whole optimization process for any new image. In my mind having a model is way better than doing a task for every new input. Why on the earth somebody want to do sparse coding instead?
