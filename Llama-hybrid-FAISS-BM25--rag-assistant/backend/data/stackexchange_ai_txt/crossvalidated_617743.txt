Period cutoff in Chow test

I am using the Chow test to analyze structural change in time series data potentially caused by a significant event. Since each data point represents a day, the data is broken into two chunks: Chunk 1: All data occurring before the event Chunk 2: All data occurring on and after the event. This is working fine, but I also want to analyze potential changes in the 30-day period following the significant event. In other words, I want to use a cutoff of 30 days rather than a single day, if that makes sense. So far, I have tried to create a larger period cutoff by setting the beginning of the second chunk to 30 days after the event. This means the data is broken into two chunks: Chunk 1: All data occurring before the event Chunk 2: All data occurring 30 days later and beyond To my understanding, this excludes data occurring in days 1-29. Assuming all of this makes sense, is this a valid way to apply the Chow test using a period cutoff rather than a single-day cutoff? If not, is there a better way to use a period cutoff? I came across this post, but it seems to deal with automatically detecting breakpoints rather than using a priori breakpoints.
