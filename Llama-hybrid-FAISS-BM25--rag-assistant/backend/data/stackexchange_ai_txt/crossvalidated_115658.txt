What type of simulation would be needed?

I have come up with 10 different regression models (one for every sector of the S&P500) and was interested in running a simulation as a way of testing the performance of the models. I have a few questions related to this: 1) Is simulation a reasonable approach for determining possible performance? 2) How would I go about building a simulation in R if I want to calculate: average net profit/loss, beta, sharpe ratio, Volatility, Average Gain, Average Loss, win-to-loss ratio, and annualized returns? Thanks!
