There are severe flaws with this approach. First, there are many gambles which usually win, but which are bad gambles. Suppose you have the chance to win \$1 $90\%$ of the time and lose \$100 $10\%$ of the time. This has a negative expected value, but the way you are training the neural network would teach it to recommend such reverse lottery tickets. Second, you are missing a big point of the stock exchange, which is to manage risk. What determines the price of an investment is not just its return, it is the return versus the risk which can't be hedged away. Investments with high returns and high risks are not necessarily better than investments with low returns and low risk. If you can invest risk-free at $6\%$ and borrow money at $5\%$, this is more valuable than finding a very risky investment with a return of $60\%$. An investment with a negative rate of return may still be valuable if it is strongly negatively correlated with a risky investment with a high rate of return. So, the rate of return is insufficient for evaluating investments. Third, you should realize that you are competing with other people who also have access to neural networks. There are a lot of commercial programs aimed at day traders based on neural networks. (These are made by people who find it more profitable to sell software to confused day traders than to use their own systems.) There are many proprietary systems, some of which may involve neural networks. To find value they overlook, you need to have some advantage, and you haven't mentioned any. I'm a big fan of neural networks, but I think typical users of neural networks in the stock market do not understand the basics and burn money.
