j2me - Content-Disposition attachment; filename - how to get it?

I am trying to download an audio file served by Rails server with my j2me application. Here is my piece of code: try { connection = (HttpConnection) Connector.open("http://host.com/user/getaudio/65/"); connection.setRequestMethod(HttpConnection.GET); connection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1"); System.out.println("HTTP Response: " + connection.getResponseMessage()); // OK System.out.println("HTTP ResponseCode: " + connection.getResponseCode()); // 200 System.out.println("HTTP ResponseLength: " + connection.getLength()); // -1 connection.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } The HTTP response is OK, code: 200. Everything is fine but the connection.getLength() returns -1. I have realized that the file is attached via Content-Disposition header. I know how to reach it with connection.getHeaderField() but what next? Is it possible to reach it somehow? Regards, Peter
