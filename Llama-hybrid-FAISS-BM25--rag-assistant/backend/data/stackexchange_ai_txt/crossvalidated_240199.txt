Testing equivalence (mean stayed the same)

We have an app, where you post projects and we'll be running A/B test on new version of posting page. How do we ensure that the new version is not worse? We have 14 days of time to decide that. And on average we get 708.73 projects posted in 14 days with standard deviation of 36.16. We could just wait until we see the results and see if it's better or worse. But how to determine it's just not worse. Doesn't matter if it's nearly the same.
