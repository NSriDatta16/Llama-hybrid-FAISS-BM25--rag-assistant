This is an active area of research. This first question is whether a central limit theorem (CLT) even exists which depends on the mixing properties of your MCMC, e.g. geometric convergence. Typically, this is a nontrivial question. Provided a CLT exists, the second question is how to obtain a consistent estimator of the variance in the CLT. Partitioning the chain as you have done is called batching and is the approach used in the R package mcmcse . I'd suggest you take a look at that package and the references therein. As an example of using the package you can do library(mcmcse) n = 1000 y = rep(0,n) for (i in 2:n) y[i] = rnorm(1,0.9*y[i-1]) mcse(y) which will return an estimate of the expectation of y, which is known to be zero in this case, as well as an estimate of the Monte Carlo standard error in the estimator which takes into account the correlation in the chain. This package allows the user to specify the batch size, but defaults to the square root of the total number of samples. Perhaps the references in the package will give an indication of why this is the default or what other batch sizes will work.
