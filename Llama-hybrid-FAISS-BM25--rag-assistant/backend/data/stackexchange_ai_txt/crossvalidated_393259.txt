Clarification on quantification of Categorical variables

I have a countries column with 49 levels. I want to quantify it. If I run CATPCA on that column would i be able to get the quantified result. Since CatPCA is like PCA or factor analysis: it extracts few "latent" continuous variables out of many original correlating variables
