.Net you say? If you are using VS2010, Coded UI is really good, as a long time QTP user (on the more technical side of that of course) Coded UI was a dream, even in its early stage of existence it is so powerful and integrates tightly into the Visual Studio eco system that if you can use it i recomend it highly. You can read about here Another tool that my experience is more limited with but i have heard good things about is ( specflow ) which is can work nicely with coded UI to create and organise tests in a sensible way. Might give you something to think about anyway!
