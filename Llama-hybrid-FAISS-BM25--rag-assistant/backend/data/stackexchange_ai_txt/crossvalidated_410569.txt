You can process each image with the same CNN, outputting a $H$ dimensional vector $h_i$ for each image (in Keras this is a TimeDistributed application of your CNN). So if you have $N$ images, your output will be $(N,H)$ dimensional. Then you can use max and/or mean pooling across the $N$ dimension, giving you a fixed output of dimension $2H$ , which you can pass onto a classification layer.
