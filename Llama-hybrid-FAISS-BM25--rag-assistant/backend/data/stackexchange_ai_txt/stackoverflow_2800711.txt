I would recommend one of the other questions asked here about how to store objects in localStorage. It helped me a lot as I am implementing a code editor that can store multiple files and last state of the user. The stackoverflow question Both answers posted are very valuable. Some things to take into consideration: When do you store data, after each key pressed or after some other specific action/event? Use a temporary Javascript data structure or only interact with localStorage directly?
