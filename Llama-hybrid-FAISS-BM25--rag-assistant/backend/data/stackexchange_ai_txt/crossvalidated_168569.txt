Need time series visualization software with zoom

I am responsible for providing time series data to my co-workers monthly as line charts. The plots consist of two series: the actual data and a moving-average smoothed line. I am currently doing this with Excel charts exported to PDF and distributed by email. This is an OK approach except that we now have over 10 years of monthly data and the charts - containing all 10+ years - are becoming useless for analyzing patterns in recent subsets of the series. I'm looking for a solution where I can present my co-workers something similar to the charts used in Google Finance . Those charts allow the user to zoom in to see series subsets in greater detail. I'm willing to pay for a solution, but I am on a small-business budget rather than an enterprise budget. Any suggestions on how to approach this?
