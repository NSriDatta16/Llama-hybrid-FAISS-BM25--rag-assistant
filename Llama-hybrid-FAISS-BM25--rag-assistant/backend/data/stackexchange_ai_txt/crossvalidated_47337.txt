How to interpret a scatter plot for the whole model in a linear multiple regression analysis?

I am writing a very basic report on ability of three predictors (two dichotomous and one continuous) to predict the criterion. I created a scatter plot for the whole model, and all I have to do is write 1 or 2 very simple sentences on what it suggests. Would it be appropriate to state that the many residuals suggest that this may be a weak model? Is there anything else I should pay special attention to? [Please bear in mind this is a very basic report; I am not expected to write anything in depth; I am using SPSS]. Many, many thanks to whoever answers.
