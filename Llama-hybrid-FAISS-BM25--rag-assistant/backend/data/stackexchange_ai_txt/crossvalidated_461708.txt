From the brief description, CNNs would indeed seem much better suited to solve this problem. In particular, the main inductive bias of CNNs is that their is spatial pattern that is translation-invariant, which seems like exactly the case you're describing. If you believe that the patterns you mentioned are simple, then training a small, shallow (1D) CNN should perform well on the task. I hope that helps!
