Oracle in optimization

I have encountered the word oracle in the following context : Given an $\alpha$ -approximate oracle for stochastic optimization we show how to implement an $\alpha$ -approximate solution for robust optimization under a necessary extension, and illustrate its effectiveness in applications. I saw this question , but it doesn't seem to have the same meaning. I was wondering what does oracle mean in this context. Edits: I found the following definition in this paper : A $\rho$ -approximate Bayesian optimization oracle is a function $\mathcal{O}_{\rho}:(\Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}) \rightarrow > \Theta$ for which: $$ f\left(\mathcal{O}_{\rho}(f)\right) \leq \inf _{\theta^{*} \in \Theta} f\left(\theta^{*}\right)+\rho $$ for any $f: \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that can be written as a nonnegative linear combination of the objective and constraint functions $g_0, g_1, \dots, g_m$ . I would appreciate if someone can shed some light on it.
