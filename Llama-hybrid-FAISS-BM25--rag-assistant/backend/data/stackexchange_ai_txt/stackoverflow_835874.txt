obviously anything can have bug, even the VC compiler. so if there is a bug in this section of code, you could wrap it in a #pragma to turn optimisations off. IF it still crashes after that, then something else in your code is trashing your map (and then you need to turn on DrWatson to get dumps so you can inspect the crash in windbg to try and find out what's happened to it). To turn off optimisation use: #pragma optimize("g", off) to turn it back on, either change off to on or use the special case #pragma optimize("", on) which resets your optimisation settings to the project defaults.
