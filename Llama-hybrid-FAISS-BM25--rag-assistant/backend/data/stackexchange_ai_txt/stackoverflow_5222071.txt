Instead of embedding a time bomb, perhaps consider applying a BUGBUG: comment ? Rather than forcing you or someone else to fix code that may be kind of unsightly but works as expected down the road, you can just do a solution-wide search and find the ugly bits when you decide it's time to get down and refactor the really ugly stuff.
