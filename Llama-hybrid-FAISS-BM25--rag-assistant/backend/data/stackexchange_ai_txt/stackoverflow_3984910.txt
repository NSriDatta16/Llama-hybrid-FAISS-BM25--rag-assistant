I have a text file of a paragraph of writing, and want to iterate through each word in Python

How would I do this? I want to iterate through each word and see if it fits certain parameters (for example is it longer than 4 letters..etc. not really important though). The text file is literally a rambling of text with punctuation and white spaces, much like this posting.
