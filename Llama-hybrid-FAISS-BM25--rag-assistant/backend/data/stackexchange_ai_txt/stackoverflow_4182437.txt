You can easily add a "License Agreement" dialog to a setup project created in Visual Studio. To do this, follow these steps: With your setup project open in Visual Studio, right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer, point to "View", and click "User Interface". Right-click on the "Start" group, and select "Add Dialog" from the pop-up menu. In the "Add Dialog" dialog, click the "License Agreement" icon and click "OK". A license agreement form will be added to your installer under the "Start" group. Drag and drop the "License Agreement" dialog in the list to rearrange where it appears in the setup sequence. With the "License Agreement" dialog selected, use the "Properties Window" to customize its options as needed for your application. The most important thing to set here is the "LicenseFile" property, which specifies the text file that contains the license agreement you want to be displayed. If you cannot find the text file that contains your license agreement, you need to add it to your setup project. To do this, select the "Browse" option from the "LicenseFile" drop-down box. Then, in the dialog that appears, double-click on the location where you want your license agreement to be copied to the target machine (presumably the "Application Folder"), and then click the "Add File" button. Your license agreement should be named "license.rtf", and must be encoded as an RTF file.
