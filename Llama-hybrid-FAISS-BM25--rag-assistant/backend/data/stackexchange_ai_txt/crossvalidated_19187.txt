I have found a solution that I find rather elegant. There is an excellent article in the literature entitled "Analysis of repeated measures data with clumping at zero" which demonstrates a zero-inflated lognormal model for correlated data. The authors provide a SAS macro which is based on PROC NLMIXED and is quite easy to implement. The good news is that this can simplify to cases without clustered observations by omission of the repeated statement in the macro. The bad news is that NLMIXED does not yet have the many correlation structures that we often need, such as autoregressive. The macro is named MIXCORR, and has a very useful Wiki page that you can find here . The macro itself can be downloaded under section SAS MIXCORR Macro for data with repeated measures and clumping at zero . I highly recommend all of these links. Hope you find them to be useful.
