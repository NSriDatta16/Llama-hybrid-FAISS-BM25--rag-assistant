Import local Apple Mail.app messages (.emlx) into mutt

I am a mutt newbie, but am learning steadily, highly encouraged by its speed of searching and message display. I use mutt to read email from two Gmail IMAP accounts, and I cache the headers on my disk in ~/.mutt/cache/hcache and message bodies in ~/.mutt/cache/bodies/. I have a few years of mail I downloaded via Apple Mail.app that are stored in ~/Library/Mail/Mailboxes/.mbox/Messages/ where is 2000 .. 2010. All these messages have .emlx extension. How do I transfer these messages to my mutt store so I can read and search them via mutt?
