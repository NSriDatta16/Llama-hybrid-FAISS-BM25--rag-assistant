Try using $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] . Notice that it is 'HTTP_REFERER', NOT, as one would expect, 'HTTP_REFERRER' Also, please note the documentation on this variable: The address of the page (if any) which referred the user agent to the current page. This is set by the user agent. Not all user agents will set this, and some provide the ability to modify HTTP_REFERER as a feature. In short, it cannot really be trusted. In addition, ceejayoz is correct in noting that if you go directly to a page and don't follow a link there, most browsers will not set a referrer.
