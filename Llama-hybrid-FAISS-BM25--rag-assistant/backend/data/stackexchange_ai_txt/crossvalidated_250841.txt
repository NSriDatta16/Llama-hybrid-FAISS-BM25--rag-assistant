I pursued your thread and read the available material (unusual for me ) because I am very interested in the subject of extracting structure from data without injecting structure and am always up for creative analytics. This book like all other books that I haven't written should be taken with a grain of salt. Let me comment on some of your comments.. In the very old (but bad) days analysts would detrend/deseasonalize first clearly premising no ARIMA structure and no outliers/level shifts etc. and THEN violate their assumed premise and identify an ARIMA model. Equally flawed some researchers suggest building an ARIMA model first and then detrend/deseasonalize to deal with deterministic structure. Some researchers approach the problem simultaneously/holistically essentially crafting a hybrid model taking into account any pulses/level shifts/multiple time trends and changes in seasonal dummies along with ARIMA structure while incorporating any user specified causal series like heating degree days / cooling degree days. Averaging the values of the squared residuals for each of the 7 days and then modelling these variances with a Fourier model appears to me to be an ARCH/GARCH technique but inconsistent with ARIMA modelling of the squared residuals which is the normal ARCH/GARCH approach. It appears to be very ad hoc as Fourier methods while often suitable for physical processes leave a lot to be desired for other kinds of data and I am not sure how this fits into their playbook. Dividing the residuals by the square root of the fitted variance is an attempt to determine the weights (normalization) for a subsequent Generalized Least Squares (GLS) solution given that the 7 daily error variances are different from each other AND that the daily variance for each day is changing over time. AUTOBOX , a piece of time series software that I have helped to develop) uses a similar BUT different scheme to render the error variance to be invariant over time. http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html might be of some help here . Their attempt to deal with error variance change is laudable but impracticable as far as I am concerned. Hope this helps unveil some of the "stuff" . Time to get another book or some more advice.
