Shapes dragging problem

I need to design a software where user can drag shapes in a window. The problem is that there might be thousands of shapes and there might be some restrictions, e.g. one shape cannot be over another shape. So I actually need to know how to organize data storage and some algorithm to quickly determine if a shape can be placed in some particular position. I think this problem was solved many times, but I don't know how to google it properly. Could you please provide me with some information on this topic? Thanks!
