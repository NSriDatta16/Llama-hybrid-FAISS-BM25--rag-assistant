My understanding Generative: probability of x and y (eg, hmm) Discriminative: probability of y given x (eg, logistic regression aka crf) In the first, we can generate a new x and y, since we know their joint distribution In the second, x is fixed, so we could not generate a new case Example: age and height. The joint probability of age and height would allow you to draw a sample. For example, (44, 2 ft) has low probability but (44,6 ft) higher. A discriminative model would merely tell you height given some age. The probability of 6 ft given 44 is higher than probability 2 ft given 44, but you don't know anything about the distribution of the ages or the distribution of ages and heights together, so you cannot generate a new case
