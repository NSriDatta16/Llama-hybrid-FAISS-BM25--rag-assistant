In response to the original post, I kinda think the disk IS a literal concept. Even if we no longer use this particular kind of storage, it represents writing data to some type of memory device. It might be better to ask "What does 'Save' mean?" than "What's a better/more contemporary icon than the floppy disk?" When you save something, you are putting it somewhere for later use or storing it. We're getting bogged down in choosing literal storage devices that will all eventually be obsolete. The folder and arrow idea (in another post here) didn't seem right because we're used to folders being a way to organize files, not as a storage device. And of course you don't necessarily need a folder to save. So here's one proposal using the concept of an abstract cube being placed inside another cube - or placing an object inside a box. Thoughts? Don't bother with "thinking outside the box" jokes because I already thought of that :) Oops, not enough reputation to post an image here. Here's a link.
