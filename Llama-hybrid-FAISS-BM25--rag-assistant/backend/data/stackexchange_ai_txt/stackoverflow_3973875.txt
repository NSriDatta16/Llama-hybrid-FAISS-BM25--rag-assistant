There's a nice tutorial on this in the web site to go with the book OpenGL ES 2 The examples from the book are all at www.opengles-book.com . Chapter 9, Simple_Texture2D does exactly what you want. It sets up a shader that samples a texture, initializes it, and shades the triangles using the texture. The shader program is close to: varying vec2 v_texCoord; uniform sampler2D s_texture; void main() { gl_FragColor = texture2D(s_texture, v_texCoord); } and you set it up thusly: glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, userData->textureId); // Set the sampler texture unit to 0 glUniform1i(userData->samplerLoc, 0); glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indices); But see the actual code, from the links I gave above, to really see the example.
