I think there are several issues here the most pertinent being that presumably the gap between individual solves isn't the same. You may have to define a "maximum gap" so that you can treat the data as if it is sequential, however that will probably create a whole bunch of partitions in your data. I.e. instead of having one long sequence of solve times, you'd have a whole bunch of separate sequences. I think what you're asking essential is if the the present solve time is conditionally independent to the one before it. There are myriad ways to test for that specific condition. Here is a few Bayesian approaches: https://www.bnlearn.com/examples/ci.test/
