jQuery image hover effect

I'm trying to achieve this effect with jQuery. I wrote some of the code, but it's buggy (move to the bottom-right corder and you'll see). check it out Basically, if there's an already-built jQuery plugin that you know of that does this, I'd be very happy using it, if not, any help with my formula would be appreciated. This is what I get for not paying attention in Maths classes :) Thanks in advance. Maikel
