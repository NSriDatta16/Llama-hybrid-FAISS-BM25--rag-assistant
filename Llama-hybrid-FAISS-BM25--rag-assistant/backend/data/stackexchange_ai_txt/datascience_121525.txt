How do I use a column with data of different layers for AI?

I am working with real estate data for an ML/DL project. In the csv file there is a column in which each cell contains data like the examples below: Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 6 Houses Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 7 Houses Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 8 Houses Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 4 Houses Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 5 Houses Karachi Flats > DHA Defence Flats > DHA Phase 8 Flats > Emaar Crescent Bay Flats > Emaar Pearl Towers Flats Karachi Flats > DHA Defence Flats > DHA Phase 2 Extension Flats Karachi Flats > DHA Defence Flats > DHA Phase 8 Flats > Emaar Crescent Bay Flats Karachi Flats > DHA Defence Flats > DHA Phase 7 Flats > Jami Commercial Area Flats Karachi Houses > DHA Defence Houses > DHA Phase 7 Extension Houses Karachi Flats > DHA Defence Flats > DHA Phase 6 Flats > Nishat Commercial Area Flats It basically tells where in where in where in where a particular property is located. The objective is to create a price prediction model. I think I can do something with this particular column (maybe classify it somehow) to be able to use it. But because the data might have 3 layers, or 4 or 5 or maybe more, I can't figure out the right way to make it numerical to for example implement a decision tree or random forest. Any guidance?
