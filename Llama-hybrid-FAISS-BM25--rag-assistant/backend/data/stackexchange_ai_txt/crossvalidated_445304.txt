When the number of data values is less than the number of parameters in a statistical model the statistical model does not usually provide anything useful. You have one datum and one parameter (the probability of heads) and the datum does not convey very much information because it is a dichotomous outcome rather than continuous, so don't expect too much. The calculation that you need is not based on the maximal likelihood estimate and the prior maximum because, as X'ian points out in his comment, the relevant Bayesian calculation uses the whole range of parameter values (i.e. all probabilities of heads from zero to one). You have to provide a complete prior probability function for heads. What you say means that its peak is at 0.5, but you have to decide on how wide the function is, and its shape. (The function has Pr(heads) on the x-axis and probability density on the y-axis). Give the observation of a single heads, the likelihood function is a right triangle with its maximum at Pr(heads)=1 and minimum of 0 at Pr(heads)=0. Multiply that function by your prior probability density function and re-scale the result to have unit integral, and you have your posterior. Your posterior probability function for Pr(heads) will not differ much from your prior if your prior is a narrow peak, but will differ more substantially if your prior includes a lot of weight at the Pr(heads)=0 end. Interpretation of the results is straightforward: a. On the basis of the observation alone, the most likely probability of heads is 1, and Pr(heads)=0 can be ruled out. The likelihood of Pr(heads)=0.5 is half as high as the likelihood of Pr(heads)=1, but a different of two-fold is quite trivial in most cases and the likelihood function is very flat and so it is not very discriminating. b. Your prior expectation is that the most probable value for Pr(heads)=0.5. c. The posterior function shows how probable you should think each value of Pr(heads) is. Do not focus only on the maximum, but see what ranges of Pr(heads) are reasonably plausible (for some version of "reasonably" and "plausible"). A credible interval might be useful. Note that more data can be added by simply multiplying that posterior by a new likelihood function.
