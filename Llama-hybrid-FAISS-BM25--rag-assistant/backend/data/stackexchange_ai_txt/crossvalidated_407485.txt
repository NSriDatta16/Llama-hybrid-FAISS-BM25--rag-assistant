Appropriate dimensionality reduction technique for a small, but high-dimensional sample

I am attempting to conduct some multivariate analysis on a dataset I've been given with a sample size (n) of 23 and a feature number (p) of ~800. I would like to use dimensionality reduction, but after some reading I am unsure if PCA / FA methods are appropriate given that $N \le p$ . Running PCA on my dataset in MATLAB for example returns 22 principal components (n-1), in which most of the variance is stated to be accounted for within the first 10 or so components. I don't truly believe the PCs generated will be a good representation of my data though due to the low sample size: a feature ratio which is undesirable when running PCA . Am I correct in thinking this or am I still okay to use PCA on my data? What might be an alternative dimensionality reduction technique I could implement that may be more suitable?
