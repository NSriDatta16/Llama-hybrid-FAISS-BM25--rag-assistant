SpaCy vs AllenNLP?

I have used a little of both spaCy and allenNLP in my NLP projects. I like them both as they work very well with PyTorch (my DL framework choice!). But, I still cannot decide which one to master in a long term so that I can increase the pace of my NLP projects in future. Can someone please share their experience or suggest the differences between these 2 libraries or pros and cons?
