Name of PDF? - projecting uniform probability distribution on the unit circle to the x-axis

Consider a uniform probability distribution on a circle of radius r, i.e. $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \}$ .If we wish to project onto the x-axis, we can consider each point on the circle to contribute $\delta(x-rcos(\theta))$ . Then averaging over all possible values of $\theta$ yields the following distribution: $Pr(x) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}$ Intriguingly, the Fourier transform of Pr(x) happens to be the zero order Bessel function of the first kind, i.e. $J_0(2\pi r f)$ Question: What is this distribution Pr(x) called? I distinctly recall it having a Wikipedia page dedicated to it, and it being named after some mathematician. EDIT: It is equivalent to the Arcsine distribution on the interval (-r,r), but I could swear I've seen it with its own page under a different name.
