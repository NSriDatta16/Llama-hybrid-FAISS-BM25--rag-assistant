R mlogit and McFadden R^2 (strange?) value

I was a little bit surprised by the high value of the McFadden R^2 given by the "mlogit" R package for this simple model: f = mFormula(mode ~ log(cost) | 1 | 1) "mlogit" gives the following output: Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t-value Pr(>|t|) 2:(intercept) -4.002328 0.103865 -38.534 If I try to compute the McFadden R^2 "by hand", I have to estimate the null model, (i.e. mFormula(mode ~ 1)), for which I obtain Coefficients : Estimate Std.Error t-value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept):2 -2.558537 0.026906 -95.091 If I'm not wrong, given the LL value of -9138 of the model, the McFadden R^2 is computed as 1 - (-9138 / -10212) = 0.105, which is very different from 0.621. Note that I have aggregated data, and that the discussion in How to calculate pseudo R2 when using logistic regression on aggregated data files? might be useful here, as I use a weighted logit. Did I miss something or is the R^2 provided by the "mlogit" package not accurate when computed for weighted models ?
