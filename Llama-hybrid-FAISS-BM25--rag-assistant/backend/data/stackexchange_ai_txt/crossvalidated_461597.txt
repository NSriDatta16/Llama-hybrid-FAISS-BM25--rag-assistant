Differencing is applicable for stochastic non-stationary time series while time trends are applicable for deterministic non-stationary series. See the discussion here stochastic vs. deterministic trend in time series and ADF test fail to reject while kpss and box say white noise and stationary as to possible ways to identify which is more appropriate for any individual time series. Decompose a time series data into deterministic trend and stochastic trend might also be of help to you .
