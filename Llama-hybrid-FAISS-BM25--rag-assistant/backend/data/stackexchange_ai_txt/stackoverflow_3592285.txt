Does using the first one with -nw work? that should prevent an X window being opened, but there should still be enough of the 'GUI' part of emacs present to be able to initialise the faces system. It's still not as elegant as -batch (it'll fail if run from a non-terminal process, eg crontab) but it'll be less irritating.
