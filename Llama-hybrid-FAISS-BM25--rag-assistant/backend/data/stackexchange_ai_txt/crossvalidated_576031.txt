Probability of seeing sun rise tomorrow using Bayes theorem

When Richard Price's published the Bayes theorem, he gave the example of a man seeing the sun-rise for the first time and wondering if it happened everyday. With each observation thereafter, he updates his belief (i.e. the sun does rise everyday) using Bayesian reasoning. This question tries to analyze the same problem. It is a stormy night and an alien prisoner is abandoned on the frigid earth during the first ice age. Scared, he finds a cave and only comes out for a few hours at night to find some food. He has no luck though. After spending 6 nights like this, hunger becomes unbearable and so on the 7th night he decides to venture out for a little longer. After a few hours, he sees the skies changing colors. The only time he saw them change color before was during thunderstorm lightning on the night he was dropped. This time, however, he witnesses a glorious sunrise. He came from the dark side of a tidally-locked planet (i.e. one side always faces its star and the other side is forever dark). On his planet, days are not tied to the sun, but time (24 hours is measured as a day). As the warmth soothes him, he wonders if this is an one off event on earth or if the sun will rise again tomorrow. How can he use Bayes theorem to update his beliefs? Bayes Theorem Total number of nights observed = 7 Total number of times sky changed colors = 2 (once due to lightning and once due to sunrise) Total number of times the sunrise happened = 1 P(belief | observation) = P(observation | belief) x P(belief) / P(observation) P(Belief) = The sun will rise tomorrow P(Observation) = Sky changed colors P(Sun will rise | Sky changed color) = P (Sky changed color | Sun will rise) * P (Sun will rise) / P(Sky changed color) Day 2 P(Sun will rise | Sky changed color) = (1/2) * (1/7) / (2/7) = 0.25 Day 3 P(Sun will rise | Sky changed color) = (2/3) * 0.25 / (3/8) = 0.44 Day 4 P(Sun will rise | Sky changed color) = (3/4) * 0.44 / (4/9) = 0.74 Day 5 P(Sun will rise | Sky changed color) = (4/5) * 0.74 / (5/10) = 1.184 Why does the posterior probability go beyond 1? What am I doing wrong here?
