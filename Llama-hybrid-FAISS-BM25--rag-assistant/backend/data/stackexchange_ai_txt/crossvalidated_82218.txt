I did similar classification problem last fall in the context of churn analysis with our CRM data. I used logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees. ROC-analysis is one method for evaluation of probabilistic classifications from several models, it is not tied to logistic regression and it uses all cut-offs from range [0,1]. But this was just a start of analysis. Next method for evaluation of classifications was setting explicit cost-values for false positives and false negatives. Then I just decided to make a cut-off at point which minimizes total costs. Reason why I wanted to have explicit cost values was that our business users could say to me what is relative importance of different false classifications with respect to each other. Can your business users say what is relative importance of various cells in the confucion matrix?
