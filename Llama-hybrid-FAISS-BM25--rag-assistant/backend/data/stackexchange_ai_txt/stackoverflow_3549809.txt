PeZ is exactly correct. You can find information about how to do it here , but I commented because I wanted to reinforce an additional pitfall of embedding fonts. First, it will make the size of your SWF increase quite a bit, because it creates outlines of every single character in the font set you use. To resolve this, you should limit down what characters are actually embedded - if possible. You can learn more about ranges here . Also, remember that you need to embed bold and italics as well if you are using them in your application. In other words, something like this: @font-face { src: url("/style/MyriadNormal.ttf") ; fontFamily: Myriad; fontWeight: normal; unicode-range: U+0021-U+007B; /* whole range of uppercase, lowercase, symbols and punctuation. */ } @font-face { src: url("/style/MyriadBold.ttf") ; fontFamily: Myriad; fontWeight: bold; unicode-range: U+0021-U+007B; /* whole range of uppercase, lowercase, symbols and punctuation. */ } Remember that every version of a font you embed will increase the SWF size as well - so if you embed a normal, bold, and italic font you triple up the size.
