Well, this depends on a lot of things. In experience, maturity has very little to do with age. If you act like an adult, chances are you'll be treated like one. If you work, and gain the experience to back yourself up, you will absolutely be taken seriously. I am 15 years old, and I spend a lot of time in language communities like Clojure and Haskell, and Ioke as of late. I don't act like an average teenager, so I'm not treated like one. I have never come across any sensible, well-meaning software developer that didn't at the very least respect my skills and enthusiasm. Most of the time, people are just amazed that I know as much as I do at such a young age. All in all, if you act like an adult, you'll be treated like one. Just don't act like a 'kid', and you wont have to deal with such things. Good luck.
