You seem to be bringing together several concepts here, and you might want to clarify what your objective is, before going down the path of DeepAR or some other complex Deep Learning model: Predicting future oil levels: This is a time series problem only if the main input variables to your model is multiple past values of oil levels, and the target output variable is the same variable in the future (e.g. for sales forecasting we tale the sales number from the last 104 weeks to forecast out the sales for the next 26 weeks). You can have additional inputs (which in this case are called external regressors) but the main input variable has to be the past values of the predicted variable itself, for it to qualify as a time series problem. Even if it is a time series problem, you might not need to use a Global model like DeepAR. Often times local Statistical model like ARIMA or a State Space approach are more suited for a time series use case than a deep learning approach. Global Deep Learning or ML based time series models are only suited when you have 100s or 1000s of parallel time series that you want to predict simultaneously, and rich meta-data to connect the different time series together, or when you have a single time series but which is very dense and has a very high signal to noise ratio, like an IoT signal with a very complex pattern that is at a 15 minute granularity, but with data going back several weeks or months. Predicting wear and tear in various industrial and manufacturing equipment is typically treated as a mean time to failure problem, not a time series problem. You might want to look into that approach as well. You mentioned modeling it as a time series problem for downstream anomaly detection purposes. Not all anomaly detection problems require a dynamic time series signal. Often a static (stationary if you want to get technical) model like K-Means or Isolation Forests is more suitable. The only time your anomaly detection would require a time series based approach, is if the same oil levels can be considered anomalous during sometime of the day or the week, and expected during other times. If a certain set of oil levels is always either anomalous or expected, regardless of the time stamp, then use a static anomaly detection algorithm. Those are much easier to deploy and monitor anyway.
