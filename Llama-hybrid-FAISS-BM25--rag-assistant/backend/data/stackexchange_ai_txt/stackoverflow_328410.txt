There's a wide range of possible opportunities here. Let me add the following choices: Physics with a focus on complex networks. This has applications in biology, epidemiology, sociology, finance, and computer science. A good machine learning program, with statistics, data mining, text analysis, and computational learning theory. Industrial engineering/operations research, with simulation, reliability, and process control. I'd be happy to talk further about this, please put questions in comments.
