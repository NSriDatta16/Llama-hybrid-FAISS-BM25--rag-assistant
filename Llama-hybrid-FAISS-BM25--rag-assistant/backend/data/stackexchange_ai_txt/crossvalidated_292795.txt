How to improve classification algorithms when the features are unlabeled?

hey guys I'm dealing with data that has around 15 features that are all positive, real numbers but I have no idea what the features are. The headers of my data are all just "feature1", "feature2", "feature3", etc and a column of binary targets {1, 0}. I want to know what I can do aside from just trying a bunch of different classifiers. How could unsupervised learning help in this case? Could I somehow use dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover relationships between the features?
