super() returns a proxy object, not the parent class (because you can have multiple inheritance), so that wouldn't work. Using isinstance() is your best bet, although there's no way to make it as elegant as the dictionary lookups using type(arg) . I don't think allowing alternative argument orderings is a good idea; it's liable to lead to nasty surprises, and making it compatible with inheritance as well would be a significant headache. However, it would be quite simple to make a second decorator for "use this function if all the arguments are of type A", or "use this function if all the arguments are in types {A, B, E}".
