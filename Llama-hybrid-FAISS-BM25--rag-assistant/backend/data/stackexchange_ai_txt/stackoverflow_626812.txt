Most elegant way to clip a line?

I have a Rectangle2D and a Line2D. I want to "clip" the line so that only the part of the line which is within the rectangle remains. If none of the line is within the rectangle I want the line to be set to (0,0,0,0). Basically something along the lines of a Rectangle2D.intersect(Line2D src, Line2D dest) or something similar. Is there a way to do this with the java.awt.geom API? Or an elegant way to code it "by hand"?
