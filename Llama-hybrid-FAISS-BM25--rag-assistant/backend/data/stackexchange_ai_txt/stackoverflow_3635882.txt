Android has its own GUI framework and doesn't use Swing/SWT (what Jigloo seems to be for), so I don't think you can use it to build Android GUIs. When you open a layout XML file in Eclipse and click the 'layout' tab, you can get a rough idea of what it will look like anyway. You could check out DroidDraw if you want a drag and drop GUI builder, although I'm not sure how regularly updated it is.
