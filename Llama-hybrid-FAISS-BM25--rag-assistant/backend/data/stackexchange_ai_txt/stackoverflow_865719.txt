How to make slider labels clickable [Flex 3]

I have a simple slider, with only 3 options. It seems strange to force the user to drag the small thumbnail on the slider, when it would be a lot easier to click one of the 3 actual labels by the side of the slider. Does anyone know how to accomplish this?
