SQL Server Replication Error

I have a SQL Server 2005 box set up for merge replication to SQL Server CE 3.0. The publication, publisher, distributor and IIS have all been set up. In my application, I attempt to sync the databases using the following code: //TODO: Change for production //*************************** string localDBPath = @"C:\Documents and Settings\Robert\Desktop\MyDB.sdf"; //*************************** SqlCeReplication replicator = new SqlCeReplication(); replicator.InternetUrl = "http://myWebServer/sqlcesa30.dll"; replicator.Publisher = "mySqlServer"; replicator.PublisherDatabase = "myDatabase"; replicator.PublisherSecurityMode = SecurityType.NTAuthentication; replicator.Publication = "myPublication"; replicator.Subscriber = Dns.GetHostName(); replicator.SubscriberConnectionString = @"Data Source=" + localDBPath; try { // Check if the database file already exists if (!System.IO.File.Exists(localDBPath)) { // Add a new subscription and create the local database file replicator.AddSubscription(AddOption.CreateDatabase); } // Transfer the initial snapshot of data if this is the first time this is called. // Subsequent calls will transfer only the changes to the data. replicator.Synchronize(); } catch (SqlCeException ex) { // Display any errors in message box MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); } finally { // Dispose of the SqlCeReplication object, but don't drop the subscription replicator.Dispose(); } Unfortunately, this code fails at the "replicator.Synchronize" line with the following error message: Failure to connect to SQL Server with provided connection information. SQL Server does not exist, access is denied because the IIS user is not a valid user on the SQL Server, or the password is incorrect. This error message is not very clear to me and I am running out of places to look for the cause of this. Any ideas?
