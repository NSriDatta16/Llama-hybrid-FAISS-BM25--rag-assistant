Start and Stop SQL Server on my development laptop

I have SQL Server Express on my laptop. I only need to hit it every few weeks. Running SQL Server sucks up a fair bit of memory on my laptop so I was wondering what is the easiest way to turn off SQL Server when not using it? What I have done thus far is to create two batch files on my desktop. One brings SQL Server up with this command: net start "sql server (sqlexpress)" and the other takes it down with this: net stop "sql server (sqlexpress)" Is there a more elegant way to do this? Maybe a tool try app or something other than batch files?
