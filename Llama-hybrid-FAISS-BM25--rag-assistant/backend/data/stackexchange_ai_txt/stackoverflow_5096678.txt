Replace text inside Wicket AjaxLink

I have created a new AjaxLink in my .java file add(new AjaxLink("link"){ private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; @Override public void onClick(AjaxRequestTarget target) { target.appendJavascript("window.open('http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/23/libya.protests/index.html?hpt="+T1+"')"); } }); And added it to my .html file TEXT TO REPLACE The url is just an example but T1 is dynamic and I get that from my .java file. I would like the "TEXT TO REPLACE" to equal the T1 string but I don't know how to do this. I have tried creating a Label and adding it like but that gives an error. Any suggestions? Thanks
