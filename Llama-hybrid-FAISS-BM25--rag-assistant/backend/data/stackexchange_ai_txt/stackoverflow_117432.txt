Boost.DateTime has millisecond and nanosecond representations IF the underlying platform supports them. While it is using platform specific code, it is keeping those details out of your code. If that is a big deal, they do have another way of doing platform independent subsecond resolution. This page a couple of paragraphs down talks about how to do it. (From the Page) For example, let's suppose we want to construct using a count that represents tenths of a second. That is, each tick is 0.1 second. int number_of_tenths = 5; //create a resolution independent count -- divide by 10 since there are //10 tenths in a second. int count = number_of_tenths*(time_duration::ticks_per_second()/10); time_duration td(1,2,3,count); //01:02:03.5 //no matter the resolution settings
