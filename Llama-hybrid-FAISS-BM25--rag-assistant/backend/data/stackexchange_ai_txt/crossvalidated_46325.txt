Smoothing a time series of ratios

I have a time series of proportions, $x_t = \frac{a_t}{b_t}$ i.e. $x_1 = 2 / 30, x_2 = 1/10$, ... I want to smooth $x_t$. Should I apply a smoothing function directly to $x_t$, or should I smooth $a_t$ and $b_t$ individually, then recompute the proportions? My gut tells me you should smooth the individual time series, and then recompute. Suppose each of the three time series have noise (this is why we would be interested in smoothing to begin with), then maybe $a_t = f(t) + \epsilon_a$, $b_t = g(t) + \epsilon_b$. Then the proportions $x_t = \frac{f(t) + \epsilon_a}{g(t) + \epsilon_b}$, which could be smoothed by taking $\hat{x_t} = \frac{\hat{f(t)}}{\hat{g(t)}}$
