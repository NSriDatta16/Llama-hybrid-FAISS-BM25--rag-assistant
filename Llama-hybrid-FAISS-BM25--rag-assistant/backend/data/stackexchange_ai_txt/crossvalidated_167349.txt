From where I can learn to use scikit learn

I have read text about machine learning and I feel that I have gained sufficient knowledge that I can start applying them practically. I have programming experience in python so I want to learn how to use scikit learn. I went through documentation but I left it because I couldn't quite get it. Are there any resources (books or courses etc) from where I can learn to use scikit learn?
