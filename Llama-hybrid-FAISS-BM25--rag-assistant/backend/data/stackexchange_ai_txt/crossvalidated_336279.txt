In a logistic regression you don't know the probability $p(x)$ of $Y=1$ given $X=x$ and hence calculation of the log odds (with the assumption that $p(x)$ is correctly specified by the logistic link) is not readily possible. How did you calculate the odds of admit ? To get identical results you need to calculate $p(x)$: bindata This will result in the same estimated coefficients. > coef(glm.logistic) (Intercept) gpa -4.357587 1.051109 > coef(lm.out) (Intercept) gpa -4.357587 1.051109
