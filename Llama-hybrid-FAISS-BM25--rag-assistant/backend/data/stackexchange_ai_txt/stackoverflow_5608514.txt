Simple&Easy way: Add some css class to every 'window' when you open it. You are already opening those sliding windows so this shouldn't be a problem. Then when that submit button is pressed, you just find element with that class and hide it (display:none / slide back / .. whatever) + remove that class. There are of course more complicated and more elegant ways how do it. It depends on your needs and situation.
