Difference between $y_t = \alpha + \beta t$ and $y_t = y_{t-1} + \beta$

Would someone mind walking me through the differences between: \begin{align} y_t &= \alpha + \beta t \\ &\& \\ y_t &= y_{t-1} + \beta \end{align} as well as between \begin{align} y_t &= \alpha + \beta t + a_t \\ &\& \\ y_t &= y_{t-1} + \beta + a_t \end{align} where I believe $a_t$ is a sequence of independent normal random variables, $\mathcal N(0,1)$? Basically all I can draw from this is that $y_t = \alpha + \beta t$ is a regression model where there's a dependent variable and independent variables and $y_t = y_{t-1} + \beta$ is a time series model that depends on the past and some variable $\beta$. Clearly that isn't a very good explanation of what the difference between the equations are.
