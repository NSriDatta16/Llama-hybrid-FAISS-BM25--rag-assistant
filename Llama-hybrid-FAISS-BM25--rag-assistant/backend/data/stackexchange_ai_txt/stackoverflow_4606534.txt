Eclipse Workspace concept questions (or "Am I even close to understanding this workbench thing?")

I'm just starting to use Eclipse and I feel like I'm missing something in the workspace concept. From what I can glean a workspace is just an assemblage of pieces/parts of the IDE that can be arranged in different ways. For instance one might have a Java workspace and a Python workspace that had different elements available and organized in different arrangements. Is that a good working understanding? If I'm most likely going to have a single set of working components that I use across projects is one central workspace logical? Folks that have been using Eclipse for a while, do you generally have a single workspace, or do you have different ones for different groups of projects? If the latter, what dictates the desire for an additional workspace? Thanks in advance!
