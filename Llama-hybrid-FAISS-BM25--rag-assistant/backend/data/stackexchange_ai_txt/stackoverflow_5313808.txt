EDIT: Since you have figured out the error and the way you have described it, I can only assume that it is happening because the Storage plugin won't store a number. basically myindex is a number when it is returned by the $(this).index() call. However doing a "" + myindex converts it into a string. To check the theory, try this $.Storage.set("whichp", myindex.toString()) You are trying to store a variable mystring which isn't defined anywhere. Should you not be storing variable myindex instead? This should work $('P').click(function () { var myindex = $(this).index() if (!$.Storage.get("whichp")) { $.Storage.set("whichp", myindex) } else { alert($.Storage.get("whichp")) } });
