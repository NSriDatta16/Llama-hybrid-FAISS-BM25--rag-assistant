Using XML gives you the advantage that a XML tool can be used to process the JSPX file in one or other way. A XML parser, a XML validator, a XML transformer, a XML marshaller, etc..etc.. That's all. I have never used JSPX. I have never had the need to have it massaged by some XML tool. Just plain JSP with a HTML5 doctype and no scriptlets . All Java code go in Java classes. Works perfect. For the real MVC works I use Facelets (with JSF). Facelets is less or more the successor of JSP. It's XML based and the major advantage here is that a XML processor can be used to generate HTML output.
