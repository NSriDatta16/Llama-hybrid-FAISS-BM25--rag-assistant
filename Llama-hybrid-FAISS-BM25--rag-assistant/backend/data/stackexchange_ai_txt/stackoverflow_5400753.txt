A Question on OpenGL ES 2.0 and Alpha / Stencil Tests

I have a quad covering the area between -0.5, 0.5 and 0.5, -0.5 on a cleared viewport with a stencil and alpha buffer. In the fragment shader I apply a texture which happens to have a shape -- in this case a circle -- outside of which it is fully transparent. I am trying to figure out how I can essentially "cut" that non-alpha textured shape out of the next draw of the shape, such that I draw the first quad, offset to some degree (say between -0.3, 0.5 and 0.8, -0.5) and draw again, and only the non-overlap of the non-alpha texture is drawn of the second quad's texture. It is easy enough doing this with a stencil buffer, such that it applies to the quad and is blind to the texture, however I would like to apply it to the texture. So as an example of the function what I want actually rendered of the conceptual circle texture would be a crescent in that case. I am not sure what tests I should be using for this.
