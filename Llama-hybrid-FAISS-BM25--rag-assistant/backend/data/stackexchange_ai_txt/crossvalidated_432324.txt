Time Series assumptions for iid $\epsilon$

thanks for reading my post. I know its fundamental and rather easy qns but I'm seriously struggling. Please help me, thank you very much! Let $\boldsymbol{X}$ have a distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$ , and let $\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}$ = $\boldsymbol{X}$ for all $t$ . (a) Show that { $\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}$ } is weakly stationary. $\mu_{t}$ = $\mu$ $\mu_{t}$ does not depend on $t$ $cov(Z_{t+h},Z_{t})$ = $\sigma^{2}$ $v(t+h,h) = v(h) = v(-h) = \sigma^{2}$ By definition, { $\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}$ } is weakly stationary (b) Find the autocovariance function for { $\boldsymbol{Z}_{t}$ }. $cov(Z_{t+h},Z_{t})$ = $\sigma^{2}$ (c) Suppose $X$ and $\epsilon_{t}$ are IID Normal, show that $y_{t}$ = $X\epsilon_{t}$ is White Noise, but $y_{t}^{2}$ − $E(y_{t}^{2})$ is not White Noise. I have no idea if I can just assume for $\epsilon_{t}$ distribution iid normal with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$ . Could someone enlighten me with the proof? Also, if my way of answering (a) and (b) is right? I tried for part(c): Below is my attempt: $E(y_{t}) = E(X\epsilon_{t}) = E(X)E(\epsilon_{t}) = \mu * 0 = 0$ $v(0) = cov(y_{t}) = cov(X\epsilon_{t}) = \sigma^{2} $ $v(h) = cov(y_{t},y_{t+h}) = cov(X\epsilon_{t},X\epsilon_{t+h})$ = 0 Thus, $y_{t}$ is a white noise distribution with mean 0 and variance $\sigma_{z}^{2}$ . $y_{t}^{2} = X^{2}\epsilon_{t}^{2} $ $E(y_{t}^{2}) = E(X^{2}\epsilon_{t}^{2}) = E(X^{2})E(\epsilon_{t}^{2})$ $E(y_{t}^{2} - E(y_{t}^{2}) ) = E(y_{t}^{2}) - 0 = 0$ $v(0) = cov(y_{t}^{2} - E(y_{t}^{2})) = cov(y_{t}^{2}) - cov(E(y_{t}^{2})) = cov(X^{2}\epsilon_{t}^{2}) - Cov(0) = \sigma^{4} $ $v(h) = cov(y_{t}^{2} - E(y_{t}^{2}),y_{t+h}^{2} - E(y_{t+h}^{2})) = cov(y_{t}^{2},y_{t+h}^{2}) = cov(X^{2}\epsilon_{t}^{2},X^{2}\epsilon_{t+h}^{2}) = 0$ Since $v(0) = \sigma^{4} \neq \sigma^{2} $ $y_{t}^{2}$ − $E(y_{t}^{2})$ is not White Noise.
