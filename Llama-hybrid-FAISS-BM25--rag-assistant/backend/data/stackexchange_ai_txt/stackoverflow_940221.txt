How to allow users to modify front end menus?

I am writing a backend/admin area for a website. The users want the ability to modify their menu's on the website. These menus can be hierachical no more than 3 levels deep. Do you allow users to do this? How do you store the hierarchy? How do you programmatically display the menu? How do you make it easy for users to create hierarchies - some sort of jQuery drag/drop? Look forward to your replies.
