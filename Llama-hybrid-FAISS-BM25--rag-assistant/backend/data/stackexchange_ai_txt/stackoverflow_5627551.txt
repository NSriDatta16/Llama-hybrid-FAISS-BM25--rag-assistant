Libsvm python error

I'm trying to figure out what is the proper format of a python list to be given as input to a svm_problem function in python. I got the following program from the web, stackoverflow. I have the following: from svm import * x=[ [1,0,1],[-1,0,-1],[1,0,0]] #x=[ [1,0,1],[-1,0,-1]] prob = svm_problem( [1,-1],x ) param = svm_parameter(kernel_type = LINEAR, C = 10) m = svm_model(prob, param) print m.predict([ 1,1, 1]) It raises an assertion error, says assert failed: assert len(x)==len(y) . But if x=[ [1,0,1],[-1,0,-1]] , the program works perfectly. Am I not supposed to give a train-data problem of length more than 2? Also I don't understand what in x=[[1,0,1],[-1,0,-1]] is a label and what is the data? Any help is highly appreciated.
