I fear that in the long run you may find piping into R and reading the standard output to be rather troublesome. I suggest a few alternatives you could look into: Rserve provides a headless R server you connect to via tcp/ip; a sample C++ client exists Direct R embedding as per the `Writing R Extensions' manual (but you'd drop down to a lot of fairly bare-metal C code) RInside wraps the R API for embedding in much higher abstraction C++ using the sibbling package Rcpp . Plus, I recently added a detailed example of how to do that from Qt which is now in SVN (but not yet on CRAN); there is also a detailed blog post about it.
