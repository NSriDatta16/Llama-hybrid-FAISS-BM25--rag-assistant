Storing many objects using Java

I'm reaching out to the community here to understand if there is a way to store many objects in a Java map structure (> 500K). I know at some point my application will exceed its memory footprint if I use the Java Collections API and I'm looking for other solutions (outside of distributed caching). My intention is to store something to the effect of Map >. Requirements: Structure will be immutable (one time load into the map). Only read access. Access to the map needs to be fairly quick but not looking for low latency retrievals, more concerned about storing and retaining these objects in memory. Does anyone know of such a library I can utilize that can achieve this or has anyone ever come across a solution in which they were required to load many objects in memory in Java? I'd be very interested in hearing your feedback. Thanks.
