String stream object in .NET library

Is anyone aware of a .NET class for encapsulating a collection of objects (strings in my case) which allow for Stream-like reading, seeking, etc. Essentially I need a List that has a GetNext method that will return the next object and update the current reading position. This wouldn't be hard to impliment (possibly with extension methods) but I wanted to leverage any currently developed .NET classes that may already exist. EDIT: I want to add that the data will always be accessed in a forward manner (i.e. no need to seek to a spedific position) or just reset to zero. So it seems like an IEnumerator may work.
