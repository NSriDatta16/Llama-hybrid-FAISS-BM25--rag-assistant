Matching relies on the calculations for the variance derived in Abadie & Imbens (2006). It is an unusual estimator that requires re-matching of the units. A&I demonstrated that the ratio of the effect estimate and this variance is asymptotically standard normal, so the p-value comes from evaluating that ratio (i.e., the t-statistic) in the typical way (i.e., using pnorm() ).
