That's simple. It's explained in man bash : /bin/bash The bash executable /etc/profile The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells ~/.bash_profile The personal initialization file, executed for login shells ~/.bashrc The individual per-interactive-shell startup file ~/.bash_logout The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits ~/.inputrc Individual readline initialization file Login shells are the ones that are read one you login (so, they are not executed when merely starting up xterm, for example). There are other ways to login. For example using an X display manager. Those have other ways to read and export environment variables at login time. Also read the INVOCATION chapter in the manual. It says "The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files." , i think that's a spot-on :) It explains what an "interactive" shell is too. Bash does not know about .environment . I suspect that's a file of your distribution, to set environment variables independent of the shell that you drive.
