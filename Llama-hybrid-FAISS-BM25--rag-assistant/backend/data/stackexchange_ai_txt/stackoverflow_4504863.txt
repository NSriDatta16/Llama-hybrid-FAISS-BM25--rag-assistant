In addition to existing good suggestions there is one rather simple thing to do: use cursor API (XMLStreamReader), NOT Event API. Event API adds 30-50% overhead without (just IMO) significantly making processing easire. In fact, if you want convenience, I would recommend using StaxMate instead; it builds on top of Cursor API without adding significant overhead (at most 5-10% compared to hand-written code). Now: I assume you have done basic optimizations with Woodstox; but if not, check out " 3 Simple Rules for Fast XML-processing using Stax ". Specifically, you absolutely should: Make sure you only create XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory instances once Close readers and writers to ensure buffer recycling (and other useful reuse) works as expected. The reason I mention this is that while these make no functional difference (code works as expected) they can make big performance difference; although more so when processing smaller files. Running multiple instances does also make sense; although usually with at most 1 thread per core. However you will only get benefit as long as your storage I/O can support such speeds; if disk is the bottleneck this will not help and can in some cases hurt (if disk seeks compete). But it is worth a try.
