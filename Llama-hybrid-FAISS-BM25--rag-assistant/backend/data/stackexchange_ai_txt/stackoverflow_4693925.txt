JAXB ( JSR-222) is the Java standard for mapping objects to XML. There are several implementations including: Metro , EclipseLink MOXy (I'm the tech lead), Apache JaxMe , etc. JAXB is designed to map existing object structures to XML. In your example you are leveraging JAXB's ability to generate a class model from an XML schema. This produces something like a "typed DOM". There will be a Java class matching each complex type (with the necessary inheritance relationships), and a property matching each attribute/element. For example the following class corresponds to the SwitcherType complex type: import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType; @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD) @XmlType(name = "SwitcherType", propOrder = { "switcher", "receiver" }) public class SwitcherType extends DeviceType { @XmlElement(required = true) protected SwitcherType switcher; @XmlElement(required = true) protected ReceiverType receiver; public SwitcherType getSwitcher() { return switcher; } public void setSwitcher(SwitcherType value) { this.switcher = value; } public ReceiverType getReceiver() { return receiver; } public void setReceiver(ReceiverType value) { this.receiver = value; } } Unlike a DOM there are no generic getChildren() methods. Although you could implement these yourself by modifying the object model. For more information on JAXB: http://blog.bdoughan.com/
