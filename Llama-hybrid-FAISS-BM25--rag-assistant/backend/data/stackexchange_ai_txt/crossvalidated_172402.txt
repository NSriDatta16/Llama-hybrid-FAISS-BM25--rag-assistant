Is there an intuitive way to understand a sequential Monte Carlo Markov Chain?

I was wondering if there was an intuitive way to understand what a sequential Monte Carlo Markov Chain is. It also goes by the name of particle filtering. Is there an intuitive way to think about it/teach it to someone? Thanks!
