How do I go from number data to string data (NN)?

I am quite confident with using number data with a neural network, but I want to use string data. My question is where do I begin? Obviously you cant times weights and strings together (x * w) because they are of different data types, so what should I do to the string data to turn it into numbers? If you're interested, here is my dataset. It's by no means the final version but here it is just to give you an example. It's based on spelling: enormous..........| Difficulty: 2 rhythm..............| Difficulty: 3 hamster.............| Difficulty: 2 walk...................| Difficulty: 1 accommodate...| Difficulty: 3 blue....................| Difficulty: 1 projector.............| Difficulty: 1 regression..........| Difficulty: 2 go.......................| Difficulty: 1 playwright........| Difficulty: 3 weird.................| Difficulty: 3 conscience.......| Difficulty: 2 ...so after training, when I will input a word, the network should return either 1, 2 or 3, depending on how hard the network thinks the word is to spell. To sum up, my question is: I am used to using number data with my projects instead of strings, so what steps should I take when creating a network based around strings for the first time? I use numpy only
