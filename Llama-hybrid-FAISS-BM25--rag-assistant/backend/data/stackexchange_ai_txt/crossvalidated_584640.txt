Beta estimates outside of -3 to 3

I am performing logistic regression with glmmTMB with random intercepts and random slopes in R, with 5 fixed effects. I have 9 different datasets that I am running through the same model. Before running my model I have centered and scaled each dataset. If I understand correctly, my beta estimates should be between -3 and 3 because of the standard deviations associated with scaled and centered data. Well, in 4 of my datasets, the beta estimates for one particular covariate range from -3.13 to -5.89. I have double checked these datasets and everything appears to be fine. Depending on the dataset, my sample size is 28-32 animals. So my questions are: Is my understanding correct that beta estimates should be between -3 and 3 with scaled and centered data? If this is true, what could be causing my beta estimate to be outside of this range? Could it be due to too much (or too little) variation for this particular covariate? If so, what can I do about this?
