Can I multiply samples' scores in PCA to project new data?

I have m1 rows (samples) and n columns (variables) in matrix A, and m2 rows and n columns in matrix B (n>m1 and n>m2). Normally, I performed PCA on matrix A and got a low-dimensional representation of m1 samples, and then projected m2 samples into the low-dimensional subspace via multiplying the rotation matrix. Now I am thinking about what if I perform PCA on matrix A's transposition, and then I will get n variables (now they are samples )'s score matrix M . My question is, is it correct to project matrix B via multiplying M , and what is the difference between these two approaches? Thank you in advance!
