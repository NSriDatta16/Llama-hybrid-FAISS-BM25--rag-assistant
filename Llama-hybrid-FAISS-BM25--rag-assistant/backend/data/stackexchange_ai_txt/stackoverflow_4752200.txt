Phase I Read the text into a single string. Split the lines into an array (lines[]) on the newline character (\n). Phase 2 Initialize a stringbuilder. Loop through the lines collection, and split each line into words array on the space character. Then loop through the words array and append each one to the string builder. When the line length exceeds your threshold insert a newline character. When you're at the end of the the lines array, check that the stringbuilder !EndsWith the newline character (your last line was exactly the threshold length, and then add two newline characters for a paragraph break.
