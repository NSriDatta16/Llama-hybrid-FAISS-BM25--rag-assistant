Getting same output for relatively different features in Random Forest Regression

I am wokring on a regression model (random forest in this case) that predicts energy consumption in X hours ahead. The trained model gets as an input historical energy consumption. Which it uses to calculate certain features (e.g. lag energy, consumption in similar hours, etc) and then estimates energy consumption in the next hour. The estimated consumption would be then be added to the historical data to estimate the consumption in the following hour and so on. My problem is that it seems for the first few hours, the estimated consumption value is the same. And it only starts to diverge after a while. This happens even though the features are actually changing in each iteration. Below is an example of feature values and their corresponding model output Is this behaviour normal? If not what are the typical mistakes that could lead to this issue? index f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 Model output 0 772.58 2826.54 324.67 1581.91 1.00 1.00 0.00 51.00 691.68 1 509.97 2847.04 691.68 1533.58 1.00 1.00 1.00 51.00 691.68 2 569.34 2866.52 691.68 1544.21 1.00 1.00 2.00 51.00 691.68 3 691.68 2885.35 691.68 1504.43 1.00 1.00 3.00 51.00 691.68 4 691.68 2902.96 691.68 1540.28 1.00 1.00 4.00 51.00 701.68
