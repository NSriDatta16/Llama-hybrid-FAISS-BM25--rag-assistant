Intuition about Bias in LDV / DLM with Fixed or Random Effects

Problem I am failing to obtain an intuition for why estimates from a time series model that includes a lagged dependent variable as a predictor and random (or fixed) effects for individual units are biased, particularly when the number of time periods is small. And when I refer to estimates, I really mean those associated with other predictors in the model (not the lagged DV or the fixed/random effects) that are likely to constitute the quantity of interest in my typical scenario. These models may also be called hierarchical/mixed DLM/LDV models. And a simple example looks like this: $$ y_{it} \sim N(\rho y_{it-1} + \alpha_i + \beta x_{it}, \sigma)$$ As a start, I can see that $y_{it-1}$ and $\alpha_i$ are correlated. I can imagine that $\alpha_i$ might explain away some of the variance $\rho y_{it-1}$ would explain if $\alpha_i$ weren't present. But my existing intuition suggests that these would be balanced based on how well they each explain the data in conjunction with one another. Importantly, I can't see how $\beta$ would be biased by this. What am I missing? The following references suggest the bias is real, they make an attempt at explaining why, and they provide solutions. But I cannot wrap my head around the underlying issue. Can anyone provide a not-too-math-focused intuition for the issue? References Anderson, T. W., & Hsiao, C. (1981).
