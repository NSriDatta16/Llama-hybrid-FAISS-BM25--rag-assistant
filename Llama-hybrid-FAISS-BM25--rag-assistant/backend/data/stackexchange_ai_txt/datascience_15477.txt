State of the art approaches for Information retrieval tasks based on deep learning

I am interested in the state of the art approaches for information retrieval (IR) tasks, where you have a single query and a set of documents and the IR model will give you the best matched document. I have worked on vector space models (tfidf-cosine similarirty ) and LSA. I have also tried Wordnet, NER, fuzzy matching etc for improving the accuracy. Now I would like to know how to improve accuracy of IR tasks by applying nueral networks, word embeddingstopic models etc by capturing more context/sematics information
