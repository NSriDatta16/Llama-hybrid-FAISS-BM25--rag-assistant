c++ container for checking whether ordered data is in a collection

I have data that is a set of ordered ints [0] = 12345 [1] = 12346 [2] = 12454 etc. I need to check whether a value is in the collection in C++, what container will have the lowest complexity upon retrieval? In this case, the data does not grow after initiailization. In C# I would use a dictionary, in c++, I could either use a hash_map or set. If the data were unordered, I would use boost's unordered collections. However, do I have better options since the data is ordered? Thanks EDIT: The size of the collection is a couple of hundred items
