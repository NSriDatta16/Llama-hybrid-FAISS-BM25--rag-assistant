Why not just take the loss function used in robust linear regression, and plug in your forecasts with the corresponding actuals for a hold-out sample? (where "forecasts" are calculated using backtesting for that hold-out sample). For example, if Huber loss function is used in the regression then just use that functional form to calculate average value of the loss function on a hold-out sample.
