Regression analysis to estimate affinity or antipathy among celebrity wedding parties

Please consider the following plot of a graph: Each node represents a wedding party while each edge is the relation between the two parties expressed in terms of the number of people who attended both weddings (with an edge of weight 0 in case of no common participant). Each node $V_i$ has two attributes: size $S_i$, the number of people participating, and time $T_i$, the year the wedding took place. Each edge $E_{ij}$ has one attribute: weight $W_{ij}$, the number of participants that $V_i$ and $V_j$ have in common. I am interested in comparing each relation $E_{ij}$ against the whole dataset to understand which relation is stronger/weaker than expected. In other words, I want to obtain from the data a benchmark value — or the dataset "average" when controlling for the the two nodes attributes size ($S_i$ and $S_j$) and time ($T_i$ and $T_j$) — for each edge and then comparing the "average" to the real value of $W_{ij}$. Put simply, what I want to infer from my data is whether the community participating to a weeding party $V_i$ shows an affinity or an antipathy with the community participating to $V_j$. Because of my limited statistical tool-box, I though of simply proceeding with a regression analysis with weight ( shared_ppl in the R script below) as response or dependent variable. As predictors I used mult_size (as $S_i \times S_j$) and time_diff (as $\left|T_i - T_j\right|$). As it is reasonable to assume, I want to test whether the size of the parties are correlated with weight and the difference in time are correlated with weight , and I want to estimate sign and quantity of both correlations. In my simple example (see below for complete script) the linear regression $\mathbf{shared\_ppl} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mathbf{mult\_size} + > \beta_2 \times \mathbf{time\_diff}$ will return the following coefficients: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -6395.7169331 3558.2955398 -1.797 0.0891 . mult_size 0.0016097 0.0008846 1.820 0.0855 . time_diff -7.1564129 3.0076486 -2.379 0.0286 * (NOTE: I know that the p-value for mult_size is slightly above the standard .05, but still let's considered it for the sake of the example as significantly correlated to shared_ppl ) Now I can "predict" for each $E_{ij}$ an expected $\hat{W}_{ij}$ and then compare it with the real $W_{ij}$. Specifically what I did was to calculate the difference (labelled as offset in the script) from the .95 confidence interval produced by the model. Then a value of 0 would indicate that $W_{ij}$ of the relation $E_{ij}$ is within the .95 confidence interval for $\hat{W}_{ij}$ as predicted by the regression analysis above a value of -14.37 would indicated that $W_{kl}$ of the relation $E_{kl}$ is short of 14.37 people if compared to the .95 confidence interval for $\hat{W}_{kl}$. The offset for each relation is plotted below Then, given my model above, I can infer from the data that $V_i$ and $V_j$ do not show neither reciprocal affinity or antipathy, while $V_k$ and $V_l$ do show reciprocal antipathy Are my analysis and its conclusions correct from a statistical point of view?
