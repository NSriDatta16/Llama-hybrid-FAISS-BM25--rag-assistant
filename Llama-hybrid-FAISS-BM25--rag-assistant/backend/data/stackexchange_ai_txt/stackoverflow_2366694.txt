Getting a list of compiled dlls/pdbs for use in AfterBuild in MSBuild

The jist is I want to copy all the compiled files from a project to another folder after a build is finished. I figured I would use a Copy task in the AfterBuild target. Is there any way to get a list of built files in this target so I know exactly which files to copy? Thanks Update: Read my comment below to see how I figured this out. However, this isn't an elegant solution. What I am really looking for is an ItemGroup of built files. Does that exist?
