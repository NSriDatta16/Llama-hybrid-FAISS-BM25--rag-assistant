WebKit Hyphenation

Has anyone successfully been able to implement hyphenation in any of the WebKit browsers? I've tried the CSS3 hyphenation style as well as -webkit-hyphens: auto . No dice for either of those. Or maybe I'm doing something wrong? Note: I've only tried Safari and Chrome on a Mac. Update: Code example div { -webkit-hyphens: auto; } Anaideia, spirit of ruthlessness, shamelessness, and unforgivingness Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Antidisestablishmentarianism, Floccinaucinihilipilification, Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia
