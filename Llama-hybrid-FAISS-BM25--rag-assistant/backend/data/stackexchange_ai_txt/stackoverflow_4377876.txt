Why not use localStorage while the user is editing a document and the FileWriter API when they want to save it to disk? Most people are used to seeing a save dialog pop up when saving a document. The only scenario I can think of that warrants userless access to the FileWriter API is an autosave feature, but autosaving to localStorage can be just as good.
