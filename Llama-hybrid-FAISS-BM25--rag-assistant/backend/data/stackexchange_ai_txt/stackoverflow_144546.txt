I started out using the Infragistics control also which is great and is very powerful, but it's difficult to use because it's features are so extensive. I feel the same way about ComponentOne. I've switched over to the DataGrid CPT from Microsoft, and I've had a lot of success with it. Obviosly it's not as feature rich at this point as other 3rd part controls, but overall I'ts really good.
