You cannot dynamically create Greasemonkey scripts with Greasemonkey (alone). A GM script is not part of the HTML page, so writing GM code to a page will never work. The script needs to be installed into GM's script management system. A GM script cannot write to the file system, nor access sufficient browser chrome to install a script add-on. You might be able to write a GM script that posts other scripts to a server, and then sends the browser to that server. GM would then prompt the user to install the new script. You might be able to write a browser add-on that could write GM scripts, but I suspect that this approach will be difficult. You probably could write a Python (or C, VB, etc.) program that generates GM scripts for installation. With extra work, such a program could probably automatically install the script, too. Why do you want to dynamically create Greasemonkey scripts, anyway? There may be a simpler method to accomplish the true goal.?. Update for OP comment/clarification: Re: "I want to be able to have a user select an element to get blocked and then create a script that sets that element's display to none on all sites from that domain" ... One way to do that: Store domain and selector pairs using GM_setValue() . The script would, first thing, check to see if it had a value stored for the current page's domain or URL (using GM_getValue() or GM_listValues() ). If a match was found, hide the element(s) as specified in the selector. Note that, depending on the element, the excellent Adblock Plus extension may be able to block the element much more elegantly (saves bandwidth/DL-time too).
