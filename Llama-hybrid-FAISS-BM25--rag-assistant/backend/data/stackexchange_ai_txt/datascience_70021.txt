Model selection metric for validation phase in deep learning

I have been taught that for each epoch in training, we perform a training phase, and then a validation phase where we decide whether the new set of parameters is better than the current best. This selection of parameters is done using the same loss function that we use for training, but applied to validation data instead of training data. My question is, does the metric used in the validation phase really have to be the same loss function, or can it be some other metric, such as accuracy or average precision?
