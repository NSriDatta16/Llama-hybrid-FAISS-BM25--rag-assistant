What is your primary object? It appears to me that it's the HumanBody and that appendage lengths are simply attributes of that. By all means have an Arms collection if you think you're going to find a lot of humans with more than two arms :-) But I think you'll be able to get away with your first solution for your given example. Once an object starts getting hundreds of attributes then, yes, you should think about organising it in a more hierarchical fashion. As to the best way to do that, we'd have to see your actual requirement.
