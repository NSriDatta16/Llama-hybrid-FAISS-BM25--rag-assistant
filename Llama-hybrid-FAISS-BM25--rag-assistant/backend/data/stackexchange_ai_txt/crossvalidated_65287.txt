Difference between forecast and prediction?

I was wondering what difference and relation are between forecast and prediction? Especially in time series and regression? For example, am I correct that: In time series, forecasting seems to mean to estimate a future values given past values of a time series. In regression, prediction seems to mean to estimate a value whether it is future, current or past with respect to the given data.
