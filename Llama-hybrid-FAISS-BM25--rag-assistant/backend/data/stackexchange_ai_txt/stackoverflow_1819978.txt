Code review: Determining whether a folder exists, given the full file path?

With a function being passed a full path to a file, such as C:\someFolder\anotherFolder\someXML.xml , determine whether the folder exists. Is there a smarter/better/more elegant way of doing this? Here is my implementation: Private Function FolderExists(ByVal fullPath As String) As Boolean Dim folders() As String = fullPath.Split("\") Dim folderPath As String = "" For i As Integer = 0 To folders.Length - 2 'subtract 2 to avoid appending the filename. folderPath += folders(i) + "\" Next Dim f As New DirectoryInfo(folderPath) Return f.Exists End Function
