How does gradient boosting calculate probability estimates?

I have been trying to understand gradient boosting reading various blogs, websites and trying to find my answer by looking through for example the XGBoost source code. However, I cannot seem to find an understandable explanation of how gradient boosting algorithms produce probability estimates. So, how do they calculate the probabilities?
