Is it correct to combine PCA and NMDS axes in a multiple regression?

I am considering to do a multiple regression in which some of the predictive variables are PCA (principal components) axes whereas others are NMDS (nonmetric muliple dimension scaling) axes. I would like to know if this is incorrect and why . I'm considering this because I have two groups of many variables that I want to reduce before analyzing the relative effects of each of these groups over another variable. The first group is composed by anatomical variables from several species which are best represented by a Phylogenetic PCA. The second group is a bunch of environmental variables which are very non-normal and that I can't normalize through transformation (I tried several and the variables remained with exponential distribution). What would be a correct way to reduce all variables before doing the multiple regression via generalized least squares?
