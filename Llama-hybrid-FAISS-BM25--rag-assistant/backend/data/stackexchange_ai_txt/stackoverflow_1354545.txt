Desktop application help framework

Consider the requirements for embedding help in a Java desktop application (or applet): Single source for content (such as AsciiDoc ) to generate high quality PDF manuals 1 Hooks for context-sensitive help Robust, simple, and well documented API (under an hour to learn) Small footprint (a sub-100K Java archive) 2 Integrate as a docked MDI-style window, or a separate window Free open source software Google says: JavaHelp Java Programming Help Help Authoring Tools Which of these, or any others, would you recommend? 1 Storing the content in AsciiDoc format would be ideal, so long as conversion is trivial. 2 Up to 500kb.
