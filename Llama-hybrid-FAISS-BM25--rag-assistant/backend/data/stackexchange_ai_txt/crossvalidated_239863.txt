Asymptotic maximum likelihood estimation is claimed to be a cross validation equivalent technique . Regardless, for time series, this is only a magnitude of goodness of fit criterion. It yields no information about how times series models extrapolate to non-interpolated times. Indeed, arbitrary models would generally do a poor job of extrapolation. For extrapolation, only models that fulfill multiple other conditions are useful, and such conditions are most typically ignored. If you would be so good as to specify more exactly what type of answer you are requesting, I may be able to give you more relevant information.
