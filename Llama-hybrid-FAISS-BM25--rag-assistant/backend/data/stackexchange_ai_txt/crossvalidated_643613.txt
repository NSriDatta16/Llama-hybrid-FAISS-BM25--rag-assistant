A method that is often used together with K-medoids is maximising the Average Silhouette Width (Silhouette method) . In general, estimating the number of clusters is a hard problem, particularly because there is no unique definition of what a "correct/true" clustering actually is, and neither a correct or true number of clusters. What is good will generally depend on background information such as the meaning of the data, the aim of clustering, and how the clustering will be used. (You may be aware that the gap statistic requires tuning decisions, see the documentation of clusGap in R, and different tunings that are in use give different numbers of clusters on many data sets, which illustrates the difficulty of the problem.) A more general approach similar to the gap statistic is in Hennig, C., Lin, CJ. Flexible parametric bootstrap for testing homogeneity against clustering and assessing the number of clusters. Stat Comput 25, 821â€“833 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-015-9566-5 . This requires the user to come up with a homogeneity null model (similar to the uniform in the gap statistic) though.
