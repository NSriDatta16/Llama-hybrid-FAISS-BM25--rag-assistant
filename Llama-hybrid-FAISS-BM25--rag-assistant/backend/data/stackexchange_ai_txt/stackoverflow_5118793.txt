Android SQlite password encryption?

So I had an idea for an Android App (just for learning) since im just starting out. it would basically be an app that lets your "store/vault" your passwords you need to remember. But it would encrypt/decrypt them through SQlite (which would be the storage median). What types of encryption can Android/SQlite3 do?
