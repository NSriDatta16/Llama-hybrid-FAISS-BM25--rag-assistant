Logistic Regression with Non Binary Predictors

I have some data where each row has features and an output variable on the interval [0,1] . The output was likely the result of logistic regression, but we have no idea of the event data and want to recreate a logistic regression model without binary events. In other words, we will aim to recreate the model that works with our output (i.e. probabilities). What is the best way to do this: a) Perform a logistic regression with the data as it. b) Convert probability to event data and therefore code as {0,1} . c) Multinomial regression. Any thoughts or nuances would be most welcome.
