Machine learning is a field with many diverse techniques. Thus, whether can you apply it here depends very much of what you are trying to achieve and what technique you have in mind. Perhaps, you could describe it more precisely in your question. Having said that, the small size of the dataset (there are a bit more than 200 countries in the world) rules out some approaches, such as artificial neural networks. On the other hand, clustering approaches (e.g., hierarchical clustering) could provide some valuable insights.
