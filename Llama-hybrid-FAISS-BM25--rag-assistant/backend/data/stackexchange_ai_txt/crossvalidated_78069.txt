It depends a bit on why you have two measurements per person for each technology. If this is to get a better measurement, you could get the average across the two and run a model like lme(averageintention ~ ease + useful + technology, random = ~ 1 | person, data=dataset, method="ML") or with any interactions that might seem valid. Running mixed models is much easier with R compared to SPSS, especially to compare different models and get more insights into the different effects. If you find technology has a significant effect in the model, you could then subset the model for the different technologies and run it again. In R you could do this by first creating a variable for the separate technologies, e.g. tech1Sub and then rerunning the model as follows: lme(intention ~ ease + useful + technology, random = ~ 1 | person, data=dataset, method="ML", subset = tech1Sub)
