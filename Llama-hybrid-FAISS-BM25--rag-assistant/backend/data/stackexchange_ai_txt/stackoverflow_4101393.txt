Developing a syntax for a language i'm thinking about designing

I'm thinking about desiging a language similar to qbasic in syntax but even simpler so that a new programmer can learn some programming without being discouraged by something like C,C++, or C#. For example, use Write "Hello World" instead of PRINT "Hello World" or In "Enter your name" Read = name instead of INPUT "Enter you name" name$ I'm looking for more suggestions on my syntax. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
