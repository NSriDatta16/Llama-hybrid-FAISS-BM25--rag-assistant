In General: Denormalize as much as possible. Refer to entities via their Key whenever possible; it is the fastest way to get data out of the datastore. Specifically, you could likely get a dramatic increase in your performance if you used ReferenceProperty to establish relationships rather than codes that go into filters. I am going to guess that querying for a UserFoo's Foo happens a good deal more often than removing and remapping Foo's, yeah? In that case, the pragmatic and datastore-wise thing to do is to use Reference Properties. Also, if the Foo-UserFoo relationship can be denormalized into a single entity, you remove the need for an entire series of queries altogether.
