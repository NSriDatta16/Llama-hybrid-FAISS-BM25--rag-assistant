What is expected true error?

In [1] and [2], the authors give formulas for the expected true error of various resampling protocols (CV, bootstrap) associated with a score function Q . I'm not sure to understand exactly what is this notion. In particular, does is it have any relationship with the bias of CV (or boostrap) as an estimator of Q ? Can this be used to detect under/overfitting (with a measure of variance)?
