Short answer: Sure, give it a shot. However, you are assuming that the time variable is linear. So either increasing or decreasing over time. This most likely isn't going to hold. This is fundamentally the reason time series analysis exists; time trends tend not to be linear, they are noisy. You can add higher-order variables with the lm() function so it allows the relationship to be parabolic or even more "wavy" with cubed terms or higher. But at some point this leads to meaningless overfit that isn't useful.
