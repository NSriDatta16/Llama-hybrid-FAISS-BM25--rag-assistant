I know this is 2 years old, but it might help someone at some point. Background knowledge comes in many forms, from prioritized features to whole Ontologies or other meta knowledge constructs. Dealing with this problem before, I have, for example, been able to represent my background knowledge as a graph (which it normally is anyways), and used its hierarchical properties to prioritize features when actually learning. As mentioned before, you can always resort to Bayesian methods, but the problem with them is the computational complexity, so be prepared to wait. A lot.
