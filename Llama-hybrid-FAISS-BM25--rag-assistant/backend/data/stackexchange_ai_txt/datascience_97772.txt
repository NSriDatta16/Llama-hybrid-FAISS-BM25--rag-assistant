One of the primary differences between fitting a logistic regression model and proportion for each combination is the difference between fitting a single overall model and many separate individual models. Fitting a logistic regression will create a single model that will attempt to accommodate the outcomes for all combinations. Fitting a separate model for each combination will better model each option but will be more complex and might lead to overfitting. Choosing between the modeling options depends on the goal of the project.
