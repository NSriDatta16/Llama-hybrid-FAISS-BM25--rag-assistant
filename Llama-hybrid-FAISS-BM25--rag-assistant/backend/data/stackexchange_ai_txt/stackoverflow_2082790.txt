There are many things you can do to reduce your memory footprints, I'm sure people have written books on the subject, but a few of the major ones are: Compiler options to reduce code size (including -Os and packing/alignment options) Linker options to strip dead code If you're loading from flash (or ROM) to ram to execute (rather than executing from flash), then use a compressed flash image, and decompress it with your bootloader. Use static allocation: a heap is an inefficient way to allocate limited memory, and if it might fail due to fragmentation if it is constrained. Tools to find the stack high-watermark (typically they fill the stack with a pattern, execute the program, then see where the pattern remains), so you can set the stack size(s) optimally And of course, optimising the algorithms you use for memory footprint (often at expense of speed)
