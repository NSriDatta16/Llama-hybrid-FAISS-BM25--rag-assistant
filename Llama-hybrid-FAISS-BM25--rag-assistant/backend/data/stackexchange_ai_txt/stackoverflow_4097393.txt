I've just integrated the Sailthru_Client class into Magento, thought this might help. I have sailthru.php , the Sailthru Client API, which contains Sailthru_Client class. I created magentoroot/lib/Sailthru folder then copy sailthru.php into it, then renamed to Client.php making it magentoroot/lib/Sailthru/Client.php . This pattern is auto-loaded by Varien_Autoload class.
