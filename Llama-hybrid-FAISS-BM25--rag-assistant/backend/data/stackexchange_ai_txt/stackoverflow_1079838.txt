How about navigating to the article page in the way a user would do it? Your step When I go to the article page could be changed to When I go to the page for the "Article Title" article and your step definition goes to an article overview, finds a link with "Article Title" and navigates to the page that way. You get more test coverage, and don't have to worry about IDs.
