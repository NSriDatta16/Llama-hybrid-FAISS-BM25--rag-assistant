If you want to compare recognition rates, you will always get a difference, and thus should test the difference for statistical significance with an appropriate test. As you have paired data for each test image, and as the output is binary (recognition is right or wrong), a McNemar test should be appropriate. Note that both kNN and CNN depend on a number of parameters, and you should optimize these parameters on a different set than the test set.
