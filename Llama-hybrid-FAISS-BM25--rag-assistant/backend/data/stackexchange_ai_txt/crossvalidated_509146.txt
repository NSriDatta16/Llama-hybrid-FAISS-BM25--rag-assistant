Not really what your question asks, but I feel its obligatory to mention that it can be problematic to model likert-type scale data as continuous and linear (which is what a linear regression is doing here). If you wanted to be more true to the data generating process then I would suggest an ordered logistic regression. Now to your original question, assuming we're going to stick with a linear regression framework and acknowledge the limitations, one option might be to mean center and standardize all of your DV's and then interpret them as as such. There's probably other (better) approaches, but this was the first that came to mind for me.
