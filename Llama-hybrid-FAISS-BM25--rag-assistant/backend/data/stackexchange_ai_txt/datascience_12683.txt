I haven't worked on many time series problems, so take my answer with a grain of salt. Having said that, it's not clear why you can't you just treat all predictors the same, in other words treat previous values of the univariate target series and independent predictors as regular predictors. I don't see what is special about the element of time that makes it especially difficult to train/learn like any other type of ordinary predictor. If time is truly important, then the neural network will demonstrate that importance by weighting your multivariate lagged variables accordingly during training. This sort of reasoning would apply to any type of model, not just neural networks. For example, the same could be said of gradient boosting.
