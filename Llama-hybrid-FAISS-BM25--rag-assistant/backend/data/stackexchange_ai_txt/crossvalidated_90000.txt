Sample size calculation for logistic regression using simulations

I want to find the sample size for logistic regression where I have a covariate with 15 levels and the covariates interacts with time, which means that the effect of the covariates is different for different periods of times. Can anyone help me find the sample size and effect size? I wish I could do this using simulations. Is there a code in SAS or R?
