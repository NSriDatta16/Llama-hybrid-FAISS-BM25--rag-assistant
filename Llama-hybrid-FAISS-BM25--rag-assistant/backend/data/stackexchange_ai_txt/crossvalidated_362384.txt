... to have a high Cook's distance because that's when the market lost its value most compared to other dates Your statement describes a data point that tend to be away from the rest of the data. This concept is not really expressed by Cook's distance, but rather by " leverage ". If you make a leverage plot, you'll see that 32nd point does have a very high leverage. Yet, high leverage is only part of the game. Just because it's an extreme point does not elevate it automatically to be an influential point that tilts the regression results. There are generally two outcomes: a high leverage point that happens to be well predicted (aka, has low residual) and a high leverage point that happens to be badly predicted (aka, has high residual.) The former one does not tend to have high Cook's distance, the latter does. In this case, if you check the standard residual, the 32nd point is well within $\pm$1 standard deviation. It's well predicted. While the 7th point is -2 SDs away.
