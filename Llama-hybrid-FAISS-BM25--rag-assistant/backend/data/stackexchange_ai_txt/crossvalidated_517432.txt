Your conclusion holds even if you drop the assumption that $X_n$ is a Markov chain. In general, if $Y$ and $Z$ are any two random variables both having state space $\{0, 1\}$ , then by the second version of the law of total probability given by Wikipedia, $$ P(Z = k) = P(Z = k | Y = 0)P(Y=0) + P(Z = k | Y = 1)P(Y=1) $$
