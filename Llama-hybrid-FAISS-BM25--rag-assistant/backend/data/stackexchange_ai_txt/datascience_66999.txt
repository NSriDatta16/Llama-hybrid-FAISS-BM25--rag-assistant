How many trees does a Random Forest need?

At first, I did a GridsearchCV and the best parameter I found was 100, i.e., a random forest with just 100 trees. My trainset has 80,000 rows and 669 columns. My test set has 20,000 rows and 669 columns. How is it possible that such small number of trees is enough?
