RCNN - recurrent convolutional neural networks - what is a time step?

I am currently studying this paper for implementing it into a speech recognition application, but seem to have some problems understanding the concepts of time step. What is a time step? I haven't worked with RNN before but would guess that in a continuous stream of data time step would be the data present at time t. but how do one even implement/train something like that in an iteration based system?... I mean something like keras, one is not able to involve output received from t-1 to t... or if so, how?, I seem to be unfamiliar with this... In another paper i found this To understand the essen ce ofthe RCL, it is useful to c1arifY the concept oftime step in RCL. It is not identical to the time associated with the sequential data, and instead it refers to an iteration during processing the data. from RECURRENT CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR SPEECH PROCESSING which then further conforms my theory of it being being about the data that was involved/processed as iteration t-1.
