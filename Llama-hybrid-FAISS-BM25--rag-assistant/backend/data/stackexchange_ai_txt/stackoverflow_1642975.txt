Folder and file organization for Python development

What is the best way to organize code that belongs to the same project in a Python development environment? What are the do and donts of Python project organization? Do you separate each class in a file? Project A Classes "subsystem1" class1 class2 subsystem1Module "subsystem2" "utils" "etc" Tests Whatever etc? Any suggestions? Oh, and please describe what are the (possible) problems of each type of organization. What are considered best practices for organizing Python code?
