What is all the browser agent stuff?

I am new to ASP.NET and wanted to capture details about people on my site. So I capture the Request.UserAgent attributes to file. Can anyone explain how to deconstruct these so I know what they mean? I am actually stumped by some of the user agents I see. Examples: IE2.0d; WinNT: Mozilla/1.22 (compatible; MSIE 2.0d; Windows NT) : Never heard of IE2.0, so is this spoofed for scanning my site, and why? Also, how is IE related to Mozilla in this case? IE6.0; WinXP: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; YPC 3.0.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; yplus 4.4.02b) : People seriously use IE6.0 these days?? And what is all the rest of that stuff, like YPC and yplus? Mozilla0.0; Win2000: Mozilla/4.76 [en] (Windows NT 5.0; U) : Hmmm... That's a weird Mozilla version?
