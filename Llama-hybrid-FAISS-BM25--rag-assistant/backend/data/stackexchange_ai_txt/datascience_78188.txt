Alternative regression model algorithms for machine learning

I am looking for not so known regression models and if possible a python library that implements it. In my quiver I have: Generalized Linear Models, Linear, Lasso, Ridge... Decision Tree based model: CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision trees(xgb,lightgbm,catboost) Support Vector Machines Knn Regressor Neural Networks Are there regression algorithm less known? I am looking for alternatives models to add to my quiver.
