You have a binary (yes/no) response variable, so logistic regression would be a natural starting point. But the nesting structure means that the usual independence assumption would fail. That can be modeled with a random effects model (or mixed model ), in R with the lme4 package. If you will post (a link to) the data I can have a look. Assuming enough observations, something like the following code: library(lme4) mod0 will fit a pure random effects model. Fixed effects can also be included. Many examples on this site, for instance Specifying and Interpreting Mixed effects logistic regression and many others.
