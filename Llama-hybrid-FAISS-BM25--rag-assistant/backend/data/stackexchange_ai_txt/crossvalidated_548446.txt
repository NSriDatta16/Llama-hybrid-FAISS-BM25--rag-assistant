There's a simple principle that exlains this: $E(x)+E(y) = E(x+y)$ $Var(x+y)=Var(x) + Var(y) +2*Cov(x,y) $ When working with means (expected values) they are just linearly related. So adding first or averaging first gives the same results. However, with variance (and, by extension, standard deviation) you have to take into account the covariance. So the order really matters.
