Why are cv-qualifiers in template parameters ignored?

I had some code that was failing to compile, which amounts to something like what's shown below. After some digging around, I came across paragraph 14.1 note 5, which states: The top-level cv-qualifiers on the template-parameter are ignored when determining its type. My code looks like this: #include #include class Bar {}; template void Func(T t) { std::cout void Func(const T& t) { std::cout It gives this compilation error: In function 'int main()' error: call of overloaded 'Func(const Bar&)' is ambiguous Can someone comment on the reasoning behind the this rule in the standard?
