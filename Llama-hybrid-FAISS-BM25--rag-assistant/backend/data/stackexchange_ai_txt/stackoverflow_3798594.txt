Depending on whether the server checks the IP address trying to use the token (probably a cookie, but doesn't have to be) against the one that logged in, it might be possible for a thief to use that cookie to gain access to your account. A well-designed site will not only cause sessions to time-out but also restrict them to a single IP address (and browser user-agent, etc).
