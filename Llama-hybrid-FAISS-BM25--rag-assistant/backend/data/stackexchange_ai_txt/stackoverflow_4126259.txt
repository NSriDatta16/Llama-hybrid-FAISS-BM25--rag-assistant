Using HBase to store time series data

We are trying to use HBase to store time-series data. The model we have currently stores the time-series as versions within a cell. This implies that the cell could end up storing millions of versions, and the queries on this time-series would retrieve a range of versions using the setTimeRange method available on the Get class in HBase . e.g. { "row1" : { "columnFamily1" : { "column1" : { 1 : "1", 2 : "2" }, "column2" : { 1 : "1" } } } } Is this a reasonable model to store time-series data in HBase? Is the alternate model of storing data in multiple columns (is it possible to query across columns) or rows more suitable?
