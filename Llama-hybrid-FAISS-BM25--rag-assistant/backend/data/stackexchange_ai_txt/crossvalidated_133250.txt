I believe that the Law of Large Numbers explains why the variance (standard error) goes down when the sample size increases. Wikipedia's article on this says: According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. In terms of the Central Limit Theorem: When drawing a single random sample, the larger the sample is the closer the sample mean will be to the population mean (in the above quote, think of "number of trials" as "sample size", so each "trial" is an observation). Therefore, when drawing an infinite number of random samples, the variance of the sampling distribution will be lower the larger the size of each sample is. In other words, the bell shape will be narrower when each sample is large instead of small, because in that way each sample mean will be closer to the center of the bell.
