To calculate AVE: sum up each squared factor loading, divide it by the number of indicators The average inter-item correlation is simply the average or mean of all your items correlations So they are different things. I believe AVE is an indicator of construct validity as how much variance is explained by a given latent variable. if your latent variable is not explaining an accepted amount of variance in its indicators, then it is a poorly defined latent variable but MIC is to test the internal consistency reliability of your items and concerns the reliability of your latent variable
