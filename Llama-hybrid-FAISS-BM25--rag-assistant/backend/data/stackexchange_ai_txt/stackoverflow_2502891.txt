Assuming that the net weight of your data crosses the memory limit, I can't see how objects could be of help. For the purposes of data storage, they're just a different form of notation, really. Maybe one method will save a byte per piece over the other - I don't know, but if there's a difference, my bet is objects are more expensive. But I think the general question is what you are trying to do with that lot of data? Could it be feasible to store parts of it to disk or the database, and have only a part of it in memory?
