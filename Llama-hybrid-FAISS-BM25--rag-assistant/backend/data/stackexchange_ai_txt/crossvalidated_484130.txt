Poisson model with overdisperssion

I'm working with a dataset $X$ (of length $N$ ) of count data, which looks like: I developed a statistical model which can be improved, so I'm asking for any suggestions, for instance, differnet likelihoods or prior selection, different approach, anything... My model This data shows a large overdispersion ( $\mu ), thus a Poisson likelihood, $f(X|\lambda) \sim \mathcal{Poisson}(\lambda)$ , is not a good choice. Reading literature about count data with overdisperssion, I decided to model $f(X|\lambda)$ as a Negative Binomial distribution, thus $f(X|\lambda) \sim \mathcal NB(r, p)$ Parameter estimation In order to not to end up with a very complex set-up, I've performed bayesian estiamtion of the hyperameter $p$ , letting $r$ be computed from the data: in a Neagative Binomial distribution, $r$ is related to the first and second moments of the distribution following: $ r = \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2 - \mu}, \text then $ $ \hat r = \frac{\bar X^2}{var(X) - \bar X} $ The whole set-up is: Likelihood : $f(X|p) = \mathcal NB(\hat r, p)$ Prior : $f(p) = \mathcal Beta (0, 0)$ (non informative, improper prior) Posterior : $f(p|X) = \mathcal Beta (0 + \hat rN, 0 + \sum X)$ which returned the following posterior predictive distribution: The first and second moments of the predictive posterior distribution are very close to those in the data (I've let the data have a huge impact in the posteriors since I've choosen a non-informative prior). Also, the point estimate posterior predictive (using $\mu_p$ ) does not differ from an averaged predictive posterior distribution over all possible values of $p$ . Once again, any suggestions for improvement? EDIT What about a zero-truncated non negative binomial distribution?
