SQL comma delimted column => to rows then sum totals?

I am using MS SQL 2005 I have a problem, which currently I am battling to get a solution. I have a Table, with a these columns : NameList;Time The Namelist Column has comma delimited data in it. The table data is as such: Namelist Time John Smith, Jeremy Boyle, Robert Brits, George Aldrich 5 John Smith, Peter Hanson 15 Jeremy Boyle, Robert Brits 10 .... I need some sort of SQL expression that will provide me with this end result: Name Total_Time John Smith 20 Jeremy Boyle 15 Robert Brits 15 Etc...... Basically the expression must find All the names in the rows and math those names with the names in the other rows and add the times together for each user. The Idea I have is to convert the comma delimited data into rows and count the distinct records of each then somehow know what the time for it is... then multiply..... but I have no idea on how to implement it Any Help would be much appreciated Thanks,
