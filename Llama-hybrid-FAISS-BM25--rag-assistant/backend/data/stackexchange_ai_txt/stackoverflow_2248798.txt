As far as I understand what you've done in your project, what you are seeing is the normal behaviour of any scrolling window in iPhoneOS. That is, your UIWebView is wide enough to contain all the HTML content displayed within so while it will move when you drag it, it springs back to its original position when you let go. The fact that the UIWebView is wider than the screen due to the fact that you've rotated it, but not resized it, means that you can't see it all the HTML content, but as far as the UIWebView is concerned it's all visible so it doesn't let you properly scroll it, it just bounces.
