Yeah, there's a better way. You want to create a map, which associates your "category" ("fruit") with a string List of your elements ("apple", "banana", etc.). Then you want to look up your "string1" in your example above from the map and see if your associated string List Contains() your "string2". This makes it entirely data-driven, and leverages the built-in abilities of the Collections more successfully.
