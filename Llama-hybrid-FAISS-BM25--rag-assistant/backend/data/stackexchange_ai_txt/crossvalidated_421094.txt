If we are using a flat prior, this is simply a game where we try to come up with a flat prior in a reparameterization that doesn't make sense. For example, suppose we want to make inference on a probability. If we put a flat prior on the log odds of the probability, our 95% credible interval for the actual probability is the two points $\{0,1\}$ before we even see the data! If we get a single positive data point and construct a 95% credible interval, it is now the single point $\{1\}$ . This is why many Bayesians object to flat priors.
