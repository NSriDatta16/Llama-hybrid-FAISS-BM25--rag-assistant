If I am returning simple data (not a page), I probably wouldn't use aspx; that is really web-forms, but what you are returning isn't a web-form. Two options leap to mind: use ASP.NET MVC; sounds corny, but it really is geared up to return different types of response much more elegantly use a handler (ashx) - which omits all the web-form noise, just leaving you with a HttpContext with which to construct your response You could also try (within aspx) clearing the response ( Clear() ?) and calling Close() afterwards. But IMO a lot more roundabout than just using a handler.
