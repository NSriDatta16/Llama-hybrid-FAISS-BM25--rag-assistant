I think you have several problems: 1) you are missing a ";" from the end of the statement: $(tr).append(td) 2) your "TBODY' element does not have a closing "/TBODY". 3) the logic with "cont" is convoluted and may be flawed. It looks as if you are only creating 3 "td" elements per row, but I'm not sure.. Concerning the code itself, I'm afraid I have to agree with "Helle", I would code it the following way: function properties(){ //This function gives to all of the elements inside //the widgetsCol that create the pages. var wdgTr, cont = 0, wdgBox = $('#widgetsCol'); // Create the table skeleton $(wdgBox).first().before(" "); wdgTr = $(' ').appendTo('#wdgBod'); $(wdgBox).children().each(function(index, element){ $(' ').append($(element)).appendTo(wdgTr); $(element).attr({new: 'true'}); // Add the new attribute to the element makeDrag(element); // Make it draggable if (cont != 2) {cont++;} else {cont = 0; wdgTr = $(' ').appendTo(wdgBod);} }); } I would also add a few comments to make it more obvious what you are doing with "cont".
