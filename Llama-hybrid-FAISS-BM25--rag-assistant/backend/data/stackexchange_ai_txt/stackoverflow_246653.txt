It might not be an issue with your site. Some browser plugins - for instance, Firebug or Web Developer - often add extra styles dynamically to the page for debugging purposes; I've noticed the unofficial -moz-* styles pop up in my own Firefox debugging. However, this isn't necessarily a problem with your page; it could be a problem that your user agent is first creating itself, and then assuming later that there's a problem with your page. First, I suggest trying to disable your Firefox plugins and seeing if you still get aforementioned error. Then, make sure your plugins are up-to-date - especially any development/debugging type ones that might be manipulating the DOM after pageload.
