Scientific papers using "entry" level Econometric procedures

I am studying Econometrics on a Masters' level. I have a pretty good grasp of the theoretical aspect of different processes, from dummy variables to time series, stationarity or simultaneous models (etc.). My problem is I struggle to proceed further. Whenever I try to read a scientific paper and try to replicate their process, so as to understand on a real empirical research level how econometrics are applied, the levels of the papers are much more advanced than the textbooks and I really struggle to understand them. What I was looking for is if you have any suggestion or list of papers that use econometric methods, the difficulty of which would lie somewhere in between textbook exercises/case studies and very advanced papers. I know it's a weird request and if you have any other advice it would be more than welcome. I really have difficulty taking my econometrics knowledge a step further. Thank you in advance!
