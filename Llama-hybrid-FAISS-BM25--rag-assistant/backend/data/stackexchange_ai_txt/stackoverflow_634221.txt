C# Web Service Impersonation

If I enable impersonation in a web service with identity="someID"... As web service is MTA application the impersonation that is applied may be applied to a worker thread and not the thread that actually call the method... I guess you might get an access denied error...Without problematically doing impersonation .. just by enabling it in webconfig .. what changes will i have to make to my function which does some clever stuff? The element within Web.config supports optional user name and password attributes which allows you to configure a specific fixed identity for your Web service to impersonate. This is shown in the following configuration file fragment... what else do i need to write? System.Diagnostics.Process[] p = System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses(); p.GetExccutiong(); Console.WriteLine();
