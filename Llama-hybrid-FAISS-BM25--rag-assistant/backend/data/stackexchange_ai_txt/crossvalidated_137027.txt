What models allow the study of the relation between two sets of variables?

Usually when you think of a model you have a single target variable which you associate to explanatory variables to try and find a pattern. In contrast with the idea of having a single target (dependent) variable I would like to study the relation between sets of variables, these sets consist of more than one variable. A first technique that comes to mind is Canonical Correlation Analysis. Bayesian Networks and other graphical models, I guess, can also be used to analyse such things. Any other methods I should be aware of and what could be their conveniences and drawbacks?
