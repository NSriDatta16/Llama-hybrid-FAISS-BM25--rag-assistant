Euclidian distance vs cosine similarity

Currently I'm working on facial recognition. If I use encoding/feature vectors of 2 images which method will prove more accuracy, L2 norm or cosine similarity and why? I read "ICA performs significantly better using cosines rather than Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, whereas PCA performs the same for both." Why is this true? When those methods will fail? And if other better approach is possible.
