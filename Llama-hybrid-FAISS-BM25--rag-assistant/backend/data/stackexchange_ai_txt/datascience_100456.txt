VQ-GAN understanding

I tried to understand how VQ-GAN works, but unfortunately I have not understood it. I tried to read some articles about it and watch a video. I believe a good and simple article will help me. You helped me with transformers . You gave me wonderful link. I know what CNNs, GANs, TRANSFORMERSs, and CLIP are. I somehow understood a bit how VQ-VAE works, but still do not understand some things about it. But I cannot understand how VQ-GAN works. Please, help me to understand it. Thanks.
