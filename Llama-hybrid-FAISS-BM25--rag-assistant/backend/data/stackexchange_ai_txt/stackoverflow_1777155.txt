SVN branches can be used for this, but you keep ending up with the effort of having to merge your branches every so often. I wouldn't do this. Though perhaps not wildly elegant, I'd go for your first suggestion: Put a configuration parameter somewhere that your build process can change it for you automatically, and if() s around the affected code. Change your build process so it will create player jars and testing jars at the same time.
