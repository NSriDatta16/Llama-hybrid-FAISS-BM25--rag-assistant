It's hard to say what the "best" way to handle the first element differently is without knowing why it needs to be handled differently. If you're feeding the elements of the sequence into the framework's ForEach method, you can't elegantly provide the Action delegate the information necessary for it to determine the element parameter's position in the source sequence, so I think an extra step is necessary. If you don't need to do anything with the sequence after you loop through it, you could always use a Queue (or Stack), pass the first element to whatever handler you're using through a Dequeue() (or Pop()) method call, and then you have the leftover "homogeneous" sequence.
