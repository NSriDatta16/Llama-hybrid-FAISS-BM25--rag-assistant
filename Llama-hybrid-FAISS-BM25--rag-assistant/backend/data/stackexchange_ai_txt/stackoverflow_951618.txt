NSNotification/Bindings?

I am making my way thru the Hilgrass and Kochan books. Doing my own experiments to further my learning I simply want to create a cocoa interface with 4 textfields, 3 that accept numbers and the 4th that displays the sum of the other 3. I can do this using a button to do the calculation however what I want to do is have it autoupdate any time one of the 3 inputs is changed. I have looked for a lesson that covers this, both in books and online but cannot find one, so either it's really simple and I'm missing something or it's not so simple. It appears the conventional way of doing this is with NSNotifactions but it is maybe possible with bindings as well? What is the standard way of doing this is cocoa and is there a tutorial that anyone knows of? Cheers, Morgan
