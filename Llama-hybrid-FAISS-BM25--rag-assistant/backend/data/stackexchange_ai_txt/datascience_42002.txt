You are effectively trying to classify images. Convolutional neural networks are much better at this task. And Keras is an easy to use library for neural networks. Check tutorials such as: https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/ and https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/11/image-classification-with-keras-and-deep-learning/
