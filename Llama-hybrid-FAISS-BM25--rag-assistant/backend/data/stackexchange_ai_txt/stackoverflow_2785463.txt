teamcity force checkout

I have teamcity project that use mercurial. I did a few manually changes to the files in teamcity/buildAgent/work directory. The problem is that now I cannot update the files to the files in the repository. How can I force re checkout for the teamcity? Is there any option to get rid of the old checkout?
