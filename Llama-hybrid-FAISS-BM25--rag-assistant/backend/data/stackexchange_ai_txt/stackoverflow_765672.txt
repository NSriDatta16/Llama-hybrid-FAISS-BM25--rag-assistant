Why do so many insist on dragging the JVM into new applications?

For example, I'm running into developers and architects who are scared to death of Rails apps, but love the idea of writing new Grails apps. From what I've seen, there is a LOT of resource overhead that goes into using the JVM to support languages such as Groovy, JRuby and Jython instead of straight Ruby or Python. Ruby and Python can both be interpreted on just about any OS, so I don't see any "write once run anywhere" advantage... why bring the hulking JVM along with you?
