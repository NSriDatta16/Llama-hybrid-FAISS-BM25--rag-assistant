I personally have Samsung Galaxy Tab and it doesn't have internal SD card (shipped with, can be bought separately I guess). In my program I call Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory and it seems to provide with internal memory path when no SD card is mounted. So far works, haven't investigated further.
