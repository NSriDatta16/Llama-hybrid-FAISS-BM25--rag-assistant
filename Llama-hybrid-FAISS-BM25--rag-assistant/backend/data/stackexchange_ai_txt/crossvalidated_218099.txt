Is there a visual tool for designing and applying neural nets/deep learning?

I know there are lots of libraries for machine learning and deep learning like caffe, Theano, TensorFlow, keras, ... But for me it seems like I have to know the architecture of the neural net, that I want to use. Is there a (visual) tool that allows to experiment with different network designs and apply them on own data? I'm thinking about something like the TensorFlow Playground , but with n-dimensional data and different layer types. Thanks in advance!
