We did it on our site by doing the following: We have a HelpTopics database with a HelpTopicId and HelpTopicText We create an aspx page that displays the HelpTopicText based on the HelptopicId passed in the querystring. We set up a css class for the A tag that displays the link to the help with the question mark image. We created a UserControl named TitleandHelp that contained a link to the page mentioned in step 2 and the style for the link set to step 3 above: The usercontrol has a public rpoperty for the title and one for the topicID (We called it HelpContext). We add the usercontrol to the aspx page where appropriate it may sound like a lot of work, but really it only takes a half hour or so to do all of the setup. The rest of the work lies in populating the table and dragging the usercontrol onto the pages where appropriate.
