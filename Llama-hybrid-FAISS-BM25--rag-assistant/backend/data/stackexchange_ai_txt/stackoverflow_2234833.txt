Can't you use Triggers ? 22.5.5: Is it possible for a trigger to update tables on a remote server? Yes. A table on a remote server could be updated using the FEDERATED storage engine. From : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/faqs-triggers.html#qandaitem-22-5-1-5 I wouldn't recommend this because you will be consuming bandwidth for every small change you do. You can try a scheduled job instead.
