So the problem is one of missing data (not all Y have a corresponding X, where correspondence is operationalized via time points). I don't think there is much to do here than just to throw away the Y you don't have an X for and calculate the correlation on the full pairs. You may want to read up on financial time series, though I don't have a good reference handy at this point (ideas, anyone?). Stock prices often exhibit time-varying volatilities, which can be modeled, e.g., by GARCH . It is conceivable that your two time series X and Y exhibit positive correlations during periods of low volatility (when the economy grows, all stock prices tend to increase), but negative correlations when overall volatility is high (on 9/11, airlines tanked while money fled to safer investments). So just calculating an overall correlation may be too dependent on your observation time frame. UPDATE: I think you may want to look at VAR (vector autoregressive) models.
