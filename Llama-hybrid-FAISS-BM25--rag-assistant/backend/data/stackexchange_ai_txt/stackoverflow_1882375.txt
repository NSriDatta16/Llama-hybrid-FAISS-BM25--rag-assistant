It's unfortunate that no matter where you look, most of the answers to this question are "Implement IDataErrorInfo!". This same problem shows up if you try to, for example, type a text string into a textbox field bound to an integer property. Simply, if MVC cannot convert the user value to the proper type, it generages these (quite useless) generic errors and never calls upon the IDataErrorInfo members. It's definately a hassle to override these unhelpful messages, and personally I feel the best answer is to simply implement some client-side validation to handle these scenarios. The cases where it generates these messages are very consistent and easily predictable: The user hasnt supplied a value for a non nullable field The user has entered or selected a value which isnt convertable to the underlying type (for exmaple: text into a numeric field) Plus, client side validation is just good practice anyways. If the user doesnt have javascript enabled then they'll certainly be able to figure out the problem anyways if you're using Html.ValidationMessage() and / or styling the input fields to identify the problems.
