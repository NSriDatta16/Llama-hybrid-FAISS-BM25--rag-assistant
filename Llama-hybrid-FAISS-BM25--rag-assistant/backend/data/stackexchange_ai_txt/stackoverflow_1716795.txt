A similar discussion was done here: http://www.motherboardpoint.com/getting-code-size-function-c-t95049.html They propose creating a dummy function after your function-to-be-copied, and then getting the memory pointers to both. But you need to switch off compiler optimizations for it to work. If you have GCC >= 4.4, you could try switching off the optimizations for your function in particular using #pragma: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas.html#Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas Another proposed solution was not to copy the function at all, but define the function in the place where you would want to copy it to. Good luck!
