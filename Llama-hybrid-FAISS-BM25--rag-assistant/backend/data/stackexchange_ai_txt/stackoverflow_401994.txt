HTML5 is still a bit far away from being implemented, but you might be able to use Google Gears for your local storage needs. Also, I've no idea how many simultaneous clients and tasks we're talking about, how big the tasks are and what strain such a request might put on the database, but I'd think you should be able to run smooth without any caching, 10+ requests doesn't seem that much. If traffic is not the bottleneck, I would put caching on the server and keep the client 'dumb'.
