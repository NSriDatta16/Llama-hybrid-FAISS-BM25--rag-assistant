I think you'll want something along the lines of #!/bin/bash for i in * do j=`du -s "$i" | cut -f 1` echo $i size is $j done Reading into another variable, read, and playing with that seems redundant. I believe a more elegant solution is Jonathan Leffler's second method (copy-pasted here) #!/bin/bash cd /home du -s * | while read size name do ... done
