Comparing Multi-level Meta-regression to Network Meta-Analysis for Dose-response Project

I am planning a meta-analysis to examine the average change in a continuous variable over time within my area of research. To be able to meta-analyze this continuous relationship, I've typically performed a multi-level meta-regression with the following structure where yi = standardized mean change for a given outcome within a group within a study, vi = the sampling variances, and time = intervention duration: metafor::rma.mv(yi,vi, mods= ~time, random = list(~time|study,~1|group,~1|es.id), struct = "GEN", method = "REML" dfs = "contain", test = "t")%>% robust(cluster=study, clubSandwich=TRUE) From here, I would explore additional models that evaluate the influence of various interacting moderators: metafor::rma.mv(yi,vi, mods= ~time * moderator, random = list(~time * moderator|study,~1|group,~1|es.id), struct = "GEN", method = "REML" dfs = "contain", test = "t")%>% robust(cluster=study, clubSandwich=TRUE) However, someone has mentioned to me that a dose-response network meta-analysis may be a better option . Frankly, I am not super familiar with those approaches but from what I've gathered , they are fitting dose-response relationships at each one of the "nodes" in the network. To me, this seems applicable when you have clearly categorical interacting moderators, whereas most of what I am interested in are continuous. Open to hearing any pros / cons of each of these approaches from more experienced users and pointing out any of my misconceptions.
