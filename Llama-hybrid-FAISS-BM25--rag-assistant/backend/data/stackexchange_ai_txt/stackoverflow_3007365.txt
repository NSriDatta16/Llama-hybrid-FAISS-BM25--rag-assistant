This is not a simple problem, and there are entire companies built around trying to solve it (even for reduced matching sets like company names versus the general case). If you can identify a discrete number of patterns that valid company names fall into, and that noise does not fall into, then you could tackle this with a series of regular expression matches. If the patterns are difficult or too numerous, then you could try developing a probabilistic model, perhaps something like a Bayesian network. You would take a subset of your data for training, and perhaps a second subset for a quick validation, and grow the network. Techniques might include genetic programming or setting up a neural network. This approach is obviously not lightweight, and you'd probably want to consider your need carefully before going down this road.
