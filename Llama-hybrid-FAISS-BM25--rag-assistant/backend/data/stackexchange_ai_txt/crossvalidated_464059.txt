I thought to increase the number of observations, simply, making a dataset with 30.000 observation, deriving from the five copies of original observations. Are you saying you simply multiplied the data to increase sample size? There is a reason this is not advised: Consider you draw a random sample of the population to estimate the average wealth of the average person. By chance, you happen to sample a doctor, an oil tycoon, a famous model, and a CEO. If you suspect your small sample (4) is biased at predicting average wealth, does multiplying the data help? No. It actually makes it worse.
