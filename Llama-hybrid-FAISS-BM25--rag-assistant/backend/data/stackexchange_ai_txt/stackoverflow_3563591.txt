How should a size-limited stl-like container be implemented?

While refactoring, I wanted to change an array where entries are added to an std::vector, but for compatibility (persistency, downgrading,...), it still needs to have an upper limit. What is the best way (elegant, stl-like, limited extra code) to have an stl-like container which is limited in size, so you know that inserting an entry fails? Edit : To clarify: I would like an stl-like container, that starts empty, that you can fill with entries and possibly remove entries and that iterate over the filled-in entries, but that doesn't allow to put in more than e.g. 50 entries, so almost like a sequential contrainer, but with an upper-limit.
