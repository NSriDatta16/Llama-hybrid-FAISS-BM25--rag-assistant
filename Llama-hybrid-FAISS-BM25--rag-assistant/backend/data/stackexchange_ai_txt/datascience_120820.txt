Should I specify 'reference=train_set' when creating a evaluating lightgbm.Dataset?

According to the docs , we should offer a argument reference=train_set when creating a validating lightgbm.Dataset. I know a little about the reason, i.e. there are some statistics data inside the training set object, such as average values and std-dev of every features, to be used when 'normalizing' the validating set. My question is: Should I do the same when creating a evaluating/testing/infering set? For example: lgb_train = lgb.Dataset(x_train, y_train) lgb_valid = lgb.Dataset(x_valid, y_valid, reference=lgb_train) model = lgb.train(params, train_set=lgb_train, valid_sets=lgb_valid) model.save_model('model.txt') # Should I offer `reference=lgb_train` in the following line? lgb_eval = lgb.Dataset(eva_feats, eva_labls, reference=lgb_train) predicts = model.predict(lgb_eval)
