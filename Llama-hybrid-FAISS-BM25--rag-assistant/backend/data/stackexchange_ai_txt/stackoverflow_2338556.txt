the generated exe file just a launcher that starts the runtime and passes the IL code to it. Not exactly. There are different ways you can set up your program, but normally the IL code is compiled to native machine code that runs in process with the runtime. As for the kiddies â€” you're deluding yourself if you think you can sell to them or anyone who uses what they redistribute. If they can't unlock your app they'll move on and find one they can or do without. They represent exactly $0 in potential sales; it makes little sense to spend too much effort attempting to thwart them because there'd be no return on your investment. A basic obfuscator might be fine, but don't go much beyond that. Realistically, most developers face a much bigger challenge from obscurity than from piracy. Anything you do that prevents you from getting the word out about your product hurts you more than the pirates do. This includes making people pay money to get it. Most of the time a better approach is to have a free version of your app that the kiddies don't even need to unlock; something that already works for them well enough that cracking your app would just be a waste of their time, and not just a time or feature-limited trial. Let them and as many others as possible spread it far and wide. Now I know that you do eventually need some paying customers. The key is to now use all the attention you get from the free product to upsell or promote something else that's more profitable. One option here is to also have a premium version with additional features targeted largely at a business audience; things like making it easy to deploy to an entire network and manage that way. Businesses have deeper pockets and are more likely to pay your license fees. Your free version then serves to promote your product and give it legitimacy for your business customers. Of course, there are other models as well, but no matter what you do it's worth remembering that obscurity is the bigger challenge and that pirated copies of your software will never translate into sales. Ultimately (and of course this depends on your execution) you'll be able to make more money with a business model that takes advantage of those points than you will trying to fight them.
