The R package brms (Bayesian regression models using Stan) can use Bayesian estimation to fit models with ordinal predictors. brms can handle a wide range of designs (e.g. multivariate and/or longitudinal and/or hierarchical) and a wide range of distributions (counts, ordinal outcomes, continuous outcomes, censored, etc. etc.). It can also incorporate temporal and spatial auto-correlation and fit mixture models. The author of brms, Paul Buerkner, has provided a large number of vignettes to demonstrate how to use the package's many features. You can see the one for monotonic ordinal predictors at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_monotonic.html
