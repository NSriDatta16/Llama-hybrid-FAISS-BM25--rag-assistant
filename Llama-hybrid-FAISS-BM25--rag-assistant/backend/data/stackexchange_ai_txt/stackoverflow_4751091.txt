How to go about searching for a player models in COD with OpenCV

I am attempting to create a program that can find human figures in video of game play of call of duty. I have compiled a list of ~2200 separate images from this video that either contain a human figure or do not. I have then attempted to train a neural network to tell the difference between the two sets of images. Then, I divide each video frame up into a couple hundred gridded rectangles and I check each with my ANN. The rectangles are overlapping to attempt to capture figures that are between grid rects, but this doesn't seem to work well. So I have a few questions: Are neural networks the way to go? I have read that they are very fast compared to other machine learning algorithms, and eventually I plan to use this with real time video and speed is very important. What is the best way to search for the figures in the image frame to test on the ANN? I feel like the way I do it isn't very good. It's definitely not very fast or accurate. It takes about a second per frame of an image 960 x 540 and has poor accuracy. Another problem I have had is the best way to build the feature vector to use as the input to the ANN. Currently, I just scale all input images down to25 x 50 pixels and create a feature vector containing the intensity of every pixel. This is a very large vector (1250 floats). What are better ways to build a feature vectors? For a more detailed explanation of what I do here: CodAI: Computer Vision EDIT: I would like a little more detail. What is the best way to calculates features. I need to be able to recognize a human figure in many different positions. Do I need to create separate classifiers for recognizing the difference between upright, crouched, and prone?
