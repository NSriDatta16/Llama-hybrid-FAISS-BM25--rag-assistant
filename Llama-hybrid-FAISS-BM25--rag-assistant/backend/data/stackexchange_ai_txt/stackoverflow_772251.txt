Direct socket manipulation can give you more power, flexibility, performance, and unfortunately complexity when compared to Remoting or WCF. However, if you need the benefits of low-level TCP/IP, such as non-blocking IO and custom protocols, tools such as Ragel and frameworks like Mina can ease the complexity burden. I recommend trying the higher-level APIs like WCF first and only use direct sockets if these don't meet your needs.
