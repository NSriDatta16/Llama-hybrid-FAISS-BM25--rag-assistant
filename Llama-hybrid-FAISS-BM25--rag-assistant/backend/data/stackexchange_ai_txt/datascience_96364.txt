Meaning of the covariance matrix?

I wonder about the excessive usage of the covariance matrix across all kinds of machine learning tools. So far, for me, the covariance is just a pre-step to get to the correlation. And as there is an obvious reason for the correlation itself, I wonder why I encounter the covariance so often. And, however, I wonder in general why it is used so much. What is/are the purposes for the covariance matrix?
