Tensorflow Text Segmentation or Open CV Text Segmenation

I want to extract text data from the image, however not sure what approach I should take. Steps successfully performed Dataset collection Image Preprocessing done Image Augmentation done Final Image data set prepared Train, Test Split done Annotation done (table and paragraph) Convolution Model (faster rcnn resnet50) Model performing well in identifying table and paragraph Cropped detection boxex image sections Confused with further step, I want to do text segmentation and pass it to tesseract. Not able to find good example from tensorflow or Open CV I tried solution 1 from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/irinaabdullaeva/text-segmentation not getting desired result I tried solution 2 from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/dmitryyemelyanov/receipt-ocr-part-1-image-segmentation-by-opencv not getting desired result I am attaching my output, wanted to know if my approach to work on text segmentation after 9 steps above is correct ?? or I need to take some other approach. I want to pass segmented text to tesseract for text extraction. Output - Please help
