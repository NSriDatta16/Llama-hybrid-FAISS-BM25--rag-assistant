When you say: for (...) { A a; } the variable a is NOT being constructed statically. That would be: for (...) { static A a; } In fact in your code, a is an automatic object, created on the stack. However, that doesn't mean that no dynamic allocation is taking place. If A looked like this: struct A { A() { p = new char[100]; } char *p; }; then when you say : for (...) { A a; } the storage for a.p is created on the stack, but the storage that a.p points at is created dynamically.
