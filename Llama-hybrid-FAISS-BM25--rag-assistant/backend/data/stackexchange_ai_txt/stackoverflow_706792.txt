Flex linechart advanced tutorial

I need to build a sales graph for a company and I am going to need to really customize the LineChart in Flex. Can anyone point me to a tutorial or even a book that gives exhaustive coverage of the LineChart in Flex? UPDATE Thank you guys for your answers but I am looking for an in-depth full coverage of everything you can do with the LineChart. I am trying to build a custom one and I am having trouble customizing it in further then those tutorials explain. I want something that will give me a deep understanding of how they work so I can intelligently program them instead of programming by permutation.
