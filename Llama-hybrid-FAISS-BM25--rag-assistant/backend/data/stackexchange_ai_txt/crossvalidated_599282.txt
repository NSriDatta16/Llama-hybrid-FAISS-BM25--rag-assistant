Did you consider using XML validation, for example, defining an XML Schema XSD (which may include some lax parts), or would it be too much work to specify the minor variations? But then, is it less work to set it up for machine learning? If there's some cooperation established with the suppliers, you may even provide them such a Schema to improve their output. You could also use some XML library to parse these files, and react to certain elements, dispatch these to a handler, perform a few checks, and proceed. A more "rule"-/event-based approach? Potentially including some counters/toggle-flags to recognize the absence of certain elements/values. One concern may be to update/maintain/correct/expand these checks, especially if somebody else eventually is expected to do it.
