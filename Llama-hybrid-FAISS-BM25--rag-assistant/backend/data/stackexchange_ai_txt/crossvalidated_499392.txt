Unfortunately, I cannot comment because I have less than 50 reputation so I'll leave it here and delete after. I personally am not familiar with supervised/semi-supervised learning but I am familiar with multiple linear regression. I don't know intuitively of why you would want to compare these values, as it just averages the expected predicted values from both models, thus there's nothing to compare. If you were using $\sum y-(\hat \beta_0+\hat \beta X)$ or even better: $RSS=\sum (y-(\hat \beta_0+\hat \beta X))^2$ , then you'd actually get useful information as you're measuring the distance from your predicted values and the actual values; in your calculations, your summing up the predicted values not knowing how far away from the true value it is, so you're comparing two black boxes. It seems that for both $\hat \mu_s$ and $\hat \mu_{ss}$ , that these are both means of means, weighted mean, grand mean, etc. What you can do is perform an $anova$ , analysis of variance, test to see if there exists difference between the two mean values. Once again, I do not know if a lower mean value or higher is better because you're test statistic isn't comparing to anything. However, if there does not exist a difference in the mean values then you would choose any model as there is no statistical difference, now if there is a difference then you would have to choose the model which fits your agenda, meaning if $\mu_s$ is smaller than $\mu_{ss}$ , choose that model if a smaller mean is good in your circumstance, or visa versa.
