I think the usual approach would be to predict p , the probability, using a logistic link, which is normal logistic regression. By calculating this entropy based on p , you end up with a transformed value which will probably indeed needs some additional transformations before it works well in a regression. Do you have any particular reason you want to apply this entropy transform first? Otherwise, I think logistic regression is the tried and logical approach here.
