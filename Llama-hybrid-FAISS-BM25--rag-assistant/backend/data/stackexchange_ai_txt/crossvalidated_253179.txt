It's not exactly about whether the relationships between Y and the various X are linear or not; a linear model is one that is linear in the parameters (just like the case with nonmixed models). So $Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2^2 + b_3X_3$ is linear, but if there are parameters (b) in the exponents, it is not. Usually, nonlinear mixed models are used when Y is not continuous. They are used for the mixed versions of logistic regression, count regression and so on.
