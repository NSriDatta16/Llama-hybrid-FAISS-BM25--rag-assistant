Speaking as a parent, if I had to explain a hashmap to a 5-year-old, I'd say exactly what you said while waving around a chocolate cupcake. Seriously, questions like this ought to mean "can you explain the concept in plain english", a good heuristic for how well you've internalized your understanding of it. Since it sounds like you get that, the question seems a bit silly.
