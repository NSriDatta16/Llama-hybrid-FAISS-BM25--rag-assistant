Timestamps are not required, network learns to align during training by itself. Neural network starts with random values first and then over training it improves loss function more and more which corresponds to proper timecodes. It learns to insert blank tokens into appropriate frames so that loss goes down the model become better. With best loss function phonemes are properly identified. For more details you can check https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-connectionist-temporal-classification-3797e43a86c In any case, the key idea to learn is CTC loss.
