mouseover element flickers

I have an image on a webpage and when the user hovers over it, another image appears. When then hovering over the appearing image, it flickers. Anybody any idea why that is? Tony UPDATE: The first image does not dissapear when hovering, just another (smaller) image appears over the top in the left top corner. When now moving over that smaller image, then the flicker appears. The image on the site is part of a gallery, so it's a php variable and gets loaded when a user selects from a list of images. So embedding one into the other is very hard.
