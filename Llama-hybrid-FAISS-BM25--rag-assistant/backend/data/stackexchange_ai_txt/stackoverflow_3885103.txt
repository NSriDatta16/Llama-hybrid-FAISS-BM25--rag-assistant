Both XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 do not support dynamic evaluation. One way to do this is using in XSLT 2.0 or in XSLT 1.0 . then you could use this function : Certainly, you could specify the test in specific match patterns as suggested by Robert Rossney , and this might be the best way. In case you need to dynamically define which filtering function to use, one powerful tool is the FXSL library, which implements Higher-Order-Functions (HOF) in XSLT. HOF are functions that accept other functions as parameters and can return a function as their result. Using this approach, you dynamically determine and pass to the my:test() as parameter a function that does the test.
