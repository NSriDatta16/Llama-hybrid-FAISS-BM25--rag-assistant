Why are non-local blocks really slow?

I have added non-local blocks into my CNN decoder, but this increases the training time by four times the original time without, so i don't really want to use it! What is the reason it is too slow? My images are cells and therefore there are lots of datapoints in each image, so i wonder using non-local blocks is like overkill for small data points? Is there a way to speed it up?
