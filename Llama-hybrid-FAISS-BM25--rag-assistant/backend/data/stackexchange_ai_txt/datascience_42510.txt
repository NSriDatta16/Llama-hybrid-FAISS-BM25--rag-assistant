It's the same reason you want to be language agnostic in programming. Things that are hard in one language might be easier in another. Job market requirements might change to favor someone who knows one language and not the others. The closest datascience example I can think of is implementing machine learning models. I understand that's something really easy to do in python. I don't know how easy it is to do in something like Javascript or any of the tools you mentioned - I only really know what R is. I personally think java is an ugly language so I wouldn't opt to use it. My strange preferences don't change the fact that python has a global interpreter lock while I believe java does not. It also isn't going to make pure python implementations as fast as java implementations - though certain techniques can make that a none issue. An employer looking for someone to fit in with their java tech stack isn't going to care that "I can do it in python". Truthfully, there's actually nothing that can't be done in R that can be done in java or python, R is Turing complete. That doesn't mean that some things aren't easier in java or python; R might not be the best tool for the job.
