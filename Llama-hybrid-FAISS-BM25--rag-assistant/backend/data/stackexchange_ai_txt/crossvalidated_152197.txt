Combination of two SVM Kernels

According to the book "Support Vector Machines" from Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, it is feasible to make kernels from kernels. My question is now more in application of this methods with tools like R. In particular, I have two models with the same classes, but the data is different. Do you know how I can combine two SVM kernels, i.e. linear and radial, to one learner for the classification task? Can you provide me some useful documents or links to libraries to do so?
