I don't think this is the right type of analysis. Consider this group of 2 persons only, call them $X_1, X_2$. In Jan, they got a score of $(1,99)$ respectively. In Dec, they both got 99. However, using your test: ${X_{1,Dec}-\bar{X}_{Jan}\over sd(X)_{Jan}}\approx 0.7$ which is probably not 'significant' depending on the cutoff you use. But one would think a jump from 1 to 99 is a significant improvement. In fact, all your test is doing is to test whether a December score is significantly different to an average score in Jan. You should really be using paired tests . For example, if the test scores can be assumed to be Normal, then you can use tests like the paired-t-test . (you can google it). If not, you can try non-parametric tests like the sign-rank test . But the key term is really paired test .
