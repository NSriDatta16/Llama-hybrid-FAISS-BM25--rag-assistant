When you double click the file, the program is run, and (usually) the name of the file that you double click, is passed in to the program as a command line argument. When you are dragging onto the window, the program is already running. The difference is obviously in the startup process that the program has. Is this software written in-house? Perhaps check how it handles starting up, and make sure that all appropriate code paths are still executed when there is a file in the command line arguments. If you can't check the program code, or how it behaves at startup, about the only thing to check in the registry, and possibly change, is how the filename is passed in. Usually they are passed in inside talking marks, so that the path to the file can have spaces and not confuse the program. Something to try would be to make sure the association uses talking marks on the argument, or if it already does, try it without. Perhaps the program isn't handling the talking marks correctly.
