Quantile intervals vs. highest posterior density intervals

I am reading a bit about Bayesian analysis , but I cannot understand the difference between the classic quantile-based intervals and the Highest Posterior Density Intervals. What is the difference between the two? I have simulated and plotted some data, the Q95% and the 95% HPDI seem to be similar but not identical. Are there situations where they differ to a larger amount? Thanks a lot
