This idea of using multiple fidelities(low-uncertainty vs high-uncertainty) data within Bayesian optimization is an area of active research. There are multiple ways of incorporating this information. If you are aware of basic bayesian optimization terminology, it can be incorporated in following ways: To pick the next point for evaluation during acquisition function optimization. By modeling directly in the surrogate model(gaussian process). Some related literature is below: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6118-gaussian-process-bandit-optimisation-with-multi-fidelity-evaluations.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01774.pdf Both of them has source code available too.
