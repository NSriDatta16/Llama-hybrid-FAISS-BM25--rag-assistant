Function of eight saved registers (MIPS)

I came across this statement in my Computer Organization and Design (Patterson & Hennessy) book: $s0-$s7: eight saved registers that must be preserved on a procedure call (if used, the callee saves and restores them) I don't understand what that "preserved on a procedure call" means.
