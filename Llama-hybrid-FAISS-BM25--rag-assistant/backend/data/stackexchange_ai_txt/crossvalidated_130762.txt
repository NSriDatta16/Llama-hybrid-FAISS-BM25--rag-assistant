First of all consider two time series, $x_{1t} $ and $x_{2t} $ which both are $I\left(1\right) $, i.e. both series contain a unit root. If these two series cointegrate then there will exist coefficients, $\mu $ and $\beta_{2} $ such that: $\\$ $x_{1t}=\mu+\beta_{2}x_{2t}+u_{t}\quad\left(1\right) $ $\\$ will define an equilibrium. In order to test for cointegration using the Engle-Granger 2-step approach we would $\\$ 1) Test the series, $x{}_{1t} $ and $x_{2t} $ for unit roots. If both are $I\left(1\right) $ then proceed to step 2). $\\$ 2) Run the above defined regression equation and save the residuals. I define a new “error correction” term, $\hat{u}_{t}=\hat{ecm}_{t} $. $\\$ 3) Test the residuals ($\hat{ecm}_{t} $) for a unit root. Note that this test is the same as a test for no-cointegration since under the null-hypothesis the residuals are not stationary. If however there is cointegration than the residuals should be stationary. Remember that the distribution for the residual based ADF-test is not the same as the usual DF-distributions and will depend on the amount of estimated parameters in the static regression above since additiona variables in the static regression will shift the DF-distributions to the left. The 5% critical values for one estimated parameter in the static regression with a constant and trend are -3.34 and -3.78 respectively. $\\$ 4) If you reject the null of a unit root in the residuals (null of no-cointegration) then you cannot reject that the two variables cointegrate. $\\$ 5) If you want to set up an error-correction model and investigate the long-run relationship between the two series I would recommend you to rather set up an ADL or ECM model instead since there is a small sample bias attached to the Engle-Granger static regression and we cannot say anything about significance of the estimated parameters in the static regression since the distribution depends upon unknown parameters.To answer your questions:1) As seen above you method is correct. I just wanted to point out that the residual based tests critical values are not the same as the usual ADF-test critical values. $\\$ $\\$ (2) If one of the series is stationary i.e. $I\left(0\right) $ and the other one is $I\left(1\right) $ they cannot be cointegrated since the cointegration implies that they share common stochastic trends and that a linear relationship between them is stationary since the stochastic trends will cancel and thereby producing a stationary relationship. To see this consider the two equations: $\\$ $x_{1t}=\mu+\beta_{2}x_{2t}+\varepsilon_{1t}\quad\left(2\right)$ $\Delta x_{2t}=\varepsilon_{2t}\quad\left(3\right) $ Note that $\varepsilon_{2t}\sim i.i.d. $, $x_{1t}\sim I\left(1\right) $, $x_{2t}\sim I\left(1\right) $, $u_{t}=\beta\prime x_{t}\sim I\left(0\right) $, $\varepsilon_{1t}\sim i.i.d. $ $\\$ First we solve for equation $\left(3\right) $ and get $\\$ $x_{2t}=x_{0}+\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i} $ $\\$ Plug this solution into equation $\left(2\right) $ to get: $\\$ $x_{1t} =\mu+\beta_{2}\left\{ x_{0}+\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i}\right\} +\varepsilon_{1t} x_{1t} =\mu+\beta_{2}x_{0}+\beta_{2}\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i}+\varepsilon_{1t} $ $\\$ We see at the two series share a common stochastic trend. We can then define a cointegration vector $\beta=\left(1\;-\beta_{2}\right)\prime $ such that: $\\$ $u_{t}=\beta\prime x_{t}=\left(1\;-\beta_{2}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c} \mu+\beta_{2}x_{0}+\beta_{2}\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i}+\varepsilon_{1t}\\ x_{0}+\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i} \end{array}\right) $ $\\$ $u_{t}=\beta\prime x_{t}=\mu+\beta_{2}x_{0}+\beta_{2}\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i}+\varepsilon_{1t}-\beta_{2} x_{0}-\beta_{2}\sum_{i=0}^{t}\varepsilon_{2i} $ $\\$ $u_{t}=\beta\prime x_{t}=\mu+\varepsilon_{1t} $ We see that by defining a correct cointegrating vector the two stochastic trends cancel and the relationship between them is stationary ($u_{t}=\beta\prime x_{t}\sim I\left(0\right) $). If $x_{1t} $ was $I\left(0\right) $ then the stochastic trend in $x_{2t} $ would not be deleted by defining a cointegrating relationship. So yes you need both your series to be $I\left(1\right) $! $\\$ $\\$ (3) The last question. Yes OLS is valid to use on the two stochastic series since it can be shown that the OLS estimator for the static regression (Eq. $\left(1\right) $) will be super consistent (variance converges to zero at $T^{-2} $) when both series are $I\left(1\right) $ and when they cointegrate. So if you find cointegration and your series are $I\left(1\right) $ your estimates will be super consistent. If you do not find cointegration then the static regression will not be consistent.
