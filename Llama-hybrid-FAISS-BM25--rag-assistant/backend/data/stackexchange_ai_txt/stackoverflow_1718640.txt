How to recreate jquery dialog after destroy

I'm creating three modal dialogs on page load (using $(document).ready(function() { ). I create these dialogs by calling a setDialogWindows() method, and pass it the div for the dialog. Dialog creation code is below: function setDialogWindows($element) { $element.dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, show: 'blind', hide: 'blind', width: 600, resizable: false, buttons: { Cancel: function() { $(this).dialog('destroy'); }, 'Save': function() { $(this).dialog('close'); } } }); } I'll spare you the dialog html, but there is some jquery drag/drop functionality that I want to be completely reset when the user clicks Cancel. Hence the $(this).dialog('destroy') . However, when I click the link again to open the dialog box, it doesn't show up. I realize this is because I haven't re-inited it, but I really can't do that because the dialogs are created on page load. I tried adding a recursive call of sorts to the Cancel function as such: Cancel: function() { $(this).dialog('destroy'); setDialogWindows($element); }, But that doesn't work -- still nothing opens when I click the link that should open it. Is there a way to just recreate the dialog box? Any ideas on where I should be re-initializing the dialog if the only place I do it now is on document.ready? Thanks.
