Why xts object produced bad forecasted values in comparision to ts object in R

For the testing purpose, I have created two time series object with same frequency (frequency=12) using xts() and ts() from the same dataset and used auto.arima() function for forecasting next 30 values. The xts based time series object produced bad forecasted values in comparison to ts . I have a high frequency dataset in seconds over 72 hours. For creating dateTime (2001:02:01 12:01:00) timestamp, I need to use xts object for creating time series. How can I improve the forecasted results in xts based time series forecasting?
