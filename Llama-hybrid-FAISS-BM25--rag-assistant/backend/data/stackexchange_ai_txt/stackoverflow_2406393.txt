Problem Solved I've got many different suggestions. Particularly, i want to thank Marc W & Reverend Gonzo. I'm here to make a summary for these ideas; this can save your time navigating thru big chunk of texts. This problem can be easily bypassed if you carefully decouple the View and Model-Controller. The dead cycle is caused by dependent writes: write_1 -> write_2 -> write_1 ->... . Intuitively, breaking the dependency can solve the problem elegantly. If we look into the problem in depth, we can find updating the corresponding views doesn't necessarily involves an external write call. Actually, a view only depends on the data it's representing. Known this, we can then re-write the logic as follow: write_1 -> read_2 & write_2 -> read_1 . To illustrate this idea, lets compare the 3 methods mentioned by different posters: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/2707f1b483.png As you can see, only the proxied view can solve all the dependency thus it's the generic solution for this knid of problem. In practice, it can be implemented as something like this (in your event-response codes): setValue(newValue); anotherSyncUI.parse(); // not anotherSyncUI.setValue() any more anotherSyncUI.repaint(); No more loops. Solved.
