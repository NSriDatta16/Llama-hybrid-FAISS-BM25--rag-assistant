Have you tried turning on anti-aliasing in the rendering hints? That might help. If not, you could pretty easily write your own own scaling function. This is actually pretty simple - you just need to: Loop over all the points in your target BufferedImage For each of these loop over the relevant points in your raw pixel data (this will be a rectangular zone determined by your scaling factor) Calculate the target colour using a formula of your choice based on the raw pixel values Use BufferedImage.setRGB(...) to set the colour of the target pixel Normal anti-aliasing would use something like an average of the source pixel values as a formula, it sounds like you want something that gives priority to particular values (e.g. take the maximum pixel value if your background pixels have low colour values)
