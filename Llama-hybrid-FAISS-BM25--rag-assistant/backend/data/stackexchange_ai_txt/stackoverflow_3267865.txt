There is plenty of debate on this. If your db is all local (not disparate instances being replicated back into a master db) then I believe that increasing integers are the way to go. By default, Primary Keys are Clustered, so having a single, thin ever increasing number makes sense, because in the case of Unique Identifiers, you can cause index and table fragmentation because they are not ever-increasing. In my opinion, if you really need unique identifiers, make a separate column that is not the primary key but has a unique non clustered index over it.
