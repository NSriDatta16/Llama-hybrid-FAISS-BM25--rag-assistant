I just want to be clear on what your saying here: bottom of the web page (the document , not the viewport ) Naturally, a div will be at the bottom of the "document", depending on your layout. If it's not going to the bottom of a document, or not paying attention to how tall your columns are, is it because your floating? Clear: both; would be in order to solve that. The sticky footers are what I think your looking for, but when you say document, and not the viewport, I get a bit confused. Sticky footers typically do this: Watch for short pages, and if its shorter than the view port, the sticky footer tacks the footer div to the bottom. Here's some sticky footers (there's gajillions of em, but this is in order of my favorites): http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/ http://css-tricks.com/sticky-footer/ http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ (listed previously) http://brassblogs.com/blog/sticky-footer http://alistapart.com/ (theres one there I just can't find it) Maybe if you gave a quick illustration or were a bit more specific on what you want? Hope this helps :D -Ken
