A couple of points: In the case of linear mixed models inclusion or exclusion of random-effects terms does not change the interpretation of the fixed effects coefficients. That is, the interpretation of the fixed effects in models A and B is the same. However, as you observed, the inclusion or exclusion of random effects can affect the estimated value of the coefficients, their standard errors, and p-values. In general, the random effects are used to model correlations you have in the repeated measurements of each subject. If these correlations are not modeled appropriately, then this may affect the estimation and inference for the fixed effects. This is even more so if you have missing data / dropout in your longitudinal outcome, which is of the missing at random type. The difference between the models A / B and C is in the time scale. In particular, you first model is $$\texttt{Score}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \texttt{Time}_{ij} + \beta_2 \texttt{Age0}_i + b_{i0} + b_{i1} \texttt{Time}_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ij},$$ where $\texttt{Time}_{ij}$ denotes the follow-up time for subject $i$ and visit $j$ , $\texttt{Age0}_i$ denotes the baseline age for the subjects, and $b_i = (b_{i0}, b_{i1})$ denote the random effects. Likewise, your second model is $$\texttt{Score}_{ij} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \texttt{Age}_{ij} + u_{i0} + u_{i1} \texttt{Age}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij},$$ where $\texttt{Age}_{ij}$ denotes the age of the $i$ -th subject at the $j$ -th visit, and the random effects are now $u_i = (u_{i0}, u_{i1})$ . The coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ in the two models have a different interpretation. Namely, coefficients $\beta_1$ denotes the average change in the score for every year of follow-up for subjects with the same baseline age. The interpretation of $\gamma_1$ is the average change in the score for every year increase of their age. Hence, it is not that one formulation is wrong and the other correct, but rather you need to select which of the two answers your research question (i.e., perhaps forcing you to rethink it and formulate it more accurately).
