Have you got a manifest correctly set up to use version 6 of commctl32.dll in your project? If not, you won't get the themed controls. In later versions of Visual Studio, this is usually done with a #pragma, like so (this one is for x86, copied from a new project generated with VS2005): #pragma comment(linker,"/manifestdependency:\"type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='x86' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"") If you add this to one of the source files in your project and rebuild, the manifest will be generated by the linker and added to your application. For other processor architectures, you'll need to change the "processorArchitecture" value. (Why VS can't figure this out for itself is a mystery left to the reader to solve...) (As some others have noted, you can also manually generate the manifest and add it to the .rc file. This is more long-winded, but does give you complete control of the manifest's contents.)
