You correct for testing multiple models by adopting an objective, algorithmic model selection path. Such a path may be governed by forward / backward stepwise selection as well as an objective model selection criterion, e.g. statistical significance of predictors, Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ), Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ), cross-validated predictive performance.
