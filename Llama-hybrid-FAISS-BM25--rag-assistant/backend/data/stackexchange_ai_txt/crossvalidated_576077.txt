First, taking the logarithm of the likelihood would simplify the notation. Using a diffuse prior, i.e. a prior that does not put more probability on some values than on others, does render the Bayesian framework useless. You could work without a prior at all or you could use a more informative prior. For example you could use a uniform prior over an interval in which you are sure to expect $\alpha$ to be part of. There could be even better solutions, but for that I do not have enough domain knowledge.
