So, like in my comment above I write it right here as answer: The problem was that the SD was mounted as mass storage device on my pc, while I was trying to access it by my app -> Error, because SD was not accessable from app In fact, it had nothing to do with the version (see comment from Roman Guy). The problem just occured the first time, two days after I updated the device ;-) I hope someone can benefit from my stupidness ;-)
