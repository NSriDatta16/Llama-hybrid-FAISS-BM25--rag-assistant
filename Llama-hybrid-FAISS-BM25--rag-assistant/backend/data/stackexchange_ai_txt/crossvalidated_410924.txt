Why in CNN network 3 filters are learning same feature?

I am using a simple CNN with one convolutional layer and one fully connected layer. I am using 3 filter channel and one input channel. I run my code 500 times with random initialization of weights in each loop. Each training loop is run for 30 thousand training steps. Then I plot filter weights of 1st filter and use fitting function to fit the data, similarly for second and third filter. I am getting similar result. Which shows that machine is learning same features to distinguish two classes. But I read every filter channel should learn a different feature. My model is showing 80 percent accuracy in 500 training loops. So what can be the reason for learning same features? Is my input data is quite simple?
