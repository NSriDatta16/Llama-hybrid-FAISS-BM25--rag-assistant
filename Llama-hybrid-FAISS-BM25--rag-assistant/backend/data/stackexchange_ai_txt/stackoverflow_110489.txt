I've read that GCC considers #pragma once deprecated, although even #pragma once can only do so much to speed things up. To try to untangle the #include spaghetti, you can look into doxygen . It should be able to generate graphs of included headers, which may give you an edge on simplifying things. I can't recall the details offhand, but the graph features may require you to install GraphViz and tell doxygen the path where it can find GraphViz's dotty.exe. Another approach you might consider if compile time is your primary concern is setting up Precompiled Headers .
