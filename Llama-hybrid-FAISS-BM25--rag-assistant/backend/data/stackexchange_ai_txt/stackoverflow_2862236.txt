STL member variable initalization issue with windows API

I am creating a windows app that uses a vector of stings as a member variable. For some reason, I can compile but when it tries to get at any of the vectors members is crashes. the error is 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0xcdcdcdd9. in the member function of the vector class. this is the size() function where it breaks. size_type capacity() const { // return current length of allocated storage return (this->_Myend - this->_Myfirst); } I am using visual studios 2010. thank you Django
