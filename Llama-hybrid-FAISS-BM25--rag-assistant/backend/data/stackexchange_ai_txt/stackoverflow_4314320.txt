MPMoviePlayerController: Removing ±1sec black screen, when changing contentURL?

I'm working on an iPad project where i have to play short video files one after another smoothly. For playing the videos i'm using MPMoviePlayerController . The problem i'm facing is that when i call [self.moviePlayer setContentURL:videoURL] it does start the next video, but there is ±1 sec delay of black screen before it starts to play the next video (the videos are read from the disk, not streamed). I need to avoid this black screen as well as the delay. So maybe some of you also experienced this problem and have some solutions? Thanks. Btw, for now, as to at least avoid the black screen, I capture the last frame of the ending video, show it in a UIImageView, and remove it after 1 sec delay. But i'm hoping to find a more elegant fix.
