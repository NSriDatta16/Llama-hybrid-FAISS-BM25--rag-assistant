Hard to say without more information and maybe some code (and I haven't used the WPF Toolkit grid - I use the Infragistics one.) A couple of things: Are you notifying the UI of property changes (by implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface) in your MVVM classes? You say "after you have updated data on DataTable". Updated how? Through the grid, or through some other means? Are your MVVM classes being "refreshed" correctly (and as such, informing the datagrid/UI that the data has changed)? I've had varied luck with this stuff. Sometimes the Infragistics grid doesn't update if I add, say, an element to a collection programmatically. I pretty much have to re-read the whole thing for the grid to update. I haven't found the cause yet. Maybe you're dealing with a similar "anomaly" here. Sorry, not necessarily helpful but maybe enough to point you in the right direction... Can't help much without more information.
