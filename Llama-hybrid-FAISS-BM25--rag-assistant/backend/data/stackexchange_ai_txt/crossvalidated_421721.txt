Suggest a model for segmenting a time series

Hi all, I have a time series that looks like above. I'm interested in segmenting it into the numbering listed. I've tried using a hidden Markov model, but the versions I can find with multiple observations per state (different state lengths) usually assume the y's (data) are conditionally independent given the states. I think that is too restrictive here with the semicircles and triangle shapes. It's also not clear how to set up the emission distributions for each state, so it's not clear how to write down a likelihood. Dynamic time warping looks promising here. I can verify the similar states are close to each other. But it's not clear how to proceed with it.
