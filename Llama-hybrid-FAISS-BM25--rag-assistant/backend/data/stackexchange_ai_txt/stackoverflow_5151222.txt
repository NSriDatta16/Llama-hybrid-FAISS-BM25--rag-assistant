WYSIWYG HTML editor for grails gsp files

Does anyone know about a good HTML editor which can be configured in such a way that it is gsp aware? What I mean is that at least tags such as and should be displayed as their html equivalent. Yes I know: a perfect editor is hard to write and it is easier to edit the HTML sources (that's what I do), but there are people who prefer an HTML editor... Update: yes, I am looking for a WYSIWYG HTML editor with which I can drag'n'drop some html elements to a page without changing the tags which might already be contained in the page. In addition, this editor should have some gsp awareness, so that tags are displayed in an appropriate way. Update: still looking for something, so I started a bounty. What I need is something like this plugin: http://code.google.com/p/grails-form-builder-plugin/ but more evolved... Bounty: not easy to select the right answer for the bounty. None of the answers is a solution to my problem, but I have decided that rschlachter points me in the right direction: a wysiwyg form editor is not the right solution for a developer...
