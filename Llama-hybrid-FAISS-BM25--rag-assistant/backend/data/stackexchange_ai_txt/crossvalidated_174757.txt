Help with Bayes Theorem (possibly?)

So let's suppose that there is a baseball player with a .300 batting average (i.e., the probability that he gets a hit is 30%) and he is facing a pitcher who has a .400 avg against (the probability that he gives up a hit is 40%). What would be the probability that this batter will get a hit off this pitcher? I tried to use Bayes theorem, but I got an answer of .222, which doesn't really make sense. Would the answer just be .350 (the average of the two), or is there some Bayesian way to get an answer?
