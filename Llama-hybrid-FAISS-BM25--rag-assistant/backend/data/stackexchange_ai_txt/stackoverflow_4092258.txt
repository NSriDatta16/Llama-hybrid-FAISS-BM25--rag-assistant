Configuration files in Silverlight

I am writing a plugin for Seesmic Desktop 2 , and this being my first time using Silverlight, I have a question: Writing Windows apps, we have the application configuration file e.g. MyApp.exe.config that is used to store config values, and for the web we have Web.config. For Silverlight, there doesn't seem to be the same thing. Ok, there's not quite the same incentive, as you have to unzip the .xap package to access it, but even so... My issue is that I have data, e.g. JSON web service enpoint URIs that I feel uncomfortable embedding directly in code, as they would normally go in .config files. Is there any equivalent/way around this for SL?
