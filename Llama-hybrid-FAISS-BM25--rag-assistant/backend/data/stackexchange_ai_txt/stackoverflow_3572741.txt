Basically both of your code fragments allocate array of pointers. For allocation it does not matters to what. Correct declaration is needed only for type checks. Square bracjets should be read separately and means only it is array. Consider following code as quick example: #include int main() { unsigned num = 10; double **p1, ***p2; p1 = new double*[num]; p2 = new double**[num]; printf("%d\n", sizeof(p1)); printf("%d\n", sizeof(p2)); delete [] p1; delete [] p2; return 0; } Yes, both are just pointers. And memory allocated is sizeof(double*) * num.
