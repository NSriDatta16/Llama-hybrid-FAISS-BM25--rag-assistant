It seems you have two questions: 1) What do slopes for (dummy-coded) categorical predictors tell us? The parameter estimate for a dummy-coded categorical variable provides an estimate of the difference between the groups, controlling for the effects of the covariates. In the context of this question, the slope for gender would represent the estimated mean difference in income between men and women after accounting for education and marital status. The fact that you are controlling for covariates is important. Imagine if for whatever reason, on average, women had 5 more years of education than men. A simple model regressing income on gender might prove significant, but that wouldn't mean that gender itself is responsible for differences in income. The significance test of the slope for gender in the context of the more complex model tests us that gender significantly predicts income beyond education and marital status. Still, we must keep in mind that gender (or indeed any of our predictors) may simply be redundant with other unknown variables and we should therefore be cautious about making conclusions about what "matters." 2) What conclusions can we draw from comparing slopes in the context of a multiple regression model. Not much. The significance tests on each of your predictors are asking if those values from zero. For example, the fact that your slope for gender is significant just means that in the context of the following model, $\beta_1 \neq 0$: $$Income_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Gender_i + \beta_2 MaritalStatus_i + \beta_3 Education_i +\varepsilon_i$$ These significance tests, however, do not test whether these slopes differ from one another. Additionally, because the scale of your various slopes are different (e.g. $\beta_1$ is the predicted difference in income between men and women whereas $\beta_3$ is the predicted increase in income per additional year of education), comparing the magnitudes of your slope estimates is not particularly enlightening.
