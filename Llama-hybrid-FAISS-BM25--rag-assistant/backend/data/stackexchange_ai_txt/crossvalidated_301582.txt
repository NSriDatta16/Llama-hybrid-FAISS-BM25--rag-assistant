Combined PCA and Quantization

I did some PCA on a dataset to reduce the size without compromising too much on their actual information. However, I learnt that quantization is also an effective technique to do this. I guess it is more fine-grained and leads to compression. Combining PCA and Quantization will hence be quite effective I guess. I got PCA to work using Scikit learn. How do I implement Quantization? Are there any libraries or standard methods? I am working with the Python data science stack. Thanks for your time. I am not getting how to quantize as it doesn't seem to be a programming issue as I have to change how a number is represented.
