Save Actions rocks. There you can get your Imports organized (Ctrl+Shift+o) and formatting of code (CTRL + SHIFT + f). Besides from that i love ALt + Shift + R for refactoring. My favorite things is the plugins though: They might cause you to use more time but most of the time they give quality (subjective I know) Code coveragde (ECLEMMA) Static analysis on source(PMD) Static analysis on byte code(FindBugs) CheckStyle SpringIDE. Then you start to rock with the mandatory source control plugins and the maven 2 plugin. Rock on!
