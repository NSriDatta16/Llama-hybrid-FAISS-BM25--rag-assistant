What is evolved faster, ANN+Genetic Algorithms or NEAT?

I'm making a cube learn to jump a jumprope by itself, and I don't know what approach would evolve to the most fitness, the fastest. One approach could be setting up a basic feed-forward ANN with 1 hidden layer only, and tweaking the weights with a genetic algorithm. On the other hand, another possibility would be to implement NEAT (genetic algorithm can change the number of connection and nodes, as well as the weights in the network). Since the second approach is obviously more complicated, would it take more time to evolve the neural network than the one with a fixed structure? Also, does it apply to all cases? For instance, I believe that for a basic jump rope, the basic neural network would do just fine.
