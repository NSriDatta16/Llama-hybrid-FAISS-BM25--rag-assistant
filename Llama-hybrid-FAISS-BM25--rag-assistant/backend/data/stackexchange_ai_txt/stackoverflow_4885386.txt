A not perfect but working solution is to use Object as parameter. public class SaveFileToExternalStorage extends AsyncTask { protected Boolean doInBackground(Object... param) { File file = (File) param[0]; List list = (CustomList) param[1]; return result; } protected void onProgressUpdate() { //setProgressPercent(progress[0]); } protected void onPostExecute(boolean result) { //showDialog("Downloaded " + result + " bytes"); } } This code is just a sample, you should ensure that the objects at index 0 and 1 are really a File or your CustomList by using instanceof . Octavian Damiean has also written a good method...
