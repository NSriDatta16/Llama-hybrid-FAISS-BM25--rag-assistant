Is assigning an inverse-Wishart distribution to a diagonal matrix problematic?

I'm reading the paper Bayesian Vector Autoregressions by Thomas Wozniak. He considers the model $$y_t = \mu + A_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots A_k y_{t-k} + u_t$$ where each $y_i$ is a $N$ -vector, each $A_j$ is a $N\times N$ matrix and $u_t \sim N(0, \Sigma)$ He assigns the prior for $\Sigma$ to be inverse Wishart. I think that the errors are independent, which would mean that $\Sigma$ is diagonal. If this is the case, then $N^2 - N$ of the entries are zero (i.e. non-random). If this is not the case, I am working with a similar model where the covariance matrix is diagonal. In either case, I am led me to the following question: Is it okay to assign the inverse Wishart distribution to diagonal matrix?
