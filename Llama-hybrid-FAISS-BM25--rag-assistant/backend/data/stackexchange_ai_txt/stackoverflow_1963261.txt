Ruby is an object oriented programming language. Rails is a framework built in Ruby for developing web applications. I have been using rails for about 6 months now, and its been great so far. If you want some of the same features of rails, you should also consider django (python), cakephp or symfony (php). Pros: MVC Architecture - Code is organized, broken up into small, manageable files Database abstraction - you dont have to write SQL queries, database types are easily interchanged Convention over Configuration - rails automatically knows file, database, variable names without explicitly being specified Fast Development - Rails requires less lines of code because of all the functions it automatically takes care of and is more expressive, resulting in faster development Cons: Slower - this is often debated, but a comparable rails application is slower than its PHP counterpart. Rails 3 is supposedly going to include speed increases. Less Literature - rails lacks the plethora of tutorials, books and api that is available for PHP. Less Hosting Support - Not all shared hosts support rails, but you can set it up on any vps or dedicated. Deployment is also a bit tougher in Rails as opposed to PHP
