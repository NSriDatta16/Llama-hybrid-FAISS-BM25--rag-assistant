As @fabrik points out @Marc B's solution works, though it's not elegant. Though, it works. If it's the first image in the post, then filter out the first tag from the wp_content then apply the filter to forcibly set the width and/or height. If the image attached is the featured image or a custom attribute, just do the same thing except filter that data item instead of the post content.
