Well, MySQL-Cluster is just NDB (Network DataBase). Now, the NDB engine has a 2 main storage mechanisms. In memory. This has been available since NDB was introduced. Basically, it's just a series of memory tables that store the data. If all of your node sets go down, you lose all of your data. So you'll need to either replicate to a hard storage, or backup often and replay binary logs in the case of a server reboot. Since MySQL 5.1.6, NDB supports disk backed storage. That means that the working set is still kept in memory, but all writes are flushed to a disk buffer. So a restart just re-reads the disk. See MySQl Cluster Disk Data Types . Another useful read is this whitepaper (PDF) about recovery principles.
