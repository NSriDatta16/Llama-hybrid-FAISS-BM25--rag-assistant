I'll toss in my traditional outside-the-box suggestion: Add Lua to your application, and build the GUI with a combination of Lua and a suitable toolkit module. One good choice is IUP , and another is wxWidgets . Both have decent quality Lua bindings. Even better, Lua itself along with both wxLua and IUP can be had in a single installation along with a bunch of other useful Lua modules from the Lua for Windows project. Lua is easy to integrate with C code, since it was designed for that purpose from the outset. It is also easy to use Lua as the glue that hold the application together, with core functionality implemented in C or as interfaces to native API calls. Lua is also supported by SWIG in case you have an extensive library to adapt. Of course, you could just use either wxWidgets or IUP directly from C as they both have C callable APIs, but event-driven GUIs are often full of nit-picky little house-keeping callback functions that are easy to deal with in a scripting language. Another toolkit to consider is Tk , which is most often seen in combination with the Tcl scripting language. Tcl was also developed with embedding in a larger application in mind, although it has evolved away from that as its primary use case. Tk has been bound to a variety of other languages, including Perl.
