If you are not required to do text output but use a file that is hand editable, you should heavily consider creating an Xml Serializable class say Data that implements a List where Student is serializable. Then you just have to the Xml Serialize/Deserialize methods to read and write your data. Once read in you can implement a find algorithm or use Linq on the List. Of course @vodkhang mentions a valid point about file storage regarding performance and random access vs loading all into memory.
