WPF has a pretty steep learning curve, especially coming from Access. WinForms would be a simpler path, but it's still a leap from Access. However, both WPF and WinForms have drag-and-drop form construction, and assuming you learn enough VB.NET to convert the VBA business logic, you're more than halfway there. :) If you implement your project in WPF, you can make it Silverlight-enabled, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms.
