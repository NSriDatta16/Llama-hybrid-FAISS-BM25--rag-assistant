If your question means "have biological ideas been used to optimize software?" then Genetic programming ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming ) is one example. From the Wikipedia article: In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. It is a specialization of genetic algorithms (GA) where each individual is a computer program. Therefore it is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's ability to perform a given computational task. If your question means "what software techniques have been inspired by biology?" then see more generally http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-inspired_computing . I would expect that several other methods such as ant-swarms ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization ) and Neural Networks ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_software ) could also be used.
