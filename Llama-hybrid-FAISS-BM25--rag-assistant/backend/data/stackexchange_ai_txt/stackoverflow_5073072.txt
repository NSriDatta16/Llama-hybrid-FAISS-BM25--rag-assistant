R.* error in Notepadv3

I just imported the Android tutorial solution Notepadv3. I wanted to see it run. As usual, I'm greeted with the inability to resolve R. I searched for an import R line and see none. I edited a line and saved. I closed and opened the application. What do I do?? This seems to happen on every project. (I have tried this with Eclipse Ganymede under Ubuntu 9.1 and Eclipse Helios under Windows 7.)
