(Can't seem to comment, but need some clarification. Will edit/delete this answer as appropriate. anyways....) It could be a caching issue: Have you tried CTRL+F5 to make sure your browser is reloading. Try in another browser, I have found Firefox and Chrome both ignore forced cache refreshes sometimes, or try in "private" mode. Does your host have a load balancer or caching system? Add a random querystring to each request to test.asp to make sure. You can force no-caching, but some browsers, ISPs and Hosters ignore it anyway... . Response.Expires = 0 Response.AddHeader "pragma","no-cache" Response.AddHeader "cache-control","private" Response.CacheControl = "no-cache" Apologies if you have tried all this, would have rather asked with a quick comment!
