Here are the options for Anomaly Detection in R as of 2017. Twitter's AnomalyDetection Package Works by using Seasonal Hybrid ESD (S-H-ESD); Builds upon the Generalized ESD test for detecting anomalies; Can detect both local and global anomalies; Employing time series decomposition and robust statistical metrics (e.g. median together with ESD) Employs piecewise approximation for long time series; Also has method for when time stamps are not available; Can specify direction of anomalies, window of interest, toggle the piecewise approximation, and has visuals support. anomalyDetection Package (different from Twitter's) various approaches including Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis, Horn's parallel analysis, block inspection, principle components analysis ; Has method for dealing with the results. tsoutliers package Detects outliers in time series following the Chen and Liu procedure ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/2290724?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ); Outliers are obtained based on 'less-contaminated' estimates of model parameters, estimated outlier effects using multiple linear regression, and estimates the model parameters and effects jointly. Considers innovational outliers, additive outliers, level shifts, temporary changes and seasonal level shifts. anomalous-acm Works by computing a vector of features on each time series (e.g. include lag correlation, strength of seasonality, spectral entropy) then applying robust principal component decomposition on the features, and finally applying various bivariate outlier detection methods to the first two principal components; Enables the most unusual series, based on their feature vectors, to be identified; Package contains both real and synthetic datasets from Yahoo. rainbow package Uses bagplots and boxplots; Identifies outliers with lowest depth or density. kmodR package Uses an implementation of k-means proposed by Chawla and Gionis in 2013 ( http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611972832.21 ); Useful for creating (potentially) tighter clusters than standard k-means and simultaneously finding outliers inexpensively in multidimensional space. washeR method Uses a new non-parametric methodology ( https://rivista-statistica.unibo.it/article/viewFile/3617/2968 ) The CRAN Task view for Robust Statistical Methods A variety of approaches for using robust statistical methods to detect outliers. EDIT 2018 anomalize: Tidy Anomaly Detection
