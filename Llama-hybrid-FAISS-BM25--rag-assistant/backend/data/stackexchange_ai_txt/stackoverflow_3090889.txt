Linker errors after upgrade to xcode 3.2.3 for iphone app

I've just upgraded to XCODE 3.2.3 and upgraded my base sdk from 3.0 to 3.2 iphone sdk. After doing this I started getting a bunch of link errors with barely any info, here's what I got: ".objc_class_name_CATransition", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSObject", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSFileManager", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSString", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSError", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CABasicAnimation", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSOperation", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CJSONDeserializer", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIWindow", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSException", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIColor", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CATransaction", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CLLocationManager", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_MPMoviePlayerController", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableSet", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIFont", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSFileHandle", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_MFMailComposeViewController", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CAKeyframeAnimation", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIImage", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIApplication", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UILabel", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CLLocation", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableString", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CJSONSerializer", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSTimer", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSValue", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableData", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSNumber", referenced from: "_objc_exception_match", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UINavigationItem", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIViewController", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableArray", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIScreen", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSHTTPCookieStorage", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_MKPinAnnotationView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSNotificationCenter", referenced from: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_QWAdView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSProcessInfo", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UITableViewCell", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CAAnimationGroup", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSInvocation", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSURL", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSSet", referenced from: "_objc_exception_extract", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UISearchBar", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableURLRequest", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSRunLoop", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSData", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSDate", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIBarButtonItem", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UITableView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSURLRequest", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSOperationQueue", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIActionSheet", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIDevice", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_MKMapView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIToolbar", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSXMLParser", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSHTTPCookie", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIImageView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CAMediaTimingFunction", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSScanner", referenced from: "_objc_exception_try_exit", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSDateFormatter", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIAccelerometer", referenced from: "_objc_exception_try_enter", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSCharacterSet", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIScrollView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIButton", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UINavigationBar", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIAlertView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSUserDefaults", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSThread", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSPropertyListSerialization", referenced from: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_GANTracker", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSMutableDictionary", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_CALayer", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIWebView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSBundle", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSURLConnection", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSAutoreleasePool", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIPageControl", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSAssertionHandler", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_MKAnnotationView", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSDictionary", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSLocale", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_NSArray", referenced from: ".objc_class_name_UIActivityIndicatorView", referenced from: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_AdMobView", referenced from: Any ideas? UPDATE: Seems like 3rd party libraries are causing the issues. These include libraries for admob, quattro, and Google Analytics. Only admob has updated their libraries so will have to remove the other ones
