Drag folder into Eclipse IDE?

I was just wondering if anyone knows the way to use Eclipse IDE without creating a project? So I could just open folder and use Eclipse just like a regular text editor? Just like notepad++ or textmate? by using plugins maybe? Thanks P.S> damn - the only thing that I miss in Ubuntu is my Notepad++
