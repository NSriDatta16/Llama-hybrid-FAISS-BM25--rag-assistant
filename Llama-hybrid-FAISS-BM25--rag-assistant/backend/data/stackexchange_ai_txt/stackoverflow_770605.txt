Take a look at beowulf to get started. That being said, the best advice I can give is to carefully measure whether you are actually being more green with your cluster. I've been a little way down this road before, and in my experience, the losses involved in having many separate computers end up wiping out any energy savings. Keep in mind that every computer needs a power supply, which converts your household voltage down to a level that the computer wants. The conversion is inefficient, and wastes heat (this is why the power supplies have fans). The same can be said for each hard drive, RAM bank and motherboard that you need. This isn't meant to discourage you from the project. Just be sure to profile. Exactly like writing software! :)
