Establish a review board, with senior representatives from development, operations, qa, the business, etc., with the CM manager as the chair. All changes have to be presented to the board. In one place I worked you needed unanimous approval to implement a change. In another a 2/3 majority was enough. At both places though, you had to get your s**t together when presenting a change; you really didn't want to be unprepared and look like a fool. The CM team defines the "artifacts" required to pass the control gate, usually a series of forms with a checklist as a guide. If the system is "mission critical" you may also want to do some kind of CM audit to ensure that your development process was followed (unit tests were run, files placed under version control, tagged properly with comments, QA tests signed off, etc.). For tools, a simple spreadsheet or database is usually enough, something you can put together yourself, tailored to your organization's processes. Keep it simple. The CM manager also has to have some "teeth" and be able to enforce the decisions of the review board. CM is a quality process, and is there to ensure that quality standards are maintained, not that deadlines are met.
