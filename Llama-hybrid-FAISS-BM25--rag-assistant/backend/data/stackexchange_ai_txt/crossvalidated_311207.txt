How to report the performance of clustering algorithm on labeled data?

I have clustering algorithm and I cluster labelled data sets to see my clustering algorithm performs. I was thinking to report performance of my clustering in sense of some score, like RandIndex score. Idea I had was to compute rand score for each clusters and take the average of it over cluters and report it. Is it faie to do this? Do you know any better way of doing it ? Here is the table that represent results. Column names shows the classes Cluster_Table Cluster subtype0 subtype1 subtype2 subtype3 subtype4 subtype5 1 12 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 11 10 3 0 0 9 0 0 0 4 0 11 0 16 0 0 5 0 0 16 0 0 0 6 0 9 0 0 0 15 7 0 0 0 0 14 0 8 13 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0
