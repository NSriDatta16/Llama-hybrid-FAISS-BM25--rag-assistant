Precision and AUROC for which class values

I am a newbie in reading research paper and implementing it by myself. I went through the paper Breast Cancer Survival Prediction from Imbalanced Dataset with Machine Learning Algorithms . Can anyone please summarize the paper for me? I cannot understand the Table 2: Performance of ML algorithms with data sampling techniques. As I am a learner I can not understand, are those precision and AUROc for class(Status) value "Alive" or "Dead"? Thank you.
