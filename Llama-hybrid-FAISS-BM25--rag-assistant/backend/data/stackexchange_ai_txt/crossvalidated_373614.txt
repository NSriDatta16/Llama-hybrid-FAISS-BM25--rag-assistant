I am not familiar with the literature on statistical anomaly detection, so take this as speculation. One possibility is that the authors mean pretty much the same thing whether they use probability or frequency of occurrence (see comment by @Bar). See the answer to this question which covers a very similar topic and reminds us of a few caveats. On the other hand, they could also be using the term probability in a Bayesian sense. There it describes the degree of confidence/belief in a hypothesis (i.e. feature is an anomaly ). Here the probability can for example be estimated using the technique of e.g. Maximum a Posteriori Estimation . The number of features in a sample could be used as the basis for this estimate. Right now I am reading Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial by Sivia and Skilling which is clearing up a lot of the confusion about probability theory I have myself.
