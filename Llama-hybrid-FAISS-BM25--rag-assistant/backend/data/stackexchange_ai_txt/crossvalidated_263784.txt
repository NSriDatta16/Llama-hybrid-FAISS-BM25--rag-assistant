Spectral Clustering in Resting-State fMRI

I have 200 .hdr/.img file pairs for person in which the carried out pre-processing using SPM. I want to apply spectral clustering for voxel time courses to find resting state networks. How can I extract voxel time courses from fMRI time series of .hdr/.img file in MatLab?
