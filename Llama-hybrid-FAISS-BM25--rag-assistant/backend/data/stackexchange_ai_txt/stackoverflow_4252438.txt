As an alternative, you may want to consider creating your own archetype using maven-archetype-plugin : http://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/ Using mvn archetype:create-from-project you can do it from your customized project, which you can create in the first place by using the archetype that suits your needs as much as possible and then adding the things that are missing or reconfiguring as necessary. Here are some tutorials: http://code.google.com/p/jianwikis/wiki/HowToCreateMavenArchetypeFromProject http://code.google.com/p/krank/wiki/CodeGeneratorAgain http://mojo.codehaus.org/maven-archetypeng/creation.html http://www.bluesunrise.com:8080/webcontent/rproxy/maven_apache/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/examples/create-multi-module-project.html Take a look at appfuse-basic-jsf , link: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Archetypes+List In fact, take a look at AppFuse itself: http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Home However, I still think you would need to tweak it if you want a one-click solution, though this seems like a very good start.
