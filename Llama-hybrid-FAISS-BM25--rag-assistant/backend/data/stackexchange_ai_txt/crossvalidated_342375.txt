Let me save you a lot of money. There is a lot of information that you do not have, but I will give you a solution to a similar problem. For starters, let us assume that the chart you have drawn was, in fact, a real chart. For starters, there is a critical piece of information that you and most traders are lacking. The data in the chart doesn't have to happen in the order on the chart. Large orders are taken "off the tape," and so trades happen that never appear as individual trades. They are aggregated together and placed in block orders later in the tape at a point where the order won't impact the trade price. Your entry points may have happened an hour before they are recorded, likewise, your exits may have also happened earlier as well. The charts do not provide actual informative data. Second, the actual order is never placed in the public record. If there is a single market-maker, then the market-maker has the true trade order, but no one else does. If there are multiple market makers, then no one has the true order. Charts and data feeds are created from recording order and not trade order. This protects large orders from shocking the market up or down. Those steep dips you marked in green could actually be a block order being recorded late because the market-maker couldn't find a place to put them. They are also recorded as weighted average prices and not the actual prices that were paid. That is the first part of your problem. The second part of your problem is that you are probably using the wrong type of mathematical tools. Consider the apparent function $$p_{t+1}=Rp_t+\epsilon_{t+1}.$$ It isn't a function though until after the trade is complete. $\epsilon_{t+1}$ is a multivalued constant. In fact, if it follows a normal distribution, it has an infinite number of solutions, so ex-ante $x_{t+1}\in\mathbb{R}^{++}$. That isn't a useful piece of knowledge. It is a relation. Now let us add some assumptions to make some math possible. We are ignoring the quantity purchased and sold since we could normalize it to unity anyway over a short period of time. For long periods bankruptcy or mergers could happen. Now, it is known by theorem that no non-Bayesian solution exists for the equation $p_{t+1}=Rp_t+\epsilon_{t+1}.$ This is because $R>1$ or nobody would invest. A Bayesian solution does exist, but it won't really answer the question you are asking anyway because, as I said above, the data isn't in the true order in which it happened. What you can do is note that risk falls with the price for any security, if you define risk in terms of reaching a goal. This is because when return is defined as $$r_t=\frac{p_{t+1}}{p_t},$$ then the smaller the bottom number is the higher the return is. Further, if you define a cost function where your cost is zero when your goal is met or exceeded and $c$ when the goal fails, then your cost function becomes the expected loss, which is now just the CDF of the values between -100% and your target return. The risk falls because as the price falls, the cdf falls below 50% and in a binomial distribution risk is maximized at 50%. If the probability of loss is greater than 50% the risk falls because it becomes increasingly certain that you will fail. If the probability of loss is less than 50% then the probability of gain becomes increasingly certain. In practice, since the goal is now binary, you can speak in terms of the binomial distribution. This is great since returns for going concerns should be approximately a Cauchy distribution, which has neither a mean or a variance. To check this, note that the expectation of the standard Cauchy is $$\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x}{1+x^2}\mathrm{d}x.$$ If you check the integral, you will see it diverges and so a solution does not exist. If you check the integral of the second moment about zero you get $$\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\mathrm{d}x.$$ For this to work, however, you really need to ground prices in operating earnings. So you should base your returns as a function of adjusted operating income, as opposed to reported earnings. It is better to use adjusted operating cash flows, but that may require data that is a bit more difficult to come by. I say adjusted because accounting data is not always reflective of its true value. Most accounting records need very substantive adjustments. Consider a firm with a deferred tax liability of \$100 million. Imagine the tax would be first due in 20 years. Then that is a \$100 million interest-free loan from the Treasury. The difference in the debt and the present value is equity. That equity needs to be adjusted as the tax date gets closer. Likewise, goodwill is worthless and should be immediately written off. If you keep doing the above, then you should save money by donating your portfolio to charity. People like me will take you for everything you have got, and if you make margin purchases, we may take more than 100% of what you have got. You cannot trade like that and make money because you are not a financial institution and cannot get access to the data you need to solve this problem. NOTE FOR COMPLETENESS In case you are wondering why it would follow a Cauchy distribution consider a trade on the NYSE. Prices happen in a double auction so the winner's curse does not obtain. Since the winner's curse is not operative the rational behavior is to bid your expectation. If there are many potential buyers and sellers then the static distribution of potential bids is the normal distribution. Statically, prices in equilibrium should converge to a normal distribution. This is not to say that the limit book is normal as not all orders are in the book. A person does not have to place an order to have a valuation. By well known theorem, the ratio of two normal distributions, the sell price divided by the buy price, is a Cauchy distribution if you are centered around (0,0) which you would be since in equilibrium the joint prices would be there if you have translated the prices into the error space from the price space. Hence, no variance or, for that matter, a mean.
