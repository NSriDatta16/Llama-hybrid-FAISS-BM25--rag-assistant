can I use manhattan distance function on hartigan wong kmeans clustering

I would like to perform Hartigan Wong clustering on high dimensional data. As I understand, Manhattan distance works better than the Euclidean distance in higher dimensions. I have been using the K-means clustering which uses the Euclidian distance function. I have two question: Can we use a different distance function, such as Manhattan distance, in k-means clustering? If so, Does changing the distance function to Manhattan distance in Hartigan Wong algorithm reduce the curse of dimensionality?
