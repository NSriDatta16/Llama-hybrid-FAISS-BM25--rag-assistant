Testing navigation in silverlight

I have a Silverlight application that is using a navigation frame. I am trying to write a unit-test for that application using the Silverlight testing framework, however when I execute the test method I get the following error: InvalidOperationException No XAML was found at the location '/Pages/LoginPage.xaml' The unit-test method looks like: [TestMethod] [Asynchronous] public void TestMethod1() { var mainPage = new MainPage(); WaitFor(mainPage, "Loaded"); TestPanel.Children.Add(mainPage); EnqueueCallback(() => Assert.IsTrue(mainPage != null)); EnqueueTestComplete(); } Here's the MainPage.xaml: If I run the "main" xap the application works correctly. I just have that error while testing. I suspect the error is due to the unit-test framework executing its xap and embedding my xap in it, but cannot figure out a way to get around that. Any clues?
