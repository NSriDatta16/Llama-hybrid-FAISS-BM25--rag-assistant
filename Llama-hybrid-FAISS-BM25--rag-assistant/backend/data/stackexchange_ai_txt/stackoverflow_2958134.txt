VS2008 web service code coverage

I have written a test method for a web service in VS2008, using visual studio test framework. Everything works fine until I enable code coverage for the web service dll in localtestrun.testrunconfig. Then, when I run the test, I get the result "Not executed". Could you give me an idea for this? Thank you
