Deep learning with $p \gg N$ and on multi-modal and heterogeneous data

I work in a problem where: The input data is a collection of time series from different sensor modalities, where each sensor comes with different acquisition rates and dynamic ranges The number of potential features vastly exceeds the number of instances (i.e. $p \gg N$) My question is: Has deep learning been applied on this type of data before?
