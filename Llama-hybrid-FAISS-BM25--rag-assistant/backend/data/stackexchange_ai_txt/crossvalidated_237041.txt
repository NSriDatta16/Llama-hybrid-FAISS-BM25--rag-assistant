This is the central computation issue for Bayesian data analysis. It really depends on the data and distributions involved. For simple cases where everything can be expressed in closed form (e.g., with conjugate priors), you can use Bayes's theorem directly. The most popular family of techniques for more complex cases is Markov chain Monte Carlo. For details, see any introductory textbook on Bayesian data analysis.
