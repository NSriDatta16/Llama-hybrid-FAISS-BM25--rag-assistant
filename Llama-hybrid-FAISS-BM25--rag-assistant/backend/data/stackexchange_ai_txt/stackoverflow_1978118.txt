This is a fairly trivial effect to accomplish. One way to achieve this is to simply place floated div elements within a common parent container, and set their width and height. In order to clear the floated elements, we set the overflow property of the parent. do ray me fa so la te do The CSS resembles the strategy outlined in the first paragraph above: .container { width: 450px; overflow: auto; } .cube { float: left; width: 150px; height: 150px; } You can see the end result here: http://jsfiddle.net/Qjum2/2/ Browsers that support pseudo elements provide an alternative way to clear: .container::after { content: ""; clear: both; display: block; } You can see the results here: http://jsfiddle.net/Qjum2/3/ I hope this helps.
