Compute the mean and std of a random variable from its correlation with known random variables?

Context I'm running statistical simulations on IQ distribution among people and I would like to sample the IQ of a child given : The general distribution of IQ following : $$ \mathcal{N}(100, 15.5) \text{ for male}$$ $$ \mathcal{N}(100, 14.5) \text{ for female}$$ The correlation between the average of parents' IQ and their child IQ (0.5). Both parents' IQs The sex of the child Question Is it possible to do that and if it is, how ?
