I think I may have reached an understanding about this. The summary of the fixed effect coefficients from the model is (on the scale of the link function, here log-odds): summary(fit)$coefficients Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.206 0.222 0.927 0.354 sexM -0.412 0.289 -1.426 0.154 These are the same estimates as when averaging over the random effects for intercept (the sex effect is constant). So, these fixed effect estimates (on the link scale) are population average effects: coef(fit) $classroom (Intercept) sexM class 1 0.1605 -0.412 class 10 0.3606 -0.412 class 2 0.2119 -0.412 class 3 -0.0294 -0.412 class 4 0.0281 -0.412 class 5 0.0855 -0.412 class 6 0.2237 -0.412 class 7 0.3090 -0.412 class 8 0.2119 -0.412 class 9 0.4990 -0.412 colMeans(coef(fit)$classroom) (Intercept) sexM 0.206 -0.412 However, when the coefficients are transformed to odds-ratios this is no longer the case: sapply(coef(fit)$classroom, exp) (Intercept) sexM 1.174 0.662 1.434 0.662 1.236 0.662 0.971 0.662 1.028 0.662 1.089 0.662 1.251 0.662 1.362 0.662 1.236 0.662 1.647 0.662 colMeans(sapply(coef(fit)$classroom, exp)) (Intercept) sexM 1.243 0.662 The intercept above (averaged over the exponentiated random effects) is not the same as the exponentiated fixed effect coefficient below, because exponentiation is not a linear transformation. But, the sex effect is the same, since this did not have a random effect associated with it. Therefore, the sex coefficient is a population average estimate, even as an odds-ratio: exp(fixef(fit)) (Intercept) sexM 1.229 0.662
