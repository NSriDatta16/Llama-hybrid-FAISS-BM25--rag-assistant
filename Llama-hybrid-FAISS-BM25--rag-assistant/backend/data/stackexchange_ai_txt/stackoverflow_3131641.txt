"No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected" after update to 4.0

I updated my iPhone to the new OS 4.0 and went to build my iPhone app and everything built ok, but the message I got at the end was "No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected". Looking at the Xcode organiser, it shows my connected device with an amber icon next to it, and all my provisioning profiles show up as "Installed" but also with an amber icon. Is there something I need to do to make the existing provisioning profiles work since updating to OS 4.0? I have XCode 3.1.3, and 10.5.8 OS. I can not install XCode 3.2.3, because for that I would need 10.6.2 OS which I do not have. So, how do I continue developing and debugging as I used to before I said "yes" to the update dialog on my iPhone, without buying a new OS or new iPhone? Thank you for your help. EDIT1: I do not want to develop for iOS 4.0.
