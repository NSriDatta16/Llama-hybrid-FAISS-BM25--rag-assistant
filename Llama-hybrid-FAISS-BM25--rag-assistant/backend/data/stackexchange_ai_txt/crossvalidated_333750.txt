STL function in R: is it possible to make it backward looking?

I would like to smooth modeling input time series data using the stl function in R . Based on my understanding, the function performs a local regression using data both forwards and backwards of each data point. I would not like to have data points include future information after the smoothing. Is there a way to do that using R's stl function, short of looping the smoothing algorithm through gradually expanding time windows? Here is the function's paper by Cleveland et. al. for your reference.
