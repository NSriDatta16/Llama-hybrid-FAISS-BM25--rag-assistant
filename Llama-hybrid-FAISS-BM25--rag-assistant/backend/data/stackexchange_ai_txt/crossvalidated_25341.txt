May I encourage you to take a step back and think about how your analysis will eventually be used? If I were in charge of some process that used enzymes (DNA sequencing, fruit peeling, whatever), I don't think I'd be terribly surprised to learn that enzymes degrade over time. It's probably more useful to know how fast the enzymes go bad and how much this rate is affected by storage conditions. This information might help determine when to order/produce a new batch of enzymes or how much enzyme solution is necessary to achieve a certain effect if the solution depending on how old it is.Similarly, even if there's a significant difference, it might not be worth the hassle if the solution kept under carefully controlled conditions is 2-3 percent better than the solution kept on the counter. The ANOVAs will tell you if there's a significant difference between conditions/days, but not the size of the difference. Instead, I'd recommend doing some regressions. You could fit each condition's data to an exponential and then compare the decay parameters (vs 0 tells you if the enzyme is degrading; vs each other to look for effects of condition). Other families of functions might be more appropriate, but this seems like a reasonable starting point to me. A few asides: If I understand you correctly, you've got 2 data points per condition/day. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to plot mean + standard deviation of two numbers. Maybe just plot them both? I'd also be tempted to normalize all the data by its starting value even if the initial ANOVA isn't significant since I think it would make the data easier to interpret. On the other hand, this might mask some kinds of changes (e.g., a contaminated sample might have a low starting value AND get worse faster than the others).
