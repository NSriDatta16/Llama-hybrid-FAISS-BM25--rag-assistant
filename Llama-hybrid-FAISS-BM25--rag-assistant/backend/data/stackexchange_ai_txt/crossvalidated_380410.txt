Using SVM with only one feature

I am doing a parametric study on the performance of SVM w.r.t various input feature sets. In one case, I analyze the performance of SVM using a only one feature at a time (similar to One-at-a-time approach ). I also found an article ( here ) where the authors analyze each feature's performance with SVM. My question: Is it advisable to use a single feature as input to SVM?
