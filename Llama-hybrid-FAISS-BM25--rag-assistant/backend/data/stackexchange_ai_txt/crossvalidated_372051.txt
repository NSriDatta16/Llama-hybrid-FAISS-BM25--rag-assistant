Well by distributing the $P(H)$ term, we obtain $$ P(H|X) = \frac{P(X|H)P(H)}{P(X)} P(C) + P(H) [1 - P(C)], $$ which we can interpret as the Law of Total Probability applied to the event $C =$ "you are using Bayesian statistics correctly." So if you are using Bayesian statistics correctly, then you recover Bayes' law (the left fraction above) and if you aren't, then you ignore the data and just use your prior on $H$ . I suppose this is a rejoinder against the criticism that in principle Bayesians can adjust the prior to support whatever conclusion they want, whereas Bayesians would argue that this is not how Bayesian statistics actually works. (And yes, you did successfully nerd-snipe me. I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist though, so I'm not sure how many points I'm worth.)
