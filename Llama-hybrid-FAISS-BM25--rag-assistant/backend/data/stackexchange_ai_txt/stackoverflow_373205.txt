I found a more elegant solution that in my original answer to myself. I found if I just logged in as th euser who orignally installed the application and caused the config file connectionstrings to be encrypted and go to the .net framework directory in a commadn prompt and run aspnet_regiis -pa "NetFrameworkConfigurationKey" "{domain}\{user}" it gave the other user permission to access the RSA encryption key container and it then works for the other user(s). Just wanted to add it here as I thought I had blogged this issue on our dev blog but found it here, so in case I need to look it up again it will be here. Will add link to our dev blog point at this thread as well.
