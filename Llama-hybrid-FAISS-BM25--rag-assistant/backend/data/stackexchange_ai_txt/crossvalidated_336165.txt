When does it make sense, if ever, to remove the intercept from a logistic regression

I normally work with linear regression, but came across a need to use logistic regression. I started with glm(y ~ x1 + ..., data, family = binomial()) . Almost none of my variables were showing large coefs, which is fine. Just for kicks I ran the same model, but excluded the intercept glm(y ~ x1 + ... - 1, data, family = binomial()) . In this model most of the coefs were large and significant. My problem is that I don't have too much experience with logistic regression and I am afraid of using this model simply because I don't want to mess up the interpretation. So my question is: What is the interpretation of the exponentiated coefficients of a logistic regression model that has no intercept?
