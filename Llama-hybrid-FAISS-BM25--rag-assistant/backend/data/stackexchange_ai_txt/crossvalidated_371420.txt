Bayesian hyperparameter learning in a multi-ouput Gaussian Process Regression

Let's imagine I have the following equation $y_t=f(x_t)+e_t$ , where $f(x)$ follows a gaussian process, and $e_t\sim N(0,\Sigma)$ . How does one go about to learn the hyperparameters, i.e., $\Sigma$ and those of of the gaussian process, in a Bayesian way? More specifically, how would we write the $p(Y|X, \theta)$ , where $\theta$ are the hyperparameters of the model, and $Y=(y_1,...,y_N)$ and $X=(x_1,...,x_N)$ ?
