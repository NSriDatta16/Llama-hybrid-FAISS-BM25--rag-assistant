The number of tables in a particular database does not usually become a problem until you have thousands (or tens of thousands) of tables, and these problems usually come into play due to filesystem limits related to the maximum number of files in a directory. You don't say what storage engine you are using. In general, you want the indexes in your database to fit into memory for good insert/update/delete performance, so the size of your key buffer or buffer pool must be large enough to hold the "hot" part of the index.
