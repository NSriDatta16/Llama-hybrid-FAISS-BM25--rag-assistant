It depends on the type of dataset you have. For instance, if you are trying to classify different types of flowers, the order in which you train the model on the features is irrelevant. However, that being said, if you are dealing with non-stationary data such as time series values i.e. stock market prediction, the order of the features relative to time, is very important.
