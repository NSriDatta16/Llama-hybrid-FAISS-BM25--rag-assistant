Backpropagation matrix multiply error Andrew Ng Machine Learning

In the Backpropagation algorithm video(Gradient Computation, week 5), he has taken an example neural network of 4 layers.(Input, 2 Hidden, Output). So, I had made my own example, I have taken x = [3x1] Matrix (Vector) y = [4x1] Matrix (Vector) Theta = [6x4, 6x7, 4x7] Matrices respectively(with weights added). Theta was taken according to s(j+1) x s(j) + 1 Rule. Then calculating deltas, delta_4 = a^(4) - y => 4 x 1 delta_3 = theta[3]'(7x4) X delta_4(1x4) *g'(z(3)) => 7x1 delta_2 = theta[2]'(7x6) X delta_3(7x1) * g'(z(2)) = error The problem I am facing is theta[2] is a 6x7 Matrix . Its transpose is a 7x6 Matrix . We can multiply a matrix when the A(c) = B(r) , where c and r are columns and rows respectively. So Taking a transpose doesn't allow me to multiply the matrices. theta2 is a 6x7 matrix and delta3 is a 7x1 matrix(vector) theta2_transpose is a 7x6 matrix which doesn't allow me to multiply. So Please tell me where I'm getting it wrong. can anyone one of you can explain in matrix(r, c) format ? Need answers, Please.
