Infinitesimal generator of Markov chain using numpy

I am computing the infinitesimal generator of a continuous-time Markov chain from the transition probabilities p . I am following the methodology described here , just translated the R code to python/numpy. p = np.array([[0.8,0.2,0],[0.1,0.7,0.2],[0.1,0.1,0.8]]) # probabilities, rows sum to 1 values, vectors = np.linalg.eig(p) q = vectors@np.diag(np.log(values))@np.linalg.inv(vectors) print(q) [[-0.238 0.273 -0.035] [ 0.119 -0.392 0.273] [ 0.119 0.119 -0.238]] If q contains transition rates, like explained in page 17 here , I would expect that given p[0,2] is 0 , the corresponding q[0,2] should also be 0, but that is not the case. Is there something wrong with my methodology? or is it my assumption that 0 values in p should also correspond to 0 values in q ?
