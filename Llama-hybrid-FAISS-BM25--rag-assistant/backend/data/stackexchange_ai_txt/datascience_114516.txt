Resources on data science errors?

I am putting together some material on common mistakes that occur in data science. The problem, is people often don't talk about the mistakes that everyone has made. Are there any good resources of real-world examples of these mistakes, and their consequences? Note: Specific examples are good, but I'm looking for a repository of many mistakes.
