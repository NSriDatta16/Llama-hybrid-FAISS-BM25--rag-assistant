Analyzing relationships between ordinal and continuous time series data

I have two sets of time series data - roleTrajectories & normalizedDegree. The former data set contains ordinal rankings of subjects' positions within a network at 13 time periods. The latter data set contains subjects' normalized degree centrality at the same 13 time periods. I am trying to determine whether or not subjects' changes in ordinal rank is correlated with changes in their normalized degree centrality. What is most appropriate approach to analyzing the relationship between the two data sets? I plan on using R for the analysis; if possible I would be grateful if someone could point me to the right package to use.
