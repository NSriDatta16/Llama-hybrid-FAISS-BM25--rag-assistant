Prediction intervals for mixture models for time series forecasting - is it really an average of the prediction intervals of the averaged models?

I'm trying to find out how to do forecasting with a mixture model (averaging the forecasts of an ets , an arima and an stlf model). I do not have a huge amount of statistics experience and so I'm struggling with finding out how to do it. The point forecasts will just be the average of the point forecasts of the three methods, no problem. The problem is how to calculate the prediction intervals. I have found an R script with an attempt to do it, but the mixture prediction intervals are just calculated as an average of the prediction intervals of the models, and I am pretty sceptical about this approach - is it really that easy? If not, how do I go about calculating them?
