Logistic Regression in R (Odds Ratio)

I'm trying to undertake a logistic regression analysis in R . I have attended courses covering this material using STATA. I am finding it very difficult to replicate functionality in R . Is it mature in this area? There seems to be little documentation or guidance available. Producing odds ratio output seems to require installing epicalc and/or epitools and/or others, none of which I can get to work, are outdated or lack documentation. I've used glm to do the logistic regression. Any suggestions would be welcome. I'd better make this a real question. How do I run a logistic regression and produce odds rations in R ? Here's what I've done for a univariate analysis: x = glm(Outcome ~ Age, family=binomial(link="logit")) And for multivariate: y = glm(Outcome ~ Age + B + C, family=binomial(link="logit")) I've then looked at x , y , summary(x) and summary(y) . Is x$coefficients of any value?
