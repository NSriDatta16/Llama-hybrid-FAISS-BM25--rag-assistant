Extracting vectors of FastText own model to use it on a NN

I have trained my own model of fasttext using the pretrained model of English available on their website with the next code: from gensim.models.fasttext import load_facebook_model mod = load_facebook_model('fasttext/cc.en.300.bin') mod.build_vocab(sentences=list(df_train.text), update = True) mod.train(sentences=list(df_train.tex), total_examples=len(df_train.text), epochs=10) Now I will like to extract the vectors of this embedding to train a LSTM neural network with it. Any tip on how to do so? Thanks in advance.
