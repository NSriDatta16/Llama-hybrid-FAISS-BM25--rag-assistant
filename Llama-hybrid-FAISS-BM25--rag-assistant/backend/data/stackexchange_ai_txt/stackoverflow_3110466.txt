I'm groping here, especially because you didn't put up the full traceback. However,there may be something to do with cache_template_extensions. http://www.mail-archive.com/heroku@googlegroups.com/msg02172.html talks about it, in regard to your problem, and http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/66/topics/2484 mentions it as an issue when upgrading to 2.3.2. Bottom line: find that line in your code (development.rb or somewhere near there) that refers to cache_template_extensions, and remove it. Good luck.
