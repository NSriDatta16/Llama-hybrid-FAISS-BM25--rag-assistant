A crude approach would be to treat "willingness" as normally distributed with constant variance and fit a linear mixed model with PB as the predictor and a random effect for subject. You should of course construct residual plots to make sure that the constant variance assumption, especially, isn't truly outrageous. If not -- and if you have a large sample size and roughly equal numbers of PB=yes and PB=no values -- inference based on this model should be approximately valid.
