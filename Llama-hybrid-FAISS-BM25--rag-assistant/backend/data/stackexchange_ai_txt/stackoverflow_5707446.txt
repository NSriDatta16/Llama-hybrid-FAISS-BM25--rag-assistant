It is possible to install plugins with Package Maker 3. It is easier by using " Raw Editing Mode ". All you have to do is to install plugins activating the Raw Editing mode Menu>Project>Raw Editing Mode and than drag the plugins (Plugnins folder containing bundles and the InstallerSections.plist) to the Files . It is less pain than Flat Package Editor, I think. Good luck, Bye
