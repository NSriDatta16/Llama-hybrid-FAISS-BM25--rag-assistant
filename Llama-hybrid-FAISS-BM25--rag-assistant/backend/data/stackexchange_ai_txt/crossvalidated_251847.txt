Computing Confidence Intervals for Odds Ratio Based on Fitted Values

I am trying to figure out how to get confidence intervals for odds ratios that were computed based on model fitted values from a logistic regression. Here's an example with the basic idea: #Load packages library(vcd) library(dplyr) data(Arthritis) #Create binary outcome for logistic regression Arthritis$Y % mutate(link=predict(fit, newdata=., type="link"), se=predict(fit, newdata=., type="link", se.fit=T)$se.fit, odds=exp(link)) #Odds ratio with 'Female, Placebo' as referent df$OR Can I compute a confidence interval for the odds ratios? I've seen other responses showing how I can get a CI for the fitted estimates, but not for ratios based on those estimates. Thanks.
