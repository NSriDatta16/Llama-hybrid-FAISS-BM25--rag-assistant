One option here would be to have your code generator prefix the user-specified name with @ . As described in 2.4.2 , the @ sign (verbatim identifier): prefix "@" enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the prefix. An identifier with an @ prefix is called a verbatim identifier. Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style. This would allow you to check for the main keywords, and deny them as needed, but not worry about all of the conflicting type information, etc.
