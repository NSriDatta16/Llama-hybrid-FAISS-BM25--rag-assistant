Machine learning to predict apps (recomendation)

I am currently collecting mobile device data about user location and the time at which an app is being used for a cohort of users and apps. I am trying to predict which apps are likely to be used at a given time by a given user. Which model should i use in order to predict the apps that are likely to be used by a particular user? For example, should I collect data for 5 days a week then use the 3 days for training and then the other 2 days for testing? Given location, time of day, and day, what model should I use to predict which app is likely to be used?
