As others have written , this is compositional data analysis . We have a compositional-data tag, so searching for threads carrying, e.g., this tag and the "time-series" one may be helpful. One paper on forecasting compositional time series is Snyder et al. (2017, IJF ) . Essentially, the idea is to transform the original compositional time series, then forecast the transformed data, and finally back-transform the forecasts in a way that respects the compositional nature. Thus, this approach should also work with other forecasting methods, like neural networks, or anything that uses lags or causal effects.
