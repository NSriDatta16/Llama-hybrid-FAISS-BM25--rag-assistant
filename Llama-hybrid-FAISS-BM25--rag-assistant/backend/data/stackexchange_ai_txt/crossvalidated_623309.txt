Relationships between two measurements of size of an organism are very simple: they are usually just based on a linear regression between the two quantities. Look up allometric scaling relationships for more on this topic. For example, here's a paper linking bone length and body mass. It finds very strong relationships: Once a relationship like this is established, the regression can be used to make predictions for any other species when you have measurements of just one of the two quantities. This is seen most often in the case of extinct species, for which we estimate mass based on fossil bones. Relationships based on age are a little more complicated because they are not linear, but the principle is the same. The von Bertalanffy growth function is often used for this, though it has been criticised and extended. This paper is relevant. Population size estimation is a larger and more complex topic. Mark-recapture methods are one way that population sizes are estimated by ecologists.
