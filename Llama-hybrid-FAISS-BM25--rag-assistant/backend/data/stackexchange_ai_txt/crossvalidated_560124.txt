why is unsupervised learning said to be learning probability distribution?

In the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow et al., it is mentioned that unsupervised learning involves observing several examples of a random vector x, and attempting to implicitly or explicitly learn the probability distribution p(x) However when I think about the typical unsupervised algorithms such as clustering and anomaly detection, I fail to understand why such algorithms are learning $p(x)$ . For example in anomaly detection, is it not more accurate to say that it is learning $p(Y|X)$ where Y = 1 if the data is an anomaly and 0 otherwise?
