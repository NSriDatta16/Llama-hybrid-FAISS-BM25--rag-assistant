How to view load test reports by individual request in Visual Studio Team edition

When performance testing a web site using the Load Web Test of Visual Studio one gets a summary of the results. Useful measures are shown, like the average response time, maximum response time etc. One thing that intrigues me is being able to drill down to specific requests if needed, answering questions like what was the single request taking the most time. One can set the Timing Details Storage property of the Run Settings to "All Individual Details", but that only seems to give aggregation per URI, ignoring changes to the query parameters. In my scenario, http://somewebsite/dosomething.ashx?cmd=find is very different from http://somewebsite/dosomething.ashx?cmd=nothing . How do I generate a report which distinguish those?
