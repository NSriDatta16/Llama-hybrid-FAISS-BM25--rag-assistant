smorgan's answer is right. For someone who maybe need more explanations, I will add my thinking. I think plugin process has CGContext which doesn't have real os window. because browser process need window but plugin process just transfer drawing data to browser process, so plugin process's CGContext does NOT have location. It might be just memory buffer. Thanks smorgan.
