Think of the average score for all those who received A (including A + B). That average is around 5. Now think of the average score for all those who didn't receive A (i.e., control and B). That average is also around 5. So you can see that there is no main effect of A. If you do the same for B, you will find the same results. Marginally, that is, ignoring whether you receive the other treatment, each factor has no effect on the outcome. Clearly, there is something else going on, which can be found in the interaction. What is the effect of A vs. no A for those with no B? It is to increase the score by 6. What is the effect of A vs. no A for those with B? It is to decrease the score by 6. That is the effect you are observing. Another way to describe it is that receiving exactly one treatment yields a score of 8, but receiving either no treatment or both treatments yields a score of 2.
