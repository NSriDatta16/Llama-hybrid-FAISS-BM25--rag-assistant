Ruby - Mechanize: Select link by classname and other questions

At the moment I'm having a look on Mechanize. I am pretty new to Ruby, so please be patient. I wrote a little test script: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new page = agent.get('http://www.google.de') pp page.title google_form = page.form_with(:name => 'f') google_form.q = 'test' page = agent.submit(google_form) pp page.title page_links = Array.new page.links.each do |ll| page_links This works. But page_links includes not only the search results. It also includes the google links like Login, Pictures, ... The result links own a styleclass "1". Is it possible to select only the links with class == 1? How do I achieve this? Is it possible to modify the "agentalias"? If I own a website, including google analytics or something, what browserclient will I see in ga going with mechanize on my site? Can I select elements by their ID instead of their name? I tried to use my_form = page.form_with(:id => 'myformid') But this does not work.
