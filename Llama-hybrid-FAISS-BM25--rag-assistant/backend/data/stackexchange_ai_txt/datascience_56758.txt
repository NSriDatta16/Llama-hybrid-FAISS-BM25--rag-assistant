Why is PCA often used before t-sne for problems when the goal is only to reduce dimensionality?

Ex: Matlab's t-sne tutorials frequently use PCA https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/tsne-settings.html " Process Data Using t-SNE Obtain two-dimensional analogs of the data clusters using t-SNE. Use the Barnes-Hut algorithm for better performance on this large data set. Use PCA to reduce the initial dimensions from 784 to 50. (1) Why are we using PCA here to reduce dimensions to 50 first at all if we are going to use t-sne after PCA to reduce to 2 dimensions anyway? Matlab Tutorial Code: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/tsne-settings.html rng default % for reproducibility Y = tsne(X,'Algorithm','barneshut','NumPCAComponents',50); figure gscatter(Y(:,1),Y(:,2),L) 1) See question bolded above 2) What would you have googled to find this out? I had googled "Why is PCA often used before t-sne for problems when the goal is only to reduce dimensionality? "
