Not to toot my own horn, but I made a pretty popular video series on text analytics with Rapidminer. You can see it here: http://vancouverdata.blogspot.com/2010/11/text-analytics-with-rapidminer-loading.html You can likely avoid doing feature selection, just use a classifier that doesn't create a million * million matrix in memory :) Logistic regression will choke on that many dimensions. Naive Bayes assumes independent dimensions, so you will be fine. SVM doesn't depend on the number of dimensions (but on the number of support vectors) so it will be fine as well. 300 is a lot of classes though. I would start with only a few and work your way up.
