If the content is very large and the changes are only minor ones, you may consider to go for a "reverse delta" approach: only the latest version of the text is stored in full format, and the previous vesion is a diff from the latest version to the previous. It would spare a lot of storage space, but comparing two versions where the number of modifications is large, the cost of the process could be considerable. After all, it is always a tradeoff between storage space and processing requirements. If you can't or don't want to user PEAR and PECL, you still can use the diff utility called by exec. I'd go for a standard diff format for sure, and never develop an own one.
