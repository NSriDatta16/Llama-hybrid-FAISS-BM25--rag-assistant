I think you are talking about a heightmap which is you PNG which is then converted to a 3D triangle mesh. You need to use the information from the mesh (or PNG color value) to calculate the current height where you should place your character. If this is a flying character your pretty much done here, but in your case you need to calculate the normal vector of the current triangle the character is standing on. This is pretty simple using the cross product of the two triangle vectors (V2 - V1) x (V3 - V1). That should be your characters angle as well. You could maybe average this vector by including normals from the surrounding trangles as well. Btw, when you have the normals of the triangle you can apply some basic shading to the ground as well. Added: The OP changed the question to be a 2D problem. The above approach still works, but it much easier in 2D. Use the height values not as triangles but as lines (silhouette) and calculate the normal of the current line instead. That is, create a vector, v, between the current height value and the next. Then the normal of that vector is n = . Use that as the angle of your character.
