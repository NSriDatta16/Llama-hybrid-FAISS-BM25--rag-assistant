There are no characters that require UTF-16 rather than UTF-8. Both UTF-8 and UTF-16 (and for that matter, UTF-32 along with some other non-recommended formats) can encode the entire UCS (that's what UTF means). There are some streams that will be smaller in UTF-16 than in UTF-8. However, in practice such streams will largely contain Asian ideographs which are linguistically very concise. However, XML requires some characters in the 0x20-0x7F range with specific meanings, and are quite often using alphabet-based scripts for the element and attribute names. Because of the aforementioned concision of these ideographs, the ratio of XML tags (including the element and attribute name along with the less-thans and greater-thans) to human-trageted text will be much higher than in languages that use alphabets and syllabaries. For this reason, even in cases where plain-text in UTF-16 would be appreciably smaller than the same text in UTF-8, when it comes to XML either this difference will be less, or the UTF-8 will still be smaller. As a rule, use UTF-8 for transmission and storage. Edit: Just noticed that you're compressing too. In which case, the balance is even less important, just use UTF-8 and be done with it.
