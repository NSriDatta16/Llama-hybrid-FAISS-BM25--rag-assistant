MyOrganization.Technology is still the recommended way to start the namespace with. I used to have similar problem of namespacing my hobby the projects before. So I've just made up the name for the development group of one (you want to have a short and readable one) and started using it. However, keep in mind that the usability is still the key. For example, here's is one exception from the rule. Our open source Lokad Shared Libraries are following namespace of the .NET itself (i.e.: System or System.Threading ). That's because there are numerous everyday helpers and extensions that should be available for our developers without even noticing that they are leveraging non-BCL code. It also makes the using declarations look nicer.
