ColdFusion will run on any J2EE servlet engine - which includes JRun, Tomcat, Resin, Jetty, and others. It will not run directly on a web server like Apache or IIS (these are configured to send appropriate requests to the application server). As Steve points out, there are alternative CFML engines to Adobe CF - the two main ones are Railo and OpenBD (both are Open Source with commercial options available), but these still both need Tomcat/etc. If you have a Windows+IIS server, you might consider BlueDragon.NET , which is commercial only (not Open Source), but will plug directly into an IIS web server (no need for a J2EE servlet engine). Whether any of this is easier than just re-writing the 70 lines of logic in a language/technology you're already using will depend on what precisely that code is doing. On one hand, 70 lines isn't much and sticking to a single technology is better, but then again, Railo or OpenBD are both quick and easy to setup and wont cost you any licensing fees.
