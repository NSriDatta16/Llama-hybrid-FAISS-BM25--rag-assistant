What does linear regressor output mean? I am using tensorflow estimator in R

I try the code at tensorflow in R tutorial (https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/ ) but I cannot understand the output what the code produces. Code: library(tfestimators) install_tensorflow() # return an input_fn for a given subset of data mtcars_input_fn % train(mtcars_input_fn(train, num_epochs = 10)) model %>% evaluate(mtcars_input_fn(test)) Train function output: [/] Training -- loss: 6459.84, step: 8 Evaluate function output: `label/mean` average_loss global_step `prediction/mean` loss 1 21.6 177. 8 11.6 1239. My questions: Why losses are so big? What does label/mean and preddiction/mean mean? What is the difference between steps and epochs? Thanks!
