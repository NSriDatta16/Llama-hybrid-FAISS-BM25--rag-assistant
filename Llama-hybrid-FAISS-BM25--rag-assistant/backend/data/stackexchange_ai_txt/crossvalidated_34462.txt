How should I determine if a person differs from typical performance?

I have a set of data that looks like this: Person 1 [48 total records] 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, -- Person 2 [56 total records] 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, -- Person 3 [18 total records] 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, A '1' indicates a false answer, and a '2' indicates a correct one. I want to be able to compare records to see if any people in the data set are performing significantly above or below average. I've heard of using z-scores and standard deviations, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach, or even how I would go about doing the calculation. I also need to find out the minimum number of records I would need in order to have sufficient confidence in the results (if that's the correct term). Basically, I want to make sure I'm only performing this analysis on people with enough records to minimize the role chance would play. My math skills are pretty limited, so a simple explanation would be greatly appreciated.
