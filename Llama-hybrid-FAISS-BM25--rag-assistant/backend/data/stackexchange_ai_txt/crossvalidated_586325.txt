I'm currently analyzing the data of an experiment and faced a couple of questions. I want to test the hypothesis that: Variable A predicts Variable B. The two variables are the results of 2 tests. Variable A is the average of items 1-22. Variable B is the average of 3 test components. Variable A is not normally distributed. B is normally distributed There is no linearity between the 2 variables. There is a very weak correlation after testing with Spearman's rho (0.18) and Kendall's tau (0.13). Initially, the experiment had 4 conditions. Could the bad correlation and the no normal distribution be explained because of the 4 conditions and should I look for the correlation within the groups then - like testing for correlation between A and B in the first condition, then in the second, and so on...
