Problem in PCA plot analysis

I have generated these two PCA plots on Galaxy using two different GEO datasets, as a part of RNA-Seq analysis. In both, each group has several clusters. Also in the Obese vs Control dataset, the PC1 is very high 81%. So, according to my understanding none of the datasets are good to go. Obese dataset: T2D dataset: My questions are: How do we know if a PCA plot is good? What I have learnt from online tutorials is that the PC1 should not be very low or very high, a PC1 of 40-60% is good. Also, the samples should be neatly clustered into a single cluster. Can I still take forward these two datasets by picking the closely clustered samples? Is there a statistical way to figure out which sub-clusters to choose for the next level of analysis? What is the minimum number of samples one should have in each group? Is it 2? [
