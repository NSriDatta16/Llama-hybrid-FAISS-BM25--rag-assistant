Inline Background Image for Text

I want to use a background image to highlight text in a paragraph. I do not want to use the background-color property for this as I want an image that look more like it was hand highlighted. How can I do this INLINE? I seem to only be able to do it as a block element and then the text breaks to its own line. I need it inline, a sentence here or there within a paragraph. Example of it working but only as a block level element: link text Please scroll down a bit to the YELLOW highlighted text. I need the highlighting to NOT cause the text to break onto the next line AND to end when the associated span ends, which could be right in the middle of a paragraph. THANK YOU! I read all over the place and could not see a solution.
