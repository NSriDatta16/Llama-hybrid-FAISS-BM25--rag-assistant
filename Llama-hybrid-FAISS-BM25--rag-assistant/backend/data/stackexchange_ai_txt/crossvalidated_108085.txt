Interpretation of Linear SVM Coefficients

I’m building a model using Linear SVM from the Scikit-learn package in Python. I have found that Linear SVM performs much better on my training set than Logistic Regression. My question is, is there a way to interpret the coefficients from my linear SVM in a similar way as we would interpret logistic regression coefficients? I can output the coefficient of each feature in my model using coef_. I’m trying to figure out if there is a way to measure how effective each feature in my dataset is in regards to predicting an outcome. For example, a completely hypothetical situation, using logistic regression to predict whether a student is in an honors class or not, given the student’s test scores. Using Logistic Regression it’s possible to calculate an output along the lines of “a one-unit increase in the test score leads to an expected 10% increase in odds of the student being in the honors class”. Is it possible to calculate something similar using Linear SVM? As you can probably tell, I’m a complete newbie when it comes to this and any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks
