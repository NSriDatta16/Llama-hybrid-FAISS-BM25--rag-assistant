What is a proper way of switching the servers and VMs off and on for power outage?

my organisation have two physical servers and some VMs. Currently when there is a pre-scheduled power outage, I use a script I wrote to loop through all VMs scheduling a shutdown command to all VMs and the servers. For example, ssh root@${VMS[$i]} 'echo "shutdown -h now" | at 05:00am Mar 31' Then I restart the machines when I am back to the office in the morning. Is this the appropriate way of doing the auto shutdown? Do you do it differently? Thanks in advanced.
