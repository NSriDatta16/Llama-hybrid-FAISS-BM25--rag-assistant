Average php memory usage per request?

What is your average php memory usage per request . I know lots of people will say that php memory usage depends on the application , but i just want to get general idea about your data.I just created simple php framework so i want to know that do i use needless memory or it is normal . Actually , the interesting point is about my database class. I have a database class which is part of framework. For example , i have an albums table in database and albums have child objects which are songs . When i select albums from database , my database class automatically find child objects and get the data about them form database. So when this process occur , database class consumes around 1mb memory . If it is too much or you have an different method for this process please share .
