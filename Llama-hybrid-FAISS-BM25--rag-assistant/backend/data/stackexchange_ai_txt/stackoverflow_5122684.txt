You cannot create a HTTP sniffer extension in Chrome using their APIs, you have to go through the C++ route and create a cross platform NPAPI plugin that your extension can access: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/npapi.html Answers to your questions: Rapid install, they just click on "Install" within the browser, and the extension is automatically installed. Cross platform, you can create a single extension that will work on all platforms (embed platform specific plugins). Easy development, your development will all be in JavaScript that communicates to your plugin through JavaScript. In the plugin, you only deal with the inputs and the outputs. Everything is like a black box. You can use firebreath . HTML5 Web SQL Storage or keyvalue LocalStorage and IndexDB Use HTML5 WebWorkers for asynchronous operations. Plugins can do asynchronous callbacks too! Since your using NPAPI, there is no limit. Your NPAPI can create a SysTray icon if you want to as well. The cons of using NPAPI is that, your extension becomes dangerous to the end-user, since you are technically executing native code.
