Favourite Colour: Myrtle

At work we use confluence . On occasion it crashes, resulting in an error 500 page being generated. This page includes some interesting reference information, including: System Information: favouriteColour: Myrtle javaRuntime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment jvmVersion: 1.0 operatingSystem: Linux 2.6.18-92.1.13.el5 ... Myrtle? Many thoughts raged through my head. What's Myrtle? Why is it my favourite colour? Is it my favourite colour? Why does that particular tidbit of information require its own system property? At first I assumed it was just something that someone at work had done. A remnant of a project long forgotten, an old April Fools joke perhaps? It seems I was mistaken . In fact, even Atlassian acknowledges the colour , though they give no reason for its existence. Now, I know what you're thinking? Who cares? I do, gentle reader, I do. And you should too. It's little mysteries like this that make life worth living. So, is there one among you who knows the secret of The Mysterious Myrtle uh.. Mystery? At least one inquiring mind wants to know..
