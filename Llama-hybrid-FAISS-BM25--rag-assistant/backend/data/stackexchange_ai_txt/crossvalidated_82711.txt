The problem induced by non-response is bias due to differences in responders and non-responders. Adding extra observations to strata with higher non-response will not reduce the bias, so that approach cannot be recommended. However, adding extra resources , such as more personalized follow-up, is a reasonable strategy. I would not apply the resources to everyone in the sample of the low-response strata, but to a sample of the non-responders, no matter what strata they come from. This technique is known as two-phase, or "double", sampling. The overall choice of a sampling scheme, including the effort devoted to each phase of a double-sampling plan is governed by an equation which relates desired precision to cost. See any good sampling text, e.g. Lohr, 2009. There are also weighting solutions for non-response, for example response-cell weighting and inverse-probability-of response weighting (IPW). I'm traveling, but I believe that you will find good examples in Groves et al. (2009) as well as in Lohr (2009). Also, google "inverse probability weighting response" or related phrases.
