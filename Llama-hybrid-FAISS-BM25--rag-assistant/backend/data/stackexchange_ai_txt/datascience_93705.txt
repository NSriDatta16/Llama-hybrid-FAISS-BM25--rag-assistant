As the data augmentation must only be used for the training data, I will have very few images from the 4 classes for the validation set, would it be a problem? You may first perform data augmentation on the image dataset and then split it into train/test or train/test/validation. Just make sure that the images present in the test split are not included in the training split or vice-versa. See this . Is it needed to split it in training/validation/test, or is training/validation enough ? The validation dataset is particularly to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters i.e for hyperparameter optimization. If you want to simply skip that procedure, just make two splits, train, and test. See this . See this answer to know the difference between test and validation dataset. Another problem is the unbalanced data with such a difference between the number of images in each class, would oversampling or undersampling be a good solution ? I would encourage you to augment the images for a specific class until you are left with a near-balanced dataset. For transfer learning and fine tuning, should I freeze all the convolutional layers or should I only train a FC layer? As a common practice, you may try unfreezing some initial layers ( layers that usually have lesser filters ). Refer to this blog. Deeper layers have more filters and extract high-level features.
