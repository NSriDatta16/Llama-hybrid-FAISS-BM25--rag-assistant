ANTLR on a noisy data stream

I'm very new in the ANTLR world and I'm trying to figure out how can I use this parsing tool to interpret a set of "noisy" string. What I would like to achieve is the following. let's take for example this phrase : It's 10PM and the Lazy CAT is currently SLEEPING heavily on the SOFA in front of the TV What I would like to extract is CAT , SLEEPING and SOFA and have a grammar that match easily the following pattern : SUBJECT - VERB - INDIRECT OBJECT... where I could define VERB : 'SLEEPING' | 'WALKING'; SUBJECT : 'CAT'|'DOG'|'BIRD'; INDIRECT_OBJECT : 'CAR'| 'SOFA'; etc.. I don't want to ends up with a permanent "NoViableException" as I can't describe all the possibilities around the language structure. I just want to tear apart useless words and just keep the one that are interesting. It's more like if I had a tokeniser and asked the parser "Ok, read the stream until you find a SUBJECT, then ignore the rest until you find a VERB, etc.." I need to extract an organized structure in an un-organized set... For example, I would like to be able to interpret (I'm not judging the pertinence of this utterly basic and incorrect view of 'english grammar') SUBJECT - VERB - INDIRECT OBJECT INDIRECT OBJECT - SUBJECT - VERB so I will parse sentences like It's 10PM and the Lazy CAT is currently SLEEPING heavily on the SOFA in front of the TV or It's 10PM and, on the SOFA in front of the TV, the Lazy CAT is currently SLEEPING heavily
