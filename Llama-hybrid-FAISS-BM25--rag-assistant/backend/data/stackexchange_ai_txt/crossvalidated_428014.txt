Very intersting question, and I've been reading through this paper for a little while now, trying to understand, and here's my best guess at why this was done: The ML part of this paper is just restricted to just the first part of the study, where the objective is to simply predict (using the hourly wage variable in the dataset) which individuals earn an average hourly wage of less the 125% of the statutory minimum. The authors are trying to build their prediction model only using demographic features ("age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, marital status, citizenship/nativity status, and rural status of the residency"), so they want to make sure that the wage rate value that is observed for each individual in the dataset is only influenced by these demographic features and not prior minimum wage hikes, which in theory, could effect everyone's wage rate in different ways. For this reason, they exclude all observations from state's where there's been "at least one minimum wage increase in the last 4 quarters to allow wages to adjust to the new environment". With regards to the test set, if the the model developed in training does a good job using only these demographic features to predict, then it shouldn't matter so much whether or not these events are included, but in doing so, they can potentially increase the model's robustness. If you hear back from the authors please post their answer here, as I'm also very curious to hear what they have to say. Thanks for sharing the paper.
