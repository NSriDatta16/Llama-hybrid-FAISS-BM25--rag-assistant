The prediction interval is $$ \hat{y}_{h} \pm t_{(1-\alpha / 2, n-2)} \times \sqrt{M S E \times\left(1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x_{h}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}\right)}$$ for a simple linear regression. The mean of this quantity is $\hat{y}_h$ . Thus, you can simply take the average of the prediction interval points and recover the prediction. This is not true generally speaking for other models however. Prediction intervals integrate over the uncertainty in the parameters and the likelihood, and not all likelihoods are symmetric about their mean (e.g. the gamma).
