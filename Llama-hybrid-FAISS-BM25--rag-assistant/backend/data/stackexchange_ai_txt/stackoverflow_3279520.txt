Different between UIView and UIControl when drag inside UIScrollView

I have a UIScrollView which contains some small UIView subclass. UIScrollView is scroll enabled, and I want each UIView can be dragged inside UIScrollView freely. My UIView subclass has this method: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] != self) { return; } CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; originalX = self.center.x; originalY = self.center.y; offsetX = originalX - touchPoint.x; offsetY = originalY - touchPoint.y; [self.superview bringSubviewToFront:self]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == self) { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; CGFloat x = location.x + offsetX; CGFloat y = location.y + offsetY; self.center = CGPointMake(x, y); return; } } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == self) { self.center = CGPointMake(originalX, originalY); } } I found touchesCancelled:withEvent will be called each time I just drag UIView several pixels. But these codes will work correctly if it is subclass of UIControl. Why? Thanks in advance!
