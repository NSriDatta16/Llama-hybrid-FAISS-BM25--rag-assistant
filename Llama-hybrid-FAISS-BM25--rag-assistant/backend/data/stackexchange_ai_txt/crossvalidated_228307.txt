The answer is that you need to "unfold" the recurrent neural network ( https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/rolling-and-unrolling-rnns/ ) The easiest way is to build an "unfolded" model of a fixed length and train it. After you found the weights - when you need to use your model to label the sequences, you will not have any limit on the length.
