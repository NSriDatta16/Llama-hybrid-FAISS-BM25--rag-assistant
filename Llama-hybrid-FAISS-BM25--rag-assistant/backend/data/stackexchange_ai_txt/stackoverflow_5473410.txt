Hey thanks, you got me on the right track. I was using zend_auth to persist the entity through session storage, and I was calling getIdentity()->getId() , which it didn't like. Works fine without separating the entity dirs, but its no problem atm, I just persisted the id into storage and had my class recreate the object from the id. It seems to be working now, thanks for the help
