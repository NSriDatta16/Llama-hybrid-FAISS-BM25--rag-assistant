Ajax loaded html doen't show images in Firefox

I loaded some async HTML with $.ajax({ url: target, beforeSend: function () { }, success: function (html) { targetTabBox.html(html); } }); The URL: target is a "page" returning a HTML fragment (some text and images). targetTabBox is a div In IE all is well, but in firefox, I don't get to see my images only the alt text. When I right-click the image and do properties I see: http://localhost:3000/Product/Slapen/Laken-en-deken/%5CFoto%5CCms%5Cgots-logo.gif Which is wrong, but: When I look at the HTML with firebug I see: Which is as it should be! What am I missing here?
