?_escaped_fragment_= - headless browser

what do I have to do to add a ?_escaped_fragment_= support to my server? I want google to be able to crawl through my ajax site. My hashes are already in #! form But I have no idea how to tell my server that when I enter mywebsite.com/?_escaped_fragment_=section to my browser so the url mywebsite.com/section and it would be equal to mywebsite.com/#! thanks
