ODBC could not complete the requested operation

I am having a problem with an a lotus 8 agent running on a server.The agent tries to fetch data form a sybase database (using Sybase 11 ODBC driver).I can run the same agent from a cleint machine with no error, but when the agent runs on the server it ends with the following error. -> LS:DO- ODBC could not complete the requested operation. If you have any ideas please forward it. Thanks
