Can't reproduce. Made a simple demo here http://jsbin.com/iposi3/2 which loads http://jsbin.com/uwoxe/2 . Note it is vital that the loaded remote page isn't a full-blown-html page, so no html , head , body tags or the like else it will fail completly. Only a "html-fragment" as the one you have shown. To view the code use http://jsbin.com/iposi3/2/edit and http://jsbin.com/uwoxe/2/edit Works just fine in my Opera. Although of course the facebox is too small to show the tabs nicely with default settings. To your problem I recall (check my post on that ) that jQuery sometimes strips the script tags from remote loaded content. But that seems to apply only when $.load is used which FaceBox doesn't (it uses $.get for remote content). Which browser do you experience problems in? If it is IE it could be that IE throws "Permission Denied" errors when jQuery tries to inject the script tags from the remote content. Did you check your browsers error console?
