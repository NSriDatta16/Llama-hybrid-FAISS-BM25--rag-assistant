No significant difference on the first four criteria. No significant difference on coding speed either - you're going to be slow in both at the start, then you'll get faster. Ruby may be slightly better at managing libraries (Ruby Gems) but Python probably has slightly broader library coverage. No big deal either way. Coming from PHP, I'd guess that Python might be slightly quicker to learn. That might be a reason for choosing Ruby - you might learn a little more. There are a lot of "mights" and "slightlys" there. That's because the two languages are much more similar to each other than either is to PHP. Neither is particularly hard to learn - I'd suggest spending a little time with both and then going deeper with the one you prefer.
