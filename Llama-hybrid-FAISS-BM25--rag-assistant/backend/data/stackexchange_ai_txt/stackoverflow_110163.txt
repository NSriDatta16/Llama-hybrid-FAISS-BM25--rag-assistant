How do I save a model with this dynamically generated field?

I have a rails model that looks something like this: class Recipe x) self.ingredients The idea is that when I create the ingredient from the webpage, I pass in the ingredients_string and let the model sort it all out. Of course, if I am editing an ingredient I need to re-create that string. The bug is basically this: how do I inform the view of the ingredient_string (elegantly) and still check to see if the ingredient_string is defined in the set_ingredients method?
