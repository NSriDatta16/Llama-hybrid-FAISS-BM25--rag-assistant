ANSI C standard (aka C89), 3.5.7: All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration or in an initializer list for an object that has aggregate or union type shall be constant expressions . The latter part of this restriction has been dropped in C99, which isn't properly supported by VS.
