I agree with many of the posting concerning ruby's ActiveRecord migrations - they are an elegant way to manage the database in small incremental files that everyone can share. With that said, I've recently implemented a project using VisualStudio's Database Project, and it's kinda made me a believer. Short story - you create a database project, import all (if any) existing database objects into it (tables/views/triggers/keys/users/etc). That import results in a "Create" script per object. To manage the database you alter the create script and then on deploy VS compares the target database to the state of the database residing in your project and apply the proper alter statements. It really is a bit of magic and I have to admit, it's one of the better things the VS team has done. I'm really impressed up to this point. Of course, you can manage the whole database project in the version control system of your choice.
