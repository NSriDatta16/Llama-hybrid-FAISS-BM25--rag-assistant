Checking Visual Studio files for code comments

I'm looking for a Visual Studio 2008 add-in or macro that will examine all of the .cs files and report back on "code comment coverage". Our company's standard is that all C# classes, methods, and properties are code commented. I've got a large solution, and going through the files by hand wastes a lot of time. If I had a report that told me exactly which files have code comments and which ones don't, I could examine just those files. I don't mind writing some code to accomplish this, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel. Is there an add-in or macro that does this? Failing that, is there a way to use reflection or the System.CodeDom namespace to check a class for code comments? If I could just get my classes loaded into an object model, I could probably get the rest of the way there.
