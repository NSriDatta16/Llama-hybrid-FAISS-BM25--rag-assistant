Why can't my ROC reach a low PPV?

I am creating a couple of models (RF, SVM, LR) and I want to evaluate all of them on a certain PPV (0.7). This question and this question helped me write my code: #Run RF data_ctrl_null $pred$ affirmatory, response = rf_model $pred$ obs, positive = 'affirmatory') #Find threshold for PPV=0.7 coordinates But the problem there is no threshold the allows me to get a PPV =0.7; the lowest my PPV goes is 0.7417722 at threshold=Inf and the next lowest PPV is 0.7436548 at threshold= 0.7915000 . Below is my plot. Can someone explain to me conceptually what is going on? EDIT From user Calimo's explanation below, I determined that the issue is because of the way my code is interpreting positive and negative cases (should be positive=affirmatory and negative=negatory , or control), which is not what I'm seeing. myRoc Call: roc.default(response = rf_model $pred$ obs, predictor = rf_model $pred$ affirmatory) Data: rf_model $pred$ affirmatory in 102 controls (rf_model $pred$ obs affirmatory) > 293 cases (rf_model $pred$ obs negatory). Area under the curve: 0.9008 Saw that the pROC package actually allows you to set cases and controls. I had to modify myRoc: myRoc_new $pred$ affirmatory[rf_model $pred$ obs=="negatory"], cases=rf_model $pred$ affirmatory[rf_model $pred$ obs=="affirmatory"]) Now I can see that my model supports a PPV from 0.25-1 at various thresholds. However, the coordinates only provides me with near thresholds i.e. threshold= 0.4277500 gives PPV= 0.6981132 and threshold= 0.4312500 gives PPV= 0.7047619 . This is so close to PPV=0.7 but can I get the exact threshold?
