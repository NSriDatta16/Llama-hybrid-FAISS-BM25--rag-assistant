I had the exact same problem and the following solution worked perfectly without playing with the additional opacity attribute. It still requires IE to use filter but feels cleaner to me. background-color: rgba(244, 244, 244, 0.6); filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient(GradientType=0, StartColorStr='#7ff4f4f4', EndColorStr='#7ff4f4f4'); A great explanation for the IE filter gradient trick and benefits of not using opacity attribute on backgrounds can be found below http://robertnyman.com/2010/01/11/css-background-transparency-without-affecting-child-elements-through-rgba-and-filters/
