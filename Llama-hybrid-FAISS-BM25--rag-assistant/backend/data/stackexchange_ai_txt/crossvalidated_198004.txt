Do I add my dependent variable to PCA?

I am performing a PCA, and have a small handful of dependent variables and a large number of recorded independent variables. Do I perform the PCA on the independent variables and then correlate the dependent variables with the principal components or do I include ALL of the variables in the PCA?
