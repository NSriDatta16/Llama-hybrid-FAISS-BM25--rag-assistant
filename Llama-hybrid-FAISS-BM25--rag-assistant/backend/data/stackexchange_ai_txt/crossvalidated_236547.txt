First you must distinguish misunderstanding bias from statistical bias, especially for a lay person. The choice of say using median, mean or mode as your estimator for a population average , often contains a political, religious or science theory belief bias. The computation as to which estimator is the best form of average is of a different type to the arithmetic that affects statistical bias. Once you have got past the method selection bias, then you can address the potential biases in the estimation method. First you have to pick a method that can have a bias, and a mechanism that leads easily toward that bias. It can be easier to use a divide a conquer viewpoint where it becomes obvious as the sample size gets smaller, the estimate becomes clearly biased. For example the n-1 factor (vs 'n' factor) in sample spread estimators becomes obvious as n drops from 3 to 2 to 1 ! It all depends on how 'lay' the person is.
