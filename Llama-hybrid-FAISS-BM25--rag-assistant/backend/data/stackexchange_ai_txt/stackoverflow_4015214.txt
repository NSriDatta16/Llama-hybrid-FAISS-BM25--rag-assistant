ToBinary() and ToFileTimeUtc() do not return the same value. ToBinary provide a round-trip value, an Int64 that can preserve the properties of a DateTime. It uses the same time base, January 1st of the year 0. The value is always UTC. Bit 62 is set for the extreme corner case where a local time near the 1/1/00 would be negative when converted to UTC (paying attention to detail here :)). Bit 63 is set when the Kind is UTC. Convert the magic number to hex to see this. ToFileTimeUtc() uses the same time base as Windows' FILETIME, January 1st of the year 1601. The magic number is the number of ticks for 12am, 1/1/1601.
