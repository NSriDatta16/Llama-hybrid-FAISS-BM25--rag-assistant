With jQuery, you use $(document).ready() to execute something when the DOM is loaded and $(window).on("load", handler) to execute something when all other things are loaded as well, such as the images. The difference can be seen in the following complete HTML file, provided you have a lot of jollyrogerNN JPEG files (or other suitable ones): $(document).ready(function() { alert ("done"); }); Hello // : 100 copies of this in total With that, the alert box appears before the images are loaded, because the DOM is ready at that point. If you then change: $(document).ready(function() { into: $(window).on("load", function() { then the alert box doesn't appear until after the images are loaded. Hence, to wait until the entire page is ready, you could use something like: $(window).on("load", function() { // weave your magic here. });
