If possible I would suggest first using either PCA to find a small number of composite variables or EFA to identify some latent variables. Then run the MANOVA on those components/factors to see if the experiment had an effect. Otherwise, when you test for group differences you (software) must estimate all of the 19*20/2 covariance parameters among the DVs and subsequently your power will be very low.
