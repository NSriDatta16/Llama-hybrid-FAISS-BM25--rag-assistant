NS_INLINE and Xcode debugger

Single stepping through code that uses any of the NS_INLINE functions from NSGeometry.h causes the debugger to lose sync with the current instruction pointer, making debugging the routines very difficult. I've tried #undef NS_INLINE at the top of my implementation file, #define NS_INLINE in the precompiled header, looking for pragmas, compiler switches, etc., but no matter what, the functions always compile inline for my debug builds. FWIW - NSMakeRect, NS_MakeSize, etc. all compile inline. Question is, how do I get NS_INLINE to compile to nothing?
