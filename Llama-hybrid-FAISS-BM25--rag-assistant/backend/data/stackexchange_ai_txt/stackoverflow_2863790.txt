Implement notification for UIApplicationWillTerminateNotification (and probably UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification as well). That way your objects can save their state, and restore it when the application is relaunched. There are notifications for that, too, but you are more likely to want to read in the old state data when the objects receive their init calls. You should consider all the usual storage mechanisms for state - NSUserDefaults , plists, and CoreData. The choice is up to you.
