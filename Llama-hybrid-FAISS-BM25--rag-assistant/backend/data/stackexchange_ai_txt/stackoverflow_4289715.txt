How do I make an ActionEvent and a KeyEvent fire the same action?

I'm writing an applet and want to figure out how to make a button and a key event cover the same bit of code. For this question, I'll call this button fireButton . The code for the action event would of course look like this: public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { if (e.getSource() == fireButton) { //all the code that pressing button executes } } Now, I want pressing the 'enter' key to perform the same code that the action event handles, but I do not want to rewrite all the code again in a keyPressed method. To be specific, I'm writing a battleship program, and the 'Fire' button takes input from two textFields, handles exceptions, and passes the input as parameters to a method that fires at a particular square in the grid. Ideally, pressing the enter key would function the same way as if I had pressed the fire button. Is there a way to make a certain method call an actionPerformed method? If not, what would be an elegant solution to the problem?
