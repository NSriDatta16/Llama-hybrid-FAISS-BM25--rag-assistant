In most cases, we call a very strong predictor as "cheating variable". A toy example would be we want to predict a persons weight in lb, "accidentally" include a persons' weight in kg. Note that this toy example is over simplified, that we may think it is no one would have such mistake. However, in real world, it usually happens when we have high dimensional data without totally understand the data, i.e., we do not know we are cheating. Therefore, I would suggest you go back and look at if you are cheating in certain way, including some after fact features, say if you are "using customer service calls as variables to to predict if customer buy the product". If not, then the problem is trivial to solve. No machine learning needed. Just use that variable in production !
