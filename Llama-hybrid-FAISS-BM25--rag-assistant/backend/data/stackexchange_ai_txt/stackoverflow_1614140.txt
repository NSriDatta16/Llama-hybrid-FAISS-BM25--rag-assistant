What version of Oracle are you using? I ASSUME there is a primary key on table entries for field id, correct? Why the WHERE condition does not include "c.group = e.group" ? Try to: Remove the order by condition Change the index definition from "create unique index (group, category, id)" to "create unique index (id, group, category)" Reorganise table categories as an IOT on (group, category, id) Reorganise table categories as an IOT on (id, group, category) In each of the above case use EXPLAIN PLAN to review the cost
