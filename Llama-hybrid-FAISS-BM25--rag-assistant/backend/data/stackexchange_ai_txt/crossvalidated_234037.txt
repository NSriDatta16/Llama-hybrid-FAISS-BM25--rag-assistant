Writing PCA objective function in scalar and matrix forms

These posts explains the PCA objective in matrix form in very nice way: What is the objective function of PCA? PCA objective function: what is the connection between maximizing variance and minimizing error? But I am still confused about the scalar notation in the Introduction to Statistical Learning , page 376: $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$ I think $\frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}^2$ makes up the covariance matrix, but how are the $\phi_{j1}$ related to the "weights"? Could anyone help me to build the connection between these two notations?
