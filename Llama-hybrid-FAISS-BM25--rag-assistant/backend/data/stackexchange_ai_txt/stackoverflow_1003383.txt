The only 100% safe way to declare fonts is to use generics as fall backs. The generics are: 'serif' (e.g. Times) 'sans-serif' (e.g. Helvetica) 'cursive' (e.g. Zapf-Chancery) 'fantasy' (e.g. Western) (wtf?) 'monospace' (e.g. Courier) From the W3C All five generic font families are defined to exist in all CSS implementations (they need not necessarily map to five distinct actual fonts). User agents should provide reasonable default choices for the generic font families, which express the characteristics of each family as well as possible within the limits allowed by the underlying technology. Fonts such as Arial and Verdana which many web designers take for granted may not be present on Linux browsers (even firefox on centOS from experience). Apple has most of the Microsoft fonts but there are some which are absent.
