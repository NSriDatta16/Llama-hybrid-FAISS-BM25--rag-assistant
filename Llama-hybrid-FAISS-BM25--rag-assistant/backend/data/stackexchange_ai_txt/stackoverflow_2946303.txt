Status code can be semantic if you don't use plain numbers and replace them with some sort of constants. For example, when dealing with file uploads in PHP, you deal with explicit constants like UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE , UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE and so on. Of course it gets messy when you use plain numbers such as 1, 2, 3 because you don't know what they mean right away. But constants provide an elegant way for the status code to mean something.
