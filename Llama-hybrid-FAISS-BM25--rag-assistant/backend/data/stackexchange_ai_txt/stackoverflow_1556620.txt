The database log is not some after the fact history record, like an IIS log. In databases with Write-Ahead Logging the log is the primary restore, redo and undo source, and for all purposes the authoritative source of data. Deleting or replacing the log is one of the worst decisions somebody administering a database can do. Your database may be corrupted at this moment. The proper way to truncate the log is to do a full database backup, followed by a database log backup, followed by periodical log backups. This will free space in the log and allow for its reuse. It will not shrink the physical LDF file. Another avenue is to change the recovery model to SIMPLE , which will allow the server to automatically recycle the log file as it sees fit. Changing the recovery model to SIMPLE has implications on the recoverability of the database as you won't be able to apply certain disaster recovery scenarios like point in time recovery nor will you be able to recover any data changes since last backup.
