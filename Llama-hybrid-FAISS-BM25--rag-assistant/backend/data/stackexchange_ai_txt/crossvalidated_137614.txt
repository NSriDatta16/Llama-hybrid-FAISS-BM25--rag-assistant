There is a paper discussing the same problem: J. Borondo, F. Borondo, C. Rodriguez-Sickert & C. A. Hidalgo, To Each According to its Degree: The Meritocracy and Topocracy of Embedded Markets , Scientific Reports 4, 3784 (2014) From its abstract: [...] A system is topocratic if the compensation and power available to an individual is determined primarily by her position in a network. [...] individual compensation is based on the number of shortest paths that go through them in the network. [...] the distribution of payoffs is meritocratic only if the average degree of the nodes is larger than a root of the total number of nodes. So in short: the quantity you are asking is betweenness centrality (as Vincent have already mentioned ), you can exploit only some systems, where there are not many connections.
