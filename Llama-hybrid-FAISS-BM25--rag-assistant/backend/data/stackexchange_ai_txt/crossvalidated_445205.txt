Gaussian distribution in logistic regression

Suppose, we are doing logistic regression for datasets (X,y) and if we assume that x has gaussian distribution. What we try while finding y, is we try to maximize the log likelihood right? When we maximize the likelihood, we try to find the mean and std_dev that maximizes the probability of occurring given x. But since, we are assuming the dataset to be gaussian in the first place, we know that the mean and std_dev that gives maximum likelihood is nothing but the mean and std_dev of given dataset. Then, why not just take the mean of X, and std_dev of X and just calculate y. But instead we learn different parameters in weight and biases which does the same job? Please explain even if this seems to be a poor question or provide me any resource which clears my doubt.
