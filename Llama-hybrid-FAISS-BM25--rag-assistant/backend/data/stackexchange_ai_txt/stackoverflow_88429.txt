I've used SIFT to re-detect te same object in different images. It is really powerfull but rather complex, and might be overkill. If the images are supposed to be pretty similar some simple parameters based on the difference between the two images can tell you quite a bit. Some pointers: Normalize the images i.e. make the average brightness of both images the same by calculating the average brightness of both and scaling the brightest down according to the ration (to avoid clipping at the highest level)) especially if you're more interested in shape than in colour. Sum of colour difference over normalized image per channel. find edges in the images and measure the distance betwee edge pixels in both images. (for shape) Divide the images in a set of discrete regions and compare the average colour of each region. Threshold the images at one (or a set of) level(s) and count the number of pixels where the resulting black/white images differ.
