Columbia University's Statistics Dept made the academic year 2013-2014 a year of focus on measures of dependence. In April-May 2014, a workshop was held that brought together the top academics doing work in this field including the Reshef Brothers (MIC), Gabor Szekely (distance correlations), Subhadeep Mukhopadhay to name a few. The modal space analyzed was the RKHS or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, not euclidean. Here's a link to the program that includes many pdfs from the presentations. http://dependence2013.wikischolars.columbia.edu/Nonparametric+measures+of+dependence+workshop
