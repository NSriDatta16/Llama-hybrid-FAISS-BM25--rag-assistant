Shipments - editing custom value in dropdown box for carrier

OK my problem is that my client would like their shipping carrier 'Colissimo' to appear in the drop down box for Carrier when creating the Shipment document in Admin of magento. One of the values in the dropdown is Custom Value. Is there any way of editing this to 'Colissimo'?
