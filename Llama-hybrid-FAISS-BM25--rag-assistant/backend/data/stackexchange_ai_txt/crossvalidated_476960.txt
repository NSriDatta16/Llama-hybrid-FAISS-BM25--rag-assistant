Why skewness is not being corrected by BoxCox transformation

I have 2 variables which I want to put as predictor (independent) variables in logistic regression. However, both on them are highly skewed (one on left and other on right). Also, both variables are actually ordinal (values of 1,2,3 and 4). I am using following code to correct skewness with BoxCox transformation: import scipy df[feature] = scipy.stats.boxcox(df[feature])[0] Following figures show histograms of 2 variables before and after transformation: The skewness does not seem to have corrected very much. What are my options now? Can I safely use these variables in logistic regression to get reliable results or do I need to apply some other transformation? Is any particular method recommended for ordinal variables? Thanks for your insight.
