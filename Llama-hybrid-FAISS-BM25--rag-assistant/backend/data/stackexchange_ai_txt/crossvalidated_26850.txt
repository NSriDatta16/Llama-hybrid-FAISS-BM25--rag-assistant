I would highly discourage the use of any discontinuous improper scoring rule (an accuracy score such as sensitivity, specificity, proportion classified correct that when optimized results in a bogus model) and instead use likelihood ratio tests or partial F tests for added value of the new variables. One of several ways to see the problems with proportion classified correctly is that if the overall proportion in one category is 0.9 you will be correct 0.9 of the time by ignoring the data and classifying every observation as being in that category.
