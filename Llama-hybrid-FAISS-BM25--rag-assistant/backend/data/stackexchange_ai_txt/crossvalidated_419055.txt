Forecasting in a state-space model from a Bayesian perspective

We have the following state-space model(or linear dynamical model): \begin{align} x_t&\sim N(Ax_{t-1},Q)\\ y_t&\sim N(Bx_{t},\Sigma) \end{align} I want to obtain a sample from $p(y_{T+1}\mid y_{1:T})$ . $$p(y_{T+1}\mid y_{1:T})=\int p(y_{T+1}\mid y_{1:T},\theta,x_{T+1},x_{1:T})\cdot p(\theta,x_{T+1},x_{1:T}\mid y_{1:T}) \ dx_{T+1} \ dx_{1:T} \ d\theta$$ I think we have $$p(\theta,x_{T+1},x_{1:T}\mid y_{1:T})=p(x_{T+1}\mid x_{1:T}, \theta, y_{1:T})\cdot p(x_{1:T}, \theta \mid y_{1:T})$$ and $$p(y_{T+1}\mid y_{1:T},\theta,x_{T+1},x_{1:T})=N(y_{T+1}\mid Bx_{T+1},\Sigma)$$ Let us assume that we can draw from $p(x_{1:T}, \theta \mid y_{1:T})$ . I think we can draw from $p(x_{T+1}\mid x_{1:T}, \theta, y_{1:T})$ by $$x_{T+1}\sim N(A[i]x_{T}[i],Q[i])$$ with the quantities indexed by $i$ drawn from $p(x_{1:T}, \theta \mid y_{1:T})$ . So, I'm thinking of doing \begin{align} p(y_{T+1}\mid y_{1:T})&\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N N(y_{T+1}\mid B[i]x_{T+1}[i],\Sigma[i])\\ \end{align} and sample from this mixture of normals. Is this correct?
