AspNetSqlMembershipProvider and PasswordRecovery Control

My scenario is I have a asp.net 2.0 application web application which had the AspNetSqlMembershipProvider properties as: enablePasswordRetrieval="false" and passwordFormat="Hashed" But now the need has risen to store user's passwords unencrypted as clear text and display them to Superusers. I have done this by changing the AspNetSqlMembershipProvider properties to: enablePasswordRetrieval="true" and passwordFormat="Clear" The problem is the way the PasswordRecovery control behaves. From what I have read it checks the properties of the AspNetSqlMembershipProvider tag if enablePasswordRetrieval="true" and passwordFormat="Clear" it will attempt to retrieve the password this is causing a problem when the password is effectively still stored as a hashed one. Is there any way of forcing the PasswordRecovery control to reset not retrieve the password when AspNetSqlMembershipProvider properties are enablePasswordRetrieval="true" and passwordFormat="Clear"? Sorry for the long winded explanation, all help / pointers very much appreciated as always. Thank you.
