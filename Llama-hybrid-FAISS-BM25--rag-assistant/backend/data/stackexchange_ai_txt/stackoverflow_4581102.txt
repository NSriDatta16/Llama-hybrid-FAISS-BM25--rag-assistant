I learned WPF a few years ago after a number of years developing in Flex/Flash. The biggest hurdle for me was getting a handle on XAML and the way templating and "styling" works. 1. Approach with an open mind While there are styles in WPF and Sliverlight, they bear little resemblance to the CSS used in Flex or HTML. The biggest piece of advice I could give you is forget about how you THINK styling should work and approach with an open mind. 2. Download code examples Find yourself some code examples and tutorials and dive in! http://www.silverlight.net/learn/tutorials/silverlight-4/ is a good place to start. 3. Get Expression Blend Get expression Blend and dig into control templating. The GUI should be familiar to you. When you drag a control onto the canvas, you can right click and select "Edit Template". This will give you an idea of how controls are built, and how to use the various layout components (Grid, Border, Stackpanel), that are available.
