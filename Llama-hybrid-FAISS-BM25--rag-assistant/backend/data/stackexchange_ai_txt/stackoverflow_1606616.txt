You should try setting this property: img.userInteractionEnabled = YES; But this is not enough, because the methods: – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: are from the UIResponder class (the base class of UIVIew) and not the UIViewController. So if you want them to be called, you have to define a sub class of a UIView (or UIImageView in your case) where you override the base methods. Example: MyImageView.h : @interface MyImageView : UIImageView { } @end MyImageView.m : @implementation MyImageView - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)aRect { if (self = [super initWithFrame:rect]) { // We set it here directly for convenience // As by default for a UIImageView it is set to NO self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; } return self; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Do what you want here NSLog(@"touchesBegan!"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Do what you want here NSLog(@"touchesEnded!"); } @end Then you can instantiate a MyImageView in your example with the view controller: img = [[MyImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480)]; [self.view addSubview:img]; [img release]; And you should see the touch events (also assuming self.view has userInteractionEnabled set to YES of course).
