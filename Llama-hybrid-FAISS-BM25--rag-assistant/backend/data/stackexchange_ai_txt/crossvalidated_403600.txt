4 months later I cans say negativ rewards are very crucial. Without them both players seemed to play for them self. No sign of competition. But with negativ rewards for a lose, agents started competing. In the case of board games you have to store the two last played moves. This way you can reward the last move with a positiv reward (because the last move lead to a win). The second last move was the losing player's move which gets a negativ reward.
