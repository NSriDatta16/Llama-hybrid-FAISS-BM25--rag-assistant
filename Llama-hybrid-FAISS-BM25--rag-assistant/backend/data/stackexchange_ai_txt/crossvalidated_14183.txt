Finding correlation of discrete distribution data

I'm not good at Statistics but I need to use it to summarize my case study. So I consult with a person who're good at Statistics. He suggested that My data is discrete because all the values are integer and some are duplicated as shown below. I want to find correlation between x and y of the two data sets below. In data set 1, x and y are discrete. In data set 2, x is discrete but y is continuous. Data Set 1 x y -5 -19 -5 -21 -5 -23 -5 -23 -4 -17 -4 -17 -4 -18 -4 -19 -4 -19 -4 -23 -4 -19 -4 -18 -3 -13 -3 -20 -3 -17 -3 -15 -3 -17 -3 -18 -3 -18 -3 -18 -3 -18 -3 -18 -3 -18 -3 -15 -3 -15 -2 -15 -2 -15 -2 -14 -2 -14 -2 -11 -2 -12 -1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Data Set 2 1 287.92 1 340 1 219.62 1 30 1 30 1 292.56 -2 -70.32 -2 -82.04 -2 -68.53 -2 -68.53 -2 -51.89 -2 -57.36 -3 -94.01 -3 -66.61 -3 -95.91 -3 -95.91 -3 -95.91 -3 -95.91 -3 -95.91 -3 -95.91 -3 -78.14 -3 -125.34 -3 -78.14 -4 -110.45 -4 -94.01 -4 -94.01 -4 -162.85 -4 -162.85 -4 -162.85 -4 -120.93 -5 -307.67 -5 -123.19 -5 -371.38 -5 -166.91 -5 -162.85 -5 -302.21 -5 -176.42 -5 -307.67 -5 -371.38 -6 -390.71 -6 -387.74 so he suggested me to find covariance and then find the correlation from covariance question 1 : Should I use sample covariance or population covariance Its difference is that in sample covariance, the average of X and Y in the sample are used; whereas in population covariance, ux and uy are used. question 2 : some books mentioned the equation of population covariance that pop_cov = sigma(xi-ux)(yi-uy) / N others said pop_cov = sigma(xi-ux)(yi-uy) = sigma(XY)- (uxuy) Which one is correct? question 3 : if the answer of question 1 is population covariance, how can I get the probability of occuring each value of X (p(x)), each value of Y(p(y)), and occuring a particular X and Y (p(x,y)). Can I calculate these 3 probabilities from the sample I have, for example p(5) is 4/39 (4 is a number of 5 and 39 is total number of X). question 4 : the formula of correlation need standard deviation (corr = covariance/(sdx sdy)), will we use standard deviation of population or sample ( is it depending on the type of covariance we use, of pop or sample)? Thank you very much. I 'm sorry that I am so novice about Statictiscs
