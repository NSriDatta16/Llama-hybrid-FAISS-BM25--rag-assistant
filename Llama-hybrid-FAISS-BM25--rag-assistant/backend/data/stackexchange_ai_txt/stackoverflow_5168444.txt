Resizing a button with higher values of Height and Width is less smooth than with lower values in WPF

I have a button which Max and Min height X width are 1024X1360 and 72X95 pixels. I am resizing this button by handling DragDelta events of Thumbs present in button's Template. The problem is the updation of height and width at lower levels, i.e upto 210X280, gives out a smooth operation which is not the case with greater sizes. Anybody out here has faced the issue? Any suggestion to improve the user experience in this situation.
