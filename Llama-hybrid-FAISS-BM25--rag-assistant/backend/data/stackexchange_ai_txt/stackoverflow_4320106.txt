@gnarf was correct in the first paragraph: Make sure that all the folders above (most likely /Users/mysuser) have permissions for any to read/execute. The execute bit when set for a directory, grants the ability to traverse its tree in order to access files or subdirectories. Specifically, the way to fix this problem is to go to Terminal, cd to the proper directory where those files are located and type: sudo chmod 0755 mysite You might want to do the same to the files inside the directory if for some reason it still doesn't work. And as a last resort, just to test that permissions aren't the issue any longer, try to chmod them to 0777 (temporarily, as this is a security hole if you leave it).
