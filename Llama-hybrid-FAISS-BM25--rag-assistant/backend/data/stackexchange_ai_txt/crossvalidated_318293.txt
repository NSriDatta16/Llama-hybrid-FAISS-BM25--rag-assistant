Which features to include for Truncated SVD?

I have a dataset of ~31000 8k-filings (ad-hoc announcements from companies listed on the stock exchange). Every document consists of a string (the actual filing, stemmed and stopwords removed) and a few metadata-features i constructed, i.e. readability measures, number of words, number of adjectives per word and a list of organisations mentioned in the document. Along with market excess returns as dependent variable, I want to feed all the data as features to XGBoost. For feature reduction, I first used TfidfVectorizers arguments min_df=5 and max_df to reduce bag-of-word features from 103000 down to 16000. Now I want to perform Truncated SVD for further feature reduction on this data. Scikitlearn's handbook suggests choosing k=100 for LSA. But I was asking myself if it would be better to only perform SVD only on the tfidf-bag-of-words and then add the metafeatures to the output or first add metafeatures and then perform SVD on all of the features? Is there a 'right' way to do this?
