Sort listbox by dragging items: Xaml Fluidlayout or codebehind?

I'm looking into ways of resorting a listbox by dragging the items in it to a different place in the list. I've looked into the new fluidlayout technology and though it looks very useful, there is also very little documentation. Has anybody got experiences with this, and also: can the sorting by dragging the items be achieved by mostly xaml/Blend only or code behind? I've seen Bea Stollnitz article on this but I'm trying to find more alternatives.
