When I deploy new versions of whatever web application I am work on, I never deploy the configuration file. I always make this a manual step, it ensures that no critical changes are made accidentally. You also have the option of splitting your configuration files into small configuration files, e.g., you could fragment your appSettings and connectionStrings into seperate files: Just manage your deployment with these files in mind.
