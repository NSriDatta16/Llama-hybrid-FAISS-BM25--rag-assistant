I would say no, you do not have to commit to specific priors. Generally during any Bayesian data analysis you should perform an analysis of the sensitivity of the model to the prior. That would include trying various other priors to see what happens to the results. This might reveal a better or more robust prior that should be used. The two obvious "no-no's" are: playing around with the prior too much to get a better fit, resulting in over fit and changing the other parameters of the model to get a better fit. As an example of the first: changing an initial prior on the mean so that it is closer to the sample mean. For the second: changing your explanatory variables/ features in a regression to get a better fit. This is a problem in any version of regression and basically invalidates your degrees of freedom.
