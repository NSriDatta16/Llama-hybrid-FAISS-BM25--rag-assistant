Machine Learning on Time Series Data - Cross Validation

I am new to Machine Learning in Time Series and want to build a machine learning model to forecast monthly returns. I have over 200 features to build my model, here's the shape of my data: First, I've tried cross_val_score with Time_Series_Split() : index_output = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits = 10) rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 400, random_state = 1234) scores = cross_val_score(rf, X_train, y_train, cv=index_output) Then I tried RandomizedSearchCV() : index_output = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits = 10) rf = RandomForestRegressor() model = RandomizedSearchCV( estimator = rf, param_distributions = random_grid, n_iter = 10, n_jobs = -1, cv = index_output, verbose=5, random_state = 42, return_train_score = True) model.fit(X_train.drop('Date', axis=1),y_train) model.cv_results_ Both of my approaches did not work, but I haven't seen a simple example of Time_series_Split() yet. How do I need to change my approaches to build my model using Time Series Split? Especially the randomized search? Error in my first approach is: C:\Users\User\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\sklearn\model_selection_validation.py:536: FitFailedWarning: Estimator fit failed. The score on this train-test partition for these parameters will be set to nan. Details: TypeError: invalid type promotion FitFailedWarning)
