Disallow UIScrollView from catching subviews touches

I've got a UIScrollView covered with a custom UIView which desperatly needs to listen to all the touch events that happen inside of him. At first, all I was getting was touchesBegan: and touchesCancelled: events. No touchesMoved: , no touchesEnded: . In fact, all the dragging gestures where being canceled by the above UIScrollView . This was solved by the following setting: _scrollView.canCancelContentTouches = NO; Now, the behaviour changes depending on the "length in time" of the first touch on the UIView. If it's short, then the relative dragging is managed as it was a scroll for the UIScrollView . If it's long, then I'm getting the touchesMoved: events inside my UIView. What I want is to always receive touchesMoved: inside my UIView. How can I make it?
