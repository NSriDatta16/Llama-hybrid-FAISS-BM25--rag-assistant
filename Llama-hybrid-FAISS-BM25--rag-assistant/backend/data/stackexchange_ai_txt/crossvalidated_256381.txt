One important clarification about this question. You certainly can do a meta-analysis in the Bayesian settings. But simply using a Bayesian perspective does not allow you to forget about all the things you should be concerned about in a meta-analysis! Most directly to the point is that good methods for meta-analyses acknowledge that the underlying effects are not necessarily uniform study to study. For example, if you want to combine the mean from two different studies, it is helpful to think about the means as $\mu_1 = \mu + \alpha_1$ $\mu_2 = \mu + \alpha_2$ $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = 0$ where $\mu_1$ is the population mean from study 1, $\mu_2$ is the population mean from study 2, $\mu$ is the global mean of interest, and $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the deviation from the global mean in each study. Of course, you hope that $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are very small in magnitude, but assuming 0 is a bit foolish. This model can easily be fit in a Bayesian framework, just as it could be fit in a frequentist framework. My only point is that in the OP's question, it could be read as using the naive model of assuming $\alpha = 0$ is okay if you are in the Bayesian setting, which is still naive but with a naive prior as well. So in conclusion, no, Bayesian methods do not make the field of meta-analysis obsolete. Rather, Bayesian methods work nicely hand-in-hand with meta-analyses.
