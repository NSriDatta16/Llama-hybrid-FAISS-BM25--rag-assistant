Plot a graph with individual years from specific package?

So I have package wq ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wq/vignettes/wq-package.html ) and it has a section to graph decomposed time series: chl27 Is it possible to get the years as increment of one rather that in 5 years batch? My data has less years, so seeing the exact year would help.
