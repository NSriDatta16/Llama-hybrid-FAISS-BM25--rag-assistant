Oh please, keep them english. Im a non-native english speaker from germany, and I always start to giggle when I come across german texts with technical terms translated to german. My personal favorite is the german translation for stack: Stack translates to Keller Datenspeicher. Translating this back to english gives something like Basement data storage. (Uh - where's the stack, and what has that to do with basement?) No young programmer here understands the german anachronisms anymore. Stackoverflow translates to Keller Datenspeicher Ãœberlauf btw. (Basement data storage overflow)
