What value is conditional logistic regression if two cohorts are already matched on everything of interest?

My situation is this: I am comparing two cohorts I have matched the two cohorts on all of the factors that I am interested in The two cohorts are already balanced on all of the factors that I would include in a regression Questions: Is it appropriate to just report the univariate results? Would conditional logistic regression add anything to/change the results?
