Real-life example in which Markov chain Monte Carlo is desirable?

A typical introduction to the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm, and hence to Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in general, starts with the following assumptions on some probability distribution $P(x)$ which we'd like to sample from. We are perfectly able to evaluate $P(x)$ , or perhaps more accurately some multiple $C \cdot P(x)$ for some fixed $C$ , though I don't quite see why you wouldn't just normalise and put $C = 1$ . However, it is very hard to sample from $P(x)$ ; so hard, that we'd rather sample from some other distribution thousands of times for the sake of getting a sample of $P(x)$ via Markov chain methods. I'd like to see an actual, real-life example in which such a scenario comes up. How can it be easy to evaluate $P(x)$ but hard to sample from it? I'd be interested in seeing a real-life situation involving say weather, diseases, neurons, air flow, whatever it is, that leads to a situation in which MCMC methods are a natural thing to ask for.
