Mouse coordinates and rotation

How would you go about mapping mouse coordinates to world coordinates in a 2d context? For example, you have an image which you can drag. Next, you apply a rotation to that image and redraw it. Now when you drag the image it does not get translated correctly. For example after rotating 90 degrees, dragging up would cause the image to translate to the right. Any ideas? Currently attempting to rotate the mouse coordinates like so: mouseX = ((mouseX*Math.cos(rotation*180/Math.PI))-(mouseY*Math.sin(rotation*180/Math.PI))), mouseY = ((mouseX*Math.sin(rotation*180/Math.PI))+(mouseY*Math.cos(rotation*180/Math.PI))) But this doesn't seem to be working...
