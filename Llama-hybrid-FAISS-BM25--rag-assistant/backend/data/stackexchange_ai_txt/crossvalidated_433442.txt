The inter-cluster variance is more likely proportional to k-1, on uniform random data , i.e., when k-means does not give useful results. Pay attention to the result quality - arguing about bad results is quite useless, isn't it? Selecting a subset of k-means based on this measure is a pretty ignorant idea, as you then would need to reassign the unassigned points to other clusters again; and that result will be much worse than running k-means with a smaller k. Inter-cluster variance of k-means is interesting because the total variance is the sum of intra-cluster and inter-cluster variance. But if you remove some cluster centers, the intra-cluster variance grows a lot. It's roughly proportional to k-1, because k=1 has 0 inter-cluster variance, you roughly split the data k-1 times when creating k clusters. All these arguments require uniform data though. That is a key idea of the VRC measure that can be used as heuristic to choose k: if the variance changes proportionally to k-1, then the results are as bad as random; but a change that is much better than this suggests a good value of k.
