Ruby: Split string at character, counting from the right side

Short version -- How do I do Python rsplit() in ruby? Longer version -- If I want to split a string into two parts (name, suffix) at the first '.' character, this does the job nicely: name, suffix = name.split('.', 2) But if I want to split at the last (rightmost) '.' character, I haven't been able to come up with anything more elegant than this: idx = name.rindex('.') name, suffix = name[0..idx-1], name[idx+1..-1] if idx Note that the original name string may not have a dot at all, in which case name should be untouched and suffix should be nil; it may also have more than one dot, in which case only the bit after the final one should be the suffix.
