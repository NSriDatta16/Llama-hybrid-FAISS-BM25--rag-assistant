How to handle zeros in target variable

I'm working on a college assignment in introductory statistics to try to predict a certain target variable. The variable is continuous but has a high percentage (60%) with zero values. This is not bad data but the actual output. What simple approach can I take here to model as linear regression does not seem appropriate. All the values are positive. We have been through the main models in class, ANOVA, Linear and Logistic, Poisson etc. The task states a model of your choice and what factors affect the tax amount captured. I ran a logistic regression on new variable created YIELDYN and then ran a linear regression on the non-zero values. I'm hoping this is sufficient given there is nothing else we have done to date that I could see as been applicable. Below is the raw scatter plot matrix
