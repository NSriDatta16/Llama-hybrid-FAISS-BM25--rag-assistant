\r is a Carriage Return \n is a Line Feed (or new line ). On Windows systems these together make a newline (i.e. every time you press the enter button your fix will get a \r\n ). In PHP if you open a Windows style text file you will get \r\n at the end of paragraphs / lines were you've hit enter. If it was a Unix style text file you'd only get a \n .
