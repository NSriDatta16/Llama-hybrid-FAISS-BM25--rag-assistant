COBOL is a niche. A nice, comfortable, profitable niche. That probably (sooner or later) will become nonexistent, but right now it is still there. Right here, several major banking organizations have their core systems developed in COBOL. This is not only maintenance, but also development! It has been around for 50 years or so. Every 10 years someone announcing it dead, but it still hangs on.
