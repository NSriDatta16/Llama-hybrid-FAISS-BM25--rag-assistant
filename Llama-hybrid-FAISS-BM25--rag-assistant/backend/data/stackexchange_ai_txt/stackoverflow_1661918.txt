Option A - you do not want to be pulling the whole repository down (all the tags and branches) every time and it will encourage your users to think of the whole repository as a single entity which it isn't really - you want them thinking in terms of solutions and of tagging/branching in that context. You address shared projects by referencing them as externals in the "root" of the appropriate solutions. This will mean that you may have the same project appear multiple times on your HDD but that's manageable.
