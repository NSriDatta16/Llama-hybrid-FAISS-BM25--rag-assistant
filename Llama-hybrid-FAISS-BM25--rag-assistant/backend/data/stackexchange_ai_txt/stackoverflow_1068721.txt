I think you have to be rigorous in your unit testing. At the moment you're worried about one particular issue, but good unit tests will capture most issues (ignoring threading/loading etc.). You have to decompose your classes/methods such that you can test each chunk of functionality and ensure complete (or as near as you can) coverage. Clover (commercial) or Emma (open source) will manage code coverage for you.
