I explored this topic in the following manuscript: Baird, S.; Hall, J. R.; Sparks, T. D. Effect of Reducible and Irreducible Search Space Representations on Adaptive Design Efficiency: A Case Study on Maximizing Packing Fraction for Solid Rocket Fuel Propellant Simulations; preprint; Chemistry, 2022. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-nz2w8 . Interestingly, we found that the most compact search space is not necessarily the most efficient, which is related to the interactions of the size-invariance degeneracy (case 3. in OP question) with other constraints. The most efficient search space had the compositional (case 2. above) and order constraint (case 1.). On average, the least efficient search space wasn't the least compact. It was one that had both the size reparameterization and the order reparameterization. It was surprising that when treated individually, the size and order reparameterizations did better than the combination of size + order. The results are summarized in Figure 2:
