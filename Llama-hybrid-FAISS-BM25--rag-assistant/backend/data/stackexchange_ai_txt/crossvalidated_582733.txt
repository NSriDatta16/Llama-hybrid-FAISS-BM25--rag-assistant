Are CI and hypothesis tests purely frequentist tools?

I've been learning statistics for a long time but I still struggle to understand the "philosophical" differences between frequentist and bayesian statistics. One of my questions is the following: Are confidence intervals and hypothesis tests purely frequentist devices? (Since their motivation is to bound our search for the "true" population parameters). P.S.: This question was associated with a different one before, but the other question does not answer my question.
