R test a regression with only statistically significant variables

I'm performing a multiple logistic regression with a large amount of columns. I want to set all the variables over a certain p value to have 0 coefficients, then test the model on the test data. Since there's so many variables I'm using, it's impractical to manually go in and set the coefficients. So I'm looking for something like the following. log_results This way I can use the results with the predict() function, and export the results easily for use in another program. Additionally, if anyone knows a way to automatically extract the significant variables and refit with them, I would appreciate that too.
