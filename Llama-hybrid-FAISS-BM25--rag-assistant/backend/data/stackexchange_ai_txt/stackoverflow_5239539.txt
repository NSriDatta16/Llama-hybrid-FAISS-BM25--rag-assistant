How to extract blocks of text from a HTML page?

I would like to extract blocks of texts with more than 100 words from a large HTML page using PHP. Whether the text is contained in ... doesn't matter. I only care about the number of words that makes a coherent text block so texts outside of HTML paragraphs should also be taken into consideration. How can this be done?
