In my experience with drag/drop in Flex, you cannot simply drag something out and handle that. There is no dragOut event (unfortunately), so that would leave you up to the task of writing dragOver and dragDrop listeners on all the containers surrounding your dragInitiator and handling the process accordingly. It's more time consuming and can become complicated if any of these controls already have specific dragOver and dragDrop event handlers. Hope this helps.
