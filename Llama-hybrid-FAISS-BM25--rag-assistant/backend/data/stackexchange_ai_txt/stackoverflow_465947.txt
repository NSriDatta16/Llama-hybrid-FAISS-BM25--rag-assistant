Drag n' Drop Controls - Evil?

I can't stand drag n' drop controls for things like threads and timers. These controls just feel too far removed from the actual essence of their being. Drag n' drop a thread? I hope the drag n' dropper understands what's going on under the covers before they do so. Are these abstractions too far removed from the metal? Are they helping or hurting programmers?
