It's because you aren't instantiating an ExtendedCustomControl, you are instantiating a CustomControl. Activator.CreateObject is just creating the base class. You can't upcast something unless it actually IS of the class you're casting to. Maybe you want CreateCustomControl() to take a System.Type and then pass it into Activator.CreateInstance instead? That way you might be able to make what you want?
