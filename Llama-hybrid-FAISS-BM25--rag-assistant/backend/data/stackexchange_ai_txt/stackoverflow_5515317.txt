Merge word documents, reset any numbered / lettered lists

I have a desktop app that does work on a Word 2003 template then merges all the created documents into one file. The app is working, except for the merging. The merge does not reset any numbered / lettered lists. I've tried a lot of different things including: selection.Range.ListParagraphs[i].Range.ListFormat.ApplyListTemplate(selection.Range.ListParagraphs[i].Range.ListFormat.ListTemplate, ref continuePrevious, ref missing, ref missing); and even trying to merge each document as a Subdocument document.Application.Selection.EndKey(ref unit, ref missing); document.Application.Selection.Range.Subdocuments.AddFromFile(ref file, ref missing, ref readOnly, ref missing, ref missing, ref missing, ref missing, ref missing);
