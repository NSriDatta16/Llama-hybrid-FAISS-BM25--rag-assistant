There's one elegant solution I did for Watir 1.6.7 in Windows. I went to ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/watir-1.6.7/lib/watir/element.rb (your path may change, but the main idea is to access the watir library and modify the element.rb file). I added these lines: def fire_event_no_wait(event) assert_exists assert_enabled highlight(:set) element = "#{self.class}.new(#{@page_container.attach_command}, :unique_number, # {self.unique_number})" ruby_code = "require 'rubygems';" this will create a method called fire_event_no_wait that behaves just like click_no_wait in watir. Hope this helps anyone out.
