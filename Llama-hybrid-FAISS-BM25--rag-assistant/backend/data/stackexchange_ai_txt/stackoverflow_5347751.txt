The weirdest thing was happening... I was accessing a property of AppState in my RootViewController , and the order of app execution was the culprit. RootViewController is loaded in my MainWindow.xib file, and apparently the XIB loading/shenanegans happens BEFORE anything inside applicationDidFinishLaunching so loadState was being called late in the game. The solution was to move [AppState loadState] to my RootViewController 's init method.
