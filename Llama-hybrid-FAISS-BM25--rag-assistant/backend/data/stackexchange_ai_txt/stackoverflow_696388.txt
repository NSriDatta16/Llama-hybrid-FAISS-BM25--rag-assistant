I also tried hydrating 2 strings and strangley it doesn't blow the performance out nearly as much as 1 string? The following only takes an average of 57ms to hydrate 1 object How are you measuring the time? Maybe there's an additional assembly loading involved and your 53 ms takes that into account. You should start measuring the time only after the first loop (first hydration). This way any assembly loading will be done before the measurement.
