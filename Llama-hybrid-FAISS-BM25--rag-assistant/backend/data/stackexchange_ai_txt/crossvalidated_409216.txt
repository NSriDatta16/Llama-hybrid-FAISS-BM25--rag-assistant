Highly significant t-test statistics, any way to correct this?

I have been performing several paired t-test, where I test whether the sample means are different between two groups. For all of my tests (approx. 30), which all carries 13-14,000 observations, I get a p-value with a significance of 1%. I was wondering if there was any reason to this? I know that as n increases, the t-statistic increases monotonically (due to n being the root). The t-test is: I was wondering if this isn't a potential issue, for my study? I have read somewhere that some people adjusts the p-value through a Minimum Bayesian Factor (MFB). I have tried finding an explain like I'm 5 to understand the basics, but have not been able to. Maybe there are other methods?
