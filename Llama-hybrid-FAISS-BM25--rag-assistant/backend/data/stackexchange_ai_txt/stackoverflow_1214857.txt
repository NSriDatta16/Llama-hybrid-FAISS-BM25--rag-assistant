Since you want to access this before the filesystem loads, my first thought is to allocate and use a block of storage space on the hard drive outside of the filesystem. You can create a hidden mini-partition on the drive and use low-level I/O commands to read and write your data. This is a common task in the world of embedded systems, and we often implement it by adding some sort of non-volatile memory device into the system (flash, battery-backed DRAM, etc) and reading and writing to that device. Since you likely don't have the same level of control over the available hardware as embedded developers do, the closest analogue I can think of would be to reserve a chunk of space on a physical disk that you can read from without having to mount as a filesystem. A dedicated mini-partition might work the best because if you know the size of it, you can treat it as one big raw-access buffer and can avoid having to hassle with filenames, filesystems, etc.
