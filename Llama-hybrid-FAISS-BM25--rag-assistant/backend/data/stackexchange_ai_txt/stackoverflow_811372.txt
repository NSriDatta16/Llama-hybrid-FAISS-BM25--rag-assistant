You need to specify what operations you need to be fast on the vector, otherwise it is impossible to design a proper solution. Will you need mostly random access, or mostly sequential? What performance is acceptable for random access? To illustrate my point: one way to store your data is to simply compress them using LZMA or other good compression library. Then when you need to access some element, you decompress, discarding decompress data as soon as decompression no longer needs them. Such storage will be very space efficient, sequential access will be reasonable fast, but random access time will be very bad.
