Random effects--mixed model

I have 2 study sites containing data from a species of wildlife. I am trying to evaluate resource selection use a use vs. availability analysis where used animal locations = 1 and random locations = 0. I used the following R code to address my question of interest: results I accounted for variation in unequal sample sizes for animals (i.e., number of telemetry locations/individual) by using (1|ID) but I also wanted to account for variability in habitat selection across study sites using (1|Site) . I've always heard that you can specify study site as a random effect (and is typically encouraged by reviewers); however, I recently heard that I should include study site as a fixed effect to get the same inference as (1|ID) (i.e., adjusting for the effect of unequal sample sizes among sites on the marginal fixed effect estimate). The concern is that I have 73 individuals for (1|ID) but only 2 sites for (1|Site) . What are some thoughts on this?
