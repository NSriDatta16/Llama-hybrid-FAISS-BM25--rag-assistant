I would go the vector way using complex numbers. My example is in Python, which has built-in complex numbers: import cmath # complex math def average_angle(list_of_angles): # make a new list of vectors vectors= [cmath.rect(1, angle) # length 1 for each vector for angle in list_of_angles] vector_sum= sum(vectors) # no need to average, we don't care for the modulus return cmath.phase(vector_sum) Note that Python does not need to build a temporary new list of vectors, all of the above can be done in one step; I just chose this way to approximate pseudo-code applicable to other languages too.
