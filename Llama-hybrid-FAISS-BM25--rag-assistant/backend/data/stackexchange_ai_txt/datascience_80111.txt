If I understand your question correctly then yes, neural networks are exceptional in spotting patterns in data (even unstructured like images) and output the correct label Or is it better to work in this case with more than one output class and map these recognized output classes afterwards to the same class manually I am not sure I understand what you mean by this but essentially the output layer of your neural network should have just as many neurons as you have possible outputs when it comes to classification (except for binary classification where only one neuron is enough).
