Most elegant way to sync managed objects with controls on iPhone?

I'm trying to port an iPhone application from using SQLite to Core Data. Is there a way to sync managed objects directly with the controls that manipulate their values, without having a controller in the middle? Note: I CAN do it the hard way -- it's what I'm doing now; I'm looking for the elegant, easy, fast way. I'm paging through the documentation and I'm just starting to feel overwhelmed. The documentation on Bindings seems to be Mac OS X only, not iPhone. Is what I describe even possible on the iPhone? Thanks.
