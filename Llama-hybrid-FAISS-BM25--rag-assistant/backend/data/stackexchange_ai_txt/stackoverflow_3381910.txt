Cocoa touch connection and data design pattern

My question is a design issue and it has been driving crazy over the last couple of days. I am new to cocoa touch development. I have an application that has a UINavigarion controller and a 3 views. I need to keep communicate with a WCF service and store the data on the app side. How do I create my Model (MVC) in a way that makes the data available to all controllers? What I started doing is a singleton that handles all the storage and web calls but I read thru the threads that it is a bad idea. I also considered putting the code in the appDelegate but people say that is a bad idea too. Conceptually how would u design your model and communicate with the controllers? Any help is much appreciated.
