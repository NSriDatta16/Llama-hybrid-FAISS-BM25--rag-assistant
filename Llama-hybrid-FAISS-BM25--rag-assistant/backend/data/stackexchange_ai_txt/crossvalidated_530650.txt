ANOVA for four groups where individuals appear in each group

I would like to calculate an ANOVA between four groups. Each group has 82 elements, i.e. for each group I have a vector of size 82. The groups describe the average typing speed on the left side of the keyboard, right side of the keyboard, from left to right and from right to left. Each individual has one value for each group. For example, group1 = [w1, w2, w3,..., wn] group2 = [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn] group3 = [y1, y2, y3, ..., yn] group4 = [z1, z2, z3, ..., zn] n is 82. w1, x1, y1 and z1 is the typing speed on the left, right, left to right and right to left for person 1. w2, x2, y2, z2 is the typing speed for person 2 etc. Is it valid to use ANOVA here because a person appears in every group?
