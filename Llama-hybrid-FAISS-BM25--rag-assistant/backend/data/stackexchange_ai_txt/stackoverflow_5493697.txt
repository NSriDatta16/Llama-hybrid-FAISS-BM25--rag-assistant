Which VMware API should I use?

I'm trying to write a fairly simple application in C# (or at least, I think it should be simple) that polls a vCenter for all of its ESX servers, then each ESX server for all of its VMs. It will collect some simple, real-time statistics and plop 'em into a database. Easy peasy, right? Hmm. I'm stuck trying to figure out which VMware API I should use and I'm getting more confused the more I browse VMware's terribly organized documentation site. I've read through about 60 pages of the vSphere Web Services SDK Programmin Guide and still have no idea how to get data (but I've learned a ton about VMware's alphabet soup... yippie). My question is thus: Which VMware API should I use for a read-only application focused around gathering CPU, memory, network, and harddrive statistics? I need to gather this data from a typical vCenter + multiple-ESX setup. Edit: I forgot to mention that I've successfully wrote a PowerCLI script to do what I've explained, but its just too slow and unstable for a production-ready product (and PowerShell is, imo, a poorly designed scripting language). I do have the VMware vSphere SDK for .NET , but the provided documentation is... brief to say the least. Am I missing the real vSphere SDK for .NET docs?
