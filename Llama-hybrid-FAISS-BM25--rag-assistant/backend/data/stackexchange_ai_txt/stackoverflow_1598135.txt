Trouble with Ajax (creating a dynamically

I'm new to Ajax, and Im just loving it. Really nice. but i stucked in this thing, so whats the problem? I have a js function that allows the user to Register a new product dynamically.. So when he is in the product area, theres a button that when clicked, just creates a FORM, where he can add a new product. By now, im doing well, but, i got this field CITY. So, I need no generate a with all the cities I have on my mySql table. The first thing Im doing is accessing the database and geting the quantity of cities, I think Im making this confuse so... cities = document.createElement('select'); cities.setAttribute('class','coolButton'); Cities = new Array(); ajax = new Ajax(); ajax.doGet('pegacidade.php?act=1',GiveCitiesQty); This works just fine, I get the quantity of cities. GiveCitiesQty = function (str) { ajax.doGet('pegacidade.php?act=2&id='+j,PegaNomeCidade); //Cities[i] = document.createElement('option'); //Cities[i].setAttribute('value',i); //Cities[i].appendChild(document.createTextNode((2009+i).toString())); //cities.appendChild(Cidades[i]); } This is where I stucked, i dont know how to create this dynamically. Any sugestions? (for now im trying not to use any toolkit, for the real learning) Thanks, Jamfi.
