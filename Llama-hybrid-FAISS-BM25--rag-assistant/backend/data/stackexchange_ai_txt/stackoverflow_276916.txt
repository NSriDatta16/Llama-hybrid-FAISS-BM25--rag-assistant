Click Once - All Users

How to I configure click-once to install apps for all users. On another forum I got to 'use MSI' - thanks - but how. Also, the first installing user may not be admin - which may be a problem. And I want all users to trigger an update check. No local storage, it's a WPF client to a WCF service. We're XP, internal.
