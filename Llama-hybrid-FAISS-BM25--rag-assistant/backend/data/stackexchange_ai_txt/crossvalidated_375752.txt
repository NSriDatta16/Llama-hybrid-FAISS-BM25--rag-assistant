@CraigMilligan. Shouldn't: the weight be outside of the squared parenthesis the weighted mean be calculated as sum(x $w*observed)/sum(x$ w) for which we can also use weighted.mean(observed,x$w) Something like this: r2ww $w*(x$ resid)^2) observed $resid+x$ fitted SSt $w*(observed-weighted.mean(observed,x$ w))^2) value
