How to create multiple levels with Cocos2d

I'm creating a simple puzzle game that uses Cocos2d and Box2d but I'm struggling to find any documentation on how to organise levels. The game is similar to Cut the Rope in structure, it has multiple fixed size levels with changing Box2d assets. Currently my mainGame.m file contains my HUD and methods for creating obstacles. Would the best answer be to call some sort of .plist file for each level that lists the assets to be created, and their respective position, then use a for loop to reference the method in the mainGame.m file? Or could I create a level class on a seperate xxxxxx.m file that references the methods in my mainGame.m? I apologise if this is vague/hard to understand, I'm very confused at the moment and not sure how to move forward :/
