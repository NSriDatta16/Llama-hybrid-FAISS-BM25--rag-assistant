I do not recommend accessing the S3 API (or the Azure Storage API) direct from your phone. If you try this, then you will need to either have public PUT permissions or you will have your private storage access keys in plain view in the XAP file - it will be easy for a hacker to steal these and you will soon be paying to host PimpMyBreasts, WikiL33ked and SpamThis. Instead, you should host your own storage service where you can at least put some security checks in about what is being uploaded. If you do insist on using S3 directly, then this article covers S3 from C# including PutObject requests - http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/s3_ec2studio.aspx Good luck Stuart
