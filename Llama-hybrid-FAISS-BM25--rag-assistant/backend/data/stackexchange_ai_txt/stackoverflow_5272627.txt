Socket Hooking / Intercepting / Injecting (Windows)

I think the title is enough for understanding what I need. What I want to get is a piece of code that injects 1 packet into another software socket. My research on this turned some ways to accomplish this I found something about LibPCap, but I don't know if this is able to inject packets too. I know it capture packets. Another way was to use Hook API (inject some DLL's) ... but I didn't understand this, so I haven't managed to use it. Port forwarding was another way None of this was successful for me because I wasn't focused on any of this one. I want to know witch one is the easiest way to implement and I'll be happy to hear your ideas on doing this. BEFORE POSTING: I'LL USE THIS JUST TO CHECK OUT SOMETHING ON MY PROJECT. I WON'T USE THIS TO HARM OR HACK.
