Consider using a mix of Access and Excel. View your Access table in datasheet view. Select all rows Paste into Excel Insert a new column before Column A. Build your INSERT statement in this cell. Insert a comma between each column (insert new column) and single quotes as needed Insert an end parenthesis Drag the INSERT statement, commas, and end parentheses downward, copying their values for each row in your table. ensure you set SET IDENTITY_INSERT MyTable ON before executing that script.
