Strictly to your dilemma: In your case, even if "Food" and "Facility" may, at a glance, vary together, that doesn't mean automatically that they are "correlated" in the proper sense to dismiss one and it's legitimate to investigate which one is a better predictor for, i.e., a nice place to spend the vacation, regressing on both. It can be a 5 stars place with nice rooms, but lousy food. However, you should dismiss from start variables which describe the same thing in different ways or levels of detail (i.e. food - breakfast - dinner). Judge and be creative on that. I agree that it's not the best practice to regress on categorical data, but you can do it if you have a clear picture on what you are doing. Logistic regression will work only if your outcome is a dichotomic variable. In your, case I suggest to consider classification instead of linear regression. Cheers!
