Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, using a proposal distribution other than a Gaussian in Matlab

I am currently working on my final year project for my mathematics degree which is based on giving an overview of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and some numerical examples. So far I have got some great results by using my proposal distribution as a Gaussian, and sampling from a few other distributions, however I am trying to go one step further by using a different proposal distribution. So far I have got this code (I am using Matlab), however with limited resources online about using different proposals it is hard to tell if I am close at all, as in reality I am not too sure how to attempt this, (especially as this gives no useful data output so far). It would be fantastic if someone could lend a hand if they know or forward me to some easily accessible information (I understand that I am not just asking coding advice, but Mathematics as well). So, I want to sample from a Gaussian using a proposal distribution of a Laplace, this my code so far: n = 1000; %%%%number of iterations x(1) = -3; %%%%Generate a starting point %%%%Target distribution: Gaussian: strg = '1/(sqrt(2*pi*(sig)))*exp(-0.5*((x - mu)/sqrt(sig)).^2)'; tnorm = inline(strg, 'x', 'mu', 'sig'); mu = 1; %%%%Gaussian Parameters (I will be estimating these from my markov chain x) sig = 3; %%%%Proposal distribution: Laplace: strg = '(1/(2*b))*exp((-1)*abs(x - mu)/b)'; laplace = inline(strg, 'x', 'b', 'mu'); b = 2; %%%%Laplace parameter, I will be using my values for y and x(i-1) for mu %%%%Generate markov chain by acceptance-rejection for i = 2:n %%%%Generate a candidate from the proposal distribution y = laplace(randn(1), b, x(i-1)); %%%%Generate a uniform for comparison u = rand(1); alpha = min([1, (tnorm(y, mu, sig)*laplace(x(i-1), b, y))/(tnorm(x(i-1), mu, sig)*laplace(y, b, x(i-1)))]); if u If anyone can tell me if the above is completely wrong/going about it in the wrong way, or there are just a few mistakes (I am very wary about my generation of 'y' in for the for loop being completely wrong) that would be fantastic. Thanks, Tom
