Have you considered using a pivot table? It's a little bit overkill but greatly simplifies what you want to do. Assuming your using Excel 2007: Select the range of data including column labels. Go to Insert->[Tables]->PivotTable. In the dialog box that appears, select Existing Worksheet, choose a cell a click OK. At this point, the PivotTable pane appears with your field names in one box and four other labeled boxes below. Drag Name to the Row Labels box. Drag Name to the Values box. Drag Days to the Values box. You're done!
