I'm about to blog a wrapper around the lightspeed OR/M I think it's all in all about 3-400 lines of ruby and it would allow you to use active record style finders but in the context of a .NET OR/M http://www.mindscape.co.nz/products/lightspeed/ The idea behind lightspeed is very close to the idea behind datamapper. You can use anything from the System.Data namespace in IronRuby but that would entail making your own mapping to your objects and translating update/delete queries to DbCommands and managing the connections yourself. I'm looking at improving dbi for sql server later today. I'll look at the sqlite one when I've got a higher test coverage. Anyway implementing a dbi provider for sqlite that uses .NET won't take very long and you're more than welcome to email/IM me if you want to do it. But at this point the state of IronRuby is such that if you want something to work and it doesn't yet you have to do it yourself.
