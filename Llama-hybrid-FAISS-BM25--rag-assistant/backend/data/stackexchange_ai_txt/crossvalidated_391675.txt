Computing average of repeated measures before linear regression

Suppose I have a repeated measures dataset where multiple measures of a continuous outcome are taken on each subject in the dataset. How would one perform linear regression? Does it make sense to first compute the average of all outcomes per subject and then run the regression? I know mixed-effects models or GEEs are more appropriate particularly if the ICC is high - but let's ignore those models and focus on linear regression... If anyone knows what would be appropriate please chime. Thanks.
