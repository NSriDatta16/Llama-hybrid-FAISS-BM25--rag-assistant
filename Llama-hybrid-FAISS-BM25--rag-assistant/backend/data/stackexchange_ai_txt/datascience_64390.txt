I would say that the meaningful difference in approaches to sentiment classification is between knowledge-based and statistical ones. The knowledge-based, as you mention, usually use a polarity lexicon, that contains words with a sentiment value and then calculate the sentiment of a text by summing up the values of the words. The statistical ones train a model based on a labeled training set (i.e. in a supervised setting). The models that are used for that differ, for instance you can use a Naive Bayes classifier or an SVM or any sort of neural network. With regards to the packages you mentioned, as far as I understand Textblob indeed uses a lexicon. NLTK provides a lexicon-based sentiment classification but it also allows you to train your own statistical model. If a knowledge-based or a statistical approach is better for you use-case depends really on your data. Same holds for the difference between off-the-shelf vs custom trained one. But it also depends on the time you are able to spend on creating your own model and the expertise you can build on. If your domain is quite limited, I would argue hotel reviews are quite limited, fine-tuning a knowledge-based approach (by tweaking the underlying lexicon) might give you good results. In any case, I strongly suggest that you have a test set to evaluate your performance when creating or fine-tuning your model or comparing different models.
