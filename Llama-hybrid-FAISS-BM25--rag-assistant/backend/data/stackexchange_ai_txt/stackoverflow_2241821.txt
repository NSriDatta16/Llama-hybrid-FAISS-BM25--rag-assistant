Qt 4.6 - How to drag and drop into a QGraphicsView in QtCreator?

I've been trying to figure out how to drag and drop an image into a QGraphicsView using Qt and the QtCreator IDE. I have read the documentation here: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qgraphicsscene.html#dragEnterEvent This documentation is too general for me to understand. Can anyone give me an example that works? I also found a post about the same thing on StackOverflow here: Implementing drag and drop with QT 4.5 using QT Creator environment I figured out where this 'Promote' function is but I am still confused on how exactly I "promote" this QGraphicsView to drag and drop. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
