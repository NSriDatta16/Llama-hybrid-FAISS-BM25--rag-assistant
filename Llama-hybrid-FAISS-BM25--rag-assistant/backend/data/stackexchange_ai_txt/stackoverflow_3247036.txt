Selecting Word-Parts in C#

While collecting some training data for NLP, I discovered that it is impossible to select parts of 2 adjacent words in a RichTextBox. For example: you can not select "lect Me" from "Select Me" in a RichTextBox using mouse..!! However it can be done using SHIFT key Is there a property to be able to select parts of adjacent words not the whole words? That would make it easy for a human annotator... Thanks
