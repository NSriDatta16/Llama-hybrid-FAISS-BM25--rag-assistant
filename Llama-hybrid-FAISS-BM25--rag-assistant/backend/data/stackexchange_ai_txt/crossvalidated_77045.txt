The first issue that appears to me is that of multiplicity. If our objective is to consider each of the 80 places on the body where these individuals are measured and test whether there's a difference between diseased and healthy individuals, then having a 0.05 level test at each of the 80 places will result in an average of 4 type I errors. That's no good. Correcting this by using Bonferroni would yield a valid test for each site but is extremely conservative due to the assumed independence between each anatomical site (which we know to be false). If $n \gg 80$, then it would be possible to simultaneously test the partial correlations for conditional independence using a multivariate regression model with fixed effects for each site and an interaction with disease indicator. Using an L-1 penalty for the interaction parameters would force small differences toward zero and give you more power to estimate larger differences. Alternately, if data were matched (paired), you can compute differences in diseased and undiseased individuals and fit the differences model with intercept through the origin. If you're doing a randomization / permutation, it should be possible to calibrate it using a simulation. My question to you is this: the permutation test will only give you the joint sampling distribution of the model parameters under the null hypothesis. What next? What's your plan to use that information and obtain a calibrated and well powered test of hypothesis about the 80 sites?
