Utility of feature-engineering : Why create new features based on existing features?

I often see people create new features based on existing features on a machine learning problem. For example, here : https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/ people have considered the size of a personâ€™s family as a new feature, based on the number of brothers, sisters, and parents, which were existing features. But what the point of this ? I don't understand why the creation of correlated new features is useful. Isn't it the job of the algorithm to do that on its own ?
