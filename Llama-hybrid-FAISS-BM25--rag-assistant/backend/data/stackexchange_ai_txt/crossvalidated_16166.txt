As @rolando2 mentioned, this depends very much on what your trying to accomplish or what question(s) you are trying to answer. If you are trying to find a good model for prediction then rather than just deciding on whethere to include a term or not, it is better to use some type of shrinkage method such as penalized regression, ridge regression, lasso/lars, or model averaging. You should also take into account outside knowledge about the variables. If my doctor had a choice of 2 predictive models to help in diagnosing me I would prefer that he use the one that uses blood pressure as a predictor rather than the one that uses the results from an exploratory surgery, even if it has a slightly smaller $R^2$ value.
