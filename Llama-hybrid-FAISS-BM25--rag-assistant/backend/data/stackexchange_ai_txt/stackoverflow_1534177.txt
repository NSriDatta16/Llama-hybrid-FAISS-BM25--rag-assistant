Another possible solution, which sounds like it might be the best heuristic, is to take the weighted average of all the end nodes (weighted by path importance), then find the node which is closest to the computed average point. Connect to that node. Obviously that only works if the nodes are laid out in space somehow, but it's a good analogy.
