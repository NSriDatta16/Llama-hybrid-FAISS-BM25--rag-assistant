If you are working with P2P data transfer in .NET please take a look at Mono Torrent that's an open source implementation of the BitTorrent protocol. You can either embed the whole Mono Torrent library and use BitTorrent as your underlying protocol or take the relevant parts of it for your own project. The library has a very liberal license (MIT/X11) that allows embedding.
