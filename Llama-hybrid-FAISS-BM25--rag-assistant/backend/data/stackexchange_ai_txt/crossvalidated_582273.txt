How much randomness is required for Gibbs sampling?

I am attempting to parallelize a program that executes hundreds of calls to Mallet 's getSampledDistribution method, which is essentially an execution of Gibbs sampling over a topic distribution which has been previously built using LDA, each of which executes a thousand iterations. The way this is implemented in Mallet is that the random factor of Gibbs sampling comes from a random seed which is uniformly accessed: this allows multiple executions of my program to retain determinism so long as the order in which the samplings are done is the same. However, the random seed is retained across samplings: that is, the seed is not reset in-between calls to getSampledDistribution, guaranteeing that no two calls will use the same random factors, even if the overall execution does use the same sequence of random factors every time. This poses a problem for parallelization: in order to parallelize the execution, I would need to give up determinism since different threads may execute in different orders each time, thus accessing the random seed at a different point in its distribution. Determinism in this part of the process is a requirement for my application, so an option I have is to overwrite the random seed at the beginning of each call to getSampledDistribution, effectively forcing every Gibbs sampling process to use the exact same sequence of random factors, i.e. if I use Gibbs sampling a thousand times in my program, every one of them will use the same random factors, e.g. 3, 5, 7, etc., rather than each sampling having its own random factors across the execution. My question is, would this significantly affect the quality of the results from the sampling process? Given that the process in Mallet already uses an uniform sequence by default, I assume that so long as the random factor is "sufficiently random", then the sampling process will give me good enough results. However, I unfortunately have a weak background in statistics and machine learning, so I want to make sure doing this will not severely impact the process. If more information about my particular application is needed I can provide it, I just did not want to dump unnecessary information here and further complicate the question.
