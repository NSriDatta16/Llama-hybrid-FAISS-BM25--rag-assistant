Preparing Likert Data for CFA

I've been running a CFA on Likert scale data that averages the responses for each item, and I've been thinking that if I could possibly run the analysis without averaging the responses, it might improve the model and allow the possibility of using the DWLS estimator. When preparing Likert survey data for a CFA, can the respondents' entries be listed individually? This means there will be multiple scores recorded for each item and I'm unsure how this will work in R. If it will work, I'll go back to my data source and try to get the respondents' individual entries. (I'm learning this on my own so I apologize in advance if this seems like a basic question.)
