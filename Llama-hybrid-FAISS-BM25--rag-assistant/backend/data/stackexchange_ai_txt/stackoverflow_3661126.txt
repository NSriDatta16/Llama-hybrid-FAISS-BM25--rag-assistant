Sql Server Reporting Services vs Reporting Via .NET Application

My boss wants me to create a few reports in the near future and I think he wants to use SQL Server Reporting Services to deploy the reports. I'm not so sure this would be such a great idea considering that we are a pretty small organization and I cannot see us making good use of or needing the features that this solution offers such as setting up Users, Groups and Subscriptions. Although I have not used SSRS before, I've watched a 3-day webinar on it and it looks like it's one of those things that are nice and OK for simple situations but becomes a pain & too restricted when the requirements become more complex. I would much deploy the reports as local reports (.rdlc) in a .net application because: I would much rather process & format data with .NET then SQL. Sure you can use CLR, but this route just seems like it would be harder to maintain and less ideal than just processing data as I usually would in a .NET application. Limitations on UI when adding parameter controls - if I remember you do not have much control over the layout. So I guess my question would be in what situations does SSRS work good, what situations does it not work good? Are my points valid or am I just being a skeptic?
