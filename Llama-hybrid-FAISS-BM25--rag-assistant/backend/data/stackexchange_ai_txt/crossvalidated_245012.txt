Difference between experimental unit and observation

In the design of experiment in Agricultural research (I seek in particular that of Plant Breeding), common practice is that each experimental unit corresponds to one observation in the dataset. But, is it possible to use each sample (samping is done within a plot) on its own as individual observation by adding another factor, to infer from the dataset? For instance, In a alpha lattice design of experiment, I have following combination of factors and a response variables: plots cols block entries replication response 101 1 1 wheat_gen4 1 111.16131 102 2 1 wheat_gen11 1 73.51577 103 3 1 wheat_gen2 1 110.58604 104 4 1 wheat_gen16 1 117.10852 105 1 2 wheat_gen12 1 111.37657 106 2 2 wheat_gen13 1 105.00643 Apparently, plots column is the identifier for the experimental unit. We routinely model the data with one or more predictors ( cols , block , entries and replication ) and perform analysis of the response . But, although the data gathering process calls for obtaining multiple samples from each experimental units, we eventually end up having an average or a single summary value for all samples, as response variable. So, What I wish to know here is, why are the individual samples themselves not the observation, but their summary is? Say, for instance, I took five sample plants from each plot and thus want to also use that to model as response using this new structure. Does this require a new factor be introduced ? If so, how do I interpret the new factor? Or am I conceptually wrong? Forgive, me for the ambiguities. I'm a beginner in design of experiments and computational statistics.
