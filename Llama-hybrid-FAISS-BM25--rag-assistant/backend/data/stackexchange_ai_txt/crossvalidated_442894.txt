Why significant variable doesn't improve model performance?

I have a binary classification problem with 5K records and 60+ features/columns/variables. dataset is slightly imbalanced (or not) with 33:67 class proportion What I did was 1st ) Run a logistic regression (statsmodel) with all 60+ columns as input (meaning controlling confounders) and find out the significant risk factors (p 2nd ) Use the identified 7 significant risk factors to build a classification ML model 3rd ) It yielded an AUC of around 82% Now my question is 1 ) Out of 7 significant factors identified, we already know 5 risk factors based on domain experience and literature. So we are considering the rest 2 as new factors which we found. Might be because we had a very good data collection strategy (meaning we collected data for new variables as well which previous literature didn't have) 2 ) But when I build a model with already known 5 features, it produces an AUC of 82.1 . When I include all the 7 significant features, it still produces an AUC of 82.1-82.3 or sometimes, it even goes down to 81.8-81.9 etc. Not much improvement. Why is this happening? 3 ) If it's of no use, how does statsmodel logistic regression identified them as significant feature (with p 4 ) I guess we can look at any metric. As my data is slightly imbalanced (33:67 is the class proportion), I am using only metrics like AUC and F1 score. Should I be looking at accuracy only? 5 ) Should I balance the dataset because I am using statsmodel Logistic regression to identify the risk factors from the summary output? Because I use tree based models later to do the classification which can handle imbalance well, so I didn't balance.Basically what I am trying to know is even for `significant factor identification using statsmodel logistic regression, should I balance the dataset? 6 ) Can you let me know what is the problem here and how can I address this? 7 ) How much of an improvement in performance is considered as valid/meaningful to be considered as new findings?
