What is the variance of the mean of correlated binomial variables?

An average of $B$ binomial i.i.d. random variables, each with variance $\sigma^2,$ has variance $\frac{1}{B}\sigma^2.$ If the variables are simply i.d. (identically distributed, but not necessarily independent) with positive pairwise correlation $\rho$, the variance of the average is $$\rho\sigma^2 + \frac{1-\rho}{B}\sigma^2$$ but I don't understand why. Can somebody provide a proof?
