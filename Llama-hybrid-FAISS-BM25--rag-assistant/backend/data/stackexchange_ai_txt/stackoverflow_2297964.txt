The problem I think the key/value table approach is regarding the datatypes - if a value could be a datetime, or a string or a unicode string or an integer, then how do you define the column? This dilemma means the value column has to be a datatype which can contain all the different types of data in it which then begs the question of efficiency/ease of querying. Alternatively, you have multiple columns of specific datatypes, but I think this is a bit clunky. For a true flexible schema, I can't think of a better option than XML. You can index XML columns. This article off MSDN discusses XML storage in more detail.
