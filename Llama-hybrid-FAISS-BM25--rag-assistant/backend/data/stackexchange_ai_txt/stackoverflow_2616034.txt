A good framework will teach you exactly what you are hungry to learn. I second Jorge's suggestion of CodeIgniter. I was looking at that a lot until I decided to build one myself. BTW, I LOVE using my homebrew framework, and building it taught me A LOT so don't let anyone discourage you from reinventing the wheel if you really want to know how the wheel works.
