$ heroku logs --app app_name might give you something to go on, but don't expect too much. The logs are pretty sparse. You could use the Exceptional add-on to maybe get some more info. There is also the "Logging" add-on, which I have not tried yet, but might be of help to you. Also pay attention to the messages you get when you do your git push to Heroku. Make sure that all of your gems are installing properly.
