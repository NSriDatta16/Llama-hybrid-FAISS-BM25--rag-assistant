The answer that there are no linear combinations of variables that are useful in predicting outcomes is true in some but not all cases. I had a plot like the one above which was caused by multicollinearity in my data. Reducing the correlations allowed Lasso to work but it also removed useful information about the outcomes. Better sets of variables were obtained by using random forest importance to screen variables and then using Lasso.
