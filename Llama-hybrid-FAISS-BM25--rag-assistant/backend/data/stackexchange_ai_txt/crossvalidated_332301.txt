We can construct a custom test for this problem. If we assume that algorithm D1 is the same as the other algorithms, that they are all the same as well on average across the problem domain (highly dubious), and that differences in the algorithms' performances are independent across test problems (also dubious) then we can attribute differences in performance to randomness in the choice of problems. In that case, the rank of algorithm D1's performance would be uniformly distributed over the integers $1, 2, \dots, 9$. We have two experiments, so the sum of the ranks $R_1+R_2$ of algorithm D1 on the two experiments will, under the null hypothesis, have the same distribution as the sum of two uniformly-distributed numbers from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$. This distribution we can generate explicitly (there aren't that many combinations, after all), and see what the probability is of observing the actual or a greater rank sum. In this case, $R_1+R_2 = 2$, and the probability of such a sum occurring by chance is easily seen to be $1/81$. Since there are no more extreme values possible, this is also the probability of such a sum or a more extreme one occurring by chance, and corresponds to the p-value associated with the test of whether D1's performance really is uniformly distributed over $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$. Having written all this, though, I would STRONGLY suggest generating more test problems for your comparison than just two, and trying very, very hard to make sure they are representative of the problem domain and not subtly biased towards your algorithm. If you get substantially more data, you'll be able to use more powerful ranking procedures that can, to some extent, take into account lack of independence between algorithms across test problems as well as differences between algorithm performance - but that is well beyond the scope of this question. Any conclusions from what you've done are more heavily dependent upon the rather stringent assumptions made above than I personally would be comfortable with.
