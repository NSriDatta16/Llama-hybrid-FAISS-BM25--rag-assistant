If the target developers are Microsoft-centric and the customer wants enforcable process, then staying with the TFS is a good call. Implementation costs have to take into account the learning curve, any lost productivity and existing infrastructure. If this is a big shop, and it sounds like it is, you'll also need an "IT" team's buy-in, which may be hard to get with a whole new technology stack. Having said that, here are some other options: You might want to take a look at Subversion + Atlassian 's Jira (issue tracking), Confluence (wiki), Bamboo (CI), Clover (code coverage), Fisheye (repository "insight") These are commercial tools, but are also already integrated and integrate well with Subversion. The Rational toolset, which IBM now sells and develops, is robust, reliable and is very process-oriented. Probably more expensive than TFS, though. I have not used this recently, but in past engagements it performed well for those shops. And finally, there's Computer Associate's Software Change Manager which has the most obnoxious process enforcement of any tool I've ever had the misfortune to be forced to use. But if anal-retentive, obsessive/compulsive mandatory process is what you want, this is the tool for you.
