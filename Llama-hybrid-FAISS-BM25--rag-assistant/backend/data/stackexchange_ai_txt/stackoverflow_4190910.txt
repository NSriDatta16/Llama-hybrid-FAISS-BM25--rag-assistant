Book App Tutorial iphone

I am totally beginner in programming. I played a bit with xcode. But my question is: How to make an application like a book with pictures, texts and sounds, and that when children change their page, image, text and sound are in the context? I need to find a tutorial for it or if someone wants to teach us. We really want to teach us to do, we walk with our own legs after. Thank you for your attention and help.
