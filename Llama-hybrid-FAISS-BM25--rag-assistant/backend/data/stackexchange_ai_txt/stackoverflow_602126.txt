I used the complete VSTS (Team Suite + Team Foundation) 2005 edition, I used different features (SC,Load Test, Unit Testing,Performance analysis,Code coverage) on different technologies and apps (C#,C++,ASP.NET), it was great and helpful but I dont know there is equivalent product in the market (even for Load Test feature)
