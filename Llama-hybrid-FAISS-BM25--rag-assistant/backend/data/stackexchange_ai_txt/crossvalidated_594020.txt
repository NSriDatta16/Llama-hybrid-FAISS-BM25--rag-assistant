Definitions are overrated. They are just words which someone claims are synonymous to other words. They may be useful in special situations, e.g. to help a novice get a grasp of a concept, or to ensure that experts, when communicating with each other, know precisely what they are talking about. But, standing alone, who cares? That said, I believe all machine learners and a good deal of statisticians wouldn't object and would understand what you mean if you say "classification" for a task where your dependent variable is nominal (synonym: categorical) in Stevens' typology . Most machine learners will associate regression with numerical dependent variables, but some statisticians would say that "everything is regression", and classification a step---obviously outside of "everything"---you apply after performing some kind of regression (e.g. logistic regression) for the purpose of decision-making. For dependent variables which don't fit these two categories, the things get murky. Ordinal regression lies somewhere between classical (numerical) regression and classification. Predicting counts is, in my opinion, clearly a regression (Poisson, binomial etc.), and not classification.
