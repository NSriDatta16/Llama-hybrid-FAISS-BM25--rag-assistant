Does any one know how to do a weighted average (sumproduct/total) in matrix in SSRS 2008

I have just started using SSRS 2008 and needs to have a weighted avg for the columns. I know there a recursive sum, but not sure how to use it and achieve it? If M is month, V is value then I need weighted avg = M1V1 + M2V2 + M3V3 / V1+V2+V3.
