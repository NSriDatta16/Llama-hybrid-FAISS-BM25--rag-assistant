MSTest Code Coverage

Is there a way to test code coverage within visual studio if I'm using MSTest? Or do I have to buy NCover? Is the NCover Enterprise worth the money or are the old betas good enough if Microsoft doesn't provide built in tools to do code coverage? EDIT: Description of VS Products and which ones include code coverage https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/compare/ TestDriven.NET ( http://testdriven.net/ ) can be used if your VS version doesn't support it.
