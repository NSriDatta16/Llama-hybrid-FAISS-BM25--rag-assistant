Using JLists and ListModels

I have defined a DirectoryListModel class that extends the AbstractListModel class from the Java Api. Internally, I have a list of File objects. I have defined the getElementAt(int index) method as: @Override public Object getElementAt(int index) { return directoryElements.get(index) } The problem is that when I try to run my JList with my DirectoryListModel , it is going to show up the full paths of files instead of just the filenames. I could change this code to: @Override public Object getElementAt(int index) { return directoryElements.get(index).getName(); } and it'd work wonders, but the problem is that in the onclick event I'll want to have the File objects so I can do some checking with them (check if they're directories, etc). If I make getElementAt() return a String, I'm losing that possibility, thus I'd like to konw if there is a way I can format my File objects before the JList shows them in my window or if is there any simple and elegant way of doing this. Thanks
