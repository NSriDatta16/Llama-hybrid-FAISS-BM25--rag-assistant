So first off, you are right. It might be worthwhile to think of this within a general frame work of mechanism design and then tweak elements as you would like. With that being said, I think you can set this up as a mechanism design problem, in particular you can find try to find a Vickrey Clarke Grove Mechanism for your problem. Which is closely related to the voting games that you have described above. I will provide a general framework and then you can Google around it or I can answer questions as you go. First some notation, let $\theta_i$ be any report by the agent and let $\theta^t$ be the truthful report. Any set of reports can be given by $\theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2,\dots, \theta_n)$ . Now let us do the following: Ask agent to report their value function for any combination of ratings $v_i(\theta)$ . This basically asks the agent to report how they feel about any combination of ratings. Based on the above, it finds out $\theta^*$ such that : $$\theta^g = argmax_{\theta\in \Theta} \sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\theta)$$ This finds out the combination of reports that maximizes everyone's welfare, given the report of agent $i$ . Thus $\theta^g$ is the gamed rating. Pay agent $i$ the sum of everyone else's valuation of this gamed rating plus some function (of our choosing and defined in step 4) of everyone else's valuation, $$p_i := \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta^g) + h_j(v_{-i})$$ Ask agent $i$ to pay a price for being asked to rate. Think of this as the price you have to pay because your rating affects everyone else. $$h_j (v_{-i}) = \max_{\theta\in\Theta} \sum_{j\neq i}v_j(\theta)$$ Lets say the value that maximizes this is $\theta^{g^{-i}}$ , then $h_j$ becomes, $$h_j(v_{-i}) = \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta^{g^{-i}})$$ . Bringing all this together we have the final payment by an agent $i$ to be : $$p_i = \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta^g) - \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta^{g^{-i}})$$ Which is the difference between the social welfare of the gamified rating when the agent $i$ is present and the gamified rating when agent $i$ is not present. This can be interpreted to mean that the agent should pay the distortion they cause by being present in the system. All this to say, I think you should find out how a sample would pay for not lying. If the payment mechanism is truthful and optimal (everyone is incentivized to tell the truth and the societally best rating is achieved) To get more specific, we can define the utility function of any one agent as follows, where the agent lies by declaring $\theta'_i$ : $$v_i(\theta_i',\theta_{-i}) = (\theta_i - \frac{1}{n}\theta_i'-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j \neq i}\theta_j)^2$$ Then the "gamified" rating $\theta^g = \frac{1}{n}(\theta'_i + \sum_{j\neq i} \theta_j)$ hence the VCG payment is : $$p_i = \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta'_i,\theta_{-i}) - \sum_{j\neq i} v_j(\theta_j)$$ $$p_i = \sum_{j\neq i} (\frac{1}{n} (\theta'_i +\sum_{-i} \theta_j)-\theta_j)^2 - \sum_{j\neq i} (\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{-i}\theta_j-\theta_j)^2$$ Where the first term is the welfare of everyone else, other than $i$ with $i$ having lied and the second term is the welfare of everyone else had $i$ not been present.
