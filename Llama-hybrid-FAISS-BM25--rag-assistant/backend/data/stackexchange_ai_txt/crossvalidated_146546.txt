Your current usage of MASS fitdistr is incorrect, it expects to be supplied with actual observations rather than essentially a histogram which you have supplied. Your best bet I think is to simulate a dataset with 24 values 0.5, 42 values 1.5, 68 values 2.5 etc and then run fitdistr on that. You can get lognormal or log-logistic or gamma by replacing 'weibull' in your call as appropriate. EDIT I assumed that people would not all respond exactly at the end of day 1 but would be spread out across the day with average response roughly half way through the day. You will presumably then want to use the model to predict how many responses will arrive at time $T > t$ given you have received $m(t)$ responses up to time $t$. You would calculate this as $$m(t) \frac{\Pr(T > t)}{\Pr(T \le t)}= \frac{m(t)\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{t}{b}\right)^a\right\}}{1-\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{t}{b}\right)^a\right\}}$$ Where $a$ is the shape parameter and $b$ the scale parameter.
