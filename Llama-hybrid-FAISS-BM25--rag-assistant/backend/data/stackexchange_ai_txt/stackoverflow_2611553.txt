I'm gonna change my comment to a proper answer, because after having a quick play what i suggested does exactly what you want. Download the free version of Reflector from here , unpack it and run it. Drag and drop a compiled version of your assembly on to it, and next to the Name tag in the info section at the bottom of the dialog will be its fully qualified name, ready for you to just copy and paste from there. Note that all the info you need is also availableby right-clicking on the compiled file, select Properties , then go to the Details tab, although you can't just copy/paste from there.
