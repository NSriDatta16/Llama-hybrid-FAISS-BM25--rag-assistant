View raw XML request

I am very new to WCF and SOAP messaging but I have managed to put together a reasonably good client which I am using to download news stories from a media organisation. I have generated proxy classes which obviously abstract a lot away and mean that I am basically just creating objects, calling methods and iterating through results. My issue is that I have raw XML examples of what the calls to the web service should look like and I want to be able to "compare" these to the calls that I am making. Basically I need to ensure that the calls that I am making are the same as the example XML files for testing purposes. Does what I am asking make sense or am I going about this the wrong way? Please let me know if there is any necessary information that I have left out, I could bang on for paragraphs but am not sure what information is relevant.
