Although I have decided to port to MC++ for completeness and because I have already done the research there are two other solutions I could have used. Firstly I could have called the C# component from native C++ by embedding the mono runtime into the project. Looked interesting and I will be researching it for use in other projects. Or I could have used the CLR Hosting API . Looked more of hack then the first but doable. Lastly for anyone interested in finding information needed in porting C++ to the its managed form see this link. Looks like native C++ is the only language that can be compiled as managed without modification to the code. Correct me if I am wrong. EDIT: I'm wrong ..
