Is there a way to run code when an assembly loads?

I'm building an application that will load untrusted assemblies for inspection (i.e. retrieval of the assembly full name). For security reasons, I'm trying to think of a way that these assemblies could be written that would allow them to execute code when loaded. I haven't code up with a method yet, but wanted to throw it out here to see if anyone could. I'm aware that I could load these assemblies into an untrusted app domain, effectively stopping them from doing almost anything, but I wanted to avoid the complexity if it's un-needed. Specifically, I will be calling Assembly.Load and .FullName . Maybe there's a better way to load the assembly name without using the Assembly class? Thanks, Matt
