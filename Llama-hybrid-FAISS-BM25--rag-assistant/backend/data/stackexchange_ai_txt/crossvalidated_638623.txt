Vocabulary in EDA

I've found myself straggling to find appropriate vocabulary to describe a scatterplot as part of exploratory data analysis. I've found this paper about the graph theory and although it's interesting I'm not sure what vocabulary I can use In this plot, can I say that the blue points are higher compared to orange? I don't have a model, I don't know interactions, confounders or I haven't done error control to say that the one is higher than the other.
