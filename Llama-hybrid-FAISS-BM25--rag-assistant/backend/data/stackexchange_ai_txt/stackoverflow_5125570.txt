display attribute values on category page in magento

I have a Brand attribute (dropdown) that I created for products. The dropdown for this attribute displays 5 to 6 brands. What I want is to display the attribute value of brand in the category page, and the value should be related only to those products which are currently displayed in the category page. So, if six products are displayed, then six brands should be displayed, selected by the admin.
