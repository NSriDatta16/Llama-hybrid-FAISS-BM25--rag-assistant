Interesting question .. I have answered in a time series context because that is the only subject that I know anything about . I have implemented procedures that are used to estimate a family of forecast errors to enable model evaluation metrics to be generated. After identifying a robust ARIMA model for a time series we have a set of model residuals. We can bootstrap say 1,000 forecasts for the next time period using monte carlo methods. An actual value for the next period is observed thus we now have 1,000 error measures for the robust ARIMA model that had been developed and consequentially upper and lower limits for that metric can be produced . As a second candidate we could introduce an exogoneous/causal series and form a transfer function (regression on steroids !) and forecast the predictor and use those forecasts to aid the prediction of the endogneous series. Similar to approach 1 we can then form a distribution of forecast errors for the next period. We can now generate and additional two sets of forecast errors by allowing for pulses to occur in the future thus in total four error distributions have been generated. This process can be conducted for K periods into the future. This would enable confidence limits to be placed around a forecast evaluation metric such as mape or mae .
