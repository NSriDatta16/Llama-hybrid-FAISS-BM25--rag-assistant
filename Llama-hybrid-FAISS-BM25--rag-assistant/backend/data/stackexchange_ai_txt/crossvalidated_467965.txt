We can understand them from the training data. Random forest is to learn different trees based on partial training data, where the training data sets are drawn from the raw data set and the attribute at each split is on random. It encourages the diversity of samples. The MART or generally boosting usually train a single tree over the entire training set while with different adaptive loss functions. The loss function matters.
