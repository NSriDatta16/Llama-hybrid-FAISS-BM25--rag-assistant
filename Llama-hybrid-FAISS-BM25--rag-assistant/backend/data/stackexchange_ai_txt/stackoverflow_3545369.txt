Porting code which requires default char to be unsigned to a code-base which does not have this requirement

i have gone through the numerous questions regarding signed/unsigned char. I understand there are three distinct char types in C++. Currently i have a large code-base which is compiled with Visual Studio - the "default char unsigned" setting is set to "No". Now i'm supposed to add a particular project to our code-base (integrate it to be a part of our current tool-set). This project comes with a documentation where it is strongly emphasized that it needs default char to be unsigned. Now i began to wonder: why did the author use "char" and not "unsigned char" if he needs char to be unsigned? What could go wrong if i change our code-base to have the "default unsigned char" settings set to "Yes"? And what could go wrong if i change all "char" to unsigned char in the whole project i'm supposed to add to our code-base? Actually what i should probably ask was "How am I supposed to add this project to our code-base without breaking anything" but that would be asking for a solution and i would not learn anything ;)
