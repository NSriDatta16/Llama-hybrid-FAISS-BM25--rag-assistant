You're all ignoring the point of the question - Why must the developer type out the PIMPL code? For me, the best answer I can come up with is that we don't have a good way to express C++ code that allows you to operate on it. For instance, compile-time (or pre-processor, or whatever) reflection or a code DOM. C++ badly needs one or both of these to be available to a developer to do meta-programming. Then you could write something like this in your public MyClass.h: #pragma pimpl(MyClass_private.hpp) And then write your own, really quite trivial wrapper generator.
