Firefox 3.03 and contentEditable

I'm using the contentEditable attribute on a DIV element in Firefox 3.03. Setting it to true allows me to edit the text content of the DIV, as expected. Then, when I set contentEditable to "false", the div is no longer editable, also as expected. However the flashing caret (text input cursor) remains visible even though the text is no longer editable. The caret is now also visible when I click on most other text in the same page, even in normal text paragraphs. Has anyone seen this before? Is there any way to force the caret hidden? (When I either resize the browser or click within another application, and come back, the caret magically disappears.)
