Detecting if a CGAffineTransformed view is out of bounds of a screen/UIView

I have a several views that I can drag around, rotate, scale. I want to make it so they can't be drug, rotated or scaled off the screen. Dragging seems to not be an Issue as I'm not using a Transform to generate the new position and see if that new position would put the view off the screen. When I rotate or scale I use a CGAffineTransform (CGAffineTransformedRotate or CGAffineTransformScale) and I cant seem to get what the new frame would be without actually applying it to my view. CGRect newElementBounds = CGRectApplyAffineTransform(element.bounds, CGAffineTransformScale([[gestureRecognizer view] transform], [gestureRecognizer scale], [gestureRecognizer scale])); CGRect elementBoundsInSuperView = [element convertRect:newElementBounds toView:[element superview]]; elementBoundsInSuperView is not the Rect that I would Expect it to be, Its way off. I've also Tried to get the bounds in the SuperView first and then apply the transform to it, and that's not right either. CGRect elementBoundsInSuperView = [element convertRect:element.bounds toView:[element superview]]; CGRect newElementBounds = CGRectApplyAffineTransform(newElementBounds, CGAffineTransformScale([[gestureRecognizer view] transform], [gestureRecognizer scale], [gestureRecognizer scale])); the [gestureRecognizer view] should be the same as element .
