Your tiles will be parts of the entire HTML file that will be generated from putting them all together along with the layout.jsp. That means that the tiles must only contain the markup for which the tile is a placeholder. In your case you don't need to have full HTML-HEAD-BODY content. In the code you posted, the tiles are fragments of a page, not entire pages. You will still need page directives and taglib declarations inside the header.jsp ,footer.jsp and content.jsp files as they are processed before the result they generate is placed inside the layout.jsp.
