How to apply box muller transform to a time series?

I have a time series where each point is independent and uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$ . I want to apply the box-muller transform to obtain a normally distributed time series. However I am unsure if I need to do this in a rolling window method to each pair of consecutive data points or some other way. If we take the definition of the box muller transform, $Z_0 = \sqrt{-2\log U_1}\cos(2\pi U_2)$ and $Z_1=\sqrt{-2\log U_1}\sin(2\pi U_2)$ where $U_1, U_2$ and independent and uniformly distributed $U[0, 1]$ . Then $Z_0, Z_1$ are independent normally distributed. Given our uniformly distributed time series $X = \{x_1, x_2, x_3,...,x_n\}$ , I would have done something like $Z = \{z_0=\sqrt{-2\log x_0}\cos(2\pi x_1), z_1=\sqrt{-2\log x_1}\sin(2\pi x_2), ..., z_{n-1}=..\}$ . $Z$ has one less elemnt than $X$ as each point $z_i$ uses the last two data points to avoid look-ahead bias. But I'm not sure if this is valid. How do I apply the box-muller transform to a time series? Is it even possible / correct to do so?
