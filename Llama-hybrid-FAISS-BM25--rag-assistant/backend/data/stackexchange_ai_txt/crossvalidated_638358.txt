Effectiveness of Using Moving Averages in Timeseries Regression Analysis with Noisy Data

I am working with a dataset where I suspect there is significant noise in both the dependent variable ( $y_t^*$ ) and the independent variable ( $x_t^*$ ). I am considering using moving averages to denoise the data before performing ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. I would appreciate insights into whether this approach is statistically sound and the implications it might have on the analysis. The true underlying model of my data is: $$ y_t = kx_t + b + e_t $$ However, the observed variables are: $$ y_t^* = y_t + v_t $$ $$ x_t^* = x_t + \mu_t $$ where $v$ and $\mu$ represent measurement errors, and $e$ is the error term in the regression model. All these errors ( $v$ , $\mu$ , and $e$ ) are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid). In a standard OLS regression with $y^*$ and $x^*$ , the covariance term $\text{cov}(y^*, x^*)$ remains as $k \times \text{var}(x)$ , but the variance $\text{var}(x^*)$ becomes $\text{var}(x) + \text{var}(\mu)$ , which would lead to a shrinkage in the estimated coefficient for $x$ . I am considering using a rolling average to mitigate this issue. Assuming that $x_t$ are stationary but autocorrelated, and $\mu_t$ is iid with no autocorrelation, the formula for the average would give: $$ \frac{\text{cov}(\bar{y}^*, \bar{x}^*)}{\text{var}(\bar{x}^*)} = \frac{k(\text{var}(x) + \text{[some linear combination of autocorrelation terms]})}{(\text{var}(x) + \text{[some linear combination of autocorrelation terms]}) + \text{var}(\mu)} $$ If $x$ is highly autocorrelated and we take a larger rolling window, this increases the long-run variance, potentially outweighing $\text{var}(\mu)$ , which remains constant. Would this approach yield an estimate closer to the true coefficient $k$ ? Furthermore, I am curious about the implications of resampling the data at a lower frequency (e.g., converting daily data to weekly or monthly) on the variance. Also, what would be the effect if the rolling average is applied only to $x^*$ and not to $y^*$ , especially if the measurement error is primarily in $x^*$ ? I am seeking insights on whether my analysis is correct and if the proposed methodologies are valid approaches to handle noisy data in regression analysis.
