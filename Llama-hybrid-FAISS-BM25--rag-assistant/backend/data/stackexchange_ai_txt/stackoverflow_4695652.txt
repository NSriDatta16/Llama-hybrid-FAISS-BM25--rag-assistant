I use PersistJS ( github repository ), which handles client-side storage seamlessly and transparently to your code. You use a single API and get support for the following backends: flash: Flash 8 persistent storage. gears: Google Gears-based persistent storage. localstorage: HTML5 draft storage. whatwg_db: HTML5 draft database storage. globalstorage: HTML5 draft storage (old spec). ie: Internet Explorer userdata behaviors. cookie: Cookie-based persistent storage. Any of those can be disabledâ€”if, for example, you don't want to use cookies. With this library, you'll get native client-side storage support in IE 5.5+, Firefox 2.0+, Safari 3.1+, and Chrome; and plugin-assisted support if the browser has Flash or Gears. If you enable cookies, it will work in everything (but will be limited to 4 kB).
