I really liked Inside Windows Communication Foundation . It tells you a few things that most other books don't: What the design goals of WCF are Different messaging and coordination patterns and what support WCF has for them The organization of WCF (Relationship between bindings, channels, etc). A few other books have this, but I found this book to have the most hands-on explanation of them - which I like. Highly recommended.
