The quick and easy hack would be to just update the UI at the end of your anonymous method in your thread. Obviously you can't update it directly, but you can use Dispatcher.Invoke : Thread t = new Thread(delegate() { po.Organise(inputPath, outputPath, recursive); Dispatcher.Invoke(new Action(()=>{PBar.Value = 100;}),null); }); t.Start();
