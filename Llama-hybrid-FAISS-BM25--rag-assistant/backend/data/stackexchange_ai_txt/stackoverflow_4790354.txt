I have hosted an open-source project to enable Android phone to IP camera: http://code.google.com/p/ipcamera-for-android Raw video data is fetched from LocalSocket, and the MDAT MOOV of MP4 was checked first before streaming. The live video is packed in FLV format, and can be played via Flash video player with a build in web server :)
