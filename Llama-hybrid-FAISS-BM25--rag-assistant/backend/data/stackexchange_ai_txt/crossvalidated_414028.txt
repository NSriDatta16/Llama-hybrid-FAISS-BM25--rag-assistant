Selecting informative priors

I am questioning myself on how to chose the priors for a bayesian analysis in Rstudio. I'm trying to investigate the chances of relapse in a set of patients. These patients are all affected by a variant of the disease that, by itself, predisposes them to relapse more than the "regular" variant of the pathology. I know from bigger studies in literature that the "regular" group has a ~3% chances of relapse, with respect to the ~11% of the variant I'm considering. If I wanted to predict the chances of relapse, based on some covariates, could I possibly include this prior knowledge in the model? How would I do It, practically? Thanks
