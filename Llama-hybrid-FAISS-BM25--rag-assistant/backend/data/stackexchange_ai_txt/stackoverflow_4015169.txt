You probably mean density, not resolution (in Android, applications do not work directly with resolution). Actually, you don't need to support all 3 densities. Quote from developer.android.com: This pre-scaling mechanism works independently of the source. For instance, an application targeted for a high-density screen may have bitmaps only in the res/drawable-hdpi/ directory. If one of the bitmaps is a 240x240 icon and is loaded on a medium-density screen, the resulting bitmap will measure 160x160. I've done simple test: removed ldpi and mdpi density images, launched my app on mdpi skin and it scaled hdpi images nicely. It's not the best practice, but android's prescaling does its part as described. Please read this for more details.
