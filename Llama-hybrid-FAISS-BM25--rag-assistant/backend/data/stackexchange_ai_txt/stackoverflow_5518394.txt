I'd recommend putting the text inside a tag so that you could click on it (and so that screen readers and such could make sense of your form): Pre-Payment Then, the whole thing becomes easy: var text = $('label[for=pre-payment]').text(); var or_this = $('#pre-payment').next('label').text(); I'd prefer the first option, label[for=...] , as it is less fragile than the second
