Pekka has explained it in theory in his answer . Based on his answer, and my answer to another question about the > combinator , I'll provide an illustration, modified to address this question. Consider the following block of HTML, and your example CSS selectors. I use a more elaborate example so I can show you the difference between both of your selectors: The first paragraph. A quotation. A paragraph after the quotation. Which s are selected by which selectors? First off, all of them match div p because they are elements situated anywhere within a element. That makes div > p more specific, which begs the next question: Which s are selected by div > p ? Selected This paragraph is a child, or a direct descendant, of the outermost . That means it's not immediately contained by any other element than a . The hierarchy is as simple as the selector describes, and as such it's selected by div > p . Not selected This is found in a element, and the element is found in the outermost . The hierarchy would thus look like this: div > blockquote > p As the paragraph is directly contained by a blockquote, it's not selected by div > p . However, it can match blockquote > p (in other words, it's a child of the ). Selected This paragraph lives in the inner , which is contained by the outer . The hierarchy would look like this: div > div > p It doesn't matter if there are more s nested within each other, or even if the s are contained by other elements. As long as this paragraph is directly contained by its own , it will be selected by div > p .
