PCA and its kernelized version are data transformations, typically employed for dimensionality reduction or denoising. They are not used for classification directly, though you could use (standard) PCA as a preprocessing step before training a classifier. The most common kernel-based classification methods are support vector machines (extremely popular), kernel LDA (less popular) and kernel logistic regression, so you probably want to read up on those.
