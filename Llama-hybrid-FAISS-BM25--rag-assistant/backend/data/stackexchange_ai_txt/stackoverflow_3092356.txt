Calculate CMYK coverage on PDF

I don't suppose is there any free or open source libraries out there that able to calculate the CMYK coverage on a pdf file. I tried looking around I don't seem to able to find any. If there isn't any out there if anyone could point me in the right direction of what do I need to do in order to calculate the CYMK coverage on a pdf. Oh also the development environment I'd be working in is .net framework 4.0 Cheers
