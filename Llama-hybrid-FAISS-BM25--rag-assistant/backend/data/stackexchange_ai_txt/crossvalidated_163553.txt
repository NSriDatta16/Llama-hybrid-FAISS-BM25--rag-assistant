How do you turn the output of a nnet neural network model into an equation?

Assuming the output of the above nnet feedforward model (nnetModel) is such that the following summary is produced: > summary(nnetModel) a 2-2-1 network with 9 weights options were - linear output units decay=0.01 b->h1 i1->h1 i2->h1 6 4 5 b->h2 i1->h2 i2->h2 9 7 8 b->y h1->y h2->y 3 1 2 Is there a way of turning this information into an equation which also incorporates the weight decay (0.01)? I would like to make use of this equation as an objective function for nonlinear optimisation. I've had a go at converting the model output into an equation function (FFNN) which makes use of the sigmoid activation function (extracted from the C-sources; filennet.c, lines 157-165). sigmoid 15.0) { return (1.0) }else return (1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-sum))) } FFNN I would like to extend this out for my actual nnet model output which has 20+ independent variables. Does anyone know a better way of writing an equation function which also factors in the weight decay (0.01)?
