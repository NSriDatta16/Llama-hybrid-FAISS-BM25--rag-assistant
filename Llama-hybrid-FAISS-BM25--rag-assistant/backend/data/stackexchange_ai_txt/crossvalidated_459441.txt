Can you compare the entropy between instances even if they have different n_labels

Consider a dataset where each instance was annotated by a number of participants that had to category the instance (a, b, or c). To calculate some form of agreement between these participants, we could calculate the average entropy over all instances. My question is, is that still a fair thing to do when not all examples have been annotated by the same number of participants? Say that example_1 has been annotated by three participants, and example_2 had five participants, is it then still fair to compare the entropy values between these two or take the unweighted average? Example dataset: annotator_1 | annotator_2 | annotator_3 | annotator_4 | annotator_5 ------------------------------------------------------------------- a b a a c a a b a b a c b b a c a
