It means theoretically . In an experimental setup, different chunks of the series will have probably different statistics, even the average values as you suggest. But, for example, if a theoretical analysis shows thata $E[x_t]=\mu_x$ , i.e. constant, then the series is said to be mean stationary . This means at any time of the series, the mean of the sample at that time is $\mu_x$ . For different chunks of data, you won't get exactly equal means of course; but the theoretical analysis suggest that you could expect approximate means among large enough chunks. Another example would be autocorrelation, i.e. a second order statistics. If your time series have stationary autocorrelation, then the correlation between two of its samples won't depend on exactly where they are, instead it'll depend on the relative time distance between them, i.e. $r_x(t_1,t_2)=r_x(t_1-t_2)$ . This means, even if you analyze first $10^4$ samples or the next, you should be obtaining similar results (within ergodic assumption) because the realization is assumed to come from a 2nd order stationary process.
