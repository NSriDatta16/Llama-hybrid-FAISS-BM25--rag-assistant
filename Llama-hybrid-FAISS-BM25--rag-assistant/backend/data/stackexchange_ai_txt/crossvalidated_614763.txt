Unstable HDBSCAN & UMAP clustering results

I've segmented my data using UMAP (dimensionality reduction, with a fixed random seed) and subsequently HDBSCAN to generate a number of clusters. I've also looped through different values to fine-tune both UMAP and HDBSCAN to generate the optimal solution based on the relative_validity score embedded within HDBSCAN. I also split the data into train and test to ensure I wasn't overfitting. My problem is that the solution seems to be a bit unstable - when I feed completely new data, UMAP and HDBSCAN produce slightly different solutions. Whilst I understand there is an stochastic element to both algorithms, intuitively I would expect to always get roughly the same clustering structure. Is this expected? Does anyone know how to solve this? Is there any step I'm missing? Thanks in advance! # UMAP projection = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=, n_components=, min_dist=, metric=, random_state=42) train_projection = projection.fit_transform(train_data) # Fit HDBSCAN cluster = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=, min_samples=, gen_min_span_tree=True, prediction_data=True) clusterer = cluster.fit(train_projection) ```
