[Partial answer, but too long for a comment] This situation is very common in experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, where you often have multiple research participants completing multiple trials in an experiment or repetitions of the same stimulus in neuroimaging. $\hat Y$ might be simple averages (e.g. average response times in different conditions) or estimates from more complex models (e.g. drift diffusion models fit to a single participant's response times, reinforcement learning models fit to their choices, a GLM fit to neural data). More often than not, these "level 1 estimates" are fed into a "level 2" t-test, ANOVA, or regression analysis. A commonly-cited limitation of this approach is that it ignores uncertainty in the individual $\hat Y$ estimates, rather than giving less weighting to more uncertain estimates. For this reason, multilevel models are increasingly used instead, where this weighting occurs automatically. This paper is a good starting point for reading about this approach as applied to RL models.
