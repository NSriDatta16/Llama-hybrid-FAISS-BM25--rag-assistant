This answer gives an intuitive and not-mathematical interpretation: The PCA will give you a set of orthogonal vectors within a high-dimensional point cloud. The order of the vectors is determined by the information conveyed aftter projecting all points onto the vectors. In different words: The first principal component vector will tell you the most about the point cloud after projecting all points onto the vector. This is an intuitve interpretation of course. Look at this ellipsoid (follow link for a 3D model) : If you would have to choose one vector forming a one-dimensional sub-space onto which the points of the ellipsoids points will be projected. Which one would you choose because it conveys the most information about the original set in 3 dimensions? I guess the red one along the longest axis. And this is actually the calculated 1st principal component! Which one next - I would choose the blue one along the next longest axis. Typically you want to project a set of points from a high-dimensional space onto a two dimensional plane or into a three dimensional space . http://www.joyofdata.de/blog/illustration-of-principal-component-analysis-pca/
