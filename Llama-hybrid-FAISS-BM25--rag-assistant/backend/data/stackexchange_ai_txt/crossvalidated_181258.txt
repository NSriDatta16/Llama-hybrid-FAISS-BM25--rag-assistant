ANOVA for increasing IV

I wonder, how to analyze a dataset the right way. My data are generated as follows: Take one graph $G$ with $G \in \{ \text{random}, \text{spanning-tree}, \text{empty}\}$ Doing something with the graph, depending on parameter $n$ for $n=1$ to $100$: Measuring parameter $a$, $b$ and $c$ (e.g. Cluster Coefficient C, Pathlength L and Powerlaw-Exponent Alpha) I run this setup for each graph once and checked the correlation (what happens to a , b or c if I increase n ). My next task, is to check if there is a difference in the parameters between the different graph types for a series of $n=1$ to $100$. I want to know if the graph-type has an influence on my parameters (depending on n). My best case would be, that I can take an empty graph. My current approach is: For each graph type: Calculate the parameters a , b and c for each n ($n=1$ to $100$) (averaged over 100 runs) So far I get for each graph type a file with 100 rows (1 row per n) with 3 parameters. Then I do a one-way-anova analysis for each parameter with the graph-type as my IV and the parameter as my DV. Is this approach right? Or should I create 100 datasets (one for each n) for each graph type and perform a anova analysis on them? Kind regards and thanks for any help, Kai
