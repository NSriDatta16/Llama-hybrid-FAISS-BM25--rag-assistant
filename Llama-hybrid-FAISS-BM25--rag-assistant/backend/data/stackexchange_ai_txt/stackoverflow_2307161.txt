JQuery drag/scrolling/overflow issue

I have a scrolling:auto problem with JQuery 1.4.2 and JQuery 1.7.2. I have a container DIV with 2 DIVs inside it. Like this: Title goes here! Content goes here! And I enable dragging the group by: $('#dragMe').draggable({ containment: '#dragContain', cursor: 'move', zIndex: 20000 }); And, when I do so, in FF the scrolling only works with the mouse wheel. Grabbing the scrollbar causes a drag event and moves the group. It works fine in IE. Is there any way to correct this? Can I make only the titlebar a grab handle which causes a drag on the parent div? Thanks!
