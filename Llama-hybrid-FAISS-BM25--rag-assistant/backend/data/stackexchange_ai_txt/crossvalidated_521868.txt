I need to run a comparison test of mean biomass of species between 2 different locations. Problem - too many zero values for my dependent variable

I need to run a t-test and series of ANOVA tests (through SPSS, excel, or Matlab) to compare the biomass of 20 species (dependent variable) found at 2-4 different locations (independent variable). The problem I have is that I have many zero values (indicating no record of that species observed on several surveying days) for biomass of individual species, which is bringing the average biomass value incredibly low per species. Is there a formula or stats test that accounts for ''non-observations'? Any advice or recommendations? Thank you!
