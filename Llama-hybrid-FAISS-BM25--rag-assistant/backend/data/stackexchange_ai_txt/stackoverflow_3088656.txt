Unless there's a significant benefit derived elsewhere, it can be said that keys in map should single-valued things, if at all possible. That said, through paying attention to equals() and hashCode() you can make any object work as key, but equals() and hashCode() aren't very pleasing things to have to pay attention to. You'll be happier sticking to IDs as keys.
