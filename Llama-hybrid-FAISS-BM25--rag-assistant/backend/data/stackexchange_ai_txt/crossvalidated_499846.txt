What is a feature vector and how do they differ from feature maps

I'm reading a paper which reviews image upscaling techniques. A model named SRCNN is described as: First layer: creates feature maps from low-resolution input images Second layer: converts these feature maps into high dimensional feature vectors source snippet: https://prnt.sc/vy2sah From what I understand a feature map (in this context) is the output of a filter that has been applied to an image. What is a "high dimensional feature vector" and how do they differ from feature maps?
