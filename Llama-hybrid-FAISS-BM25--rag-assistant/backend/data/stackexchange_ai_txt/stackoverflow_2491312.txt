You are not getting any results because you are using the wrong namespace. All elements without prefix are in the namespace urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/DIDL-Lite/ . Items in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ are prefixed with dc: in the xml document. The fragment does not show any items so it is hart to tell what elements you are looking for. For example - given the following xml: Hot Issue Purl Title And also given the assumption that you want to retrieve both titles the following code should yiedl the results you are looking for: XNamespace dc= "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"; XNamespace ns = "urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/DIDL-Lite/"; var result = xAudioinfo.Descendants(ns + "title"); // var result2 = xAudioinfo.Descendants(dc + "title"); //
