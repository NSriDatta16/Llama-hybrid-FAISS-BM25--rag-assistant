Html Agility Pack - Get html fragment from an html document

Using the html agility pack; how would I extract an html "fragment" from a full html document? For my purposes, an html "fragment" is defined as all content inside of the tags. For example: Sample Input: blah My content Desired Output: My content Ideally, I'd like to return the content unaltered if it didn't contain an or element (eg. assume that I was passed a fragment in the first place if it wasn't a full html document) Can anyone point me in the right direction?
