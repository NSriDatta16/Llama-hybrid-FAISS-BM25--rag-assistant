This is a good robots.txt directive for WordPress. Add the Allow: /wp-content/uploads if you want uploads to be indexed, but that doesn't make sense, as all your images, pdfs, etc., are included in your posts and pages and are indexed there. User-agent: * Allow: / Disallow: /*?s= Disallow: /wp-admin/* Disallow: /wp-content/* Disallow: /wp-includes/* Disallow: /wp-content/cache Disallow: /wp-content/themes/* Disallow: /trackback Disallow: /comments Disallow: /category/ Disallow: */trackback Disallow: */comments But the most critcal bit of info is in your page source: That means you have privacy set in Dashboard/Settings/Privacy and that's blocking all search bots even before they get to robots.txt. Once you get a good robots.txt file and change the Wordpress privacy setting, so to Google webmaster tools and turn up your crawl rate to have Google hit the site faster.
