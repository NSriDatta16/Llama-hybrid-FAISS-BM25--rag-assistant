Conceptual Question on ARMA Processes

Would love to hear some feedback on a conceptual question I have concerning ARMA modelling. In particular, I would like to ask if someone could highlight why a time series would exhibit both AR and MA like behavior, with a simple example. For example, it is understood that with an AR process, the current value of the series is a function of past values of the series plus an additive error term (innovation). Whereas, an MA process is a function of current and past innovations. Yet, I don't quite understand why a time series would exhibit both behaviors?
