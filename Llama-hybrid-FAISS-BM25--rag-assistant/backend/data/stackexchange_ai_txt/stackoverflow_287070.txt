I assume that you are talking about companies purchasing and deploying web applications within their organizations. If you are talking about just using external applications, I don't think they notice or care. I think this is very subjective, but from my past experience, companies tend to go with the technologies they already have installed and running. They tend to do this for several reasons. The new application will require fewer changes to existing infrastructure (for example, getting PHP running on IIS) Interop with existing applications is probably going to be easier They probably already have expertise in-house to support whatever language/server/db, etc that they are currently running. Their IT people may have already formed prejudices towards the other languages/OS/db Every time I have gone out to evaluate web applications in the past, I have limited my search to the technologies we were already using.
