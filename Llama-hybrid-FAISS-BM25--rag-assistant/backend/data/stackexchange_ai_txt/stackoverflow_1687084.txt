SQL Agent Job - Connection may not be configured correctly or you may not have the right permissions on this connection?

I'm getting this error when running an SSIS package through SQL Agent Failed to acquire connection "ORACLE ADO.NET". Connection may not be configured correctly or you may not have the right permissions on this connection. When I log on as the SQL Agent User and run the ssis package directly it is fine. When I then execute it through the SQL agent job, it fails. I've read around extensively on this topic, and it seems a lot of the advise concerns how you are logged in, configuring of proxy accounts, etc, etc, etc, none of which has been helpful. I am logging onto an Oracle database with an ADO.NET conncetion. The connection string is as follows (datasource, userid and password have been changed): Data Source=DATASOURCE;User ID=userid;Password=password;Persist Security Info=True;Unicode=True; I'm loading this from a registry setting using package configuration. To check that I am getting the correct string, I am writing it into a temporary log table. I am definately getting the string I need from the correct registry setting. I've tested the oracle login credentials though PL/SQL developer, and it lets me login just fine. As far as I can tell, as I'm using an explicit user name and password for the Oracle connection it just shouldn't matter who the SSIs pacakge is run as. The only point of failure that Ican see would be the reading of the information from the registry, but that seems fine. I'm really quite baffled, I must confess, and would appreciate any help some of the splendid experts here can offer. Many thanks, James
