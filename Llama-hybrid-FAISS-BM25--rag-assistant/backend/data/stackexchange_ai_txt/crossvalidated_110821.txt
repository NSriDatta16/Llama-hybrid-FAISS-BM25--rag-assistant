SVMs and solution

In SVMs, is the solution to the minimization problem $$\textbf{w} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i x_i y_i $$ and once we know $\textbf{w}$ we can get $\textbf{b}$? In plain English can somebody please describe the solution above? Basically the hyperplane that separates the data with the maximum margin is a linear combination of the training data? The quantity $\textbf{b}$ is the distance from the decision boundary to the closest training example? I have not been able to find a simple explanation of the solution above in the books and notes I have looked at.
