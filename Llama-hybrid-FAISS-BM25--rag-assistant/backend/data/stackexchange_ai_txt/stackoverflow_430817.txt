It makes more sense to think of the list of numbers as the resource. Suppose each list's resource URL is /list/{id} where {id} is a placeholder for the list's ID. Then: POST /list creates a new list, the server generates a list ID (or 'hash') and specifies the /list/{id} URL in the response's Location header. POST /list/{id} adds a number to the list GET /list/{id}/average returns the average DELETE /list/{id} deletes the list. An alternative to GET /list/{id}/average would be for GET /list/{id} to return the list as structured data, e.g. XML, that includes the average as a generated property.
