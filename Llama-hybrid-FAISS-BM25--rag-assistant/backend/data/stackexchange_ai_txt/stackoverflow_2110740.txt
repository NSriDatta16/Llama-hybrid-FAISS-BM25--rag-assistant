To my mind the model is too simplistic but it depends on the complexity of the agencies / setup. 'Agent Joe' could leave the agency and start employment at another, but ongoing-commission from his previous agency must still be linked to him. He is a member of 1 and only 1 agency at a given point in time (obeying your rule), but the database might need to be historically accurate to handle commissions that pay over time. As they replaced 'Joe' with 'Bill' the percentages of all the agents against that agency would then exceed 100% again unless the date was considered. I would also not rule out that as an agency got larger, they were permitted far more combinations, so that 10 sales people did not automatically get a percentage on every policy, but they indicate who sold the product and what the respective commissions are. In terms of your specific design, Agent.AgencyID can be nullabe, but the commission split requires both Agent and AgencyID, so unless you consider the lack of commission split record = 100% then it is going to cause you problems.
