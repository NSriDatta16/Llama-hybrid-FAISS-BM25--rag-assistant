Unless you're doing greenfield development using TDD, you are unlikely to get (or want) 100% test coverage. Code coverage is more of a guideline, something to ask "what haven't I tested?" You may want to look at other metrics, such as cyclomatic complexity . Find the complex areas of your code and test those (then refactor to simplify).
