Silverlight 4 & SQLite

I've been doing some research on finding an embedded database to be used with Silverlight/isolated storage. Everyone says SQLite will not work with Silverlight due to unmanaged code. From my experience there is just a dll named System.Data.SQLite.DLL which I believe I either got from installed SQLite.NET or from the NHibernate build. When configuring in c# code you can use a file based database and just specify a file to use. So my question is where is the unmanaged code? And why wouldn't using file based database and writing it to isolated storage work? And now that Silverlight 4 supports OOB does that have any impact on this? Answers appreciated ahead of time. Regards
