What's the need to use Upcasting in java?

I've gone through most of the papers in the net, but I'm still not able to understand, why we have to use upcasting. class Animal { public void callme() { System.out.println("In callme of Animal"); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void callme() { System.out.println("In callme of Dog"); } public void callme2() { System.out.println("In callme2 of Dog"); } } public class UseAnimlas { public static void main (String [] args) { Dog d = new Dog(); Animal a = (Animal)d; d.callme(); a.callme(); ((Dog) a).callme2(); } } You can consider this example for upcasting. What's the use of upcasting here? Both d and a giving the same output!
