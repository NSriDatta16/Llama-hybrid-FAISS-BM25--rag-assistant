Is it possible to design a deep CNN model on a small size image dataset

I have started a project of classifying a dataset using deep learning. I have tried transfer learning on pretrained models. Now, I want to design a CNN model which can do this work of classification but everywhere it says it needs large data. My question is: Is it possible to design a deep CNN model on an image dataset of size less than 1000 images?
