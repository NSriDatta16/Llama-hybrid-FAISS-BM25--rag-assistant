I've taken the liberty of submitting a second answer, because my original answer referred to an online app that people could play with to get insight. The answer here is more a geometric argument. The following diagram illuminates, I hope, what is going on. Much of this was inspired by @Federico Ramponi's observation that the largest triangle is characterized by the tangent at each vertex being parallel to the opposite side. (source: brainjam.ca ) The picture was produced using a trial version of the excellent desktop program Geometry Expressions . The diagram shows the three circles centered at points A , E , and C . They have equal radii, but the picture doesn't really depend on the radii being equal, so the solution generalizes to circles of different radii. The lines MN , NO , and OM are tangent to the circles, and touch the circles at the points I , H , and G respectively. The latter points form the inner triangle IHG which is the triangle whose size we want to maximize. There is also an exterior triangle MNO which is homethetic to the interior triangle, meaning that its sides are parallel to that of IHG . @Federico observed that IHG has maximal area because moving any of its vertices along the corresponding circle will result an a triangle that has the same base but less height, therefore less area. To put it in slightly more technical terms, if the triangle is parameterized by angles t1 , t2 , t3 on the three circles (as pointed out by @Charles Stewart, and as used in my steepest descent canvas app), then the gradient of the area w.r.t to (t1,t2,t3) is (0,0,0) , and the area is extremal (maximal in the diagram). So how is this diagram computed? I'll admit in advance that I don't quite have the full story, but here's a start. Given the three circles, select a point M . Draw tangents to the circles centered at E and C , and designate the tangent points as G and I . Draw a tangent OHN to the circle centered at A that is parallel to GI . These are fairly straightforward operations both algebraically and geometrically. But we aren't finished. So far we only have the condition that OHN is parallel to GI . We have no guarantee that MGO is parallel to IH or that MIN is parallel to GH . So we have to go back and refine M . In an interactive geometry program it's no big deal to set this up and then move M until the latter parallel conditions are met (by eyeballs, anyways). Geometry Expressions created the diagram, but I used a bit of a cheat to get it to do so, because its constraint solver was apparently not powerful enough to do the job. The algebraic expressions for G , I , and H are reasonably straightforward, so it should be possible to solve for M based on the fact that MIHG is a parallelogram, either explicitly or numerically. I should point out that in general if you follow the construction starting from M , you have two choices of tangent for each circle, and therefore eight possible solutions. As in the other attempted answers to the question, unless you have a good heuristic to help you choose in advance which of the tangents to compute, you should probably compute all eight possible triangles and find the one with maximum area. The other seven will be extremal in the sense of being minimal area or saddle points. That's it. This answer is not quite complete in that it leaves the final computation of M somewhat open ended. But it's reduced to either a 2D search space or the solution of an ornery but not humongous equation. Finally, I have to disagree with @Federico's conclusion that this confirms that the solution proposed by the OP is optimal. It's true that if you draw perpendiculars from the circle centers to the opposite edge of the inner triangle, those perpendiculars intersect the circle to give you the triangle vertex. E.g. H lies on the line through A perpendicular to GI ), but this is not the same as in the original proposed solution (which was to take the line through A and perpendicular to EC - in general EC is not parallel to GI ).
