Traditionally, with screening tests for a disease one seeks an ROC curve that bends up near the upper-left corner, such as "A." Also, a curve that dips below the 45-degree line (separating upper-left from lower right) is not favored. False alarms for diseases and bomb threats are expensive (extra expensive 'gold standard' testing required, inconvenience discourages participation). However, ebola is hardly a typical disease. If there are too many false alarms at an airport the method falls out of use because of the excessive disruption. "Better safe than sorry" is hard to argue against until you face the consequences of it. Depending on user's personality and needs, "B" might be OK for an iPhone. Maybe lots of false alarms are tolerated because of the advantage of correct IDs which may be reminders ("Oh yeah, Sven Rasmusson, the prospective Swedish client from the happy hour last month.") , vs. false alarms that could be instantly dismissed as "Somebody I never heard of." IMHO you are being asked a mainly-philosophical question rather than a mathematical one, which may not be totally appropriate for such an exam. Might be OK if there is a suitable philosophical discussion in the course that gives clues to the author's opinion. For an exam question, the author's opinion is the only thing that matters. Anyhow, it seems your main question was how to understand the curve. Maybe this answer will help with that. Maybe other Answers will be more helpful with the philosophical issues--towards a 'correct' answer to the exam question.
