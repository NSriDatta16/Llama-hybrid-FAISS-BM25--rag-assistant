Prediction/Forecastig of one variable with relation of multiple features

My dataset is composed of time series (40 points) with multiple variables A B C D ... Target Release Date 2022-06-01 0.008 15490 69600 16950 ... 1.044659 2022-05-01 0.007 14500 78920 19874 ... 1.035948 ... My goal is to forecast the target value with the relation of all the features combined. I tried to predict the last column with a simple linear regression, but I got a fluctuating score with each run. Is it more correct to treat this problem as a Multivariate Time Series / Temporal Convolutional Neural Network?
