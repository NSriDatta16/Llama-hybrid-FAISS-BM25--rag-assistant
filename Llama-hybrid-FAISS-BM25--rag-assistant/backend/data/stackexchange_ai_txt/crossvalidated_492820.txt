I also face this problem with my data. I am a biomedical scientist and my data are rarely normally distributed. However, I have had successful classification using DA as you describe, some times over 90% RCC. I don't know if I have the best answers for your questions, but I can tell you that Box's M is not robust with non-normal data. Use non-parametric Levene's test instead. Another option is to use multinomial (binary when you only have two groups) logistic regression, which is not sensitive to deviations from normal distribution as is the case for DA. Comparing results from discriminant analysis and logistic regression may add credibility to your conclusions whenever the take-home is the same from both techniques. I would not describe the analysis as worthless just because of Box's M or lack of normality. After all, RCC is often used to evaluate the performance of techniques such as DA and logistic regression; if you're getting high RCC with large enough sample sizes, I would be believe the results. Hope this helps.
