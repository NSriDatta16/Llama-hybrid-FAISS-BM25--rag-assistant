From the documentation : If a field has blank=True , validation on Djangoâ€™s admin site will allow entry of an empty value. And from the null documentation : Note that empty string values will always get stored as empty strings, not as NULL . Only use null=True for non-string fields such as integers, booleans and dates. For both types of fields , you will also need to set blank=True if you wish to permit empty values in forms , as the null parameter only affects database storage (see blank). So blank=True basically affects only the forms . It allows to have empty form fields. But you also have to set null=True for non- string fields if you really want to allow empty values in the database as "no value" or "empty" means NULL in the database for non-string fields (for string fields, an empty value is just the empty string '' which is different from NULL ).
