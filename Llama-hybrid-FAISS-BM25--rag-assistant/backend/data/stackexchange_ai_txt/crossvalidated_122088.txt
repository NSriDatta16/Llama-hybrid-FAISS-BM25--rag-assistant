I don't think you'll get much advice on python code. I haven't seen much on this site. Random sampling is almost always the correct approach. (If you have clustering or events recorded over time or at different locations - then other sampling techniques may have added benefit. The issue of split sample has been addressed here a few times. Sample entries: Splitting the dataset into Testing,Cross Validation and Training Set Logistic regression performs better on validation data Generally -70/30 split commonly done. More traditional than anything. (though would be great if someone had a reference for this) -Often sample size is inadequate to justify 70/30 split (see logistic regression... above).
