Should HTML be encoded before being persisted?

Should HTML be encoded before being stored in say, a database? Or is it normal practice to encode on its way out to the browser? Should all my text based field lengths be quadrupled in the database to allow for extra storage? Looking for best practice rather than a solid yes or no :-)
