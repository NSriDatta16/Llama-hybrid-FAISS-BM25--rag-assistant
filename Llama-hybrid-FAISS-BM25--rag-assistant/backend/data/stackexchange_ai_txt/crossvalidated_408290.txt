Condensing values of categorical data

Beginner ML question here. I have a dataframe with a categorical column, a lot of the values are slightly different but essentially mean the same thing. Here's an example of such values: Wireless Connection Wireless Connection Wi-Fi Wireless Connection Issue 3g Wireless Connection Issue Wi-Fi Wireless/Connectivity What would be the best way to condense/encode these values? Intuitively my thinking is to just find all instances of the values and convert them to single unique value like, Wireless Connection . For what it's worth, I'll be feeding the encoding of these values into some classifier, like a Decision Tree or Logistic Regression to predict if a customer's question in a call to customer service was answered.
