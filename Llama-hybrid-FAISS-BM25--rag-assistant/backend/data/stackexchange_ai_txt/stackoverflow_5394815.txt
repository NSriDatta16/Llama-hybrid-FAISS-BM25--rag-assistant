I assume you'll be building on the Windows platform? If so, you'll probably want to look into winpcap: http://www.winpcap.org/ On Unix/Linux, you'll want to make use of libpcap: http://www.tcpdump.org/ In either of these, you'll need to develop in C/C++ or use a native interface to call the libraries from your language of choice. EDIT: Found a .NET wrapper for WinPcap that you'll likely want to make use of: http://pcapdotnet.codeplex.com/
