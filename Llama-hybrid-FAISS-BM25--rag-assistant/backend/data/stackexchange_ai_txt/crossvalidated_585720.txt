The Kaplan-Meier method is a popular way to estimate survival over time for a group of individuals when some survival times might be censored. It doesn't provide a test per se . The log-rank test is one of several related ways to test whether there is are survival differences between two or more groups of individuals. These tests are based on differences between the observed numbers of events at event times and the number expected if, at each event time, all groups had the same hazard. The tests differ in the weight placed on different times; the log-rank test weights all times equally. See this answer for some details on the log-rank version. The derivation by Klein and Moeschberger in Section 7.3 is based on a different survival estimator, the Nelson-Aalen estimator . The log-rank test is nevertheless a typical default for evaluating differences among survival curves however they are estimated. You might be recalling that the log-rank test is equivalent to the score test for differences between groups in a Cox proportional hazards model. As the log-rank test is limited to mutually exclusive categories, doesn't allow for covariate adjustment, and doesn't extend to Bayesian analysis, Frank Harrell says that "we no longer need to be using or teaching the log-rank test."
