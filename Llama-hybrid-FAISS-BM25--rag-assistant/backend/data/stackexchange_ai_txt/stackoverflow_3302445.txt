Re: Expander control in silverlight 4

I have installed the latest silverlight toolkit and dragged the expander control onto my design, there is some kind of an error going around with the name spaces, and my intellisense stopped to work after I added the control, following is the xmlns that is added to the application when I dragged the control onto the xaml editor: xmlns:toolkit="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation/toolkit" Can anyone please identify why would this happen? Thanks
