Correct level setting of factor outcome for training a dataset with train function of caret R package

i would like to ask a specific question about machine learning implementation procedures in R, and especially about caret R package and randomForests: if i want to use the function train from the caret package regarding a binary outcome of a categorical variable, then i have to set the level of the factor i want to predict as the first level ? i.e if "cancer" is the status i want to predict from a categorical variable "Disease"(control and cancer the levels), i have to set it as the first level ? Moreover, this also is the case instead for using the function randomForests ? Or for the second function it is irelevant and it is not important ? Please excuse me for my naive questions, but im new in machine learning !! Thank you, Efstathios
