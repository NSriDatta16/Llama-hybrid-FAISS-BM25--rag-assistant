Is this ok to average p values?

I have seen other posts about averaging p values. I believe I have a special case where average may apply. Finding the exact probability distribution of my data is an NP hard task, so I am using a non deterministic algorithm to estimate my p value. The algorithm was published and validated on experimental data. Because it is non deterministic, I have repeated the same test 1000 times. In this case I think it would make sense to report the mean p value along with the standard deviation. In most cases standard deviation is For combining p values, I would use Fisher's method, but the 1000 tests are not independent. They are just non deterministic iterations of the same test. This is why I want to use mean p. Reporting mean and standard deviation would be a more descriptive estimate of the p value rather than running the algorithm just one time. Searching through the literature, I found a few things that appear to contradict the idea that a p value cannot be averaged: Using harmonic mean p value for dependent tests https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347718/ different ways of combining p values via averaging https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347718/
