MCMC algorithm -- understanding some paremeters

I am trying to understand an MCMC program. I manage to run it, but I am trying to understand the meaning of the some parameters in the analysis. The code is something like this #Nsamples nsamp = 50000 #Burn-in skip = 300 #temperature at which to sample temp = 2 #Gelman-Rubin for convergence GRstop = 0.01 #every number of steps check the GR-criteria checkGR = 500 #1 if single cpu , otherwise is giving by the nproc-> mpi -np # chainno = 0 This is for the metropolis-hastings algorithm. How my results depend on these parameters or what these parameters mean ? I understood the nsamp and skip , I also kind of know what GRstop and checkGR means but I have no idea what temp and chainno means. How does changing these parameters can effect the analysis ?
