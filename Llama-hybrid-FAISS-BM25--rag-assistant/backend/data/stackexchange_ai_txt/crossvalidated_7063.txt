Yes. It is certainly possible that this is due to something like Simpson's paradox. If the data looked like $$\begin{array}{rrrrrr} \textit{Organ}&\textit{Outcome}&A&B&C&D\\ \textrm{Lung}&\textrm{Bad}&371&2727&2374&418\\ \textrm{Lung}&\textrm{Good}&556&3199&2740&558\\ \textrm{Heart}&\textrm{Bad}&214&245&195&273\\ \textrm{Heart}&\textrm{Good}&8859&3828&4691&8752\\ \end{array}$$ then I think you would get something like your hazard ratios (if that means ratios of bad outcomes/totals fractions). Many other patterns of numbers would too. If you are reviewing the article, it seems reasonable to ask for the underlying numbers to be presented. If they look anything like mine, then it does seem a little strange to add Lung and Heart numbers without a good reason.
