Easiest thing for 'plug and play' is to use Meta's Prophet since it fits for these trend changepoints. An example output of the trend from the example in the link: Then just look at the change in the gradients for the trend component in the output dataframe. There are definitely better methods that perform better on benchmarks but it will get you started. If it irregularly sampled just pretend that it is and disable seasonality and reindex your time series to appear regular. Basically it will just be a trend changepoint algo at that point. Alternatively you could try wild binary segmentation which involves exhaustively segmenting your data into 2 pieces and fitting a trend line to each then choosing the point where segmenting your data minimizes some criterion like mse, then repeating that process fitting on the residuals until a global criterion is minimized like AIC/AICC. If using python this is essentially what a package I wrote up uses if you use a 'linear' trend estimator with 'local' fit type: ThymeBoost .
