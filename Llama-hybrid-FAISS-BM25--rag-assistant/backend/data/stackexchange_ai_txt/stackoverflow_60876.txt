I'd suspect a leak before suspecting fragmentation. For the memory-intensive data structures, you could switch over to a re-usable storage pool mechanism. You might also be able to allocate more stuff on the stack as opposed to the heap, but in practical terms that won't make a huge difference I think. I'd fire up a tool like valgrind or do some intensive logging to look for resources not being released.
