I suspect the compiler doesn't know how much space it will need to allocate for s[], should you choose to declare an automatic variable with it. I concur with what Ben said, declare your struct struct my_struct { int n; char s[1]; }; Also, to clarify his comment about storage, declaring char *s won't put the struct on the stack (since it is dynamically allocated) and allocate s in the heap, what it will do is interpret the first sizeof(char *) bytes of your array as a pointer, so you won't be operating on the data you think you are, and probably will be fatal. It is vital to remember that although the operations on pointers and arrays may be implemented the same way, they are not the same thing.
