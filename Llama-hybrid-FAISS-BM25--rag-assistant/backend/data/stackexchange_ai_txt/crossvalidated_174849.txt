What is the best econometrics textbook focusing on time series analysis?

Looking for some good econometrics textbook on time series. Something on graduate/postgraduate level and would include both theory and application. Any suggestions? (I already checked the Books for self-studying time series analysis? thread, but I need exactly the opposite, not book for beginners, but something that is very up to date, especially something that focuses on unit roots or hysteresis)
