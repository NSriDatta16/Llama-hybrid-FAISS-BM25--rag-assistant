Reducing wiimote pitch/roll variations

I want to use the wiimote to control a cursor WITHOUT the infrared sensor bar. I'm using the pitch and roll values for this. The problem is that when the pitch is close to 0 degrees, the roll is very unstable, and when the pitch is close to 90 degrees, it is itself very unstable, but the roll is fine. Im polling the wiimote very frequently, so im averaging the last 20 values for both pitch and roll, and I can get the cursor to go where I want. The only problem is that there is still alot of uncontrolable shaking. Any ideas on how I can reduce it? (Or even get a more precise position without the IR sensorbar?) Thanks! Dave
