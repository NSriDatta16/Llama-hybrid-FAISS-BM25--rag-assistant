Binary numbers instead of one hot vectors

While doing logistic regression, it is common practice to use one-hot vectors as desired result. So, no of classes = no of nodes in output layer . We don't use index of word in vocabulary because that may falsely indicate closeness of two classes. But why can't we use binary numbers instead of one-hot vectors? i.e if there are 4 classes, we can represent each class as 00,01,10,11 resulting in log(no of classes) nodes in output layer.
