The most intuitive explanation I know for SD is the average magnitude of error . However, this explanation applies for MAD as well, and this is perfectly fine. But why? The bounty definition states There must be a simple and intuitive answer that distinguishes the standard deviation from the mean absolute error Must? No. The difference between RMSE/SD and MAD/MAE is the difference between $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ metrics, which isn't intuitive to begin with (at least not for the dummy person in the crowd). It is very similar to the mean/median/mode centroid argument. Each of them has its own properties and use cases where it's preferable. However, let's toy around a bit. Consider the island of Manhattan with its infamous grid structure. You have your hotel room at point $(x_0,y_0)$ and various points of interest at points $(x_1,y_1),...,(x_n,y_n)$ . Just for convenience, assume that $\bar x_n=x_0,\bar y_n=y_0$ - the hotel location is right at the center. The $\ell^2$ (Euclidean) distance between a single point of interest and your hotel room is the aerial distance - that is, how long would be flying there using a chopper (or even better, a jetpack! We've been waiting for waaaaaaay too long for them. If we can afford a room at the center of Manhattan, we can afford this too). So, the SD is the average flying distance. When it rains, we rather take a cab than fly (nobody's got time for pneumonia, right?). Cabs, however, cannot fly. They have to navigate in the grid, which is longer than flying. Not only the driver's hearing loud radio, smoking and overcharging - this drive is longer than flying because we don't go directly from point to point but rather move in the grid. Winter sucks. Point is, MAD would be the average distance when using a cab. Sounds familiar? that's because the $\ell^1$ distance is well known as Manhattan distance / Taxicab geometry . Now, with these two distances at hand (and hopefully a jetpack on our back), we can tell the difference. Moreover, we can see that for the Manhattan example (or any other 2D case), we measure the $\ell^2$ distance simply using a ruler, while the $\ell^1$ distance is harder to measure. This is why SD is also easier to understand and is more intuitive for people than the MAD.
