The paragraph that was quoted has been echoed among the answers as well: the "left-click" might or might not come from the button on the left - and the "right-click" might or might not come from the button on the right. A pet peeve of mine is the talk of a "third button" - which almost always is in the middle. The sequence is not 1-3-2 but 1-2-3. Perhaps that third button should be a color too....
