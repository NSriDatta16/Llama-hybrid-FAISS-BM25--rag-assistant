How to optimize a regression model without coefficients?

About myself, I’m very new to machine learning, so I apologize if this question appears incorrect. I have done thorough amount of research into the different (more basic) types of machine learning algorithms, but I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direct (or at least let me know if I’m looking in the right field). I’m trying to optimize a regression model without coefficients (or the least amount of coefficients). Rather, what I am trying to do, is build a regression model that optimizes the way the independent variables are used in the model (i.e uses the fractions of different independent variables, takes the sine of a variable, etc.). The overall goal is to build an accurate model with the least (or no) use of coefficients. Is there anything out there that does this sort of thing? Any and all feedback is extremely appreciated!
