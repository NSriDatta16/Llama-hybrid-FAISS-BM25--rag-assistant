APIs for accessing Intel TXT (trusted execution mode) or AMD SVM?

Do any current operating systems (windows, linux, BSD) provide drivers that enable user-mode programs to execute partly in the trusted execution mode (isolated from everything else running on the computer)? If so, where can the documentation be found?
