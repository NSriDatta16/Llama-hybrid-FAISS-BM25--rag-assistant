java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl while starting the weblogic

As part of our application we are using apache's xerces jaxp parser. When we deploy the application on weblogic 9.2, we are getting the following error. org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'org.apache.cxf.wsdl.WSDLManager' defined in class path resource [META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml]: Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Could not instantiate bean class [org.apache.cxf.wsdl11.WSDLManagerImpl]: Constructor threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl As per our analysis, weblogic is trying to to load its own DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl which is present in weblogic.jar instead of apache's xerces. We tried the following to force the weblogic to load DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl from xerces i) we have added the following tag into weblogic.xml true ii) we have put latest versions of xalan in jre/lib/endorced folder. this didn't resolve our problem. ii) we have added entries in weblogic-application.xml webapp.encoding.default UTF-8 javax.jws.* org.apache.xerces.* org.apache.xerces.jaxp.* ii)Added the following entry in weblogic-application.xml org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl iii) Added jaxp.properties to load DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl from xerces to the jre/lib and started the server.In this case, the weblogic didnt start. iv) Then we started the server first and then copied the jaxp.properties file during the run time when server starts.But no success None of the above worked for us. Any help is highly appreciated.
