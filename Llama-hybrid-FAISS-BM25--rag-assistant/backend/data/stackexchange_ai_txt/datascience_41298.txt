What algorithms are good to predict next numbers?

Let's consider we have several hundreds of numbers like ( 1, 2, 5, 8, 7, 15, 19, 8, 4, 6, ...) those are closed numbers of a stock on consecutive days for example. I like to know what algorithms are good to predict next numbers? Is it possible to find a relationship between this sequence of numbers or we need extra input data to make a prediction? I am completely new on this and seeking some ideas and guidance for a new comer in data science field(although I have some experience in machine learning and image and voice recognition).
