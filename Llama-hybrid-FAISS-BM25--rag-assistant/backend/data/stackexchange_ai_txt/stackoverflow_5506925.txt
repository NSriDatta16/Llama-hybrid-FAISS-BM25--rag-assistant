Does the sql in the dump insert multiple rows? Does the dump use multiple row inserts? (Or maybe you can pre-process it to?) This guy covers a lot of the basics, for example: Disabling indexes which makes import many times faster. Disable MySQL indexes, so before import run: ALTER TABLE `table_name` DISABLE KEYS; then after import change it back: ALTER TABLE `table_name` DISABLE KEYS; When using MyISAM table type, use MySQL's INSERT DELAYED command instead, so it encourage MySQL to write the data to the disk when the database is idle. For InnoDB tables, use these extra commands to avoid a great deal of disk access: SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0; SET UNIQUE_CHECKS = 0; SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0; and these at the end: SET UNIQUE_CHECKS = 1; SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1; COMMIT;
