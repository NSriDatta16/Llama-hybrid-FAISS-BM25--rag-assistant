How to input data to LSTM?

I have a labelled dataset ( 0 and 1 ) with two types of short length time series data (from day1-day5) as follows. Type1 (Temperature at location1): sensor1, 38, 38, 35, 33, 32 sensor2, 33, 32, 35, 36, 32 and so on .... Type2 (Temperature at location2): sensor1, 18, 18, 12, 11, 09 sensor2, 13, 12, 15, 16, 12 and so on .... In summary my dataset looks as follows. ID, time-series1, time-series2, label sensor1, [38, 38, 35, 33, 32], [18, 18, 12, 11, 09], 0 sensor2, [33, 32, 35, 36, 32], [13, 12, 15, 16, 12], 1 and so on .... I would like to use my dataset in LSTM (or a equivalent deep learning model). However, I am still not clear how I can use my dataset in a deep learning model such as LSTM. I am happy to provide more details if needed.
