According to a US Government-owned(!) document describing the design of Ada: Rationale for the Design of the Ada® Programming Language : A pragma (from the Greek word meaning action) is used to direct the actions of the compiler in particular ways, but has no effect on the semantics of a program (in general). I like the (last caveat) there... This cross references well with on-line greek dictionaries (e.g. as quoted by Martin York ) that say pragma ( πράγμα , as commented on the original question by asveikau) means : that which has been done, a deed, an accomplished fact what is done or being accomplished spec. business, a commercial transaction a matter, question, affair spec. in a forensic sense, a matter at law, case, suit that which is or exists, a thing Seems the key to understanding is the word action rather than information .
