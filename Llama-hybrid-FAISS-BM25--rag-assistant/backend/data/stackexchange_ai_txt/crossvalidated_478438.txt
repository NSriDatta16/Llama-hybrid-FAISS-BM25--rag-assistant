Certain time series methods, like ESM deal fine with trends. Others, like ARIMA don't. So in some cases the method requires you to remove it and sometimes not. I think you should focus more on why you would want to remove it or not assuming your method allows you to have it. Sometimes you want to separate out seasonality, trends etc so you can see them.
