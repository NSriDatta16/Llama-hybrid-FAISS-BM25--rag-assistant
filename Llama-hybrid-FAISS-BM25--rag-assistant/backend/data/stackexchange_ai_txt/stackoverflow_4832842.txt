How do I programmatically abort a jQuery drag operation?

How do I programmatically abort a jQuery drag operation? Using jQuery UI, the user begins a drag operation. While dragging, an asynchronous event occurs that causes the dragged element to be deleted (a timer-based refresh, for example). In the refresh, I would like to do something like this before the refresh to avoid errors from the deleted element : element.trigger('dragstop'); But that didn't seem to work.
