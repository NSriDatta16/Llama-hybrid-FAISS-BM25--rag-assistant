You can make number "private", but then you need a getter : function Peon(number) { var number = number; // increment this.inc = function() { number++; }; // a simple getter this.getNumber = function() { return number; } } var p = new Peon(10); function returnNumber() { p.inc(); alert(p.getNumber()); } You should read Douglas Crockfords "The Good Parts" for more information on how to use this pattern, there's (limited) a preview available at Google Books . Also you don't need to return something from the constructor, your return true is superfluous.
