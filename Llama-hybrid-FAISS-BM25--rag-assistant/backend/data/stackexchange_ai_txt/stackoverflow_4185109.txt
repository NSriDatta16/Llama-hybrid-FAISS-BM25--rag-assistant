What would be the preferred method of creating an online photo album?

I have at my disposal PHP, MySQL and a Linux server. The site I'm creating for a client should have a back-end manageable photo gallery. I am planning to create it fully in MySQL, meaning I would have a table containing a mediumblob that would contain the binary data of the picture. This would allow me to have everything at one spot, not having to rely on the chance that the client wouldn't accidentally remove an image from the gallery directory without updating the database and so forth. The alternative, of course, would be to have the images independent of the MySQL database, and only save the image paths. What I'm posting a question here for is to ask you experts if there are any potholes in this method I'm not seeing. I have never tried this method of creating a gallery before. For instance, is it considered bad practice retrieving large amounts of data from MySQL when file-system storage is possible? What are your thoughts? (I will mark correct the reply that erases all doubt about this case from my mind)
