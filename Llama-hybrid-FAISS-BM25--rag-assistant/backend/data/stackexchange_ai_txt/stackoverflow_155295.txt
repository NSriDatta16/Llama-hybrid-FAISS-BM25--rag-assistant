It's generics - it's a form of type parameterisation. In your example, it's making l refer to a list of strings - the list will only ever contain strings: the compiler treats it (pretty much) as if everywhere that the API docs mention "T" it actually says "string". So, you can only add strings to it, and if you use the indexer you don't need to cast to string, etc. To be honest, giving generics detailed coverage on an online forum is pretty much impossible. (In C# in Depth, I take nearly 50 pages talking about generics.) However, armed with the name of the feature, you should be in a much better position to find out more. The MSDN "Introduction to C# Generics" is probably a good starting point. Asking specific questions about generics on SO is likely to yield good results - I just don't think it can really be covered properly in one question/answer.
