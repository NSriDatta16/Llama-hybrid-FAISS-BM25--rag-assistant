Creating a map between N images and N labels using CNN

I have seen classification CNNs that train with numerous images for a subset of labels (i.e. Number of images >> Number of labels), however, is it still possible to use CNNs when the number of images = Number of labels? specifically consider: having N settings that you can control to generate a unique image. Is it possible to make a CNN that can describe the mapping? (Is CNN the right architecture to use?)
