Get offset of node in whole html document in Javascript?

I'm looking for a way to get the offset relative to the whole document for a given node with Javascript. Eg.: Title First paragraph Second paragraph Then (using JQuery): $("#myTitle").getDocumentOffset() should return 47 because the h1 with id myTitle starts at offset 47 in characters relative to the whole document. Any idea how to accomplish this? Thanks in advance.
