Attaching swf elements by ObjectID

I have swf file with some graphics I need to use in my haxe(future compiled to swf too) program. There is no problem with embedding pictures by swfmill, so i tried to disassemble the swf with swfmill and found some entries like DefineSprite and DefineShape which have objectID's. Is it possible to attach these elements from haxe using the swf file as a library?
