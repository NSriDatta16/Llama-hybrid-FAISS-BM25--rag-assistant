Endogeneity may arise from various reasons: omitted variable (you forget important controls in your model), measurement error (your data are poor measures of the true variable you're willing to capture), and simultaneity. In your case, it is probably simultaneity. Simultaneous determination of both variables arise because observed income and consumption are equilibrium outcomes. Regression models based on time-series require assumptions with regards to the exogeneity of independent variables in a dynamic context, say $X$. Assume $Y$ is consumption. (Exogeneity) e.g. X is the weather: past, current and future weather realizations are exogenous to my consumption level $Y$, since my consumption couldn't possibly have a causal effect on sunshines. (Sequentially Exogeneity) e.g. X is (can't find a good example here?): past and current realizations of X are not caused in any way by my consumption $Y$, but future realizations may be so. If agents are not forward-looking, then income X may not depend on expected future consumption. (Endogeneity) e.g. X is income: since I could have decided yesterday to work more to increase my income X in anticipation of today's consumption $Y$ (savings to buy a new car), past and current $Y$ may cause current $X$.
