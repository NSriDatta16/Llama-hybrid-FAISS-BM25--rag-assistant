Multivariate Time Series with Long Horizon Prediction

There must be a model for what I would like to do, because I have been spending far too long with this project for an answer not to exist. For reference, I am using R. I have a time series object, $X$, with $n$ observations and $p$ columns (indicator variables). I also have a separate time series object $y$ which I would like to predict future values of, which has $n$ observations and $1$ column. I would like to feed this data into a black box, and I would like the black box to spit out $h$ predicted future values of object $y$ using learned patterns from my independent time series object X. Of course one could find a simple linear solution using regression, but this does not account for obvious autocorrelation. It also requires me to forecast dummy observations for $X$, which is undesirable . I would only like to forecast one series, not all of them. I could also use an ARIMA model, which takes care of autocorrelation but has very poor predictive ability. I looked into using bsts -type models, but these also require additional newdata when the object has a regression component. I have been looking into keras -based models as well, but thus far have not found a solid tutorial to teach me what I am looking to learn. To reiterate: Time series $X_{n \times p}$ Time series $y_{n \times 1}$ Insert $X$ and $y$ into black box Supply value $h$, the desired time steps in the future I would like to predict See $h$ predicted values of $y$ based on features the machine learned during processing. Tutorials and/or walkthrough links would be greatly appreciated, especially if they are coded in R! This question was tagged as a duplicate of this question , which I had seen earlier. However, the answer was not satisfying to me. I feel this question is better worded, more nuanced, and asks specifically for some type of starter-code or tutorial, or information on how to begin implementation. This is one of the most useful guides I have found , but in some regards it falls short (it does not explain how to accomplish far-in-the-future prediction). The theory of machine learning is interesting for all of us, but as noted in this journal entry , Considering the complexity of financial time series, combining deep learning with financial market prediction is regarded as one of the most charming topics. However, this field still remains relatively unexplored. In posing this question, I am hoping to assist other beginners with the same problem they face when attempting to incorporate time series forecasting with deep learning.
