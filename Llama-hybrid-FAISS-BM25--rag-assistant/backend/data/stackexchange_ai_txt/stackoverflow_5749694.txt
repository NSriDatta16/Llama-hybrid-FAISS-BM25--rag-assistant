What is the fastest way to detect when two timestamps produce the same local time in Python?

The UNIX timestamps 1289106000 and 1289109600 both represent 2010-11-07T01:00:00 in the US-East EST/EDT timezone, as a result of daylight savings time. I'm creating a dictionary-like object, keyed on timestamp, that needs to map any such pairs to the same value. Additionally, as much as we want to avoid premature optimization, I happen to know that this operation is performed in an extremely tight loop. Any solution must be faster than using fromtimestamp to obtain the local time for each timestamp. Is there a way to structure my object's back-end storage, or build some sort of lookup table in advance, that makes this possible?
