It depends on your goals. Almost always, the model with maximum "accuracy" is not the same as the model with the best/most convenient "interpretability". You ultimately have three options here: Build the most accurate model you can (hard to interpret) Build the most interpretable model you can (could be more accurate) Strike some balance, ie: "satisfice", between 1 and 2 (which is neither most interpretable nor the most accurate) In applications where the quality of the prediction has large consequences - I'm thinking about my work in healthcare - I prefer to build the most accurate model possible, and test it rigorously, to deliver the best outcomes to our patients. For the users who want to understand how the model works, I often pull out representative samples (one tree in a random forest) or build a simpler model to approximate the more complex one (multivariate regression with simple interpretations).
