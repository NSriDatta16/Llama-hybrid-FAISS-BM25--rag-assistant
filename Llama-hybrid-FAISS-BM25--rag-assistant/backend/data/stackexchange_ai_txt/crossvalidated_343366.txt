Variance of parameter estimators in terms of $\ n$ observations in a linear time series model

Let $\ X_t = b_1 + b_2.t + e_t$ be a linear model, where $\mathbb{E}(e_t)$ = 0, $\ var(e_t)$ = $\sigma_e^2$, and $\ cov(e_i,e_j)$ = 0 for all $\ i \neq j$. I have derived the equations for the estimated values of $\ b_1$ and $\ b_2$, respectively, $\hat{b}_1$ and $\hat{b}_2$ as: $\hat{b}_1 = \overline{x}_t - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(x_t - \overline{x}_t).t}{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(\overline{t} - t).t}.t$ $\hat{b}_2 =\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(x_t - \overline{x}_t).t}{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(\overline{t} - t).t}$ where $\overline{x}$ and $\overline{t}$ are, respectively, the mean of the $\ x_t$ and $\ t$. I have, however, to prove that: $\ var(b_1) = \frac{2(2n+1)}{n(n-1)} \sigma_e^2$ and $\ var(b_2) = \frac{12}{n(n^2-1)}\sigma_e^2$ I know that I can write $ var(b_1) = \mathbb{E}[(b_1 -\mathbb{E}(b_1)]^2= \mathbb{E}(b_1^2) - \mathbb{E}(b)^2 $. Can I say then that $\ \ var(b_1) =var(\hat{b}_1) = \mathbb{E}[(\hat{b}_1 -\mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1)]^2= \mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1^2) - \mathbb{E}(\hat{b})^2 $. Calling everything to the right of minus sign in the equation $\hat{b}_1$ as $\ m$, I thought of trying to work the algebra for $\mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1^2)$ and $\mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1)^2$ but got lost in my computation. Plus, I don't know what to do with given $\ covariance$. I have a feeling at one point - to which I haven't gotten yet - I'll have to use it. How can I start from my estimated values and reach an equation for their respective variances? Any help, hint, or direction to follow will be valuable. Tried to go down this road here - but I wonder if there's any other way that doesn't involve so much algebra; hence; less prone to error. $\mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1^2) = \mathbb{E}[(\overline{x}_t - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(x_t - \overline{x}_t).t}{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(\overline{t} - t).t}.t)^2]$ and $\mathbb{E}(\hat{b}_1)^2 = (\mathbb{E}[(\overline{x}_t - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(x_t - \overline{x}_t).t}{\sum_{t=1}^{\ n}(\overline{t} - t).t}.t)])^2$
