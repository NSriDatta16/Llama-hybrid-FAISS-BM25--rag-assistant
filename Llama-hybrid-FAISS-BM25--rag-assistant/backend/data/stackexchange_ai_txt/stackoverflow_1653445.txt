How can I prevent user-agents from presenting a download window for unrecognized mime types?

If you set the Content-Disposition header to attachment , this causes user-agents to always present a download window for that file. I would like to do this opposite of this: force user-agents to always display the response directly. In this particular case, I have an API that's sending JSON. I'd like to serve it as application/json as indicated by the specification , but since user-agents typically don't recognize the mime type, they present a download window. This makes debugging a real pain in the neck, so I'd like to work around this if I can. Suggestions?
