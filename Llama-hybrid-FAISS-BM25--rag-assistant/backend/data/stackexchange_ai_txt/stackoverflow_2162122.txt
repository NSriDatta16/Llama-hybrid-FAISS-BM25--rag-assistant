In ASP.NET (server side), how can I uniquely identify one browser window from another which are under the same cookiedbased sessionId

The users of my web application may have more than one browser window (or tab) open and pointed to the same page. We're using cookie based session id's, and the user will usually work within the same session id in both browsers/tabs. I would like to be able to uniquely identify which browser window (and tab) that requested an ASP.NET page (in order to make sure, that data stored in the session does not get mixed up). (e.g. I would be happy if the browser would generate and send a window/tab-id with the http request, as it publishes HTTP_USER_AGENT) Any ideas? --thomas
