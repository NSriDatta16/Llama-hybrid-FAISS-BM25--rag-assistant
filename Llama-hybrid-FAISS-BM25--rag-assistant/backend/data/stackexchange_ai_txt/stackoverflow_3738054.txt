Aren't you just moving the boilerplate somewhere else - from writing the IEnumerable.GetEnumerator method on each class to calling your AsEnumerable extension every time an IEnumerable is expected? Typically, I would expect an enumerable type to be used for querying far more times than it is written (which is exactly once). This would mean that this pattern will lead to more boilerplate, on average.
