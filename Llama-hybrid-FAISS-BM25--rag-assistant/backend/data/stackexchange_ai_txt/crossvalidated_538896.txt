How to calculate p-value to compare AUPRC for two models?

I've built two deep learning models and was looking for a way to compare the two models in terms of the area under the precision recall curve terms. I know that the DeLong method is recommended for ROC comparisons, and it's what I've used to compare the AUROC of the two models, but I'm not sure how to implement something similar for AUPRC comparisons. I've tried bootstrapping the metric 2000 times, but I'm not sure what type of hypothesis testing to use and don't want to violate any underlying assumptions of the test.
