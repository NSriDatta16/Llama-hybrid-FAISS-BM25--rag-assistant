Using Trainable=True in Keras Embedding obtained better performance

It is suggested by the author of Keras [1] to use Trainable=False when using the embedding layer in Keras to prevent the weights from being updated during training. But in my experience, I always got better performance (lower error in regression) when setting Trainable=True in text processing. My question, can I claim my result or I must use Trainable=False ? Do I make a cheat when using Trainable=True ? According to my understanding, it just a choice to use (or not to use) previous information to update the weight, so it is allowed to use Trainable=True .
