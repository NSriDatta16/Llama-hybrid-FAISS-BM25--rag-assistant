Can PCA be applied twice or more?

I have a very high-dimensional dataset with 27k features. I want to a reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. I want to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2 as the toolbox I am using expects 2 dimensions. But When I am trying to apply PCA in Matlab I am getting an out of memory error. Can I apply PCA twice to get down to 2 dimesions, i.e. 27k -> intermediate -> 2 dimensions ?
