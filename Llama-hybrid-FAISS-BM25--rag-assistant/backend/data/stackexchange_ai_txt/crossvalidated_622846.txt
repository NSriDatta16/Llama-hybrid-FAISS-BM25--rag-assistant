How can I test significance of 2 PCA results/PCA polygons

The story so far is that I am comparing the climate niche of wild native UK tree species, with the climate niche of commercial growers that grow that species in the UK. Using the species code 'agl' as an example, I've extracted the wild agl climate values and the commercial agl climate values for a number of points (11 climate factors, roughly a few thousand wild points and a few hundred commercial points). I've run a PCA on the wild values and then projected the commercial values onto those results. Through this I've managed to create some nice polygons showing the overlap of the commercial polygon on the wild polygon, and am able to say 'x% of the wild polygon is represented by the commercial polygon' (the commercial is always smaller). This has all been done in R no problem. What I'm having trouble with is working out what test I can do to test whether there's a significant difference between the polygons. Initially my project supervisor said that a PERMANOVA analysis would be most appropriate, but having looked into it and read a number of papers doing similar analyses I'm not 100% sure. I've also read some stuff about k-means clustering but that doesn't seem to fit my data either. I'm not very strong on maths or statistics due to dyscalculia, if PERMANOVA is the correct analysis for my data I'd really appreciate a simple explanation as to why. If another test is better I'd still love an explanation, but at least I'll have something more concrete to google and do my own research in. Extra details: The wild and commercial climate data sets are saved as two separate data frames, but it wouldn't be difficult for me to merge them and assign a 'group' column of either 'wild' or 'commercial' The PCA was done using prcomp NOT ade4 (which other similar papers I've read seem to use) and reduces dimensionality to 2 The wild and commercial PCA results are also saved separately from each other, however as the commercial was projected it looks very different (wild has 11 PC columns and 11 climate variable rows, commercial has 11 PC columns and 66 sampled points rows) I have been able to calculate the areas of the individual polygons, as well as the area of overlap and % of wild polygon overlapped, if that helps at all with choosing a test This is my polygon output with the blue representing wild and orange representing the commercial projection
