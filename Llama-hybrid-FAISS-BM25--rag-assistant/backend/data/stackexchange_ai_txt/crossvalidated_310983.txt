Creating a CNN for object detection

I want to create a convolutional neural network to identify a particular object in an image, say a guitar. I know there are a lot of posts and answers about this but I'm very new to this field and am not being able to find a simple explanation. If I have the coordinates for any guitar in an image how do I convert that to vector/tensor can someone please tell me?? Just a few steps as to what I should do next would be very helpful! Thanks!
