Maybe you should have a look on Java Code Conventions : Put declarations only at the beginning of blocks. (A block is any code surrounded by curly braces "{" and "}".) Don't wait to declare variables until their first use; it can confuse the unwary programmer and hamper code portability within the scope. This applies to methods, if/else blocks, loops, and, of course, classes. So, the convention encourages for the second approach.
