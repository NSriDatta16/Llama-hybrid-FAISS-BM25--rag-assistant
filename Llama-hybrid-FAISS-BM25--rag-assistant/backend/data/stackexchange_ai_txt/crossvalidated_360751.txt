Should I gloss over the linear algebra chapter in the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow?

Currently I am reading "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. I'm on Chapter 2 which is the Linear Algebra section where they go over the linear algebra that pertains to the book. I understand most of what is being taught but not at a deep level. And when I get to some of the latter parts of the chapter like "2.9 The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse" and specifically "2.12 Example: Principal Components Analysis", I don't really understand them that well at all. Would it be okay if I go onto Chapter 3 and beyond before I understand these concepts comfortably, or will I be fine with having basic knowledge of them and the symbols they use?
