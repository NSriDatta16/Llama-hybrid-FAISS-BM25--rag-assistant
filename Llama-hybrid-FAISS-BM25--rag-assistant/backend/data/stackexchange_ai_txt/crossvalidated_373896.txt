It looks very much like you have a case of complete separation : there is only one landform (ridge) that has seedlings, while other had no seedlings at al large estimates ( $|\hat \beta|>10$ ), and ridiculously large standard error estimates. Basically what's happening is that the baseline level ("abandoned") has an expected number of counts equal to zero for all plots, so the intercept $\beta_0$ - which is the expected log(counts) for the baseline level - should be estimated as $-\infty$ ... which messes up the Wald estimation of the uncertainty (the approximate, fast method that summary() uses). You can read more about complete separation elsewhere; it is more typically discussed in the context of logistic regression (in part because logistic regression is more widely used than count regression ...) Solutions: your square-root-link solution is reasonable (in this case the intercept is expected $\sqrt{\textrm{counts}}$ in the baseline level, which is zero rather than $-\infty$ ); it will change the assumed distribution of the random effects slightly (i.e., Normal on the square-root rather than on the log scale), but that wouldn't worry me too much. If you had continuous covariates or interactions in the model, it would also change the interpretation of the fixed effects. you could use some kind of penalization (most conveniently in a Bayesian framework), as described in my answer to the linked question (and here , search for "complete separation") to keep the parameters reasonable.
