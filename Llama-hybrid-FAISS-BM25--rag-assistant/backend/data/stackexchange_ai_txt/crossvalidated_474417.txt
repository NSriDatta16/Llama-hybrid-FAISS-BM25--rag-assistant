Suppose you are trying to predict the outcome of an election on Proposition A, which needs 60% Yes votes to pass. Let $\theta$ be the unknown proportion of the electorate in favor. Maybe you have a favorable view of the probability of success, so you choose the prior $\mathsf{Beta}(7,3),$ which implies $P(\theta > 0.6) = 0.77$ 1 - pbeta(.6, 7, 3) [1] 0.768213 You discover that early results from a public opinion poll are running only about 50-50, and you begin to have doubts about your prior distribution. There are a couple of possibilities (among many): Your prior is grossly wrong. Your prior is OK and the early returns from the poll are not yet reliable. In either case, you should just wait for the final poll results. If they show 735 in favor out of 1000, then the likelihood function is proportional to $\theta^{735}(1-\theta)^{265},$ the beta posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(742,268),$ a 95% Bayesian interval estimate for $\theta$ is $(0.71, 0.76),$ your prior doesn't look so bad in retrospect, and the proposition looks on target for success. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 742, 268) [1] 0.7070060 0.7614208 Alternatively, the final poll results may show only 520 out of 100 in favor, then the posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(527,483),$ a 95% Bayesian interval estimate for $\theta$ is $(0.49, 0.55),$ the data have overwhelmed your less-that-ideal prior, and it seems proponents of Proposition A have some work to do before election day. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 527, 483) [1] 0.4909563 0.5525263 Of course, it is possible, if ordinarily imprudent, to begin with such a strong prior that only a huge amount of data could overwhelm it. Also, if the people determining the prior distribution are truly clueless about Proposition A and its prospects, then they might admit their indecision and give a relatively noninformative prior such as $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(1,1).$ In that case the prior distribution will have almost no effect on the eventual prediction interval. Finally, if it seems for some reason that the first probability interval estimate is not adequate, then the posterior distribution might become the prior distribution for another round of Bayesian estimation based on a subsequent poll.
