Using xib file in three20 project

Sorry if this question has already been answered but I can't find an answer. Here are some steps I did in three20 project and the problem: I created a three20 class file inherited from TTViewController: TestTTViewController Next, I created a xib file (New File -> User Interface -> View XIB..): TestTTView.xib And the problem is that I can't map TestTTView.xib file with class TestTTViewController in Interface Buider (In inspector -> Class Identity, TestTTView.xib don't detected class TestTTViewController). In the three20 sample's TTNibDemo, I can see that the xib files can recognize their TTViewController class. What's wrong in my steps? I'm sorry if my description is not enough to understand. Please let me know if you need more. Thanks for your attention. Tien
