The Programmer Competency Matrix is just a set of skills, which are more likely to occur when being a real programmer than other skills, they are not a checklist to being a programmer, or for that matter, required to be a programmer; most common way to know someone is a programmer is that they're paid to be a programmer, which honestly has nothing to do with programming skills. To be a data scientist, do data science.
