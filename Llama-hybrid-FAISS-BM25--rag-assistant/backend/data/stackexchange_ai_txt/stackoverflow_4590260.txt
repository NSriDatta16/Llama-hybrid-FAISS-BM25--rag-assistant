PHP Magento Screen Scraping

I am trying to scrape a suppliers magento site in an effort to save some time because of there being around 2000 products I need to gather info for. I'm totally OK with writing a screen scraper for pretty much anything but i've encountered a major problem. Im using get_file_contentsto gather the html of the product page. The problem is: You need to be logged in, to view the product page. Its a standard magento login, so how can I get round this in my screen scraper? I don't require a full script, just advice on a method.
