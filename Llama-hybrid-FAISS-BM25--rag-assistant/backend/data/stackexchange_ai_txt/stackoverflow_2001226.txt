Like the others, I would strongly recommend using GC. The performance overhead usually is negligible! I don't need to repeat the benefits as stated by other users. However, I would strongly encourage writing libraries, as opposed to applications, to run in a non-GC mode as well. Some environments cannot run GC code, the iPhone being the notable one; so if you created an internal library for yourself, that you envision reusing it later for an iPhone app, then I would recommend designing it so it would work in a non-GC environment as well. Converting a GC code to non-GC code is much more difficult than the other way around!
