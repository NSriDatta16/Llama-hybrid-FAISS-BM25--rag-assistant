Question about the weighting factor of Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA/EMA)

Hiii, I have one question about the weighting factor of EMA. As I learned, Exponential Weighted Moving Average has a weighting factor, Lamda , and its formula is: S( t ) = Lamda * Y( t ) + ( 1-Lamda ) * S( t -1) Is there any methods to choose the lamda adaptively? Not to set the fixed la, choose the ' best lamda ' adaptively. I want to apply it to some online learning problems, and it's better to choose the best weighting factor automatically. Is there any related paper or github code? Thank you soooooo much!^^
