How do I create subplots in Mathematica using LevelScheme?

Consider the following arbitrary figure generated in MATLAB as an example. The basic idea is that I have a contour plot and I want to showcase selected slices from it in subplots on the right. Is there an equivalent of subplot in mma? The work around that I have right now is to have just the contour plot with the slices and the arrows and the two slice-plots separately and then put them together in latex. However, I'd like to be able to do this within mma. How do I go about doing this? An idea that I had is to generate a the contour plot with a full vertical & half horizontal aspect ratio, the two plots with half vertical & half horizontal aspect ratio, and then use GraphicsGrid to align them up. But this still gave me the plots as a list, not a composite figure. Is this the only way or is there a nicer, more elegant way of doing it?
