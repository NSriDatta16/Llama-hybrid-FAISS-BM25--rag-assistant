Your link tells to install OpenCV with MacPorts, which currently installs version 2.2.0. The API was changed for 2.2, so that might be the reason opencv.cv doesn't exist (also your link is written for the ancient 1.0). OpenCV changelog explains it: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/OpenCV%20Change%20Logs It isn't clear to me how up-to-date the OpenCV documentation is nowadays but I recommend looking at it: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/index.html (Python examples there begin with import cv )
