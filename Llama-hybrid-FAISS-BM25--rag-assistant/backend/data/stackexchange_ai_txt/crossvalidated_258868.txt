Bayesian inference using beta distribution

A certain researcher has a Beta(2,1) prior distribution on the success rate of a new ointment. $k$ is the probability that the ointment works successfully on a patient. If the ointment is tried independently on 4 patients and works successfully on $X$ of them, what is $P(k\leq0.25|X=2)$? What is $E(k|X=2)$? How might I solve this? I calculated $$f(x;\alpha,\beta) = \displaystyle\frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{\int_0^1 t^{\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\beta-1}dt} \mathop{=}^{\alpha=2}_{\beta=1} \displaystyle\frac{x}{\int_0^1 t dt} = \displaystyle\frac{x}{2}$$
