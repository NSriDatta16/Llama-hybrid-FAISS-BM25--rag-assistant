In my experience, the biggest reason for checking in commented out code is that developers hate typing so much that they would rather keep the unused code handy just in case they ever need to type a similar fragment of code in the future. Your case is a bit different, but I still say "use it or lose it". If the commented out solution fixes something important, then that would be a good motivation for finishing it. It's easy to spend more time explaining why something isn't quite right and "how we were never given the time to fix it" than it would take to do it. That last point is based on the assertion that developer time is non-linear, and that getting started on something that you're motivated to do delivers much more value than "X hours booked to project Y" every time. There are version control systems that are very good at creating and merging branches. Mercurial, git, etc. would all be capable of doing this. Even if you don't use one of these as your main VCS there's nothing to stop your colleague creating a local repository to keep his experiments in.
