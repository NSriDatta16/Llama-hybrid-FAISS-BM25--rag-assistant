Congrats on your career move, but please know that data science is one of the more difficult fields to enter, being a combination of statistics, programming, computer science, mathematics, etc. But, for someone motivated enough, with sharp acumen and intuitive data skills, it's a great field. A commenter recommended Andrew Ng's (pronounced 'ing' ) online course through coursera, and I also agree this is a great foundation. It is dense, but you'll need to master it if you hope to be a quality data scientist. He uses Octave, but I advise that you come up to speed quickly in R or Python. If you can translate Andy's code to either of those platforms, you'll be in good shape to start your practice.
