I was having tons of trouble with the return value, so I ended up just selecting stuff at the end. The solution was just to select the result at the end and return the query result in your functinon. In my case I was doing an exists check: IF (EXISTS (SELECT RoleName FROM dbo.Roles WHERE @RoleName = RoleName)) SELECT 1 ELSE SELECT 0 Then using (SqlConnection cnn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString)) { SqlCommand cmd = cnn.CreateCommand(); cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; cmd.CommandText = "RoleExists"; return (int) cmd.ExecuteScalar() } You should be able to do the same thing with a string value instead of an int.
