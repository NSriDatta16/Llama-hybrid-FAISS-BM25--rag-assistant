I would do something like this, assuming primary address refers to the Organization location: Table: Organization Org_Key {PK}, Org_Name, Primary Address fields, Any other fields Table: Personnel Person_Key {PK}, Org_Key {FK}, Position {Directory, secretary, etc}, Any other fields In my opinion, there is really no need to separate those who are "Directors" from those who are "secretaries" because they are both employees of a specific Organization. Now, if by primary address you mean a personal address (i.e., an individuals home address) then I would add additional fields to the Personnel table.
