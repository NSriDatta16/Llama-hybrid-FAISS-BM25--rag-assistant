Don't do the Equals in terms of the Hash function's results it's too fragile. Rather do a field value comparison for each of the fields. Something like: return x != null && y != null && x.Name.Equals(y.Name) && x.Type.Equals(y.Type) ... Also, the hash functions results aren't really amenable to addition. Try using the ^ operator instead. return obj.Name.GetHashCode() ^ obj.Type.GetHashCode() ... You don't need the null check in GetHashCode. If that value is null, you've got bigger problems, no use trying to recover from something over which you have no control...
