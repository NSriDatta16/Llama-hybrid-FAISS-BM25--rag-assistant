I am also not aware of any papers that 'prove' that ML, in general, works. Many techniques are based on optimization, distance measures, that really do not have any probability counterparts. I am also very suspect of some algorithms that output probabilities, unless they are based on statistical distributions. But as was implied by some of the other answers, I think that for some techniques, simulation might be the right way to go. Decision trees at least have some statistical basis in the chi square distribution. e.g and I think the development of Random Forest was an attempt to simulate some probabilities, although probabilities in ML are often internal to the algorithm and don't really generalize to what we usually think of as a statistical prediction probability
