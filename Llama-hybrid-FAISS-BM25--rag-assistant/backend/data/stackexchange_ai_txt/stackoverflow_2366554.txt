I believe I have found the answer. From a Microsoft white paper about removable storage devices in Vista: I/O Manager and Removable Media Device ACLs When the driver stack creates the device object, the I/O manager sets a default ACL that is based on the device type. The default ACL gives Full access to SYSTEM and Administrators, and it gives only Execute access to everyone else. By default in Windows Vista, the I/O manager grants the IU group Full access for device objects for removable media devices such as CD drives and for those disk device objects that have defined FILE_REMOVABLE_MEDIA characteristics. Note: In earlier versions of Windows, the entry for IU was not present in the ACL that was set by the I/O manager. The Windows Vistas I/O manager provides Full access to the IU group, so that applications can receive direct access to a volume without requiring elevation of privilege, as discussed earlier. However, UFD devices that do not set the Removable property do not benefit from this because the I/O manager does not treat them as removable. The disk class driver sets the FILE_REMOVABLE_MEDIA characteristic if the identity data—received from the device in response to the SCSI INQUIRY command—has the Removable property set. Because some UFD devices set this property even though they are not truly removable media, the I/O manager treats such devices as removable disks and provides the IU group Read and Write access to the volume. By default, the Windows Vista I/O manager gives only Execute access for remotely connected users for removable media device objects (CD devices) and for those disk device objects that have FILE_REMOVABLE_MEDIA characteristics set. Because of this, remote users cannot burn data by using a CD or DVD drive or perform backup to an optical media or format a removable disk. Administrators can set the Removable Storage Access group policy to override the default behavior. When this policy is set, the I/O manager grants Full access to remote user for these devices, allowing read and write capabilities. So Vista sets ACLs on devices differently for the interactive user vs remote users. I figured it would be something like this.
