Suppose a simple finite state machine which was developed for named entity recognition. In those kinds of machines, the states with a single outgoing transition effectively ignore their observation. In other words, the states with a single transition simply have to move to the next state without considering their current observation. More generally, states with low-entropy next state distributions will take little notice of observations. Reference: J. D. Lafferty, A. McCallum, and F. C. N.
