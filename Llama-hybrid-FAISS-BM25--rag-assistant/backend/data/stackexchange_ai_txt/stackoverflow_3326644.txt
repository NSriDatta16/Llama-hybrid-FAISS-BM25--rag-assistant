Why is my multi-component UIPickerView crashing?

I'm trying to create a simple pickerview with two components, drawing its label data from a small mutablearray and output data from a simple matrix. The purpose of this wheel is to select a value from 0 to 1000, and then spit out the number in a label and the value to the rest of the application's functions. Some specific info about what I'm doing: (skip down to the last paragraph for the problem) The left wheel spins a "hundred's" column, and the right wheel spins a "ten's" column, so essentially you're creating one value from two wheels. All I want to do is let the user create a value of 0, 10, 20, 30... 990, 1000 (every ten units up to 1000).The first component is easy to label, but I have two arrays to populate the second component's row's labels. The first array for the second component creates the 00 - 90 label, the second array (for when 1000 is selected) just has a 00 value. So when the user wants to select 1000, the 10 is on the first wheel and 00 on the second. I change the row count for the second wheel component when the first wheel component is at row 10. So now the second component only shows "00". My didSelectRow method uses a matrix for values of 0 - 990 and works great. And I just make a string and convert it to a number for when the user selects 1000 using if statements. The problem is in the rare circumstance of when the user spins Component 0 to create the value of "1000" (the last row), and if they were start spinning the second component before the first component has a chance to stop spinning (basically spinning in a hurry!), the app crashes. I think it's trying to find a value for a row that doesn't exist. I have other parts of my app that function similarly and they also crash under the same situation. Is there a problem with my approach to changing the number of rows/labels for rows based on the selection of a different component? Or is it something simple in my code? Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any help! Here's the code: //Baggage Array baggageHundredsArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; for (int i = 1; i
