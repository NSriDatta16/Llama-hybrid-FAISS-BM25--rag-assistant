You cannot get a div to fill the height of it's parent. It may work in one browser, but I've had this problem and it is not simply solved by a height:100%. You can simulate the background by creating a background that tiles all the way down the side. This isn't the most elegant solution. The only other solution I have found is to use javascript. After the page loads, you can set the height of the div to precisely what it needs to be based upon the height of the div that you want it to expand within. There may be some javascript libraries out there to assist you with positioning of this troublesome div, but I can't conjure up one at the moment.
