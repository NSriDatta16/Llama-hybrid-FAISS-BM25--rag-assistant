Using LINQ to Get Sum/ Average of a List with custom objects

I have a class: public class PointD { public double X { get; set; } public double Y { get; set; } public PointD(double x, double y) { X = x; Y=y; } //operator for +,-, * and / are overridden } Given a list , how to get the average of it using LINQ? A for loop equivalent will be something like this: double xx, yy; for ( int i=0; i You can use any built-in LINQ function only. You can't define an extension that takes care of this function. Any idea? Edit: Of course, you can use two separate Sum extension method to Sum for X and Y component before merging them. But this is not what I want. What I want is a single query/ method that does the job
