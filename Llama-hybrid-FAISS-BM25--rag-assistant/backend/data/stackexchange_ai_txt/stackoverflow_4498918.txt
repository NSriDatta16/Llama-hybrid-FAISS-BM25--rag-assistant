Setting the background colour/highlight colour for a given string range using Core Text

I have some text laid out using Core Text in my iPhone app. I'm using NSAttributedString to set certain styles within the text for given ranges. I can't seem to find an attribute for setting a background / highlight colour, though it would seem it is possible. I couldn't find an attribute name constant that sounded relevant and the documentation only lists: kCTCharacterShapeAttributeName kCTFontAttributeName kCTKernAttributeName kCTLigatureAttributeName kCTForegroundColorAttributeName kCTForegroundColorFromContextAttributeName kCTParagraphStyleAttributeName kCTStrokeWidthAttributeName kCTStrokeColorAttributeName kCTSuperscriptAttributeName kCTUnderlineColorAttributeName kCTUnderlineStyleAttributeName kCTVerticalFormsAttributeName kCTGlyphInfoAttributeName kCTRunDelegateAttributeName Craig Hockenberry, developer of Twitterrific has said publicly on Twitter that he uses Core Text to render the tweets, and Twitterrific has this background / highlight that I'm talking about when you touch a link. Any help or pointers in the right direction would be fantastic, thanks. Edit: Here's a link to the tweet Craig posted mentioning "Core text, attributed strings and a lot of hard work", and the follow up that mentioned using CTFrameSetter metrics to work out if touches intersect with links.
