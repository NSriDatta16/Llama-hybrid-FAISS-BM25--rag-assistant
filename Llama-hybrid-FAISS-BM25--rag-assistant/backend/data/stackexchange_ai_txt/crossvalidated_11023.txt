when i joined analytics industry( just out of my own interest) after serving software for 5 yrs..I didnt know SAS either..I got some version from somewhere and started writing codes on my own. Yes, I had programming background before that..I knew SQL, I knew general programming. I would suggest you visit tutorials and start writing codes yourself. The version is something you should get first but. Read SQL. Know everything from select * to joins to merge..tommorow if some interviewer gives you a loop or a join(left,right, full)..or some function like 1) contains 2) coalesce 3) sum, min, max, average 4) merge( in=a) (in=b) ..bla bla..you should be in decent condition that you are gonna ace it. These are just some bits from my side..apart from this you could also focus on reading things like regression analysis, MLE and OLS methods..this would show the interviewer that though this guy didnt have SAS facility he is good on general concepts..All I am preaching here is what i practiced.
