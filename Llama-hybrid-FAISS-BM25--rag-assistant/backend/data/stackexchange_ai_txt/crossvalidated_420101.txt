To add to the two great answers given above, I would also extend this to cross-validation. If you sample 70/30 for training and hold-out and want to do cross-validation on the 70% training set, keep in mind that the more folds you do in the cross-validation, the smaller the number of incidents in each of the partitioned sets and the larger chance that one of these groups has none of these rare events. If you have a perfect stratified sample (for 700/300 with 10% positive classes), a 10-fold CV is on average expecting more 7 positive classes per group with a non-zero chance that you may have one or none present. Hope this is useful!
