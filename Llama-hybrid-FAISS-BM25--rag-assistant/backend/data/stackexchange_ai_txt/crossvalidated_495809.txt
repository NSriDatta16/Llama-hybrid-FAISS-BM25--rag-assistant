Rank guass scaler is a scikit-learn style transformer that scales numeric variables to normal distributions. Its based on rank transformation. First step is to assign a linspace to the sorted features from 0..1, then apply the inverse of error function ErfInv to shape them like gaussians, then I substract the mean. Binary features are not touched with this trafo (eg. 1-hot ones). This works usually much better than standard mean/std scaler or min/max. Do checkout this link
