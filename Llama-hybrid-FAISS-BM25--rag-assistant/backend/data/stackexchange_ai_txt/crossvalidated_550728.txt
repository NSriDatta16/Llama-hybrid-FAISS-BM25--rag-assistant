The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm itself has satisified that the generated markov chain has stationary distribution (since the generated markov chain is easy to be designed as aperiodic , irreducible and positive reccurent under this algorithm). The detailed balance condition is used to confirm which distribution is the stationary distribution, but not its uniqueness and existence. The detailed balance condition tells us that, if I have a distribution $\pi(x)$ , and this distribution satisify that $\pi(x_i)p_{ij}=\pi(x_j)p_{ji}$ (where $p_{ij}$ is the element in a transition matrix or transition kernel if it is continuous distribution) in a markov chain, then this distribution will be the stationary distribution of this markov chain. Therefore, the only thing we have to prove is that our target distribution satisifies the this equation.
