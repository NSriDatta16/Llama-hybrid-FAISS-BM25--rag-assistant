If you are embedding passwords somewhere, you are already hosed. You can't guarantee anything. However, you could use public key/private key encryption to make sure the data hasn't been tampered with. The way it works is this: You generate a public key / private key pair. Keep the private key secure, distribute the public key. Hash the data and then sign the hash with the private key. Use the public key to verify the hash. This effectively renders the data read-only outside your company, and provides your program a simple way to verify that the data hasn't been modified without distributing passwords.
