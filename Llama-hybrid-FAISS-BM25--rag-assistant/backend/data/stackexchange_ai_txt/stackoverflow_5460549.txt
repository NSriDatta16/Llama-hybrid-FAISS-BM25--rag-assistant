Ok, the ultimate answer on this was to, yes, set the flag on 'startDrag', but rather than leaving it around and unsetting it on mouse release button event, simply call the base method and then unset. The reason is that the image for the cursor is only requested (and painted) once - not continuously during the drag, as I had first thought. Leaving the flag set meant the cursor image would get drawn at inappropriate times. So, the implementation looks like: MyClass::dragStart(Qt::DropActions supportedActions) { __dragStart = true; TableView::dragStart(supportedActions); // request for drag cursor image happens here __dragStart = false; }
