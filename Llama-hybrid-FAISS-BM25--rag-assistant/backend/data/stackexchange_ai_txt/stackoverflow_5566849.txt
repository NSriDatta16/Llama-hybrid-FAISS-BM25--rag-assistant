MS Chart Control series label positioning

I've got a gantt chart (RangeBar) I've made with the MS Chart control; for some shorter series, the label gets displayed outside the bar; I'd prefer to set it so the label gets stays inside the bar and gets truncated (with ellipsis would be nice). Is there a way of doing this? I've been poking around in the properties of the chart and series for ages now with no success.
