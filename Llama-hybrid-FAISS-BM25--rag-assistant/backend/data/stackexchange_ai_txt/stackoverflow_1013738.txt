Cygwin is very cool! You can compile programs from other systems (Linux, for example), and they will work . I'm talking communications programs, or web servers, even. Here is one trick. If you are looking at your file in the Windows File Explorer, you can type "cd " in your bash windows, then drag from explorer's address bar into the cygwin window, and the full path will be copied! This works in the Windows command shell as well, by the way. Also: While "cd /cygdrive/c" is the formal path, it will also accept "cd c:" as a shortcut. You may need to do this before you drag in the rest of the path. The stdio.h file should be found automatically, as it would be on a conventional system.
