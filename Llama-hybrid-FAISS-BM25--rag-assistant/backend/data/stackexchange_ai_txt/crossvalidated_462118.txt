Note that $\epsilon_t$ are i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ , but that's not the case for your process. Your process has some time dependencies: the value of $X_t$ depends on $X_{t-1}$ and some white noise. It then makes sense to study the distribution of $X_t | X_{t-1}=x_{t-1}$ (1 past sample since your process is AR(1)), which for your process is $\mathcal{N}(0.8x_{t-1},1)$ . Now if you want to express $X_t$ without taking into account the past, you have to find the stationary solution of your process. This is unique and has the form $$ X_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty 0.8^j \epsilon_{t-j} $$ But for time series it is in general more informative to take a look at the mean and the covariance function.
