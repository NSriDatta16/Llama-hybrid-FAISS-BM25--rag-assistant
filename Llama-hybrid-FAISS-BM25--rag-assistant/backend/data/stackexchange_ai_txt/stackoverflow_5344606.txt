Sharding GridFS on MongoDB

I'm documenting about the GridFS and the possibility to shard it among different machines. Reading the documentation here , the suggested shard key is chunks.files_id. This key will be linked to the _id of the files collection, thus this _id is incremental. Every new file i save in the Grid will have a new incremental _id. In the O'Reilly "Scaling MongoDB" book the use of an incremental shard key is discouraged to avoid HotSpots (the last shard will receive all the write and read). what is your suggestion for sharding the GridFS collection? have anybody experienced the HotSpot problem? thank you.
