It looks like you are interested in time-to-event data, given the variables Event and Event.time . So the best approach would be to use survival analysis rather than logistic regression, as logistic-regression analysis would lose all the information about times to events. There are ways to apply LASSO, ridge regression, or elastic net with survival analysis, for example with the glmnet package in R. In general, features should be normalized before applying such approaches, so that the different predictor variables are all on the same scales as far as possible. Otherwise results and the predictors selected might differ if your measurements are in, say, mol/liter instead of mg/liter units. Your categorical variables are presently coded as integer values. You may need to make sure that the software interprets them correctly as categorical variables; how to do that depends on the software, e.g., use as.factor() in R. Otherwise they might be interpreted as continuous variables, a problem if there are more than 2 categories.
