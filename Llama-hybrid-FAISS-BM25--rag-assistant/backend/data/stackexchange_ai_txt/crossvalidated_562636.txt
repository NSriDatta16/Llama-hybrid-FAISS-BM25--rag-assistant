Code with explanation on using the OpenCV for image classification using the SVM with python from Scratch

Could anyone share links and resources on Image classification using SVM(Support Vector Machine) from Scratch? Also, there should be the use of the OpenCV library. I got one link , where I am trying to understand the code. But, it's complicated for me.
