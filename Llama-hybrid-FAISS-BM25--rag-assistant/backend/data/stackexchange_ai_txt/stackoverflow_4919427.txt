Single view template for multiple request formats

I am involved in the build of an HTML5 app and we have created a custom MIME type (mobile) for iPhone, Android etc. So for example we have index.html.haml and index.mobile.haml. In many cases the output will be the same - so my question is, how can I create a view file that is used by both mobile and html request formats? And in the cases where the view is different, select the correct html or mobile view? I have been digging and can't seem to find a clean and elegant solution.
