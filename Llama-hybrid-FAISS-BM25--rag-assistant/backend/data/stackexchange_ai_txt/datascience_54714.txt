You can also consider a multi-output model using the Keras functional API (see "Deep Learning with R", Ch. 7, p. 224). Here are the respective Keras docs . There are also some tutorials online. I'm not sure if a NN is suitable for your problem, but this would be an option to consider. The advantage is that your model can also take correlation between the features and the two outputs into consideration while learning (which may give better results).
