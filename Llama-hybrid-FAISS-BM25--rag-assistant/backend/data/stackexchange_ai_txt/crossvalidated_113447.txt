Correlated residuals in time series analysis may imply far worse than low efficiency: if the structure of autocorrelation implies integrated or near-integrated data, then any inferences about levels, means, variances, etc. may be spurious (with unknown direction of bias) because the population mean is undefined and the population variance is infinite (so, for example, the finite values $\bar{x}$ and $s_{x}$, and quantities derived from these are always false estimates of the corresponding population statistics). That's not a problem that can be resolved by increasing sample size to offset inefficiency. If autocorrelated errors obtain in OLS, I would say that the same issues may be present (it depends on the data generating process). Again: not an issue of efficiency. The critical caveat is whether ordering of your data is meaningful : if the order has meaning in that it relates to the data generating process then you're in trouble.
