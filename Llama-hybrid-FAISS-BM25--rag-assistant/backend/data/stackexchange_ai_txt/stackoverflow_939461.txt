I think that in this case the OP is looking for a pragmatic (profitable) reason to switch over to MVC, since most companies think that way. The biggest advantage is that it is much easier to create unit tests for ASP.NET MVC applications. A good suite of unit tests can then serve as the foundation of a Continuous Integration process. The bottomline for the powers to be is that you can create a build in a single step, simplifying deployment, creating installers, patches etc.
