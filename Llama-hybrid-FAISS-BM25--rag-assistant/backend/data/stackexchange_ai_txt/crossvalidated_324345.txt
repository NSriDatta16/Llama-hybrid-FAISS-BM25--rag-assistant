You can compute the correlation between the distances, or (often better)between the ranks for the neighbors of each object. The average will give you an "average (rank-) correlation" between any two distance measures. Then you can identify similar measures. I have seen such an analysis in a paper, but I'd need to search it. It was a few hears ago.
