Labels are used with goto and switch/case statements, when they are used to direct the flow of control. However, labels may also be used absent any goto statements (case labels must only appear in a switch statement) as means of identifying particular code segments -- i.e., somewhat like a comment, though in reality more like a title. If you're not seeing any switch or goto statements, I suspect the code author is simply using them to organize his code.
