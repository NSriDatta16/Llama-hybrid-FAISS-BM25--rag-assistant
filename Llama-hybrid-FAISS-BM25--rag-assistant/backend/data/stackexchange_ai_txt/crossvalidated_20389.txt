This is easily handled with a Markov model, since it is OK to have the outcome a time T be dependent on the state at T-1. What would not be OK is for the outcome to be dependent on previous state. Reducing this to its simplest form, consider a Markov chain. A Markov chain, named after Andrey Markov, is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, between a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a random process characterized as memoryless: the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This specific kind of "memorylessness" is called the Markov property. Here is a sample:
