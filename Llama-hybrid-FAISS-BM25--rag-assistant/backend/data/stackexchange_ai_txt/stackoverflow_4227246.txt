First of all, I fail to see how it's useful to wrap Gson like that. As to your problem, the information about generic type T itself is not available during runtime. It's been erased. It's only available during compile time. You want to parameterize it with the actual type instead like new TypeToken > . Due to lack of reified Generics in Java (it isn't possible to do a T t = new T() ), Gson itself is forced to use the TypeToken approach, as you see. Otherwise Gson would have done it in a much more elegant manner. In order to be able to pass the actual type around, you've to reinvent the same thing as TypeToken is already doing. And this makes no sense :) Just reuse it or just use Gson straight without wrapping it in some helper class like that.
