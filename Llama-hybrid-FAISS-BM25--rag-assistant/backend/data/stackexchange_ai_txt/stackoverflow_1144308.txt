In Firebug / Firefox (you'll have to check other browsers) I solved your problem adding a: li { overflow:hidden; } Don't know why exactly, but that magical line solves lots of problems around floated stuff :-) Edit: Solution if you can change the html slightly If you have any control over the html, you could perhaps use paragraph tags instead of list items: p.list_item { background: transparent url(/++resource++stylesheets/images/bullet.gif) no-repeat scroll left 0.45em; padding-left: 11px; } However, that would kind of change the semantic meaning of the list items...
