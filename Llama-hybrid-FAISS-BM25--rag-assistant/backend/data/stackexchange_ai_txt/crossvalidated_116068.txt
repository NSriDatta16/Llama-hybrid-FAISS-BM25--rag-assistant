Stationarity means, among other things, that a All the random variables $X_t$ have the same distribution All pairs of random variables $(X_t, X_s)$ have a joint distribution that depends only on the difference $t-s$ and not on the individual values of $t$ and $s$: the joint distribution of $(X_1,X_3)$ is the same as the joint distribution of $(X_2,X_4)$. More generally, the $n$-th order distributions of $(X_t, X_s, X_u, \ldots, )$ are the same as the $n$-th order distributions of the random variables $(X_{t+\tau}, X_{s+\tau}, X_{u+\tau}, \ldots, )$ If the $X_t$ are all independent random variables, then the first of the above conditions is not satisfied unless we also say, claim, assert, or have reasons for believing, that all the $X_t$ have the same distribution. This is often referred to in abbreviated fashion as iid or i.i.d. which stands for independent and identically distributed random variables. In this case, all the other conditions are automatically satisfied. In other words, If the random variables constituting the process or time series are iid random variables, then the process is stationary. If the random variables are independent but not necessarily identically distributed, then the process is non-stationary.
