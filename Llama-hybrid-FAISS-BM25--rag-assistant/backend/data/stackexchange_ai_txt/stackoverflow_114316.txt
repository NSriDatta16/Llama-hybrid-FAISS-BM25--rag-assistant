I don't know if .NET has a matching mechanism, but Java allows you to specify an agent JAR file, namely a class that is notified/invoked when each class is loaded. Then, via instrumentation/bytecode manipulation, you could intercept such method calls. Perhaps you can replace the class loader in some way in .NET. not sure.
