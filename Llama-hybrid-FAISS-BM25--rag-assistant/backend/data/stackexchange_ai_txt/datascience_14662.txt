Applying convolutional neural network over text documents using 1-D tf-idf feature vectors

I want to apply a CNN over documents. I have tf-idf vectors of documents with me (one vector per document). My question is, is 1D CNN applicable in this case? The reason I am asking this question is that I have read 1D convolutions being applied to sequence of vectors and I have sequence of scalars (tf-idf vector) as input in this case, so is it applicable?
