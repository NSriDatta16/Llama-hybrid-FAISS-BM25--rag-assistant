listbox dragdrop in wpf

I am currently porting a windows forms application to wpf. There is a listbox with filenames in it. It should be possible to drag (multiple) items to the windows explorer. This was easy in with the old windows form, but I can't find a way how this can be done in wpf. This was the code I used with windows forms: void listView1_ItemDrag(object sender, ItemDragEventArgs e) { string[] files = GetSelection(); if (files != null) { DoDragDrop(new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, files), DragDropEffects.Copy ); } }
