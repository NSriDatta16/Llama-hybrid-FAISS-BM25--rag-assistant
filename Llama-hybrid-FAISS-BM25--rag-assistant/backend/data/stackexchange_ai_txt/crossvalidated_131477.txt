how to decide which logistic regression model is better?

I have the following 3 models: fit1 Edit - The variable survived is a binary variable - 1 indicating a user survived beyond 10 sessions (threshold) and 0 otherwise. ascore is a value indicating activity of user and gini is the gini-simpson index. and I am intending to check if addition of "gini" produces a better fit (classifier) than just having ascore in the model. The AICs for the models are 22280, 22132 and 21959 which may seem to indicate fit3 > fit2 > fit1 The AUC for ROC curves are 0.7447, 0.7241 and 0.7326 which may seem to indicate fit1 > fi3 > fit2 While ascore is significant in fit1 and fit2, it is not significant in fit3. Here are my outputs: > fit1 summary(fit1) Call: glm(formula = survived ~ ascore, family = binomial, data = records) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.6363 -0.3987 -0.3587 -0.3521 2.3751 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.7638342 0.0227365 -121.56 fit2 summary(fit2) Call: glm(formula = survived ~ ascore + gini, family = binomial, data = records) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.6139 -0.4180 -0.3821 -0.3302 2.6274 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
