Using an experiment to distinguish $\ell^1$ from $\ell^2$ metrics of disutility is probably hopeless â€”- because people are likely to state preferences that can not be modeled by either. For instance, people may state intransitive preferences. If you ask about any particular level of the administrative budget, they may prefer to reduce it by 10%, but if you ask about reducing the admin budget to 1/3 of its current size, they may prefer the status quo. Good luck modeling that with $\ell^p$ utilities! If you instead ask for 1-10 ratings, as Eoin suggests, people may state discontinuous ratings: they may only give ratings in the 1-3 or 8-10 ranges. Good luck fitting that well with $\ell^p$ utilities! There is a literature on this, in empirical studies of non-expected utility, and maybe you can model the preferences of the crowd that you survey, but that might not be a good enough reason to follow the model in your own budgetary decisions. So if the central authority wants a genuinely participatory budget process, it might be better off by transparently taking a weighted average of the proposed allocations, with the weights given in advance. This may highlight the need for vetting which proposals are allowed to go into the average at all, but that would be equally necessary even in the more complicated and less transparent approaches.
