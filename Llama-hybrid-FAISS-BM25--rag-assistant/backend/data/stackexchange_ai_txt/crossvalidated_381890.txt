How to perform specific queries in weather data time series

I have time series data from several weather stations located in a specific area. The readings include a timestamp, the humidity and the temperature. The resolution of the data is quite high, about 6 measurements every second. The recorded data are provided as CSV files (one CSV for each day for each weather station). My question is how is it possible to perform a query like this: Find a station (or let's say an area) where the temperature is higher than 20Â°C for more than 6 hours during the last 3 months . Additionally, it would be meaningful to create some graphs in a web application. From my knowledge it's non trivial to pass such a big amount of data into a javascript library (e.g. highcharts,...) and then visualize them. I would appreciate any hints or examples.
