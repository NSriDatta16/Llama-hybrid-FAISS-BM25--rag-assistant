You don't say exactly how the replication is done or the data volumes involved (or why you are sorting the data). If the aim is to minimise the impact on the source database, your best bet may be to extract into an intermediate file and load the file into the destination databases. The sort could be done on the intermediate file (if plain text), or as part of either the export or import into the destination databases. In source database : create table export_emp_info organization external ( type oracle_datapump default directory DATA_PUMP_DIR location ('emp.dmp') ) as select emp_id, emp_name, dept_id from emp order by dept_id / Copy file then, import in dest database: create table import_emp_info (EMP_ID NUMBER(12), EMP_NAME VARCHAR2(100), DEPT_ID NUMBER) organization external ( type oracle_datapump default directory DATA_PUMP_DIR location ('emp.dmp') ) / insert into emp_info select * from import_emp_info; If you don't want or can't have the external table on the source db, you can use a straight expdp of the emp table (possibly using NETWORK_LINK if you have limited access to the source database directory structure) and QUERY to do the ordering.
