Is there a way to programatically launch the Windows "set up microphone"

If I search for "microphone" in Windows 7 the first option is "Set up Microphone". I'd like to be able to launch that programatically. I've tried dragging that shortcut to the desktop but it's just a "search" shortcut. any suggestions?
