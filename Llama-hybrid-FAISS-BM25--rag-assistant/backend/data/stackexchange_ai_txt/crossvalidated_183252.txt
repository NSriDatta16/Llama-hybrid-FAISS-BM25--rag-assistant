Can I use cross validation on a subset of the training set to select hyperparameters?

I am using R, and I had a dataset with 400000 rows and 800 columns, training a random forest model with only 100 trees on this dataset will take me about 1 and half hour on my laptop. So I went on and performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the dataset and find out that the first 100 PCs would retain approximately 92% of the variance. So I then train my model on the 100 PCs and the training time reduced to about 15 minutes. But it will still be very slow, if I want to select the optimal mtry value using 10 fold cross validation. My question is, can I use only a smaller proportion of the training data, maybe 1/3 of it and use this smaller data set to select the mtry value via cross validation?
