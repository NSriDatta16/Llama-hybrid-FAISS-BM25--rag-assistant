Any particular reason you only have one Agent installed? TeamCity allows up to 3 Agents even on its free Professional Edition. We've got two Agents installed on one moderately powerful machine and had no issues. Anyways I can't think of anything that I've come across with TC that will help, apart from perhaps the new Build Queue Priorities plugin...
