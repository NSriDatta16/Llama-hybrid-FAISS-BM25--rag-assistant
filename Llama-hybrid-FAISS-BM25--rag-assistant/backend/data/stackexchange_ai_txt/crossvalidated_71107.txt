Replicating tables in van den Brink, P.J. & ter Braak, C.J.F. (1999) with vegan's prc

The paper is: van den Brink, P.J. & ter Braak, C.J.F. (1999). Principal response curves: Analysis of time-dependent multivariate responses of biological community to stress. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 18, 138-148. The example data used in the paper: spdta Perform a principal response curve analysis: require(vegan) #the species data are natural log(x) transformed mod However, the species scores are difference from the ones listed in the paper, but I can get it back by the function scores # Species scores: scores.sps.1999 My question is: The canonical coefficients are also different from the paper. I can manage to transform my results into the paper ones but don't know why. sum_prc Also, the paper gives the standardized canonical coefficients rdt and standard deviations sdt . How do I get this piece of information from my PRC results? rdt
