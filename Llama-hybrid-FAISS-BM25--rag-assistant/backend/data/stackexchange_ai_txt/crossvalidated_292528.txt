Since a nonparametric test is available - the Wilcoxon test - a better question might be how to choose between the Wilcoxon test and logistic regression. You can use either one for this problem. The logistic model approach generalizes to a multivariate comparison, e.g., is there an association between any of 5 brain measures and memory loss. This idea was developed by Peter O'Brien: http://www.citeulike.org/user/harrelfe/article/13264639 Think of linear logistic regression as competing with a t-test that assumes equal variance in the two groups. Think of quadratic logistic regression as competing with a two-sample t-test with unequal variances. A cubic logistic model would allow skewness to differ.
