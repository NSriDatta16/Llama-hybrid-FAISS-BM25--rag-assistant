This information is usually in any textbook about time series forecasting. One example would be here . The idea is testing forecasting accuracy in general is quite simple. Simple leave out some of the data at the end of your sample and fit the model on the remaining part. Then forecast from the model. Since you have some data left, you can compare it with forecasted values. This is the same process which you would use to test your future forecasts, the difference is that you do not have to wait for actual data to appear. How you compare the forecasts with actual values is up to you, usually some statistic is calculated such as MSE, MAPE or MASE. To make sense of this statistic some protocol of how much data is left out and how much is used for fitting the model is needed. The key words for more information are test and train sets.
