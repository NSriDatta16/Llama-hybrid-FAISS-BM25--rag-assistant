Binary vs ordinal logistic regresson

I have made my response variable as both a binary and a ordinal variable and performed binary logistic regression respective ordinal logistic regression. If I want to test which model fits the data best, which is the best way? So how to test which one of the binary and ordinal logistic model is the best fit?
