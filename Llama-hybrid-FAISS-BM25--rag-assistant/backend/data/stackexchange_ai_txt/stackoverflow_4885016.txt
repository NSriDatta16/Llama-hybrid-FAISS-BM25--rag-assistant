Umh..there are several ways you can parse an xml document to into memory and work with it. You mentioned DOM. DOM actually holds uploads the whole document into memory and then allows you to move between different branches of the XML document. On the other hand, you could use StAX. It works similar to DOM. The only difference is that, it streams the content of the XML document thus allowing better allocation of memory. On the other hand, it does not retain the information that has already been read. Look at : http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbem.html It gives details about both parsing methods and example code. Hope that helps.
