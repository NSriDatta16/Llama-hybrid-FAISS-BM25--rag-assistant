It's possible that for any given predictor there is no significant difference in the response between predictor values, but that there is a difference between combinations of predictors. Here's an example from a taste-test I conducted looking at the effects from two ingredients in a recipe for cookies, each with two levels: sugar (brown vs. white) and fat (butter vs. shortening). As it turned out, the combinations (brown sugar + shorting) and (white sugar + butter) both scored high on the taste test while (brown sugar + butter) and (white sugar + shortening) both scored low. As a result, there wasn't an overall effect for white vs brown sugar or for shortening vs butter. The result is that if you considered a model with only first order terms like $E[Y]=\alpha+\beta_1(fat)+\beta_2(sugar)$ neither predictor was significant. But including the interaction term $E[Y]=\alpha+\beta_1(fat)+\beta_2(sugar)+\beta_3(fat*sugar)$ we found $\beta_3$ to be significant. I'd try adding interactions terms to you're model. PCA can help if you have many redundant predictors and need to reduce the dimensionality of the predictor space, but that doesn't sound like the main issue in your case.
