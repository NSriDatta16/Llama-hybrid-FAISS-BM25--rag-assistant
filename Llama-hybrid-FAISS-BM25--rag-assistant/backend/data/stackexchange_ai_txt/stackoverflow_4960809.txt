In my opinion this breaks the MVC pattern a bit. You want a Controller that is responsible for a View . I would create a controller that has an Action that returns your View . If you don't want to be able to do anything else than using it as a partial view, there are attributes for that. This way you stick to the MVC pattern and you can use the extension @Html.RenderPartial . Your example of returning a DateTime is possible to solve as @Robert Levy said, but if you really want to try and return a View from outside a Controller I would strongly advice against trying that.
