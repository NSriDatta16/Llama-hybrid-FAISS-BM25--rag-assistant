You can simply drag and drop the .apk file of your application to the emulator and it will automatically start installing. Another option: Windows: Execute the emulator (SDK Manager.exe → Tools → Manage AVDs... → New then Start) . Start the console (Windows XP), Run → type cmd , and move to the platform-tools folder of SDK directory. Paste the APK file in the android-sdk\tools or platform-tools folder. Then type the following command. adb install [.apk path] Example: adb install C:\Users\Name\MyProject\build\Jorgesys.apk Linux: Copy the apk file to platform-tools in the android-sdk linux folder. Open Terminal and navigate to platform-tools folder in android-sdk . Then execute this command: ./adb install FileName.apk If the operation is successful (the result is displayed on the screen), then you will find your file in the launcher of your emulator. Mac: PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools Example: PATH=$PATH:/users/jorgesys/eclipse/android-sdk-mac_64/tools Then run adb.
