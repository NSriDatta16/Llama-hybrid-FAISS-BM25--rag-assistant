Your model has a random effect for individual which effects the marginal distribution of your observations when split into treatment groups, which is what you see in the first plot (I think, because you don't describe the data.) In the reproducible example below, there is a very obvious effect of the factor 'x', but it there is a lot of overlap in the 'allEffects' plot because this plot seems to average over the grouping factor. The short answer is that effective blocking reduces error variance. effect % mutate(y = rpois(total, exp(offset + effect*(x==1) + groups[groupid] + rnorm(total)))) library(lme4) library(effects) fit
