UML Use-case diagram postcondition implementation (with diagram)

I'm learning UML by trying to simulate how a car service garage works with diagrams and documentation. One problem I have is with postcondition (or rather, GOTO) statements. Is the dashed line > relationship only for preconditions? Can Use-case bubbles connect to eachother and follow a logic path? So this is what I have so far.. 1) Is the 'Settle Payment' bubble in the wrong place? Should it have been >ed to the other bubbles? 2) Should I associate the 'request service' bubbles to the technician too as he will be the one fixing the car? Image
