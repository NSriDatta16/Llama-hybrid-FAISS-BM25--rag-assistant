import cgi #This will give you the data of the file, # but won't give you the filename, unfortunately. # For that you have to do some other trick. file_data = cgi.FieldStorage.getfirst('file') # #(If you're using mod_python you can also get the Request object # by passing 'req' to the relevant function in 'index.py', like "def func(req):" # Then you access it with req.form.getfirst('file') instead. NOTE that the # first method will work even when using mod_python, but the first FieldStorage # object called is the only one with relevant data, so if you pass 'req' to the # function you have to use the method that uses 'req'.) # #Then you can write it to a file like so... file = open('example_filename.wtvr','w')#'w' is for 'write' file.write(file_data) file.close() #Then access it like so... file = open('example_filename.wtvr','r')#'r' is for 'read' #And use file.read() or whatever else to do what you want.
