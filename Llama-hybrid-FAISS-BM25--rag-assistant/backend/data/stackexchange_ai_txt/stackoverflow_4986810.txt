Look here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html#appcacheevents Apparently, when a page declares a manifest, the browser should look at the manifest file to see if anything has changed, and then refresh all the resources it mentions if it has. If the manifest file has not changed, then nothing else is refreshed. I guess you would change a comment in the manifest file, so that it will be seen to have changed, when the actual list of resource names has not changed -- perhaps, a version number or date comment.
