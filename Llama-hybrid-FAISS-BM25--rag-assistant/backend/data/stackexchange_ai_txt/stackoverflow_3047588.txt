The main reason for iterators in STL was to allow algorithms to be written independent of the manner in which the data was stored. Of course, the storage does (or at least can) impose some limitations, which lead to various classes of iterators (e.g., RandomAccess vs. Input) but these are (intended to be) as independent as possible of the underlying data structure. This allows, for example, a merge algorithm to take input from a vector and a list , and write the output to an ostream_iterator , without needing to pay any attention to the differences between the sources and/or destination.
