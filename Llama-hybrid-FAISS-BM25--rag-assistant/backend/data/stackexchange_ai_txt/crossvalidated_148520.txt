My best try: ...usage of transition matrices suggested by @AndyW is probably not the solution I am looking for (based on @Tim's comment). So I've tried a different approach. I found this link which deals with how to do logistic regression where response variable y and a predictor variable x are both binary . According to example I should create 2 Ã— 2 table based on my data: gold (yes) gold (no) silver (yes) 2 7 silver (no) 14 34 How I extracted the values: And construct a model: response |z|) # (Intercept) -1.2528 0.8018 -1.562 0.118 # as.factor(c(0, 1))1 0.3655 0.8624 0.424 0.672 Is it a good solution? Does the p-value (0.673) mean that presence of silver no not increase the probability of finding gold?
