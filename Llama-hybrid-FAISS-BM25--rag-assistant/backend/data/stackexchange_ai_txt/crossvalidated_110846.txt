Sorry for having taken so much time to correctly read the statement of the problem. The Poisson processes just hide the problem. Basically you have two independent Poisson variates $X_1 \sim {\cal P}(\lambda k_1)$ and $X_2 \sim {\cal P}(\lambda k_2)$ with known $k_1, k_2$ and unknown $\lambda$, and based on a realization $x_1$ of $X_1$ the goal is to predict the realization $x_2$ of $X_2$. A Bayesian approach with the Jeffreys/Bernardo prior provides a prediction interval enjoying very good frequentist properties. Assume the Jeffreys prior $\Gamma(\frac12,0)$ on $\lambda$. Then after observing $x_1$ the posterior distribution on $\lambda$ is $\Gamma(x_1+\frac12, k_1)$. Integrating the distribution of $X_2$ with respect to $\lambda$ over this posterior distribution yields the ${\cal P}{\cal G}(x_1+\frac12, k_1/k_2)$ (Poisson-Gamma) distribution as the posterior predictive distribution of $x_2$, which is the same as the negative binomial distribution ${\cal N}{\cal B}(x_1+\frac12, k_1/(k_1+k_2))$. Taking quantiles of this distribution provides a prediction interval about $x_2$.
