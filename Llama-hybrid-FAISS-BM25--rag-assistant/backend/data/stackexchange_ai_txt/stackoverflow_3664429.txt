How to query wordpress posts by custom field

I am attempting to have lots of posts in a specific category. The post will have a custom field that will be a date. I need the posts to be organized by the category, the custom field, and each page of posts should be separated by month of the custom field. So hard to explain... Page of posts for the current month. Links at the bottom for Previous and Next month. Sorted by custom field, not post date. And it should only be in the specific category. Any ideas on what I can do to achieve this?
