It's hard to diagnose your problem on the information provided. IE VML is not very well supported and therefore pretty buggy. In DojoX Drawing, I ran into a similar problem when drawing lines. VML has a bug where you can't drag and resize at the same time â€“ but, you can drag and create at the same time, so I redraw the line, I don't transform it. Further, I don't attach my click/drag events to the shape, I attach them to the overall main container, detect the id on the mousedown event, then track the mousemove and move the shape via doing a setTransform on the shape's container. Essentially, because of the weak VML support, you have to be willing to try totally different things to get it to work.
