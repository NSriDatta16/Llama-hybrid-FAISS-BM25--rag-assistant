how do i use string replace to remove a carrage return from a string

Hi how do I use string replace to remove a carrage return from a string here is the string: { $content = ' some random text link text some more random text. '} and here is the sring replace command {$content=str_replace('carrage return', '', $content);} The think I cant seem to find is what to replace 'carrage return' with. The reason for this is that I am doing a reg expression on the string which fails if there is a carrage return in the serached for string as that then doesnt match the reg expression. Also on an asside note if some one posts a response to my question how do I query them back on the posting. second asside how the hell do i get html to show up properly on here ive tried '' "" () {} :( be gentil im a newby and already got punched in the face on here :( second post and someone dropped a load of my score :(
