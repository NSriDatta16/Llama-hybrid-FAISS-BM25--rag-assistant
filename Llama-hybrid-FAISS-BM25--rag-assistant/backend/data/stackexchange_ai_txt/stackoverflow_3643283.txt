While your gem has changed names, the library name has not changed. Your config.gem line is telling Rails to load the gem and then require 'badnaam-geokit' but there's no file in your gem by that name. The fix this, use the :lib option to config.gem : config.gem 'badnaam-geokit', :lib => 'geokit' Furthermore, pushing gems to Rubygems for changes like this is not encouraged. I would instead suggest you switch your Rails project to use Bundler (which works great with Rails 2.3.5 ) and then use the :git option to load the gem directly from your Github fork.
