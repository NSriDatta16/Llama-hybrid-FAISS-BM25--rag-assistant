(Vastly simplified) The binary (say a string of binary from a line of machine code/asm) is loaded into memory from say disk. Then an instruction is sent by the processor logic to memory controller to load the contents of the memory into a processor local resister. It then gets interpreted as an instruction to do by the processor. I learned this level of stuff by doing microcoding at college. In reality there are many more steps that could occur, depending on the processor complexity and power. The processor is made up of various parts (ALU, registers etc) and they cooperate in getting instructions, data and processing. If you are interested in this level of understand and I commend you for asking the question, Id say get a book on computer architecture. I used Structure Computer Organisation by Tanenbaum at college.
