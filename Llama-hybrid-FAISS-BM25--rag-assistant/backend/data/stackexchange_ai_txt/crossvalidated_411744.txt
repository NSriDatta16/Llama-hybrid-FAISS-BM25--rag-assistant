Is this Markov Chain calculation correct?

$S=\{1,2\}$ $\alpha = (1/2, 1/2)$ $P= \begin{bmatrix} 1/2&1/2\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix} $ Find $P(X_1=1 | X_0=1)$ Given solution: $P(X_1=1 | X_0=1) = \frac{P(X_1=1 , X_0=1)}{P(X_0=1)} = \frac{P(X_1=1) \cdot P( X_0=1)}{P(X_0=1)} = 0.5 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.5$ To me, this is incorrect. Because, $P(X_1=1) = 0.25$ .... as $\alpha \cdot P = (0.25, 0.75)$ $P(X_0=1) = 0.5$ is correct as the 1st element of $\alpha = (1/2, 1/2)$ is $0.5$ . So, the answer should be $0.25$ .
