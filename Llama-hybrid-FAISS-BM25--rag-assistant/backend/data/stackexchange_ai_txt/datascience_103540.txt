The pooling layers are a very important part of CNN architectures. The main idea is to "accumulate" features from strides or maps generated by convolving a filter over an image. Purpose is to gradually reduce the spatial size of representations to reduce the amount of parameters and computations in the network. They also , help in providing a sort of "spatial invariance" for learned features because of feature aggregation. There are multiple types of pooling layers: Max-Pool (most common) Average-Pool Min-Pool
