Read page XML using Javascript

Hey guys, this is driving me absolutely insane so I wanted to ask the experts on this site to see if you know how to do it =) I'm trying to create some javascript code that can read out elements of a web page (eg. what does the first paragraph say?). Here's what I have so far, but it doesnt work and I cant figure out why: could not load page "); } } } req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onreadystatechange = processReqChange; req.open("GET", "http://www.apple.com", true); req.send(null); // --> The alert that keeps appearing is "null" and I can't figure out why. Any ideas?
