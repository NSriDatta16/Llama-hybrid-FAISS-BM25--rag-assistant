I'd just also like to add to this even though it's an old thread. In an embedded application if you can analyze your memory usage for your application and come up with a max number of memory allocation of the varying sizes usually the fastest type of allocator is one using memory pools. In our embedded apps we can determine all allocation sizes that will ever be needed during run time. If you can do this you can completely eliminate heap fragmentation and have very fast allocations. Most these implementations have an overflow pool which will do a regular malloc for the special cases which will hopefully be far and few between if you did your analysis right.
