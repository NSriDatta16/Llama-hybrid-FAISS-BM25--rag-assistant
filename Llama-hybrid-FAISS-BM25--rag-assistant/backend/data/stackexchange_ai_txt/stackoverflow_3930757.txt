I've worked on an SVN repository that had well over a hundred active commiters, a revision number of over 80.000, and had been migrated from CVS 3 years before. Generally, I'd say that SVN is not a likely bottleneck when it comes to large projects and large development teams. Sure, it may lack some features that could make some aspects easier, but that's completely insignificant compared to the organizational problems.
