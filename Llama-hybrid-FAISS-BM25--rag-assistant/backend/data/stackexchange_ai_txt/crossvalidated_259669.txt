Boxplots Here is a relevant section from Hoaglin, Mosteller and Tukey (2000): Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis. Wiley . Chapter 3, "Boxplots and Batch Comparison", written by John D. Emerson and Judith Strenio (from page 62): [...] Our definition of outliers as data values that are smaller than $F_{L}-\frac{3}{2}d_{F}$ or larger than $F_{U}+\frac{3}{2}d_{F}$ is somewhat arbitrary, but experience with many data sets indicates that this definition serves well in identifying values that may require special attention.[...] $F_{L}$ and $F_{U}$ denote the first and third quartile, whereas $d_{F}$ is the interquartile range (i.e. $F_{U}-F_{L}$ ). They go on and show the application to a Gaussian population (page 63): Consider the standard Gaussian distribution, with mean $0$ and variance $1$ . We look for population values of this distribution that are analogous to the sample values used in the boxplot. For a symmetric distribution, the median equals the mean, so the population median of the standard Gaussian distribution is $0$ . The population fourths are $-0.6745$ and $0.6745$ , so the population fourth-spread is $1.349$ , or about $\frac{4}{3}$ . Thus $\frac{3}{2}$ times the fourth-spread is $2.0235$ (about $2$ ). The population outlier cutoffs are $\pm 2.698$ (about $2\frac{2}{3}$ ), and they contain $99.3\%$ of the distribution. [...] So [they] show that if the cutoffs are applied to a Gaussian distribution, then $0.7\%$ of the population is outside the outlier cutoffs; this figure provides a standard of comparison for judging the placement of the outlier cutoffs [...]. Further, they write [...] Thus we can judge whether our data seem heavier-tailed than Gaussian by how many points fall beyond the outlier cutoffs. [...] They provide a table with the expected proportion of values that fall outside the outlier cutoffs (labelled "Total % Out"): So these cutoffs where never intended to be a strict rule about what data points are outliers or not. As you noted, even a perfect Normal distribution is expected to exhibit "outliers" in a boxplot. Outliers As far as I know, there is no universally accepted definition of outlier. I like the definition by Hawkins (1980): An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism. Ideally, you should only treat data points as outliers once you understand why they don't belong to the rest of the data. A simple rule is not sufficient. A good treatment of outliers can be found in Aggarwal (2013). References Aggarwal CC (2013): Outlier Analysis. Springer. Hawkins D (1980): Identification of Outliers. Chapman and Hall.
