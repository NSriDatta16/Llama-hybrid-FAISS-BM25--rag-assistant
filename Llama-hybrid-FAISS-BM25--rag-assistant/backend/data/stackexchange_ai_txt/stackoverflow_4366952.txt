I know the built-in fields are done this way, but it's really not good practice to embed large amounts of HTML or JS into the Python code. Instead, create a separate template fragment which is rendered by the field's render method. You can pass in the object's ID for use in the template {% url %} function, or just pass in the entire URL via call to reverse .
