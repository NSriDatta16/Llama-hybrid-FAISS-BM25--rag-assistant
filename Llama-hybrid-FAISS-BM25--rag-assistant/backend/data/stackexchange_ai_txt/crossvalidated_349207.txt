I will address frequentist meta-analysis, for which the answer is: The two approaches will give asymptotically equivalent point estimates if (1) you are using an effect size measure satisfying a property I will give below; and (2) the samples are homogenous not only in true effect size, but also in within-study variance. Let $\mathbf{X}$ be your entire sample of size 300, and let $\mathbf{X}_1$ and $\mathbf{X}_2$ be the first and second parts of this sample (of sizes 100 and 200). Let $\widehat{y}_i$ with $i \in {1,2}$ be point estimates from each sample $\mathbf{X}_1$ and $\mathbf{X}_2$. They have within-study variances $\sigma_i^2$, assumed fixed and known (the usual assumption in meta-analysis), and assumed equal by homogeneity. Let $\widehat{y}_R$ be the pooled point estimate from a random-effects meta-analysis, and let $\tau^2$ be the estimated heterogeneity (the variance of the true effects). Suppose you're meta-analyzing a statistic $g(\cdot)$. Let's check whether the meta-analytically pooled point estimate matches the simple estimate pooling all the data (call it the aggregate-data estimate). $$\eqalign{ \widehat{y}_R &:= \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{1}{\tau^2 +\sigma^2_i }\widehat{y}_i }{\sum_{i=1}^2\frac{1}{\tau^2 +\sigma^2_i }} \\ &\to \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{1}{\sigma^2_i }\widehat{y}_i }{\sum_{i=1}^2\frac{1}{\sigma^2_i }} \tag{$\tau^2 \to 0$, the truth}\\ &= \frac{ \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\widehat{y}_1 + \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\widehat{y}_2}{\frac{2}{\sigma^2}} \\ &= \frac{ \widehat{y}_1 + \widehat{y}_2}{2} }$$ (The penultimate line comes from assuming heterogeneity within-study variances.) Now, this last expression is a simple average of the two samples' point estimates. So that means that if you choose a test statistic such that: $$\frac{ g(\mathbf{X}_1) + g(\mathbf{X}_2) }{2} = g(\mathbf{X}) \tag{*}$$ then the meta-analytic estimate will be asymptotically equivalent to your aggregrate-data estimate. $(*)$ holds, for instance, if $g(\cdot)$ is the sample mean, but not if $g(\cdot)$ is the odds ratio. (However, note that you wouldn't want to meta-analyze untransformed odds ratios anyway since they do not fulfill the often-used normality assumption.) Here is a code example to illustrate the equivalence when the statistic of interest is the sample mean. The inference also appears to be quite similar. n1 = 100 n2 = 300 - n1 theta = 2 # true mean sigw = 1 # common within-study variance # generate whole dataset X = rnorm( n1 + n2, mean = theta, sd = sigw ) # split into 2 subsamples X1 = X[1:n1] X2 = X[1:n2] # get point estimates and SEs for each subsample ests = c( mean(X1), mean(X2) ) ses = c( sd(X1) / sqrt(n1), sd(X2) / sqrt(n2) ) # meta-analyze them library(metafor) ES = escalc( measure = "MD", yi = ests, sei = ses ) m = rma.uni(ES, method = "REML") # compare point estimate to aggregate analysis m$b; mean(X) # compare inference to aggregate analysis sqrt(m$vb); sd(X) / sqrt(n1 + n2)
