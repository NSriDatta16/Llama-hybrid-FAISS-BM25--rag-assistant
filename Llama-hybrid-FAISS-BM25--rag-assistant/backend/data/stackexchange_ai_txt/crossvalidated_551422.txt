Conclusion : If asked for the limiting proportion of heads, the correct answer is $1/2$ regardless of paradigm. If asked for the frequentist predictive p-value testing the hypothesis that the coin landed heads, the answer is $1/3$ . If asked for the updated Bayesian belief of the subject whether the coin landed heads, the answer is $1/3$ . Solution : To resolve the paradox it is unavoidable that we must first define and interpret what probability means. The frequentist interpretation is that probability measures the emergent pattern of many samples; the Bayesian interpretation is that probability measures the subjective belief of the experimenter or in this case the subject. Let $X$ be the random variable governing the fair coin toss, where $X=1$ (heads) with a long-run limiting proportion $\theta=1/2$ . If we adopt a frequentist interpretation, then the long-run limiting proportion of heads for the fair coin under investigation, $\theta=1/2$ , is the probability of heads regardless of who is perceiving the flip and when. If we adopt a Bayesian interpretation then "probability of heads" initially references the prior predictive distribution for the coin landing heads, $P(X=1)=\int P(X=1|\theta=c)\cdot dP(\theta\le c)$ , based on perfect knowledge that the limiting proportion of heads is $\theta=1/2$ with belief probability $P(\theta=1/2)=1$ . To the Bayesian the limiting proportion of heads, $\theta$ , is not a probability. The experimenter's belief, $P(X=1)$ , is the probability, which can later change. If the experimenter had imperfect knowledge of $\theta$ then $P(\theta)$ would not be a degenerate distribution and $P(X=1)$ would represent the experimenter's belief in $X=1$ with imperfect knowledge of $\theta$ . Using Bayes' theorem, Sleeping Beauty's prior predictive distribution for heads is updated based on the information available to her about the number of possible awakenings (1 or 2), forming a posterior predictive distribution. This results in a predictive belief probability of $1/3$ that the coin landed heads, $P(X=1|\text{awakening}=1 \cup \text{awakening}=2)=$ $\frac{P(\text{awakening}=1\cap X=1)}{P(\text{awakening}=1\cup \text{awakening}=2)}$$ $$=\frac{1/3}{1}=1/3$ Analogous to Bayesian predictive probabilities, Sleeping Beauty could calculate frequentist predictive p-values and prediction confidence levels which describe the long-run performance of the prediction based on observed data without conditioning on parameter values. The predictive p-value is the probability of the discrepancy between the estimated future result and the hypothesized future result or something more extreme. In this setting Sleeping Beauty's knowledge of the coin being fair is equivalent to having already flipped the coin a near infinite number of times. Therefore, the predictive p-value testing the hypothesis that the coin landed heads is equivalent to the limiting proportion of heads over repeated experiments where Sleeping Beauty is woken twice on tails and once on heads, $P(X=1|\text{awakening}=1 \cup \text{awakening}=2)=1/3$ . We are considering each prediction opportunity as an experiment and an opportunity to make a type I error, not every coin flip. Upon every awakening Sleeping Beauty will predict the coin landed tails, incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis 33% of the time in repeated testing . Every time she is woken and tests the hypothesis that the coin landed heads she is 67% confident in the alternative, which is tails. If asked for the limiting proportion of heads, the correct answer is $1/2$ regardless of paradigm. If asked for the frequentist predictive p-value testing the hypothesis that the coin landed heads, the answer is $1/3$ . If asked for the updated Bayesian belief of the subject whether the coin landed heads, the answer is $1/3$ .
