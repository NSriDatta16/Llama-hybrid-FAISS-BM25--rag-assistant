There is speed/security difference Storing temporary Data in Files Vs Temporary table?

If I want to store a simple variable, I could do in a php file that will be included later, and, when not needed anymore, be deleted, or in a MySQL table with the MEMORY storage engine which is better?(and fastest?) Storing in a MySQL table with the MEMORY storage engine. Storing in a "file.php" in some folder. (I create that file using php)
