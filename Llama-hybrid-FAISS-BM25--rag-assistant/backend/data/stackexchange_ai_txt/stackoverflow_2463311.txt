To offer a view from another angle if I may please (based on personal experience). You need to feel "the need of OOP" before you can actually understand what is it all about - IMHO, learning resources should come after this. One would basically "need" to be stuck in structural difficulties when writing relatively large piece of software written in procedural style (as opposed to Object Oriented, sorry if anyone disagree with the term). By then, he/she could try restructuring the code into objects to better organize it and, naturally, learn more about OOP in detail. Again, this is my personal experience and it brought me into understanding faster than any book. Just my two cents.
