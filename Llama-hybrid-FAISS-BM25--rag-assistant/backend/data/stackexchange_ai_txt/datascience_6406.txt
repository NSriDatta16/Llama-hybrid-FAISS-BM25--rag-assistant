How to evaluate clustering success in a completely unsupervised system?

The algorithm in question is Kohonen's SOM. But the question could also apply to PCA and some others. When the umatrix (or the codebook?) is examined, is there a way to tell how successful clustering was? And would it be a good idea to apply GA's to optimize size, lattice structure, learning rate, and the learning degradation functions as well as the epoch count for clustering, or is there a danger of overfitting in this instance? Assume that the SOM data is coming from a demonstrably weak PRNG and that the very first attempt shows a distinct structure. Is there some statistical property or algorithm that can evaluate the presence and degree of structure to be used for a GA fitness function?
