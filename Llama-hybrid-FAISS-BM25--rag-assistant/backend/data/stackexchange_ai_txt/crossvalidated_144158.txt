Daily Time Series Analysis

I am trying to do time series analysis and am new to this field. I have daily count of an event from 2006-2009 and I want to fit a time series model to it. Here is the progress that I have made: timeSeriesObj = ts(x,start=c(2006,1,1),frequency=365.25) plot.ts(timeSeriesObj) The resulting plot I get is: In order to verify whether there is seasonality and trend in the data or not, I follow the steps mentioned in this post : ets(x) fit and in Rob J Hyndman's blog : library(fma) fit1 Both cases indicate that there is no seasonality. When I plot the ACF & PACF of the series, here is what I get: My questions are: Is this the way to handle daily time series data? This page suggests that I should be looking at both weekly and annual patterns but the approach is not clear to me. I do not know how to proceed once I have the ACF and PACF plots. Can I simply use the auto.arima function? fit *****Updated Auto.Arima results****** When i change the frequency of the data to 7 according to Rob Hyndman's comments here , auto.arima selects a seasonal ARIMA model and outputs: Series: timeSeriesObj ARIMA(1,1,2)(1,0,1)[7] Coefficients: ar1 ma1 ma2 sar1 sma1 0.89 -1.7877 0.7892 0.9870 -0.9278 s.e. NaN NaN NaN 0.0061 0.0162 sigma^2 estimated as 21.72: log likelihood=-4319.23 AIC=8650.46 AICc=8650.52 BIC=8682.18 ******Updated Seasonality Check****** When I test seasonality with frequency 7, it outputs True but with seasonality 365.25, it outputs false. Is this enough to conclude a lack of yearly seasonality? timeSeriesObj = ts(x,start=c(2006,1,1),frequency=7) fit returns: True while timeSeriesObj = ts(x,start=c(2006,1,1),frequency=365.25) fit returns: False
