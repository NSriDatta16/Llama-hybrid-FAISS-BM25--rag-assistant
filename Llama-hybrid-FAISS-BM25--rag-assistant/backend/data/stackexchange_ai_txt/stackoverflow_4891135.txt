iPhone: detect two finger touch

I need to detect two finger touch event. If i touch the screen with two fingers on same time, so everthing is ok. Just using such code: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; CGPoint point1 = [touch locationInView:self]; CGPoint point2 ; NSLog(@"First: %f %f", point1.x, point1.y) ; if ([[touches allObjects] count] > 1) { UITouch *touch2 = [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex:1]; point2 = [touch2 locationInView:self]; NSLog(@"Second: %f %f", point2.x, point2.y) ; } } But this code don't working if i hold one finger and then touch the screen with another finger. How to implement this ? Is it hard to do ?
