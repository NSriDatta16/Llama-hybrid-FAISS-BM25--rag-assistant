How I can define a weight matrix for a certain model?

I'm trying to develop a deep learning implementation in Python to learn how the math behind it works. I've seen a lot of tutorials and they define weight matrices with different sizes(2x2, 3x3, 4x3 ....). How can I define a matrix size for a certain type of model? The model I'm replicating is a linear model. So it's basics are: w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 ...
