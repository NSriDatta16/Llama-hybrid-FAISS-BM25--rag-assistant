Use an ORM. To find out more about ORM, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping . Some choices for .Net are: NHibernate : Most powerful one but has a deep learning curve. Free and open source. Entity Framework: EF1 was not very promising But it seems like Microsoft is investing heavily on it since EF4 is very more powerful. Since you mentioned ASP.Net 4, I suggest you take a look at EF4. SubSonic Has a fast learning curve. Easy to use. Best for small-medium applications IMO. Free and open source. The most famous commercial ORMs are Active Record , LLBLGen (Which has its own ORM and also is an OR-Mapping generator), DevForce (Free for databases with less than 10 tables) You might want to take a look at this blog post to see a list of most famous ORMs available.
