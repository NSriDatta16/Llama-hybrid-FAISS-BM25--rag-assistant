Some suggestions: 1) ASP.NET Gridview ---use the free Visual Studio to create an asp.net page ...can do VB, C#, etc. ---drag/drop a gridview control on your page, then connect it to your data and display fields, all via wizard (you did say quick and dirty, correct?). No coding required if you can live within the wizard's limitations (which aren't too bad actually). The type of database (mySQL or otherwise) isn't relevant. Other quick and dirty approach might be Access itself -- it can create 'pages', I think, that are web publishable. If you want to put a little more work into it, ASP.NET has some other great controls / layout capability (non-wizard derived). Also, you could look at SSRS if you have access to it. More initial setup work, but has the option to let your users create their own reports in a semi-Access-like fashion. Web accessible. Good luck.
