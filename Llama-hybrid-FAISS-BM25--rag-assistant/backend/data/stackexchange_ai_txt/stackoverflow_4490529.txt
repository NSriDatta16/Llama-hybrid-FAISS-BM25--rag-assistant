Scott suggests the POCO template as an option , not a requirement. You don't need to use it. Scott's strategy also works with non-POCO entities. The effort would be high if unit testing were the only benefit. But since you also get a well structured application organized along commonly-understood patterns, good unit testing is really just icing on the cake with Scott's architecture.
