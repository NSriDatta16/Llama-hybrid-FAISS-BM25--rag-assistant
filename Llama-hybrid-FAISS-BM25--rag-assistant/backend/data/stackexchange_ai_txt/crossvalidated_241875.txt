Learning machine learning through guided discovery

There is a huge thread on learning mathematics through guided discovery over at math SE. I hope we can get one here as well. I am currently trying to get through Pattern Classification by Duda et al (for a course). However, the book seems too dense for me. It seems like a topic that could be better learned through guided discovery. Are there any books out there that teach one or more of the topics in pattern recognition through guided discovery?
