Given an Eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix $$ \bar{X}\bar{X}^T = LDL^T $$ where $D = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n)$ is the diagonal matrix of Eigenvalues, ordinary whitening resorts to transforming the data into a space where the covariance matrix is diagonal: $$\sqrt{D^{-1}}L^{-1}\bar{X}\bar{X}^TL^{-T}\sqrt{D^{-1}} = \sqrt{D^{-1}}L^{-1}LDL^TL^{-T}\sqrt{D^{-1}} \\ = \mathbf{I} $$ (with some abuse of notation.) That means we can diagonalize the covariance by transforming the data according to $$ \tilde{X} = \sqrt{D^{-1}}L^{-1}X. $$ This is ordinary whitening with PCA. Now, ZCA does something different--it adds a small epsilon to the Eigenvalues and transforms the data back. $$ \tilde{X} = L\sqrt{(D + \epsilon)^{-1}}L^{-1}X. $$ Here are some pictures from the CIFAR data set before and after ZCA. Before ZCA: After ZCA with $\epsilon = 0.0001$ After ZCA with $\epsilon = 0.1$ For vision data, high frequency data will typically reside in the space spanned by the lower Eigenvalues. Hence ZCA is a way to strengthen these, leading to more visible edges etc.
