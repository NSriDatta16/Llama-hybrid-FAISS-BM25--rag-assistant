There is a way to change the color of the caret by retemplating the textbox. The caret blinks not by changing its color between black and white, but by changing its color between the background color and the XOR value of the background color (first paragraph in the More Info section here explains better what windows does to blink the caret). This applies to the native textbox and should apply to any "custom" written caret in order the keep the look'n'feel consistent with the Windows standards. For WPF there is a small workaround with which one could change the color of the caret: In this way you set the background color (yellow), the caret will blink between this color and the XOR yellow (blue), but the yellow background will never be rendered (because the template doesn't care about the Background color). (the code above is just an example to show what I mean, it doesn't contain all the visuals of a normal textbox, but those can be added easy).
