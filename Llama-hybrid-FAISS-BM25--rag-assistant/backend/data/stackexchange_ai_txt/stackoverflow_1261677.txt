How to store object + string pairs without retaining the objects, and what kind of storage to use?

I am implementing a class that has to store arbitrary objects together with a string. i.e. myUIViewObject, @"that's a nice view" myUIViewController, @"not really special" myOtherObject, @"very important one" this list can be extended and modified at any time, so I thought about using NSMutableDictionary here. But I am not really sure... The object should be the key, i.e. I want to find easily the matching string for myUIViewController or myOtherObject when I ask for it like so: - (NSString*)checkObjNoteStringForObject:(id)anyObjectInList; The other problem is, that when an object gets added to that "list", I don't want it to be retained because of that. NSMutableDictionary retains it's contents, right? Could I just send a -release afterwards to undo this unwanted behaviour, and when removing from the list just sending -retain before doing so? Or is there a more elegant way? What do you suggest? Thanks @ all!
