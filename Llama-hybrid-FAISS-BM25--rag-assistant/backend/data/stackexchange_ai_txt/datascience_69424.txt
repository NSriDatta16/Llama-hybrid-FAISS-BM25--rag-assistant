Is this a case of overfitting?

I am training a CNN-LSTM-FC network with around 1 Million parameters network for spatial time series prediction but the validation loss does not even come close to the training loss after 1-2 epochs. Is this a clear case of overfitting? Any inputs would be appreciated! I am using keras with tensorflow backend.
