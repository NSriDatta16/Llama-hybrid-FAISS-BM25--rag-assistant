Reading/writing to isolated storage is no different than reading/writing to regular file system. So if you wish to store your object into isolated storage, you need to serialize it - you have quite a few serialization options in .NET including runtime serialization, xml serialization, DataContract (WCF) serialization, JSON serialization etc. Use one that suites you and don't forget about versioning your objects. Object serialization will give you bytes or characters stream that you can persist in isolated storage. To get started with isolated storage, you can refer below links: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/IsolatedStorage.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ak841sy(v=VS.100).aspx
