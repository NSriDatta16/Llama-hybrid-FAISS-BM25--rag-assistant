How to predict probabilities for a target variable?

I came across a kaggle challenge where you have to predict the probabilities for all matchups in a basketball tournament. I was already working with classification and regression algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Nerual Networks etc. Therefore I used R and the caret package. But as the result you always get the final classificated class without the respective probability. E.g. it would either classify 1 if the team home wins and 0 when the team away wins. How can you predict the respective probability that you can say team home has a 82% chance to win?
