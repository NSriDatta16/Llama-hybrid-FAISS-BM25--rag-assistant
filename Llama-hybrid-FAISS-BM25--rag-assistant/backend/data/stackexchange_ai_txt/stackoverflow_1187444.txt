Drag and drop virtual files using IStream

I want to enable drag and drop from our windows forms based application to Windows Explorer. The big problem: The files are stored in a database, so I need to use delayed data rendering. There is an article on codeproject.com , but the author is using a H_GLOBAL object which leads to memory problems with files bigger than aprox. 20 MB. I haven't found a working solution for using an IStream Object instead. I think this must be possible to implement, because this isn't an unusual case. (A FTP program needs such a feature too, for example) Edit: Is it possible to get an event when the user drops the file? So I could for example copy it to temp and the explorer gets it from there? Maybe there is an alternative approach for my problem...
