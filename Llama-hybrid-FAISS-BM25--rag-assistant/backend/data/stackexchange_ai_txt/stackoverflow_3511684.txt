How to GroupBy 2 values in a Generic list, VB.NET?

I'm using VB.NET on Framework 2.0. I'm looking to quickly group a Generic List<> by two properties. For the sake of this example lets say I have a List of an Order type with properties of CustomerId, ProductId, and ProductCount. How would I get the average of ProductCounts grouped by CustomerId and ProductId in VB.NET ? Unfortunatly I cannot do this at DB level (which would have been easy). Also I cannot use LINQ or Lambada as Im on Framewwork 2.0. So I need to do this at application level in VB.net. The list is returned to me sorted by CustomerId and ProductId so I guess with a few loop sI should be able to create a average value for but there must be a cleaner way to do this?
