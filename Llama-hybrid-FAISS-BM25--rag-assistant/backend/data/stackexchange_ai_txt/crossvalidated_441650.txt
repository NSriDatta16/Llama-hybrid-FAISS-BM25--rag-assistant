Interaction effect and collinearity: important or not? Influence of precipitation on foraging behavior?

I am facing a pretty straightforward case. I wish to test whether precipitation, represented as interaction effect between two numerical variables ( number of strong showers x highest rainfall recorded over a month) affect the foraging behavior of an animal (i.e. number of prey eaten ) at different locations with varying prey availability (i.e. location ID : categorical variable). I tried fitting in R both a linear model (lm) and a mixed effect model (lmer) with location respectively as explanatory variable and random effect. For the latter model for instance, I get the following result: lmer(eaten ~ nshowers*maxprec + (1|location), REML=FALSE) Estimate df p-value (Intercept) 1297 24.95 0.43 nshowers -23350 19.95 0.012 * maxprec 711 20.74 0.177 nshowers*maxprec 32117 19.93 0.0005*** (Note that I have scaled the explanatory variables to allow to compare their effects.) Now my problem is the following: there is collinearity between nshowers and maxprec (r=0.47) and obviously also between the interaction effect (nshowers*maxprec) and the two related variables, esp. with nshowers (r=0.8 and VIF > 40). My question is therefore simply: do these two collinearities matter here? (And also, how should the coefficients for nshowers and nshowers*maxprec, which are of similar magnitude but opposing signs, be interpreted?)
