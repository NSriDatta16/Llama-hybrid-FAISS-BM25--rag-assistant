We have it organized like this (C++): package/Class.cpp package/Class.hpp package/test/ClassUnitTest.cpp package/test/ClassIntegrationTest.cpp test/unit-test/main.cpp test/integration-test/main.cpp test/data test/tmp Where unit-test and integration-test are just the test runners, test/data holds data files that are used by the integration tests and test/tmp holds temporary files created by the same tests and is cleared for each test suite.
