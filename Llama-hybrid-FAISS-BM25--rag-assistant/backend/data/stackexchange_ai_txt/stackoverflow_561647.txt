++i doesn't need a temporary variable to store stuff in. Think of them like this: ++i int preIncrement(int i) { i = i + 1; return i; } i++ int i = 5; // as an example int postIncrement(_i) { int temp = _i; i = _i + 1; return temp; } See? Postincrement requires a temporary variable. Assuming the compiler doesn't sort it all out for you, which it almost certainly does. Of course, more important is program logic; you run the risk of encountering The Sad Tragedy of Micro-Optimisation Theatre if you worry about this too much...:)
