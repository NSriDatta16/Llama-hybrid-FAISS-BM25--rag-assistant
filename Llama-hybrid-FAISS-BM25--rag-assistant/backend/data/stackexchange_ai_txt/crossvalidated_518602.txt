Convolutional Neural Network nonlinearity understanding

In convolutional neural networks, we apply filters to an input image and get a feature map. Then we apply a nonlinearity function ReLu. I am not sure I understand what the nonlinearity function is applied on. Is it applied to each of the entries on the feature map?
