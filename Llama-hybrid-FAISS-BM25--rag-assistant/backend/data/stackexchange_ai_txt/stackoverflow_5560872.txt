I found a blog that explained what I think you are asking. How to display a dynamic datatable when you don't know what the columns are until run time. You can loop through the columns in model to build the grid, then use ajax to go get the data. Here the link www.alexrogan.com Here is how you can loop through the column values of a datatable to create the grid columns. .Columns(columns => { foreach (System.Data.DataColumn column in Model.Columns) { columns.Bound(column.DataType, column.ColumnName); } })
