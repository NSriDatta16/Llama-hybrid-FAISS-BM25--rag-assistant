I am a little bit confused by your language. Do you mean how do I weight the past to make a prediction e.g. a 12 period moving average ? An ARIMA model determines the number of observations to be used (window ? ) and how to optimally weight the values in the window. One example is to assign a weight of 1 to the last observation and zero elsewhere . Another example might be to equally weight the last k observations. An ARIMA model can be expressed in these terms (Pi Weights). Your first proposal: THe updating could be as simple as tuning the parameters or tuning paramnters and possibly changing the model. This approach would give you an honest estimate of out-of-sample performance. Your second proposal would be better if either the parameters were changing , or the model was changing or the error variance eas changing as only new data would be used. The problem with that is discarding/ignoring previous values comes at a price with respect to model formulation. Recently I suggested to a client that they take 1200 historical(daily values) and predict 30 days out at some 20 time points in the past and measure the weighted MAPE for a 30 day period. The forecasts at each point would be premised on data up to that point and care given to validating the the parameters/model had not changed up to that point and that the error variance had passed the variance constancy requirement. In this way they could have an empirical distrivution of the expected MAPE from any future origin to use as a benchmark or expected MAPE. In this way unusual mapes vould be identified. Unusual MAPE's can suggest a change in the DGP ( Data Generation Process) or a deficiciency in the Modelling Process. It appears to me that your primary concern is to sense/challenge hoe many points are actually used to form a model. Which by the way has been a primary focus of mine /
