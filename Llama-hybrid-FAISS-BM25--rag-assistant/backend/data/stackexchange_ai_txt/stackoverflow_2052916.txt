Drag'n'drop files from (e.g.) iPhone in Windows Explorer onto a WPF application

I have a C# WPF app that allows users to import files by dragging them in from Windows Explorer and dropping them on the main app window. It works fine when dragging files from physical disks, but when dragging files from a connected device like an iPhone or camera connected via USB, I don't recognise any of the data formats returned by dragEventArgs.Data.GetFormats() in the window's Drop handler. Anyone care to share some tips or point me at a good example or walkthrough of how to read/import files from a 'virtual' filesystem in C#/.NET in this way? Thanks, Dylan
