I guess you could make it up yourself using these components which all partially solve your problem http://jamal-mvc.com/ -> lightweight MVC Jamal is a set of conventions and small javascript libraries to archieve a complete separation of html, css and javascript in your web application. Jamal is built on jQuery and inspired by MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails, CakePHP and its derivatives. The MVC concept is easy to adopt for javascript Controller: Interaction with the user interface (events) Model: Business Logic and AJAX calls View: DOM, CSS modifications ActiveRecord JS -> DB connector ActiveRecord.js is a cross browser, cross platform, stand-alone object relational mapper. It shares a very similar vocabulary to the Ruby ActiveRecord implementation, but uses JavaScript idioms and best practices -- it is not a direct port. It can operate using an in memory hash table, or with a SQL back end on the Jaxer platform (SQLite and MySQL), Adobe's AIR (SQLite) and Google Gears (SQLite). Support for the HTML 5 SQL storage spec is planned. jQuery tablesorter Plugin -> display table data (maybe you need to check if it supports or can be made to easily support editable cells)
