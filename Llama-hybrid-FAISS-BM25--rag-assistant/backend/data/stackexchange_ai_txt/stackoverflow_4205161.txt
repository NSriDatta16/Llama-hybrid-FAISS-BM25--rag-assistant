Magento: Can you set it so all Websites share the same order increment id sequence?

Does anyone know if it is possible to make it so all websites or stores share the same order increment ID. Basically we are working with an ERP system that is allowing us to submit our Invoice number to be the actual order number in the system, the thing is though, they only need one number sequence not a different one for each store like how Magento does by default.
