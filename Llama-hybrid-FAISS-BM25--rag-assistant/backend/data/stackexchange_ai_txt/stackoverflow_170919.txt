I've used 3 different ways to store phone numbers depending on the usage requirements. If the number is being stored just for human retrieval and won't be used for searching its stored in a string type field exactly as the user entered it. If the field is going to be searched on then any extra characters, such as +, spaces and brackets etc are removed and the remaining number stored in a string type field. Finally, if the phone number is going to be used by a computer/phone application, then in this case it would need to be entered and stored as a valid phone number usable by the system, this option of course, being the hardest to code for.
