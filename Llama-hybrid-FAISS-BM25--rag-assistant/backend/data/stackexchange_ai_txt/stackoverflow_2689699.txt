iBatis mapping: map a string field into a List

is it possible to map a string field with a particular format like: aaa,bbb,ccc,ddd into a List having elements [aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd] using iBatis? What I need is to have in my model something like: public class Request{ private List fieldOne; public List getFieldOne(){....} public void setFieldOne(){....} } even if in my table the field is a simple string. Is this possible? Thanks Roberto
