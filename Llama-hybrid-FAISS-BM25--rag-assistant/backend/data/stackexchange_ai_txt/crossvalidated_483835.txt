It's important to get away from the idea that there is one "true" importance for a predictor. As you note, the coefficient for the same predictor changes depending on what other predictors are in the model. That's true in all regressions for an added or subtracted predictor that's correlated with both outcome and the included predictors. With logistic regression you can face this problem even if an omitted predictor isn't correlated with the included ones. "All models are wrong, but some are useful." . More complex models are typically better for prediction provided that you don't overfit the available data. But the cost of collecting the extra data either for the modeling or for future application might not be worth it. That's the business decision you might have to make, informed by statistical modeling.
