Sorry to add clutter without a clear answer for ya but this might be helpful: http://www.eecho.info/Echo/php/client-url-library-php-curl/ It appears you are in control of opening and closing the connections however in terms of returning this variable to the client and having it re-used I'm not sure that is possible (also it might just clean itself up out of your control), alternatively you might (depending on the end environment) consider using a Java backend, you could code up a simple server and just add the FTP code on top (mmm... cake). Some examples of what you'd need to do for that are here: http://fragments.turtlemeat.com/javawebserver.php http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-04-2003/jw-0404-ftp.html This assumes a pretty large amount of control of what's run in the server environment though so really depends on you owning the server basically or having full priveleges to do do what you want (like Amazon EC2 from what they advertise at least). You might be able to pull this off with Tomcat or some other JSP container and use JSPs instead of writing your own server but I don't know that you'd be able to persist the connection their either since it's sort of the same as PHP where the server generally interprets the file "on the fly" so to speak.
