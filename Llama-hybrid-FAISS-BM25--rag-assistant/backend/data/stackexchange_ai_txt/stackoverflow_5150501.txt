So, before I take a stab, I'd strongly recommend the book by OReilly, "Definitive Guide to JavaScript". I learned a ton in there (and subsequently forgot it when I didnt have to use it every day). So there's a lot of ways to skin this cat, but I the hardest part is to get the positions of the relevant things in a cross-browser way without using a library. I don't actually recall the exact syntax (so I won't try) but basically what you'll need to do is find the bounding box's position and the dragged element's position using this formula: http://blog.firetree.net/2005/07/04/javascript-find-position/ and then account for element widths and so on to stay inside the boxes.
