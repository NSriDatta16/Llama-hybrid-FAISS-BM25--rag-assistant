Your basically looking for an auditing solution, right? I know Hibernate has functionality for it using an addon project called Hibernate Envers. This quickest thing I could find on this is this blog post . As for NHibernate, I believe there's work being done on porting Envers to NHibernate, to leverage this functionality for the .NET community as well. I think it would be worth it to find out what the ETA on that is, before diving into a separate solution. If you can get it built into your ORM that's nice, right? ;-) Just checked quickly, I think Tuna Toksoz is working on it, at least according to his twitter feed.
