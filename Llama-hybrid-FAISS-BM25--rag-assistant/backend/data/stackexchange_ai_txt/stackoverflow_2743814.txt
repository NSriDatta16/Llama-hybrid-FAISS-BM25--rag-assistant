Defining ways to visualise admin fields - Django

I'm trying to add graphs to the admin interface, problem is that I have not found any documentation regarding this. I'm sure there are generally accepted ways of customizing the way fields are displayed, and I do not wish to follow any problematic route. Any ideas? Edit: this is a model I'm trying to reproduce! Unicorn : name, horn length (cm), daily grass grazed (sparkline), average speed (m/s) daily grass grazed is a OneToManyField and this is what I mean by sparkline
