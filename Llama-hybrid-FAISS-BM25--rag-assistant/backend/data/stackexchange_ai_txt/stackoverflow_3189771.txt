Slow query for update/delete sql statements

In mysql there are lot of slow queries, only related to update and delete statements. The tables have 2 index columns and not heavily indexed tables. Each table having 30K records on average. Please give your suggestions on how to overcome the slow queries related to update and delete queries. These kind of queries: DELETE FROM WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM WHERE ID2=100); ...or: UPDATE SET =0 WHERE id=1001;
