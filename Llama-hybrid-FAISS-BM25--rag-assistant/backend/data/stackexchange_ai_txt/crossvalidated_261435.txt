It is hard to see without further information why one would lie to code a binary variable as $(-1,5)$ , but it is fairly easy to see how the coefficient changes with a simple experiment: lets create a random data.frame in R with 100 observations, where salary has a mean of 60K with a standard deviation of 15K: set.seed(10) df $gender5 gender == 0, -1, 5) Now gender is coded $(0,1)$ and gender5 is coded $(-1,5)$ . Lets regress salary with gender with the original encoding and with the new one: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 61291 1994 30.736 |t|) (Intercept) 60220.7 1692.1 35.589 So: coefficient: The coefficient has a simple meaning always - whats the average difference in salary between the two categories. The first coding $(0,1)$ is very intuitive and so is used often, and is easily understood when viewed through the regression equation: $\hat{salary}=61,291-6,421\times gender$ . If males are coded $1$ and females $0$ , than males predicted average salary is $61,421-6,421\times 1=54,870$ or simply $6,421$$ less than females. When the coding changes, so does the meaning. Now instead a gap of $1$ , we have a gap of $6$ . Now if we want to predict men, we will do: $\hat{salary}=60,220.7-1,070.2\times 5 = 54,870$ . Exactly the same (with a rounding error). The gap is not $1$ now, but $6$ . Multiplying slope coefficient by $6$ , e.g., $-1,070.2\times 6=-6,421$ and we arrive back at the slope coefficient using the first coding scheme $(0,1)$ . This is just much less intuitive to calculate. Standard Error : Same shtick. The $s.e.$ is dependent on the distribution. if you change it, you change the deviation. so $2765/6=460.9$ T and significance value : Should not change. If it did, there probably is a problem somewhere. re-coding the variables changes the coefficients, but not the significance values.
