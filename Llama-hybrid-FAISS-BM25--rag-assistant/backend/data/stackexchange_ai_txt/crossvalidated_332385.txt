Markov Chains does not look to be a solution. The reason is that MC use the fact that the conditional distribution fitted uses a fixed number of past dependent variables. In itâ€™s simplest form it fits the state at time t given only information about a fixed number of states from t-1 to t-p, together with ergodicity assumption. In other words it has a short fixed memory. The short memory problem fix was introduced by recurrent neural networks. This was refined with LSTM which introduced the idea of selective forgetness. Finally, I strongly suggest them for your problem, also because they allow variable length inputs.
