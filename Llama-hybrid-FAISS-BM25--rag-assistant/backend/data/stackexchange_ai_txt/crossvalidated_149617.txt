Ability to perfectly fit the training set varies from model to model. It might not be possible to do it by fitting a mixture of distributions that you are using, but it should be possible to do it by fitting, say, a very deep decision tree. And you should not have any doubts: forcefully overfitting in this manner will most definitely defeat the whole purpose of machine learning.
