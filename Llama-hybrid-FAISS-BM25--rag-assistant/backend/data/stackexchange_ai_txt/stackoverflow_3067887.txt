The method showLoadingAnimationView returns a non auto-released view (retainCount -> 1), that you later (I assume) add to another view (retainCount -> 2). In hideLoadingAnimationView , you only remove the view from its superview (retainCount -> 1). There is a missing release in this method. That means that you should not call release in the showLoadingAnimationView .
