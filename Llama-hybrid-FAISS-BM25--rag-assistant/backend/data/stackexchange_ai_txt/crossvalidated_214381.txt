What exactly is the mathematical definition of a classifier / classification algorithm?

I just started an intro machine learning course, and to get things better organized in my head, I was trying to come up with exactly what is needed to completely specify a classification algorithm. I understand a precise mathematical definition may not be possible. Here's what I have: Let $\{X, Y\}$ denoted the data set (sample, label), $\theta$ the parameters. A classification algorithm is a decision function $f(x; \theta)$ together with a cost/risk function $C(f(\cdot; \theta), X, Y)$. Specifying the functional form of $f$ and $C$ completely specifies the classification algorithm. $\hat{\theta} = \arg\min_\theta C(\theta)$ defines the classifier. Examples I'm thinking of are maybe logistic regression, where $f$ is the logistic function and $C$ is the cross entropy cost, or linear regression, where $f$ is the linear function and $C$ is the sum of squares cost, or the perception algorithm, where the function $f$ is the linear function and $C$ is the sum of individual losses consisting of the kinked function. Is the above correct? Roughly? Where is it wrong?
