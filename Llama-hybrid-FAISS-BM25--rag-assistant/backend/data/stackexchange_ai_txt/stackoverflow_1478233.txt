Well after looking through the actual methods of the Telerik grid I have found a way to determine where a dropped row will be going and how to work with that. I'm including the following simple code to demostrate what I'm talking about. protected void uxSourceGrid_RowDrop(object sender, Telerik.Web.UI.GridDragDropEventArgs e) { for (int i = 0; i The important part to look for is this little gem e.DestinationGrid.ID . From this you can find the ID's of the target grids and with a little logic be able to sort out what you're going to do with the dropping of a row. I'm sure that this can be a little cleaner or more effeciently. But I just wanted to pass this information along to you all in case you ever come up against this same type of scenario.
