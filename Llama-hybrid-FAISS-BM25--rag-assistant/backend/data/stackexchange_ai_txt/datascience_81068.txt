It sounds like you’re overfitting the training data, and so you should research some approaches to regularisation of neural networks. I see you’ve used dropout, which is one of these, but may not be sufficient. You could also consider dividing your training data into a training set and a validation set and halting training when performance on the validation set stops improving. This is called early stopping
