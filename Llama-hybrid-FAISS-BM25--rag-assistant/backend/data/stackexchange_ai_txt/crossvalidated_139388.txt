Sample size for tracking data

I'm currently trying to figure out how to estimate a fitting sample size for a specific problem. The situation is as follows: We've got x people, of whom we are able to track y% - all the time, so we know where they are at any given time. Our subjects are free to move as they wish (inside of a specified area). I aim to identify the sample size as the percentage - i.e. the variable y - of the population that is necessary to extrapolate the movements of all subjects, fixing a error level (e.g. 5%) and a level of confidence (e.g. 90%). Since this scenario strikes me as being different from the questionnaire/survey-kind of problem that usually goes with examples for the calculation of sample sizes and I'm not that fit in statistics, I'm not quite sure if an approach like this would yield reasonable results: http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html . What do you think? Thanks for your time! Edit: The ability to track the subjects doesn't depend on their time or location. We have complete information of the position of the randomly selected and tracked sample of y% of all subjects at any time, regardless of where they are. Edit 2: The parameter I want to measure is the time spent on average by a subject in a subsection of the area to investigate (imagine a simple quadratic map with quadrants A1, A2, ..., B1, ...). The deviation between sample and population would be measured as difference between the actual average time spent in a quadrant and average time spent there as measured via the sample.
