What is the name of non-neural network algorithms

i am writing papers for my academic degree on machine learning. everytime I get confused when I try to put a name for standard algorithms (KNN, Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc) ( the non-neural network algorithms) are they called standard algorithms? or classic algorithms? or generic algorithms? is there a name that is used for these kind of algorithms?
