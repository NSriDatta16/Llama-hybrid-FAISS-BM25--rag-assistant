Can one predict the histogram $H(f)$ of some time series $f(t)$?

Say I am measuring a continuous signal and have a time series $f(t)$ with a known expression (for example, a Gaussian wave packet) between some $t_1,t_2$ , is there a way to compute the histogram function $H(f)$ (or $P(f))$ without using manual computation like the "hist" function? Or at least predict its asymptotic behavior? Thanks in advance
