Why don't you use their own initialization code since version 4.3: content here... oUtil.initializeEditor("innovaeditor", {width:"700px", height:"450px"} ); The method is oUtil.initializeEditor(selector, option). The first parameter is selector and second is editor properties in JSON format. The selector can be: Css class name, if class name is specified all textareas with specified class name will be replaced with editor. Textarea Id. If it is an Id, a prefix '#' must be added, for example oUtil.initializeEditor("#mytextarea"). Textarea object. The second parameter is editor's properties. All valid editor's properties can be specified here for example width, height, cmdAssetManager, toolbarMode, etc. Note that this method can be called from page onload or document ready event or during page load (as long as the object referred by selector are already rendered). This method available automatically when the page include the editor script.
