Let's say I'm convinced that the coin is fair. If the coin was fair then the probability of having 10 heads in a row is $$p_{10}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10}=\frac{1}{1024} I'll leave it to you to apply Bayesian approach and get to a similar conclusion. You'll start with prior probability of heads $p=\frac{1}{2}$, then update it with observation of 10 heads in a row, and you'll see how posterior probability of heads $\pi>\frac{1}{2}$ UPDATE @oerkelens example can be interpreted in two ways. your friend bet on THHTTHTTHT, then tossed a coin 10 times and got: THHTTHTTHT. In this case you'll be as surprised as with 10 heads in a row, and start doubting the fairness of a coin. You're not sure what to think about the probability of tail in the next toss, because your friend seems to be able to get exactly what he wants, this is not random. you threw a coin 10 times, and observed some combination which happened to be THHTTHTTHT, you'll notice there were 6 tails and 4 heads, which is $p=\frac{10!}{6!4!2^{10}}\sim 0.2$, which is unremarkable. Hence, the probability of a tail in the next toss is probably $\frac{1}{2}$, since there's no reason to doubt its fairness. Also, one could argue that although 0.001 is a small probability, if you toss 10 coins 100,000 times, you're bound to see a few 10-head combinations. True, but in this case you have 1 million coin tosses in total, and you're looking for at least one 10-head combination in the sequence. The frequentist probability of observing at least one 10-head combination is computed as follows: $$1-\left(\frac{1}{2^{10}}\right)^{100,000}\approx 1$$ So, the frequentist will conclude after long months of tossing a coin 1 million times and observing a 10-head combination, that it's no big deal, things happen. He will not be making any adjustments to his expectations about the probability of the next head, and leave it at 0.5 FOR COMPUTER PEOPLE If your friends are computer programmers then I found that the easiest way to appeal to their intuition is through programming. Ask them to program the coin toss experiment. They'll think a little bit then come up with something like this: for i=1:11 if rand()>0.5 c='H'; else c='T'; end fprintf('%s',c) end disp '.' THTHTHTHHHT. You'll ask them where's your code for handling 10 heads in a row here? It appears that in your code regardless of what happened in first 10 loops, the 11th toss has 0.5 probability of heads. However, this case appeals to the fair coin toss. The code is designed with a fair coin toss. In case of 10 heads though, it's highly unlikely that the coin is fair.
