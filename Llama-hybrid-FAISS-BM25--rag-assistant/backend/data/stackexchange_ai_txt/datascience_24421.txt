Does anyone know how google play music's recommendation engine works?

What sort of models do they use? Presumably some flavor of neural net. Do they do a lot of feature engineering? Or do they throw in huge raw matrices of oscilloscope output? Given that it must be supervised learning, what is their target? A thumbs up? How do they deal with heterogeneity in the population? We're not independent nor are we identically distributed. It seems like it works better lately. Curious how it works.
