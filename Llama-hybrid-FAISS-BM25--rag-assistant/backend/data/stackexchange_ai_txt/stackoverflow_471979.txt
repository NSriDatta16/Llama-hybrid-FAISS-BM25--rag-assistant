Slow response-time cheat sheet

Does anyone have links to current and historical papers and authoritative links (statistics and blog posts) regarding response-time for user interfaces? Naturally the authoritative link is Human factors design criteria in man-computer interaction Some key quotes include: [Regarding] response to request for next page. […] Delays of longer than 1 second will seem intrusive on the continuity of thought. And Assume an inquiry of any kind has been made. The user – and his attention – is captive to the terminal until he receives a response. If he is a busy man, captivity of more than 15 seconds, even for information essential to him, may be more than an annoyance and disruption. It can readily become a demoralizer – that is a, reducer of work pace and of motivation to work. These quotes are 40 years old, yet so relevant today. There is also Jacob Nielsen's authoritative excerpt . I would like to collect all the links to this kind of research under this community wiki. Next time you are told to ignore response times by your manager or build a feature that will slow down your application you can simply send them a link to this page.
