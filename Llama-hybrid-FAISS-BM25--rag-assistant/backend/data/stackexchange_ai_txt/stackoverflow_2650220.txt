Python Fabric: How to handle arbitrary remote shell prompt for input?

This is related to this question here, but with a slight twist: instead of just passing 'yes' or 'no', I need Fabric to pass an arbitrary string to the remote shell. For instance, if the remote shell prompts for 'what is your name?' then I need to feed it 'first,last'. Clarification: I know I said arbitrary input, but I was really trying to use it for the SSH key passwd prompt when I try to do a git pull . Update #1: Got a response from Jeff Forcier @bitprophet thatâ€™s like the #1 wart right now :( Either tunnelling to send a key agent out-of-band, or remote prompting, is needed. I meant adding support for those things in Fabric, is what we need to do to get network-borne git ops working Adding an easy way to kick off an OOB ssh agent-friendly tunnel is going to be easier/faster, most likely. Soon probably
