Have the user run the app in compatibility mode for XP. Just drag a shortcut onto the desktop, right-click, Properties. Then on the Compatibility tab, set it to "run in compatibility mode for:" and pick "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)". And also "disable display scaling on high DPI settings". See if that helps. It just might.
