Adding to @RobertLong's answer, there is a slight conceptual mistake in the way $b_2$ is described in the question in the case where $X_1$ was centered. It is indeed true that $b_2$ becomes the average effect of $X_2$ over all possible values of $X_1$ , in the sense that $\overline{b_2+b_3X_1}=b_2$ , but it should be emphasized that this is an average of simple effects . It may have nothing to do with the main effect of $X_2$ on the DV, which means that $b_2$ may be really far from $B_2$ even without interaction. Here is an example where there is no interaction, and $b_2$ and $B_2$ have nothing in common: the vertical axis is the DV $Y$ , the horizontal axis is for the covariate $X_2$ , and the colors stand for levels of the covariate $X_1$ . For any value of $X_1$ , the simple effect $b_2+b_3X_1$ is around $-1$ , while the main effect $B_2$ is clearly positive.
