Checking assumptions of Mixed Models with R code

Context and current approach: I read through quite a few posts on this website and on the internet but I'm still not 100% sure on what exactly the assumptions are and how to check them in practice. Below a (hopefully exhaustive) list of the assumptions I have in mind: The model is correctly specified (i.e. linear relationships between outcome and continuous predictors, no perfect colinearities) Samples are independent (obviously after e.g. repeated measures have been taking into account) Residuals on all levels have constant variance (that is, the "errors" and the random effects) Residuals on all levels are normally distributed (again that needs to be true for "errors" and the random effects) Having all of this in mind, I'm now looking to use R to check these assumptions. We can use some built in data from the lme4 package library("lme4") data("sleepstudy") head(sleepstudy) # Some simple MM sleepstudy_model=lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 | Subject), sleepstudy) We can look at the "errors" here if we want to see if there's a pattern, check colinearity between predictors, etc. plot(sleepstudy_model) We just consider the design of the study at hand for this. I assume we can look for patterns in the "error" terms again. plot(sleepstudy_model) Here it gets trickier for me.. For the "errors" it's simple, but what about the random intercept? # Checking for the errors, just look for a pattern in here plot(sleepstudy_model) #But what about the random intercept? Something like this? plot(data.frame(ranef(sleepstudy_model)) $condval, data.frame(ranef(sleepstudy_model))$ condsd) Same thing here, it's easy for the "errors", but I'm not sure about the random intercept. # Checking for the errors qqnorm(residuals(sleepstudy_model)) #Checking for the random intercept? qqnorm(data.frame(ranef(sleepstudy_model))$condval) Question: Did I list all necessary assumptions correctly? If yes, did I correctly check for all of them? Are the any additional nice ways to check for some?
