Storing Equal Signs (=) in XML Documents

I'm facing a problem that Google couldn't solve yet! I'm trying to store URLs in an XML file. Problem is that these URLs contain Equal Signs (=) in them. And that generates an error. Here is my code: (**token is a variable that contains the URL) Dim child As String = vbCrLf & " " Dim fragment As XmlDocumentFragment = doc.CreateDocumentFragment fragment.InnerXml = child The error message: (Error line and position are meaningless here) '=' is an unexpected token. The expected token is ';'. Line 2, position 133. I've replaced all '&' symbols with '&amp' in case they were the ones causing the error, but no luck so far.
