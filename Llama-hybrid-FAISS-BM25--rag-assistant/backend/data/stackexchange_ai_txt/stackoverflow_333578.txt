PEGs are the new hotness, but there are still a ton of projects that use yacc or tools more modern than yacc. I would frown on a new project that chose to use yacc, but for existing projects porting to a more modern tool may not make sense. This makes having rough familiarity with yacc a useful skill. If you're totally unfamiliar with the topic of parser generators I'd encourage you to learn about one, any one. Many of the concepts are portable between them. Also, it's a useful tool to have in the belt: once you know one you'll understand how they can often be superior compared to regex heavy hand written parsers. If you're already comfortable with the topic of parsers, I wouldn't worry about it. You'll learn yacc if and when you need to in order to get something done.
