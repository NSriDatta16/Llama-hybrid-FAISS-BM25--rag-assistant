It's certainly possible that an intermediate proxy (corporate or otherwise) is caching your pages. Although I don't understand how that would explain the cart number on the page changing . If you don't want any caching to take place, send the appropriate HTTP headers along with each request you don't want cached: Cache-Control: private, no-store, max-age=0 Expires: Pragma: no-cache The first line above is for HTTP 1.1 clients, and the second 2 are for HTTP 1.0 clients. Check out section 14.9 of the HTTP 1.1 protocol spec for all the gory details.
