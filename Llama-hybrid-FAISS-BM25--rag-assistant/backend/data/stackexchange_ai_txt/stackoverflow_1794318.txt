RGoogleDocs and now RGoogleData

RGoogleDocs is fantastic. It allows one to store data on Google and read it in in real time to R. I tried to install it on a computer the other day and lo and behold all I could find was RGoogleData in RForge. What is the relationship between the two packages? I tried to google search RGoogleData and RGoogleDocs in the same search and found nothing. Duncan Temple Lang wrote RGoogleDocs and it appears that Adrian A. Dragulescu wrote RGoogleData. I could have sworn that a windows binary of RGoogleDocs had been posted in omegahat by Duncan Temple Lang but alas in the past couple of months I no longer see omegahat on the select repository option list from RGUI. Instead RForge is now on that list. What is the relationship between omegahat and RForge?
