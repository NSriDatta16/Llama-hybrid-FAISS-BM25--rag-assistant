95% CI for $\mu$ when $x \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$ or $\sigma^2 = 2$ with 50/50 chance

Here is a little brainteaser: Suppose we know $x|(\mu,\sigma^2) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and that $\sigma^2$ can either take on the value 1 or 2 on any particular draw from the distribution (i.e., there is a 50/50 chance that it will be 1 or 2). The goal is to construct a confidence interval with exactly 95% coverage for $\mu$. There are (at least) two angles of attack here: We know that the coverage of $x \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{1}$ is too low and the coverage of $x \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{2}$ is too high. But on any draw, we could randomly pick one or the other CI (i.e., we use a randomized CI). The problem is then figuring out with what probability we should pick the first or second interval, so that we end up with 95% coverage in the long run. We know that there is some value $\tilde{\sigma}^2$ between 1 and 2 that will give us the desired 95% coverage if we compute the CI with $x \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\tilde{\sigma}^2}$. The problem is then finding this $\tilde{\sigma}^2$ value. And just in case: This is not homework. If you care to check my profile and go to my website, you'll find that my school days are long over. I actually just constructed this little exercise myself and figured others may enjoy trying to solve it. I'll post an answer in due time.
