Magento's default import tool (DataFlow) is quite slow. For 5 million products I would rather recommend a custom optimized importer specific for your data format and working low-level (Resource Models level). You can also try http://www.unirgy.com/products/urapidflow/ and discuss with the author some ways of optimizing it. However usually only a small subset of such product import is really changed - does you distributor mark the rows that were really updated? By filtering them you will be able to speed up the process significantly.
