After thinking about the problem some more I was not able to satisfactorily answer whether or not the sampled accuracies from dependent test sets would be a valid way to generate confidence intervals for the accuracy of a model. I did however come up with a different way of solving the problem which might be useful for someone in the future. Instead of using rolling window analysis (as detailed in the post above and the link) you can simply take your time series and apply the bootstrap here. So let's say we have time series $T = [1:10]$ and a forecast horizon of two. We can generate $B$ bootstrapped datasets using a stationary bootstrap with a moving block size (optimally set to be $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ where $n$ is the length of $T$ ) as our time series data is dependent. This simplifies the problem as now we can simple use a simple out-of-sample method on each bootstrapped series. We can then compute the average accuracy on these out-of-sample test sets. With this method you will train $B$ models, each one on data that is assumed (due to the bootstrap) to share the same distribution as the original series $T$ . This way we can see how well the model has learnt the actual 'information within the series' as this should be shared among all the bootstrapped data sets and our test sets on the different models will be independent. As an example let's say $B=2$ (it should be much greater, but this is just an example) We generate then bootstrapped series $B_1$ and $B_2$ : $B_1 = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 8, 9, 10]$ $B_2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 4]$ We can then split these series leaving the length of our forecast horizon $H$ for each one as an out-of-sample test. $B_{\text{train}1} = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 8]$ , $B_{\text{test}1} = [9, 10]$ $B_{\text{train}2} = [4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4]$ , $B_{\text{test}2} = [3, 4]$ We can then train two models $M_1$ and $M_2$ on $B_{\text{train}1}$ and $B_{\text{train}2}$ respectively and compute an accuracy against the corresponding test set. We can then compute the standard error or any other statistic that we would like to from this population of samples and find a mean or standard deviation for example.
