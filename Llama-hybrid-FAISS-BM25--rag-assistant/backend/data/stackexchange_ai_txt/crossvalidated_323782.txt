How to visualize char-rnn model

I am looking for any resource or tutorial which can help me to understand the visualization done by Andrej Karpathyâ€™s blog ( http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ ) or the simpler example done here http://blog.echen.me/ . I have a working lstm model and found out (I think) how to get intermediate layers from my model (using keras) but didn't figure out what to do after. In Karpathy's paper ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078 ) they look for interpretable cells but it's not clear to me how to look for them or how to select them. Examples of visualization from Karpathy's blog post: Examples of visualization from Chen's blog post: (I will add some dummy code asap.) Edit 1: add some pictures Edit 2: reformulate
