I might be telling you something you already know, but keep in mind that really $\hat{f}(x)=\hat{f}(x,\{X_k\})$, where $\{X_k\}$ is the set of sample points over which you build your estimate. For most non-parametric estimators, the $X_k$ are assumed independent, and the method is additive, so you can just look at the $MSE$ of $\hat{f}(x,X_k)$ and then take an average. Then your formula is interpreted as $MSE(\hat f(x)) = E[(\hat f(x)-f(x))^{2}]=\int_\Omega(\hat{f}(x,z)-f(x))^2f(z)dz$, which yes, is the MSE error at the point $x$. As for the $MSEP$, I'm not entirely sure what your question is, but there are surely various ways to predict this. If you want to know the error expected at $x^*$, then I guess it probably does line up with the $MSE$, however, you might want to know for example the prediction error for a random $X^*$, in which case you might assume it is drawn from a $f(x)$ distribution, then you would want the $MISE$. Hope that helps clarify something.
