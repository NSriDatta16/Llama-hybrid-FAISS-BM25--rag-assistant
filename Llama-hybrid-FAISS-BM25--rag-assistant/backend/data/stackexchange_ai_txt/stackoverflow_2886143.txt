When rendering "stops" like that it almost always means Magento encountered a PHP error while trying to include in the phtml file. Take a look at your PHP and/or Apache error logs and see what PHP is complaining about. There's too many variables to troubleshoot things without that information. If you absolutely can't get at your error logs, delete your entire phtml file and then add code back line by line, block by block, until you can reproduce your problem, and then figure out what's wrong with the last bit you just added.
