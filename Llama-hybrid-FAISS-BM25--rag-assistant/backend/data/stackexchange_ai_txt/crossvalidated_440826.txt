Maximum Likelihood Fit for Non-Linear Regression

I am reading the blog on Bayesian priors and overfitting and it mentions that assume that a data is generated by the following function: $$y_t=\sin\left(\dfrac{x_t}{10}\right)+ \cos\left(z_t\right)+5d_t+4+\epsilon_t$$ Then it mentiones the following: It features a cyclic process with one event represented by the variable $\mathbf{d}$ . There is only 1 observation of that event so it means that maximum likelihood will always assign everything to this variable that cannot be explained by other data. I did not understand what is meant by this whole sentence. So essentially we are generating $y_t$ by recording the values such as $x_t, z_t,d_t,\epsilon_t$ overtime and then plotting the $y$ vs $t$ right? now does that statement mean that we only have a single value recorded for d? And what does MLE will assign everything to this variable that cannot be explained by other data mean? I would appreciate if a concrete formulation of MLE can be provided for the equation above as the original author did not provide any in the post.
