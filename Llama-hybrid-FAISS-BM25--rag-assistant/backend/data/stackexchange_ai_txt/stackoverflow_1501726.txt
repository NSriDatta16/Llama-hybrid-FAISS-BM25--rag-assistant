SplObjectStorage doesn't work with String, what to do?

Someone has suggested to e to use SplObjectStorage to keep track of a set of unique things. Great, except it doesn't work with strings. An error says " SplObjectStorage::attach() expects parameter 1 to be object, string given in fback.php on line 59" Any ideas?
