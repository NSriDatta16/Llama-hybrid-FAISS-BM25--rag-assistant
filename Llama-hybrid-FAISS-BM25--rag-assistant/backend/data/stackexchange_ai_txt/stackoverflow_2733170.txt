Publishing toolchain

I have a book project which I'd like to start sooner than later. This would follow an agile-like publishing workflow, i.e: publish early and often. It is meant to be self-publsihed by me and I'm not really looking to paper-publish it, even though we never know. If I weren't a geek, I'd probably have already started writting in Word or any other WYSIWYG tool and just export to PDF. However, we know it is not the best solution, and emacs rules my text-editing life, so, the output format should be as simple as possible and be text-based. I've thought about the following options: Just use orgmode and export to PDF (orgmode has this feature natively) Use markdown mode and export to PDF (markdown->LaTeX->PDF should not be hard to setup); Use something similar to what the guys @ Pragmatic Progammers do: A XML + XSLT + LaTeX. More complex, but much more control over the style. EDIT: Someone just told me that he uses a combo of Textile+Adobe In Design and the XTags plugin. Not sure how they are glued together though, gotta do some research. Any other ideas / references ? I want to start writting as soon as possible. In fact, I already have a draft in an org-formatted file. However, I do want to have and use the full power of LaTex later on to format it the way I want and make it look fabulous :) Thanks in advance, Marcelo.
