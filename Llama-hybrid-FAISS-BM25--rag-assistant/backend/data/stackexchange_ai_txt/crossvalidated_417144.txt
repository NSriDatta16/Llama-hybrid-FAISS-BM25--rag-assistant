Is Prophet from Facebook any different from a linear regression?

So what I've read about Facebook's prophet is that it basically breaks down the time series into trend and seasonality. For example, an additive model would be written as: $$ y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e_t $$ with $t$ the time $g(t)$ the trend (may it be linear or logistic) $s(t)$ the seasonality (daily,weekly,yearly...) $h(t)$ the holidays $e_t$ the error My questions are: Couldn't it be done with a simple linear regression? What would be the differences in term of results if we compared them, and why?
