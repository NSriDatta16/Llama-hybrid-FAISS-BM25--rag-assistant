The "detectseparation" package. How to interpret its results?

I am running a logistic regression on financial data of several companies. The dependent variable is the company to be a smoother (binary variable: 0, 1), and there are several independent variables: company age, company size, number of board meetings, etc. I tried to run a glm that detect any complete separation in this model through the R-package "detectseparation." The code in R was: detect the result was: We can see that there is always 0 next to each IV. What does 0 mean? How about -inf and +inf?
