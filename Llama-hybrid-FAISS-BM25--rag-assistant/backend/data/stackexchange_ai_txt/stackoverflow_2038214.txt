horizontally scrolling calendar

I've used the following script http://valums.com/scroll-menu-jquery/ to build a horizontally scrolling calender. Here is how I've implemented it. http://zifimusic.com/testing/horizontalCalendar.html 90% of the calendar activity I am expecting is within a month or two of the current date. However, I think I need to provide the ability to select any month. I was going to use the jQuery datepicker, but thought that this format allowed the user to always see the currently selected date, and allow me to mark out weeks or days that need attention in a interesting yet fairly simple interface, which (when styled) should take up considerably less height than a proper calendar. I'm sure I've seen calendars like this before, but I couldn't find a script for making one. I have two issues with this calender. 1) The year scrolls off the page, so you can't see what year you are looking at. I've added this line var windowWidth=jQuery(window).width(); div.mousemove(function(e){ jQuery('li.year').each(function(){ if(jQuery(this).offset().left>0 && jQuery(this).offset().left but it doesn't seem to be having the desired effect of having the year stay visible and somewhat line up within the scrolling of the dates. 2) the scrolling is kinda nasty. it jumps WAY to far at times, and I haven't been able to get a smoother animation. If you enter the scrolling area at the left, it takes a HUGE jump, because it is using the window offset as the definition of how far it should scroll. I think it would be much better if it only animated when the user scrolled left/right, but I haven't been able to get that. I've tried limiting the distance that the scroll travels, but then i don't get the entire calendar. Really what I'm looking for is what is the best way to enable scrolling on something like this. I should say that the use of the calendar is really for selecting weeks, not individual days, which makes this format easier again, because I can visually alternate weeks to create visible groupings.
