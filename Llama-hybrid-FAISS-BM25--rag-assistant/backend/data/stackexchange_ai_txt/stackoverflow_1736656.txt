Filtering the result of a JSON.parse response in Ruby (and the JSON gem)

In a little app I'm building, I'm using the the twitter_oauth gem ( source of the methods I'm using ), which incidentally means I'm dealing with the JSON ruby gem. I'm using the messages method, whose source is as follows: def messages(page=1) oauth_response = access_token.get("/direct_messages.json?page=#{page}") JSON.parse(oauth_response.body) end It parses the JSON produced by Twitter, using the JSON.parse method. Now, what I want to do is filter the response, so as to show only the messages sent by a certain user. In other words, I want to be able to get an accounts message's on a per user basis. I went through the JSON gem docs, but couldn't find an easy way to do this. I normally don't work with JSON (I prefer XML), but since the Twitter_oauth gem relies on it, I'm forced to learn it (unless I change the gem's source code or overwrite it - not of my preference). Does any one know a pragmatic way of sorting JSON in Ruby?
