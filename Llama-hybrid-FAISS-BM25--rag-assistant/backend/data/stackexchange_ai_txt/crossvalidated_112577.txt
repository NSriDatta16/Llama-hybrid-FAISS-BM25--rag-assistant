There are many options available in R . A nice place to look is the caret package which provides a nice interface to many other packages and options. You can take a look at the website here . There are many options out there, but I will illustrate one. Here is an example of using a simple filter using the built into R "mtcars" datasets (shown below). mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Now some code setup (loading packages, etc.): # setup a parallel environment library(doParallel) cl And we can fit a simple model to select variables: fit1 Viewing the results, we get: fit1 Selection By Filter Outer resampling method: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 10 times) Resampling performance: RMSE Rsquared RMSESD RsquaredSD 2.266 0.9224 0.8666 0.1523 Using the training set, 7 variables were selected: cyl, disp, hp, wt, vs... During resampling, the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 9): am (100%), cyl (100%), disp (100%), gear (100%), vs (100%) On average, 7 variables were selected (min = 5, max = 9) Finally we can plot the selected variables (in fit1$optVariables ) against the outcome, mpg : library(ggplot2) library(gridExtra) do.call(grid.arrange, lapply(fit1$optVariables, function(v) { ggplot(mtcars, aes_string(x = v, y = "mpg")) + geom_jitter() })) Resulting in this graph:
