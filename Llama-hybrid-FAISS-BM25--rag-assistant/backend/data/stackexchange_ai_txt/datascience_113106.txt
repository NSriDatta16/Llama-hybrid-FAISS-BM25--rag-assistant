Extracting a value from text based on training data?

I have a large structured dataset with 2 columns containing: A paragraph of text with various text and integers A integer that's found in the text within the first column What I want to do is train model that can extract the correct integer from future text ideally in Python. I have come across NER but I'm not sure if this is possible. Thanks for the help.
