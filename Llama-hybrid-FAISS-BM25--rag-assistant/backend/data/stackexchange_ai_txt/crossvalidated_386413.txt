Likelihood raised to a power; how to set the power?

Suppose ${\bf{\theta}} = (\theta_1 , \ldots, \theta_d)$ and you have a posterior as below: $$\pi(\theta | D ) \propto L(\theta |D ) \pi(\theta)$$ Suppose we are in active learning setting and need to update the posterior each time to determine the action needed to be taken in the next step. I used MCMC to sample from the posterior. At first, the sample size is very low but it increases gradually. Because of the low sample size, the prior influence is very high. To discount the prior effect, I raised the likelihood to a power $w$ which seems to me that it should decrease as we gather more data, and also it should be a function of inverse of variance of prior. There are a couple of approach here to set the power; they integrated out the posterior to find a function of the power and then they minimized a penalized likelihood function over the power. However, my posterior is complex and I cannot integrate it out. Also, in my case $w$ is way higher than 1. How to set $w$ ?
