Using html5 localstorage can I find the index corresponding to a key value

window.localStorage.setItem("Georgia","Atlanta") var x=window.localStorage.getItem("Georgia") I have a list of 50 states and the largest city stored in localstorage. Using the code above I can easily retrieve that Atlanta is the largest city for "Georgia". Is there an easy way to do a reverse lookup and search for "Atlanta" and get "Georgia"?
