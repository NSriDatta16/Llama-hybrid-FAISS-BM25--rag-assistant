what's a good CMS for e-commerce?

what's a good cms for web shops ? I've always used Drupal so far, but I haven't ever developed webshops. I saw there are Magento and a Drupal module Ubecart. I actually would like to know a "known, easy to use webshop framework so I don't have to take care abuot security issues.. etc thanks
