Make sure you set up an application configuration file {application, fred, [{description, "Your application"}, {vsn, "1.0"}, {modules, []}, {registered,[]}, {applications, [kernel,stdlib]}, {env, [ {param, 'fred'} ] ... and then you can set your command line up like this: -fred param 'billy' I think you need to have the parameter in your application configuration to do this - I've never done it any other way... Some more info (easier than putting it in a comment) Given this {emxconfig, {ets, [{keypos, 2}]}}, I can certainly do this: {ok, {StorageType, Config}} = application:get_env(emxconfig), but (and this may be important) my application is started at this time (may actually just need to be loaded and not actually started from looking at the application_controller code).
