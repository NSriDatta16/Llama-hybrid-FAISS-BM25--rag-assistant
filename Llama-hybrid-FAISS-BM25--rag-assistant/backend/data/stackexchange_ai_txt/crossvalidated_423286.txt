When and under what conditions would anyone perform cross validation on the test set?

Suppose we have a dataset $D\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ , where $n = 60000$ samples/observations and $p = 3072$ variables. To my understanding one would perform cross validation if found in one of the following scenarios: 1.) model evaluation (my use case scenario) 2.) model selection 3.) model comparison My approach involves splitting $D$ into $90\%/10\%$ as $D_{train}$ and $D_{test}$ equivalently. Then performing 10-fold stratified CV on $D_{train}$ which is further subdivided into $D_{learn}$ and $D_{valid}$ after every fold in order to get an estimate of model's generalisation performance and finally test on the untouched $D_{test}$ to get the final performance estimate. After every fold $k$ the model is trained on $D_{learn}$ for 100 epochs and evaluated on $D_{valid}$ . The average performance on $D_{valid}$ over the $k$ folds is 62% and 90% on $D_{learn}$ . Finally, I evaluate the model's performance on the untouched test set $D_{test}$ to see if it agrees with the average performance on the $D_{valid}$ after the $k$ folds, and the results are pretty bad leading to 22% accuracy on $D_{test}$ and an average 62% accuracy on $D_{valid}$ which brings me to the following questions. Q1) Is my approach valid? Q2) I've read that sometimes is appropriate to just split the dataset into train/validation/test if the dataset is sufficiently large . What does sufficiently large mean and how do we define it or understand that our dataset falls under this scenario? Q3) Is it normal to account such divergence between $D_{learn}$ and $D_{valid}$ during the folds? Q4) Could the divergence in performance between average accuracy on the 10 folds and final test set ( $D_{valid}$ vs $D_{test}$ ) be because I don't perform stratified cross validation on $D_{test}$ ? Q5) When and under which condition it is necessary and sufficient to perform cross validation on the test set as well as on the train set? Thanks!
