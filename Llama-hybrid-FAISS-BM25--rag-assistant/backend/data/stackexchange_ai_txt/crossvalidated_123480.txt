Problem on time-series

I am dealing with event data (recorded over a month) which gives out a binary response from a sensor when a door opens or closes - the time is noted at every instant and can also be represented in epochs. The times are non-uniform and the data doesnâ€™t have any apparent pattern. I am building an algorithm which can take the event data, and convert it into a time series. The objective is to detect the anomalies and the most frequent periodic patterns. Finally, it should also be able to predict the anomalies and their time of occurence in the near future. The literature I have gone through has advocated the use of ARMA models and neural networks in order to handle this stochastic time-series problem. I have converted the event data into time series by measuring each time of opening and its duration. X = Duration of the opening , t = Time of opening However, I am not able to figure out the prediction part - should I prefer using ARMA models or any other kind of analyses like wavelets? How should I go about using neural networks? (I can solve this on MATLAB) Any discussion on this front will be greatly appreciated. Please help. Thanks!
