You could make the variable (it's global anyway) an explicit member of window : window.aVariable = 'default'; and later if (! ('aVariable' in window)) { window.aVariable = 'new value'; } If you don't want or cannot change the code, then I'd suggest the pragmatic ansatz and to ignore JSLint's complaints, since your code will work anyways (that is, as long as you don't enable ECMAScript 5's strict mode...).
