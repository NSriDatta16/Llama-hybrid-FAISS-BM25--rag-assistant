Good Clojure Code Examples?

I'm in the process of checking out Clojure for the first time. I've found it useful looking at the (doc xxx) and (source xxx) of the Clojure core library, but I'm more concerned with how you would organise and put together a full application. Are there any excellent, open source examples of this? For example, to learn how to code well in Java I might look at the Spring source-code, or something similar.
