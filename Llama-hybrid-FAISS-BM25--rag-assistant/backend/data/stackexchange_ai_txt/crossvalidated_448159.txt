Specifying model in glmer() - interaction terms

I am running a generalised mixed effects model, of family logistic regression, using function glmer(). I am predicting likelihood of response (0/1) and my fixed effects to explore in my final model are: Day/Night (D/N) Male/Female (M/F) Time since trial began (continuous) my random effects are ID, and location. I am having a lot of difficulty in working out the best model to fit these, not only do the significances of the 3 fixed effects vary greatly when they are modelled alone or in combination with another... but I am reading contrasting information online as to whether "*" or ":" should be used to define interaction terms? For example, just looking at Male/ Female and 'Time since trial began' modelling just male/ female: `mod1 output: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -12.856 1.592 -8.075 6.74e-16 *** SexF -12.970 3.375 -3.843 0.000122 *** Running just Time since Trial began: mod2 output: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.3185 0.5398 -2.442 0.014592 * Time -1.3036 0.3542 -3.680 0.000233 *** When running as interaction using "*" : mod3 output: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -11.483 1.955 -5.873 4.29e-09 *** Time -1.301 1.677 -0.776 0.4380 SexF -12.488 5.439 -2.296 0.0217 * Time:SexF 0.396 4.827 0.082 0.9346 When running as interaction using ":" : mod4 output: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.2957 0.5427 -2.388 0.01695 * Time:SexM -1.1943 0.3698 -3.229 0.00124 ** Time:SexF -1.5406 0.5019 -3.070 0.00214 **
