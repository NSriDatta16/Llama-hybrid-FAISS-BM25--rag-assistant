Obtaining Jeffreys prior by taking the limit of a particular prior density on $(\mu, \Sigma)$

Text: Bayesian Data Analysis 3E by Gelman, section 3.6 Let $y | \mu, \Sigma \sim \text{MVN}(\mu, \Sigma),$ where $\mu$ is a column vector of length $d$ $\Sigma$ is a $d \times d$ symmetric, positive definite, variance matrix both unknown The conjugate prior for $(\mu, \Sigma)$ is the normal-inverse-Wishart distribution, where $$\begin{align} \Sigma &\sim \text{Inv-Wishart}_{\nu_0} \left( \Lambda_0^{-1} \right) \\ \mu | \Sigma &\sim \text{MVN} \left( \mu_0, \Sigma /\kappa_0 \right) \end{align},$$ which gives the conjugate prior density to be $$p(\mu, \Sigma) \propto |\Sigma|^{- \left( \frac{\nu_0 + d}{2} + 1\right)} \exp \left( -\frac12 \text{tr} \left( \Lambda_0 \Sigma^{-1} \right) - \frac{\kappa_0}{2} (\mu - \mu_0)^T \Sigma^{-1}(\mu - \mu_0) \right)$$ In another case where $\Sigma$ follows the inverse-Wishart with $d-1$ degrees of freedom (the other parameter is not specified, but I assuming is it $\Lambda_0^{-1}$), the author suggests using the multivariate Jeffreys noninformative prior for $(\mu, \Sigma)$, i.e. $$p(\mu, \Sigma) \propto |\Sigma|^{- \frac{d+1}{2}}.$$ The author says that this is the limit of the conjugate prior density as $\kappa_0 \rightarrow 0$, $\nu_0 \rightarrow -1$, and $|\Lambda_0| \rightarrow 0$. The first limit seems to zero out the second term in the exponential above. The second limit seems to give $|\Sigma|^{{- \frac{d+1}{2}}}$. The third limit seems like it should lead to zeroing out the first term in the exponential, but I cannot see how. I was hoping someone had some insight on how $|\Lambda_0| \rightarrow 0$ helps give the Jeffreys prior.
