Can we take principal components as input variables for further analysis? When does it make sense?

I have a data set with $n=5000$ and $p=40$. It involves both categorical and continuous variables. I want to use PCA as a feature extraction method. I consider 5 components in PCA. My question is: Do the components resulted from PCA become the new variables and represent the variables instead of the original ones? In other words, should I use these 5 components instead of my original 40 variables in the next stages of data mining including clustering, rule association and so on? My other question is: when should we use PCA as feature extraction? Specifically in my case, should I use it for feature extraction or the number of my variables aren't large enough to make PCA necessary and the downstream analysis do not require any feature extraction step?
