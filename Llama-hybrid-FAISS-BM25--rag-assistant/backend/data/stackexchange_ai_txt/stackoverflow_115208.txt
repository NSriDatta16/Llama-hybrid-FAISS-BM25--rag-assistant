If your goal is manufacturing test (ensuring that the modules are properly assembled, no inadvertent shorts/opens/etc), you should focus first on testing cables and connectors, followed by socketed and soldered connections, then the PCB itself. These items can all be tested for shorts & opens by finding access patterns that drive each individual line high while its neighbors are low and vice-versa, then reading back the lines' values. Without knowing more details of your hardware it's difficult to be more specific, but most embedded processors can set I/O pins to a GPIO mode that simplifies this sort of testing. If you are not performing bed-of-nails testing on your PCAs, this testing should be considered a mandatory first step for newly manufactured boards.
