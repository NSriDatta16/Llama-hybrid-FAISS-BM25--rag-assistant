In the past, GlassFish leveraged some native libraries. It looks like GlassFish Server 3.1 does not leverage any native libraries, so there is really no need to have a '64 bit' release. The server will use the jdk that you tell it to use. If you start the server with the 64-bit JDK, you have a 64-bit 'release'. The status of NB is similar. There are some native libraries that ship with NB 6.9, but most of them are far from the 'core' functionality of the IDE. Shipping a 64-bit edition of NB would not yield much, if any, of a performance boost. Eclipse may have more of a dependency on native libraries (due to things like SWT) than NB.
