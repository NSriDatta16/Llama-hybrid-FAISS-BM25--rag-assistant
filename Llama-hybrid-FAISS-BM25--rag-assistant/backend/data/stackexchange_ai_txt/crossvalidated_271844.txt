Variational inference versus MCMC: when to choose one over the other?

I think I get the general idea of both VI and MCMC including the various flavors of MCMC like Gibbs sampling, Metropolis Hastings etc. This paper provides a wonderful exposition of both methods. I have the following questions: If I wish to do Bayesian inference, why would I choose one method over the other? What are the pros and cons of each of the methods? I understand that this is a pretty broad question, but any insights would be highly appreciated.
