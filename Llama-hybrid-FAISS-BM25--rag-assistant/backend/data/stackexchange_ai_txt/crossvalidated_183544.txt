Is there a method similar to commonality analysis but can be applied beyond the scope of multiple regression?

I got one dependent variable and six independent variables. All of them are continuous. First, I built a linear regression model, but the R 2 was only 0.22. Then I tried to build a random forest model with the same data. The R 2 increased to 0.78. After comparing the results of both models on an independent test set, I think random forest model was not over-fitted. And I'm satisfied with the result. When I built a linear regression model, I could use commonality analysis to decompose R 2 into unique and common variance of independent variables. Now the question is which method should I use to decompose the R 2 explained by the random forest model in a similar way? My first thought was to build a full model and a model without some independent variable (Let's say x). The difference of R 2 between these two models should be the part explained by x. However, it turned out some model with less independent variables had higher R 2 than full model. So this is an invalid method. Could anyone give some suggestions on this? Any help would be appreciated.
