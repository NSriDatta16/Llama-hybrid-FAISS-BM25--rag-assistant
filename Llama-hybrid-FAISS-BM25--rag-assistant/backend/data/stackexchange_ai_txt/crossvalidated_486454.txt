What you are asking for comes from simple feature engineering before you launch the algorithm. If you about the specific relationship about two features, you should create features about their linear relationship (x-y, in your case) or non-linear (x*y, or x/y, for example). Otherwise, as far as I know, there is no "readily available" version of decision trees that does what you ask for.
