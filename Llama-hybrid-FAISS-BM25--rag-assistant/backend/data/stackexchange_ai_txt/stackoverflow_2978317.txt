Is there a more efficient way to organize random outcomes by size in Python?

I'm making a program that, in part, rolls four dice and subtracts the lowest dice from the outcome. The code I'm using is die1 = random.randrange(6) + 1 die2 = random.randrange(6) + 1 die3 = random.randrange(6) + 1 die4 = random.randrange(6) + 1 if die1 That's the best I could come up with from my so-far limited coding ability. Is there a better way to make it organize the four dice in order of size, then add together the three highest while ignoring the leftover? Or is the code I'm using the best way to do it?
