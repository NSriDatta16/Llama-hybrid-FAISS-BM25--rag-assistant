You can find this information in the Thread Information Block . Please note, however, that doing so is accessing undocumented structures and is thus highly non-portable and likely to break in future version of Windows . It appears that you can get the current thread 's thread-local storage arena from the TIB; I'm not sure who you'd get another thread's TLS. You could try digging into the Process Environment Block (PEB), at offset 0x30 in the TIB, but again, you're dealing with undocumented structures that are subject to change.
