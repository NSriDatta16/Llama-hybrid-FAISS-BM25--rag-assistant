Springer has Use R! series that introduces various statistics topics illustrated with examples in R. Among other books by this publisher there are few that are worth mentioning: Introductory Statistics with R Modern Applied Statistics with S-Plus is a nice introduction to statistical modeling. Don't be discouraged with S-plus in the title since S is almost the same as R. Introductory Time Series with R Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R is a great example-driven introduction to MCMC. An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R is generally a very good introduction to machine learning, there is also online Stanford course that accompanies the book. All of those seem to meet your requirements - they are introductory, with multiple examples, but generally not in "use this black-box software that will compute it for you" fashion. Of course there are better and worse books in the series, but generally you could try those as an introduction. As an additional profit you'll learn using R quite a lot from those.
