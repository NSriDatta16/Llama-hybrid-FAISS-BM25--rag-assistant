Is it possible to create "C" statements at run time and execute them?

My Problem: Program takes input from a file { INFINITE, CMDSTART, 2, CMDPLAY, 4, CMDPAUSE, CMDSTOP } Any combination of the above input commands is possible. Output of the program is to read the above input and execute the functions in the order defined by the input. Above input should result in a executing a code something like: while(true) { cmdStart(); for(i=0;i If I didnt have "INFINITE", then probably I would have had a strcmp() and a switch statement to get the order of execution. But with infinite, I realized, I have to store these function pointers in a array in the input order. After that, within a while(loop), I have to call these function pointers. Any interesting thoughts about how else to do this.
