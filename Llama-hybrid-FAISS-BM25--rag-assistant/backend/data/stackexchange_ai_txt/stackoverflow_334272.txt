Can a WM6 Emulator have a storage card?

We're doing windows mobile development using the WM6 Professional emulator through visual studio 2008 for now. My question is, can you get the emulator image to simulate having a storage card? We run our SQLCE 3.5 database off the removable storage card in our devices and it'd be slick to just have the emulator simulate this situation as well. We've looked through the emulator configuration settings and didn't come across this option. We've got the mobile devices sitting on the desk so we could always just deploy to them directly to solve this issue, but I figured it was worth polling the group anyhow.
