Reduce dimensionality and classify EEG signals

I am new to machine learning, if someone could recommend a book to reduce dimensions (PCA), and classify (Naive Bayes), the purpose is to classify EEG signals, I have already applied pre-processing, (filtering, Independent Components Analysis, obtaining theta wave for features), now I try to reduce dimensions and classify.
