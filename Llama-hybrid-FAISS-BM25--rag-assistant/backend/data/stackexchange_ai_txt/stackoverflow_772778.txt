Have you looked at the System.Transactions namespace? Unless you have already discounted it for some reason you may be able to leverage the built in nested transaction support provided there - e.g: using (var scope = new TransactionScope()) { // call a method here that uses a nested transaction someObject.SomeMethodThatAlsoUsesATransactionScope(); scope.Complete(); }
