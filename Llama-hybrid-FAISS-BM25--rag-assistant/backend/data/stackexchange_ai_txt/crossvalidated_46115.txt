How would you deal with categorical data in a naive Bayesian classifier?

I've built a little naive Bayesian classifier that works with Boolean and real values. Boolean distributions are dealt with via Bernoulli distributions, while real valued data are dealt with kernel mixture estimators. I'm currently in the process of adding count data in. How would one deal with categorical data though, e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Toyota, Honda, Ford? My initial thoughts are to assign a number to each category, treat it as a normal real value and round to the nearest integer category on prediction. That seems very wrong to me though.
