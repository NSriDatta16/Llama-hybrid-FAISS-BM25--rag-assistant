Simple example: R code is not as elegant as it might be, but I hope transparent. set.seed(2020) n = c(5, 10, 20, 5, 7, 15) x1 = rpois(5, 5); x2 = rpois(10, 3) x3 = rpois(20, 1); x4 = rpois(5, 7) x5 = rpois(7, 3); x6 = rpois(15, 2) a = c(mean(x1), mean(x2), mean(x3), mean(x4), mean(x5), mean(x6)) x = c(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6); m = rep(1:6, n) boxplot(x~m, varwidth=T, col="skyblue2", pch=20) points(1:6, a, pch="x", col="red") Notes: (1) Some R procedures allow abbreviation of parameters, but boxplot does not, so varwidth=T works and varw=T does not. (2) It takes at least 5 distinct data values to make a full boxplot.
