Why decreasing the number of convolutional layers inside a CNN increases the number of parameters?

I am building a CNN from scratch, and I am trying to change the number of convolutional layers to see what happens. I have noticed that decreasing the number of convolutional layers increases the number of parameters . This fact really surprised me, since I was expecting to see a decrease in the number of parameters. Why decreasing the number of convolutional layers inside a CNN increases the number of parameters?
