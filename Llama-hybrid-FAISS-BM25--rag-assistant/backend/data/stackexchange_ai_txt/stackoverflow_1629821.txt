I would argue that the simplest approach would be to use the design most are familiar with: a treeview on the left for folders with a collection of thumbnails for the current folder on the right. In addition for video, you could make the thumbnail play (either the video in its entirety or a small representative clip) when the user selects it. There's nothing wrong with leveraging design that already works. It makes your application more approachable for new users and thus increases your attach rate. Look at Infragistics' Quince app for more UI Patterns. In addition, there is Jennifer Tidwell's book "Designing interfaces" that provides a great reference.
