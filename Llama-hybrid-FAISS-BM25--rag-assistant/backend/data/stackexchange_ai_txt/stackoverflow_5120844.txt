UITableViewDelegate Protocol Reference [ iOS 4.2 Library ]

iwas reading about the tableView protocol in the iOs 4.2 documentation, and i found this sentence, which refers to the "tableView:viewForHeaderInSection:" paragraph: Discussion The returned object, for example, can be a UILabel or UIImageView object. The table view automatically adjusts the height of the section header to accommodate the returned view object. This method only works correctly when tableView:heightForHeaderInSection: is also implemented. It doesn't seem to you a little bit misunderstanding?
