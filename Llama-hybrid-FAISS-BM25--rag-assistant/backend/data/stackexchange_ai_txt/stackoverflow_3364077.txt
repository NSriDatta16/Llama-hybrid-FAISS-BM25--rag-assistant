One more consideration: When you concatenate or use some other method to generate a string in C#, it occupies its own memory and may stick around for a while. If you are generating millions of strings, you are likely to notice some performance drag. If you don't need to keep your many strings around, I would see if there's away to avoid generating the strings. For example, maybe you have a character array that you keep updating as you move through the character combinations, and if you're outputting them to a file, you would output them one character at a time so you don't have to build the string.
