propensity score matching and survival analysis

I am using the Matching R package to compute Average Treatment Effect within Propensity Score Matching (PSM). I have two groups: treatment and control. In addition to assessing the statistical difference between these groups on standard continuous variables, I need to verify if the two survival curves are the same between the two groups. Before knowing PSM I had used the classical log - rank test. How can I update my approach taking into account PSM (possibly using the Matching R package)?
