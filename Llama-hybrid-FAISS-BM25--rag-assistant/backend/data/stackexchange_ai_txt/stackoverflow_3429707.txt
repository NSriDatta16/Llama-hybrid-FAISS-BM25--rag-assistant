Scalability of a single server for running a Java Web application

I want to gain more insight regarding the scale of workload a single-server Java Web application deployed to a single Tomcat instance can handle. In particular, let's pretend that I am developing a Wiki application that has a similar usage pattern like Wikipedia. How many simultaneous requests can my server handle reliably before going out of memory or show signs of excess stress if I deploy it on a machine with the following configuration: 4-Core high-end Intel Xeon CPU 8GB RAM 2 HDDs in RAID-1 (No SSDs, no PCIe based Solid State storages) RedHat or Centos Linux (64-bit) Java 6 (64-bit) MySQL 5.1 / InnoDB Also let's assume that the MySQL DB is installed on the same machine as Tomcat and that all the Wiki data are stored inside the DB. Furthermore, let's pretend that the Java application is built on top of the following stack: SpringMVC for the front-end Hibernate/JPA for persistence Spring for DI and Security, etc. If you haven't used the exact configuration but have experience in evaluating the scalability of a similar architecture, I would be very interested in hearing about that as well. Thanks in advance. EDIT : I think I have not articulated my question properly. I mark the answer with the most up votes as the best answer and I'll rewrite my question in the community wiki area. In short, I just wanted to learn about your experiences on the scale of workload your Java application has been able to handle on one physical server as well as some description regarding the type and architecture of the application itself.
