When you use a 2D-convolutional layer, you assume that there is some 2D topological order in your data. E.g. images have 2D topological order: it's important that some pixel is at position (x, y) - if we move that pixel to some other position, the image would be wrong. The number of channels can be arbitrary in images (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB), but we still consider this as a 2D topological order. Check the Table 9.1. at chapter 9.7. Data Types ( Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville). So, since your data doesn't have 2D topological order, but 1D, you should use 1D-convolutional layer with multiple channels. You could have 4 channels: 1 for time, and 3 other for space coordinates.
