Web applications are prevlent for many reasons: Its easy to secure It creates a standard point of reference that everyone can access: Does not lockout people using different platforms. Easier for people to access from outside the network (it puts the security issues to the routers/vpn etc) Less tech support (standard running platform) Easier to support (if it goes down then you have a critical response team that can fix that, rather than 1000s of machines that randomly go down) Central point of storage of data (easier to backup and access) Can scale better Its easier to build or reuse an enterprise framework than to find/create a distributed component set to work with a changing environment (LDAP, different dbs, different backups, synchronization) Less subjected to attackers (worms, people modifying the client etc) Desktop clients may sometimes have hard coded environments, or require certain tool sets which make new users a pain to setup Its cheaper to deal with a server rather than 1000s of clients. You can setup the systems to be reductant and have a quick failsave. Yes the server equipment costs more by a factor, but it costs less to maintain in the long run.
