html- / styling of- tooltips in google maps api v3

I'm trying to work out how Google adds images and styling to their tooltips that appear over markers in google maps. An example of the desired behaviour can be seen here: http://maps.google.es/maps?oe=utf-8&q=hotels+in+sydney If you mouseover one of the hotel markers, you will see different styles (bold text, normal text), paragraphs or line breaks, and images for the star-rating of the hotel. As far as I can see from the docs, these tooltips are created by giving each marker a 'title' attribute... however, any HTML in this attribute is escaped; you might end up with a tooltip that looks like: This doesn't work! ... which is not the desired outcome. Anyone have any ideas?
