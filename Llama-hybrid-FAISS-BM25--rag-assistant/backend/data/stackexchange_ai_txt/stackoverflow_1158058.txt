What is the best way to organize automatic payout at the website?

I have Ruby on Rails application. I can get money from users cards using ActiveMerchant. Now I need to make payouts to the some users based on application logic. For example, Get 10$ from Andrew Get 10$ from Mark Get 10$ from Mike ... application magic that finds who should get money ... Pay 30$ to Mark Generally, I can use not only Ruby/Rails based solution but any protocol based on requests and responses. I am planning to use Authorize.net but if this feature implementation will require to use something else then I can switch to other billing processing system. I prefer not to use PayPal. Few technical details: Ruby 1.8 Rails 2.3.2 ActiveMerchant 1.4.2 How can I manage automatic payout in my application?
