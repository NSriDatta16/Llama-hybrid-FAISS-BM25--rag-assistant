Change storageUnit newUnit = new storageUnit(); for (int i = 0; i to for (int i = 0; i What your code was doing was creating a single object ( newUnit ) and adding that to the list multiple times. Each time, you would overwrite it's category, so when you printed the list you got the same value multiple times. Instead, you need to create a new newUnit object each time.
