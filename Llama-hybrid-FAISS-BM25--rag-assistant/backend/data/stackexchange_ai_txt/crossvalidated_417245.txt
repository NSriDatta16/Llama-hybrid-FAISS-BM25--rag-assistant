Are Kalman Filter recursions valid when the state noise has a singular covariance matrix?

Consider a Linear Gaussian State-Space Model where the states are denoted by $X_t$ and observations are denoted by $Y_t$ : \begin{align} X_t &= A X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, &&\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q) \\ Y_t &= B X_t + \nu_t, &&\nu_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R) \end{align} If we let $\mu_{t|1:t} \equiv \text{E}(X_t | Y_{1:t})$ and $P_{t|1:t} \equiv \text{Var}(X_t | Y_{1:t})$ be the mean and variance of the filtering density at time $t$ , respectively, then the Kalman Filter recursions can be expressed as \begin{align} \mu_{t|1:t} &= \mu_{t | 1:t-1} + P_{t|1:t-1} B^\top (B P_{t|1:t-1} B^\top + R)^{-1} (y_t - B \mu_{t | 1:t-1}) \tag{1} \\ P_{t|1:t} &= P_{t|1:t-1} - P_{t|1:t-1}B^\top (B P_{t|1:t-1} B^\top + R)^{-1} B P_{t|1:t-1} \tag{2} , \end{align} where \begin{align} \mu_{t | 1:t-1} &= A \mu_{t-1 | 1:t-1} \\ P_{t|1:t-1} &= A P_{t-1 | 1:t-1} A^\top + Q. \end{align} You can see a derivation of these recursion (with a different naming convention being used) in Lecture 3: Bayesian Optimal Filtering Equations and Kalman Filter by Simo Särkkä If $Q$ is a singular matrix, then $Q^{-1}$ does not exist. Furthermore, the density $p(\epsilon_t)$ does not exist, which I believe implies that the density $p(x_t | x_{t-1})$ does not exist. From the lecture notes you will be able to see how this density is needed to obtain the mean and variance of the filtering density. Are the Kalman Filter recursions still valid when $Q$ is singular? In other words, given that $Q$ is singular, are equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ the correct representations of the mean and variance of the filtering density? Please understand that my question is not about whether I can code the recursions and run them successfully. I am asking this from a probabilistic viewpoint.
