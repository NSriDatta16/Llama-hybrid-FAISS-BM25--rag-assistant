There's a library for dealing with WebServices called KSOAP2 . find it here Use it and notice how your server requrires the username and password to be sent. UPDATE Code Snippet: SoapObject soapRequest = new SoapObject(WSDL_TARGET_NAMESPACE, OPERATION_NAME) ; soapRequest.addProperty("appName","MyCoolApp" ); soapRequest.addProperty("sEmail","test@example.com" ); soapRequest.addProperty("sPassword","test" ); SoapSerializationEnvelope soapEnvelope = new SoapSerializationEnvelope(SoapEnvelope.VER11); soapEnvelope.dotNet = true; soapEnvelope.setOutputSoapObject(soapRequest); HttpTransportSE httpTransport = new HttpTransportSE(SOAP_ADDRESS); try{ httpTransport.call(SOAP_ACTION, soapEnvelope); Object response = soapEnvelope.getResponse(); Log.d("-----RESPONSE",""+response); }catch (Exception exception){ Log.d("RESPONSE",""+exception.toString()); } Although I discourage posting whole code here, but since you seem to be in dire trouble, I hope this much helps you. Or wait a bit I'll blog about it, in detail.
