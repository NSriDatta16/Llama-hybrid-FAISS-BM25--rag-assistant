Detecting outliers using correlogram

If there is an outlier in a time series, how does its correlogram behave? Is it possible to find outliers using a correlogram? EDIT I have such a Time series: ts its correlogram looks like this: I have an outlier in my time series, Is it possible to detect these outlier from correlogram?
