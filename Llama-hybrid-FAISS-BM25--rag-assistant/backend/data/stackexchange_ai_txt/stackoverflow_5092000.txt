Can't get neural network result in MATLAB

I guess my question is very simple, but anyway... I've created neural network using net = newff(entry_borders, [20, 10], {'logsig', 'logsig'}, 'traingdx'); where entry_borders is an array 50x2: [(0,1), (0,1), ...] It must be a network with a hidden layer with 50 entries and 10 outputs, isn't it? But when I run this: test_result = sim(net, zeros(50)); disp(test_result); I get matrix with 10x50 elements in test_result (instead of 10 scalar values) - what's that?? I'm not speaking about the teaching process that's why here's so sily code...
