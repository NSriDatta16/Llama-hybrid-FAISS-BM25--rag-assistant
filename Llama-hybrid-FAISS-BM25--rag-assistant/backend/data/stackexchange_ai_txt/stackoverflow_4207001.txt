ASP session data storage options, coming from PHP

I've started ASP a few months ago, having come from a few years of PHP. In PHP, I used a combination of cookies PHP sessions, cookies and storing the Session ID in the database. When a person logs in, the Session Id is written to the cookie and saved in a column in the database. If the person logs off, the cookie is deleted, if the person forgets, that's okay since the cookie only lives for 72 hours. Upon visiting the site, I check for a cookie. If it exists, I see if the Session ID exists in the database. If so, we have a match and the person can continue their session. If no match the cookie is deleted, as it was probably forgery. If no cookie, the person must login. An old value for Session ID stored in the database is simply updated. Now, with ASP, it seems there are more options. From this article: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178581.aspx * Application state, which stores variables that can be accessed by all users of an ASP.NET application. * Profile properties, which persists user values in a data store without expiring them. * ASP.NET caching, which stores values in memory that is available to all ASP.NET applications. * View state, which persists values in a page. * Cookies. * The query string and fields on an HTML form that are available from an HTTP request. I'll probably stick to my Session+cookie+database system for now, but what of these other things mentioned here? They seem mysterious to me. Is a further combination possible to make things even more secure, or would that just be overkill? My main concern is that possible, the system of Session+Cookie+Database which I use, might have a flaw in it.
