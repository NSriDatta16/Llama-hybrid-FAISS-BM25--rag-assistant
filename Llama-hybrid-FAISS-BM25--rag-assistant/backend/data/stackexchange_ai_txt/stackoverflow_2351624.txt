No problem in Chromium 5.0.307.9 (Developer Build 39052) under Linux. I can't test it in Safari now. EDIT: Proposed test case had nothing to do with this problem, neither could see any extra tags. However, I looked at the Developer Tools of Safari and Chrome under Windows and Firebug in Firefox and all three rendered the DOM incorrectly. Just have a look at this picture and see that the first tag has jumped into the body. This problem also has nothing to do with Javascript because when turning off Javascript the result is the same , even more clear when comparing with the source code. Strange I didn't notice this under Linux. The Developer Tools of the WebKit browsers give an even clearer picture (also notice the jQuery error message). I suspect the Unicode Byte-Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file causing the problem: as you can see the BOM is moved to the of the document, perhaps dragging several elements in the with it. But also the unclosed elements, as shown by the W3C validator , might give some issues, although browsers usually handle this without any problems. First get rid of the BOM in your file and see if the problem persists. And I see another error: those tags beginning with are called meta tags, not "meat tags". ;-)
