Don't! Especially with free software, you have all the possibilities out there to get your changes into the main distribution. But if you have a weakly documented hack in your local copy you'll never be able to ship the product and upgrading to the next version of curses (security updates anyone) will be very high cost. See this answer for a glimpse into what is possible on foreign code bases. The linked screencast is really worth a watch. Suddenly a dirty hack turns into a valuable contribution. If you really cannot get the patch upstream for whatever reason, at least create a local (git) repo to track upstream and have your changes in a separate branch. Recently I've come across a point where I have to accept monkey-patching as last resort: Puppet is a "run-everywhere" piece of ruby code. Since the agent has to run on - potentially certified - systems, it cannot require a specific ruby version. Some of those have bugs that can be worked around by monkey-patching select methods in the runtime. These patches are version-specific, contained, and the target is frozen. I see no other alternative there.
