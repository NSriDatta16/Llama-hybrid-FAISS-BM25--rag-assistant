Let's look at what's going on behind the scenes. A logistic regression model (binomial GLM) looks like this: $$ \log\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1 $$ assuming we're only fitting an intercept and one parameter for your $X_1$ variable. As you correctly state, exponentiating the coefficients gives us the odds: $$ \exp\left[\log\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right)\right]=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1X_1)\\ \implies \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(\beta_0)\exp(\beta_1X_1) $$ For simplicity, let's focus on $\beta_1$ and assume that $\beta_0=0$ . This makes $\exp(\beta_0)=\exp(0)=1$ , and therefore the above expression reduces to: $$ \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(\beta_1X_1) $$ Now, let's look at what happens when $X_1$ increases by one unit e.g. from $2$ to $3$ . Let's also imagine $\beta_1=-0.74$ : $$ (1) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times2)=\exp(-1.48)\approx0.23 \\ (2) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times3)=\exp(-2.22)\approx0.11 $$ A unit increase in $X_1$ has resulted in a decrease of $0.11/0.23=0.478$ in the odds. Note that this is just the odds ratio, and $\exp(\beta_1)=\exp(-0.74)=0.478$ . So a unit increase in $X_1$ results in the odds of success being multiplied by the odds ratio, which is nothing but $\exp(\beta_1)$ . Essentially, if $\beta_1>0$ , an increase in $X_1$ will yield higher odds (because the odds ratio > 1), whereas if $\beta_1 , an increase in $X_1$ will yield lower odds (because the odds ratio Now, you should be able to see for yourself what would happen if we were working with $\ln(X_1)$ rather than with $X_1$ . Hint: $$ (3) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times\ln(2))=2^{-0.74}\approx0.60\\ (4) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times\ln(3))=3^{-0.74}\approx0.44 $$ That is, a decrease in the odds of $0.44/0.60=0.74$ . However, the odds ratio is still $\exp(\beta_1)=\exp(-0.74)=0.478$ , so what's going on here? By taking the natural logarithm of $X_1$ , you change the interpretation of its coefficient. Now, the odds ratio represents the change in the odds if you multiply $X_1$ by $e$ . Therefore: $$ (5) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times\ln(2))=2^{-0.74}\approx0.599\\ (6) \space\space\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \exp(-0.74\times\ln(2\times e))=(2\times e)^{-0.74}\approx0.286 $$ We see that multiplying $X_1$ by $e$ results in the odds decreasing from $0.599$ to $0.286$ . Here $0.286/0.599=0.478$ which is precisely the odds ratio i.e. $\exp(\beta_1)=\exp(-0.74)$ . Following the same logic, it's easy to see that: If we had transformed $X_1$ to be $\log_2(X_1)$ , the interpretation would be "by how much would the odds decrease after doubling $X_1$ " If we had transformed $X_1$ to be $\log_{10}(X_1)$ , the interpretation would be "by how much would the odds decrease after multiplying $X_1$ by 10 "
