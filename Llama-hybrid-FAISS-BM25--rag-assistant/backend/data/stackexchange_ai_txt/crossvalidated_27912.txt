I suspect you actually mean $y_{it}=μ_i+∑_j I_{ij}θ_{jt}+ϵ_{it}$ where $I_{ij}$ is an indicator for individual $i$ belonging to group $j$ (with probability $\pi_{ij}$. I also wonder if you really want to allow for different individuals to have different group assignment probabilities? I suspect $\pi_j$ will suffice? I guess it could be seen as a random/mixed effect (not a mixture) with a multinomial effect. This might be an improper term since "random effects" is a typically reseved for Gaussian random effects. Also note that you are not dealing with a Gaussian mixture, because you allow an individuals shift of the Gaussian ($\mu_i$). Anyhow, I can think of two approaches: Write the likelihood and maximize it using en EM algorithm which you can write yourself. Compute $\mu_i$ by averaging within individuals (assuming you have enough observations). The residuals will be distributed like a Gaussian location mixture at each $t$. You can use a standard EM implementation such as mixtools R package to estimate $\{\theta_{jt}\}$ and $\{\pi_j\}$.
