Optimal grid search for $C$ in SVM

Say we are training a radial SVM with parameters $C$ and $\gamma$. We would typically do this using grid search and CV. My prof. alluded that one does not have to exhaust all of $C$ values in the grid to obtain the optimal solution and I'm sure the popular packages don't search over all $C$ values either for the sake of speed. So my question is how is it done optimally, i.e. going over the least amount of $C$ values (for a given $\gamma$)? I'm thinking that if one start from the lowest value of $C$, we may stop once the performance no longer improves. Is this optimal?
