Time series data can be low (with some negative side-effects) but problems arise with consecutive values that are alike .e.g. 1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 . Data like this can inject false auto-correlation. It is possible to combine both regression structure reflecting known causals and memory (ARIMA) structure reflecting unknown/unspecified stochastic causals while conditioning for unknown/unspecified deterministic structure such as level/step shifts and others. This is known as a Transfer Function or a Dynamic Regression as there may be lead and lag effects around your promotions. When I know that something is going to be cheaper tomorrow, I normally defer my purchase. I suggest you review some of my posts and other posts on these topics. If you wish I might be able to demonstrate the art of the possible if you post your data in a column oriented excel file or a csv file.
