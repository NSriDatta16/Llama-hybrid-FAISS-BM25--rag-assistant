May I recommend that you look into the URI template specification ? It does exactly what you're trying to do, but more elegantly. I don't know of any current URI template parsers for JavaScript, since it's usually a server-side operation, but a minimal implementation would be trivial to write. Essentially, instead of: foo/bar/:firstVar/:(secondVar)foo2/:thirdVar You use: foo/bar/{firstVar}/{secondVar}foo2/{thirdVar} Hopefully, it's pretty obvious why this format works better in the case of secondVar . Plus it has the added advantage of being a specification, albeit currently still a draft.
