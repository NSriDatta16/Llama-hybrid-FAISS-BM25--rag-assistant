Answering to your last paragraph, I would say you should do it in presenter if there is something (some button) on view that is supposed to do it. Presenter is logically strongly tied to view (technically it should be weakly tied, by interfaces only not by implementations). If you want to save the record on some action which is not explicitly called from view, I wouldn't do it in presenter.
