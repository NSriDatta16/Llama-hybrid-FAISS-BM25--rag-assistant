Not that familiar w/ Cactus, but you should be able to use JPDA over JDWP. Simply put something like this in the JVM args (either in the Eclipse run config, the java cmd line, or however Cactus accepts its args for the JVM): -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=localhost:1234,server=y,suspend=y (or use "-Xrunjdwp:" instead of "-agentlib:jdwp" if JRE version Then wherever you start it, it will wait for you to connect. Then just create a new debug configuration in Eclipse as a Remote Java Application. Put the source that you expect to debug into the Source tab. Make sure the Connection Type is "Standard (Socket Attach)" and put localhost for the Host and 1234 for the Port. Then start that debug config and you should be good.
