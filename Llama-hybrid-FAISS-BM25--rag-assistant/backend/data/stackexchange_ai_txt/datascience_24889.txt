How to test trained PCA used for compression?

I am working on an exercise for using PCA for compression of images and I don't quite understand how to use it on the test data: I have 300 images of hand drawn sixes, represented by 28x28 matrices, in the train data, and I have used PCA to find an appropriate low dimensional representation of these images (26 dimensions yields me the sought after 90% threshold), giving me a 300x26 Matrix, that I can use to project my images into that space Now I have to test this with my test data of 10 similar images - so I have to project them into the same space. Because I can't just use the train space (dimensions don't agree), if I understood correctly, I should run another PCA to find the Principle Components for these new images, but project them into the 26 dimensions as identified by my train PCA (PCA on just the test suggests that 6 dimensions would suffice, but I want the more accurate 26 from my wide range of training data) But here is where I'm struggling: how do I centre the test data? To centralise the data before using PCA or the dual PCA, I deduct the mean from the data. When building my test PCA should I deduct the mean of the train data, or the mean of the test data?
