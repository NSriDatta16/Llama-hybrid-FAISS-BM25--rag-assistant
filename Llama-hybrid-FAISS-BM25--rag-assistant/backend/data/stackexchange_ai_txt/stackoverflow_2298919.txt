A good book on the subject is: Debugging by David J. Agans One of which is to use a rifle and not a shotgun approach when debugging. That is to be sure to test each piece to find the problem. In addition, once you make a fix then try to break it again to make sure you understand what went wrong. There has been times when I made a fix (in maintenance code) only to discover that the fix broke other things. Before you mark a bug as fixed ensure that the fix does not break something else. Which brings up the real issue of a bug: Failure to completely understand what the code is doing.
