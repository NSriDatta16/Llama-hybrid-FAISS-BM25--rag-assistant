Suppose you have the following SQL statement: select sum(A), max(B), avg(C) from TBL group by D Try this in C#: from t in table group t by D into g select new { s = g.Sum(x => x.A), m = g.Max(x => x.B), a = g.Average(x => x.C) } -- or in VB: -- from t in TBL group t by key = D into g = group select s = g.Sum(function(x) x.A), m = g.Max(function(x) x.B), a = g.Average(function(x) x.C) The obvious, which in VB would be: aggregate t in TBL into s = Sum(t.A), m = Max(t.B), a = Average(t.C) though it will give the same results, it has a higher cost as it issues multiple SQL select statements, one for each aggregate function, i.e. it will run in multiple passes. The first syntax, gives a single (fairly complex, but efficient) SQL statement which does a single pass against the database. PS. If you don't have a key by which to group by (i.e. you need a single row as the result, covering the whole data set), use a constant as in: from t in TBL group t by key = 0 into g = group select s = g.Sum(function(x) x.A), m = g.Max(function(x) x.B), a = g.Average(function(x) x.C)
