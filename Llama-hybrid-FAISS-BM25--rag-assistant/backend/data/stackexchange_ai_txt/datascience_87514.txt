If you are classifying images, you should obviously use CNN for good accuracy. The dataset you are classifying also plays a great role in determining the hyperparameters, optimizers, loss function. So you should start with a basic CNN model that you can train with optimizers such as SGD and try tuning the hyperparameters accordingly. If you are asking about the transfer learning models you can use RezNet or GoogLeNet
