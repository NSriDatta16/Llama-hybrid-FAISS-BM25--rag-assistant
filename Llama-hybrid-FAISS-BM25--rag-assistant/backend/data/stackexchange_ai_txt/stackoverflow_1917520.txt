Set the DisplayMember of the CheckedListBox to the property you want displayed. For instance: orderCheckList.DisplayMember = "Title"; // Now orderUp.Title will be displayed (Overriding ToString() will work as well, as suggested by Ragepotato, but using DisplayMember is more flexible as it means you can use the same datatype in various different contexts.) Sample code: using System.Windows.Forms; class Test { static void Main() { Form f = new Form { Controls = { new CheckedListBox { Items = { new { FirstName = "Jon", LastName = "Skeet" }, new { FirstName = "Holly", LastName = "Skeet" } }, DisplayMember = "FirstName" } } }; Application.Run(f); } }
