Why are messages received by an actor unordered?

I've been studying the actor model (specifically the implementation in Scala) but I can't understand why there's a requirement that messages arrive in no particular order. It seems like there are at least some elegant, actor-based solutions to concurrency problems that would work if only the messages arrived in order (e.g. producer-consumer variants, deferred database writes, concurrency-safe caches). So why don't actor messages arrive in order? Is it to permit efficient implementation or maybe to prevent some kind of deadlock that would arise when messages are ordered?
