How to update a counter for a resultset

i'm creating something similar to an advertising system. I would like to show, for example, 5 ads (5 record) from a given database table. So i execute something like SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY view_counter ASC LIMIT 5 ok, it works. But, how can contextualy update the "view_counter" (that is a counter with the number of show) maybe with a single SQL ? And, if i don't ask too much, is it possible to save the "position" which my record are returned ? For example, my sql return - record F (pos. 1) - record X (pos. 2) - record Z (pos. 3) And save in a field "Avarage_Position" the .. avarage of position ? Thanks in advance. Regards
