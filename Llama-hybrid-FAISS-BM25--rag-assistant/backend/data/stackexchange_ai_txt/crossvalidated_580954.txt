What are the chances of winning a tournament of a fixed number of games if I know the player's win rate in all games he plays

A player has a historic success rate of winning 2/3 of games he plays. He enters a series of tournaments, all 5 rounds each...1st round, 2nd round, quarters, semis, final. How often on average will he win a tournament? My theory... 0.66x0.66x0.66x0.66x0.66 is chance of winning particular tournament ie 0.125 ... therefore he wins on average one in 8 tournaments entered.
