non-authorized storage devices? This depends on how secure you want it to be. For the most secure level, it would consist of: special firmware written to the flash drive to get extra "meta info" (read: expensive custom manufacturing of flash drives) special windows driver to read that meta info from the flash drive your program talking to that device driver to confirm it's authorized. Or to the least secure level you have these options: using a hidden file and a special key(possibly hashed time of last filesystem modification or something?) (dd breakable) dropping below the filesystem level and recreating your own very simple filesystem.. (more security through obscurity though and dd could break that) Also, for the "most secure" option, you really need a more secure way of running the program than auto-run and a device driver(which could be half-baked to make anything appear authorized). Why do you want it to only update from an authorized flash drive anyway?
