I kind of came-up with a solution that is a bit hacky but works for me. Here is what I do to get thumbnails. Say the headline of the page I find is "this is a headline" I use this as a query to the Google Image API and then extract the first thumbnail I find. It actually works quite well for a majority of the cases. Check it out for yourself http://cricketfresh.in Mithun ps: I think this is a good answer. Will give credit to someone who comes with a more elegant answer.
