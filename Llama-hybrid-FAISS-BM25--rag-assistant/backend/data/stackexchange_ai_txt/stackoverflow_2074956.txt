Logo recognition in images

Does anyone know of recent academic work which has been done on logo recognition in images? Please answer only if you are familiar with this specific subject (I can search Google for "logo recognition" myself, thank you very much). Anyone who is knowledgeable in computer vision and has done work on object recognition is welcome to comment as well. Update : Please refer to the algorithmic aspects (what approach you think is appropriate, papers in the field, whether it should work(and has been tested) for real world data, efficiency considerations) and not the technical sides (the programming language used or whether it was with OpenCV...) Work on image indexing and content based image retrieval can also help.
