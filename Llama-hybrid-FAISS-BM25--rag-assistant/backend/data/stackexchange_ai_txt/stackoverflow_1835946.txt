In addition to the suggestions already made you may also want to consider extracting try/catch blocks from the "meat" of the function. public void delete(Page page) { try { deletePageAndAllReferences(page); } catch (Exception e) { logError(e); } } private void deletePageAndAllReferences(Page page) throws Exception { deletePage(page); registry.deleteReference(page.name); configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey()); } private void logError(Exception e) { logger.log(e.getMessage()); } This lets you focus your attention on the function you are really interested in without the exception handling getting in your way.
