How can I estimate the probability of a random member of one population being "better" than a random member from multiple different populations?

I have a set of multiple population distributions, with a known mean and standard deviation for each. I'm trying to find the probability for a given one of these distributions of a random member being "better" than a randomly pulled member for each of the other distributions at the same time. This question solves this problem for comparing it with one distribution and seems easy enough to implement, but I'm having trouble finding out how to do this in comparing with more than one distribution. Would I simply find the probability of "beating" each other distribution and then multiply it out? My gut reaction is that this wouldn't work because of them being pulled at the same time, "beating" one shouldn't be independent of "beating" others, as one really good value should be enough to beat all others. For feasibility's sake, I'd only have less than 25 distributions, on average probably closer to 15.
