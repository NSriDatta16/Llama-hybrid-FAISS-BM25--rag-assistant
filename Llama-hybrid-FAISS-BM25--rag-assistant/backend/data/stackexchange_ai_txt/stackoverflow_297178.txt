Instead of flashing the tasbar you can consider using the NotifyIcon. This will let you put something on the system tray (something else many consider evil because of the proliferation of apps that do this). Then you can popup a ballon tip with any change that actually describes the change itself. To use: (1) Drag the NotifyIcon onto your form or create in your app NotifyIcon notify = new NotifyIcon(); (2) Set the icon property to the required image (3) Control whether it is visible on the system tray using the Visible property (4) Call ShowBalloonText to show popup text (limited to 64 characters) Either way, you shoudl add an option to the program that allows the end user to turn this feature on/off based on their feelings about it all. I personally like the notify icon because the ballon text can say something like "Server went down"
