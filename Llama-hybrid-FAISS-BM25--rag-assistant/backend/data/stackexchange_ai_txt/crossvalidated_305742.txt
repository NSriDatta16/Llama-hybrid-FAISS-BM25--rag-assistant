The training data is consistent with the model y = 0 It doesn't sound like that is the model you want. So you know something about the problem other than the training data. I suggest that whatever that other knowledge is, express it as a Bayesian prior. Then use a Bayesian model. Example: you are playing a game where a coin is tossed repeatedly. It is biased, and you want to estimate the probability of heads. The rule of the game is that if it shows heads, your opponent must say "heads", and if it shows tails, your opponent can choose whether to say "heads" or "tails". How can you estimate the probability of the coin showing heads? Clearly you can make an upper bound - every time your opponent says tails it is true. To get any better than this, you must make some assumptions about the prior distribution of the bias and of your opponent's strategy.
