What is this bias-variance tradeoff for regression coefficients and how to derive it?

In this paper , ( Bayesian Inference for Variance Components Using Only Error Contrasts , Harville, 1974), the author claims $$(y-X\beta)'H^{-1}(y-X\beta)=(y-X\hat\beta)'H^{-1}(y-X\hat\beta)+(\beta-\hat\beta)'(X'H^{-1}X)(\beta-\hat\beta)$$ to be a "well-known relationship", for a linear regression $$y=X\beta+\epsilon,$$ where $$\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0, H).$$ How is this well-known? What is the simplest way of proving this?
