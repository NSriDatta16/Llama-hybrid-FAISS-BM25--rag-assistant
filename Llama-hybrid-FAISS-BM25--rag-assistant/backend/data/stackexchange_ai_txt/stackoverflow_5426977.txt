Why aren't these submenus appearing in IE?

Not sure what the issue is here... Submenus (under services and towns tabs) work fine in every browser but IE. http://fingelly.idxre.com/idx/officeMap.cfm?cid=47735#- They work fine in IE from the other pages on the site (example: http://fingelly.com/about-us/ ) But not from the listings or agent pages that are just approximating the rest of the site's template via a 3rd party for the real estate data.... The CSS is the same as fas as I can tell but obviously something's throwing it off. I've tried tinkering with z-index on the submenus and also specifying overflow visible on the menu and its parent containers. Any ideas?
