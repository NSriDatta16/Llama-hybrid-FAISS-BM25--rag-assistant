Just include the ads in the pages you are loading via ajax. There can be nothing wrong with loading the ads from a file via ajax on a per page basis. if I load Read.inc which has some content and an ad Click something on the page and it takes you to Make.inc which has content an an ad. Whats wrong with that? That's organic. One load with the ad as part of the content. It's the same as clicking a link. I haven't actually tried this yet, but it certainly seems logical.
