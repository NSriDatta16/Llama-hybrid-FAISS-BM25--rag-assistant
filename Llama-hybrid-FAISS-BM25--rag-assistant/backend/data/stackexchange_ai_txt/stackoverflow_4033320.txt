If you absolutely, positively have to have a default date no matter what application or user is entering the record, then use a column default value. Even if there is a time when the user should pay more attention to this date, you can require it on the front end. I guess if you plan on spending as much time designing, testing, and debugging your code as the developers who wrote the column default value code in SQL Server, be my guest ;)
