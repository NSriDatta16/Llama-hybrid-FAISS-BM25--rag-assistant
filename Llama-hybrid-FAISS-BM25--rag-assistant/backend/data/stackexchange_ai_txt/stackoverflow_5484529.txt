Execute long running jobs in SQL Server

I am working with SQL Server 2008. Using the Agent, I have created a job and scheduled it to execute every minute. The job executes a stored procedure that moves data from table XXX, to a temp table, and then eventually into table YYY. The execution of the job may take more than one minute - since the data is rather large. Will a second instance of the job be started even though the first instance is still running? If so, should I mark records in temp table (status = 1) to indicate that those records are being processed by a previous instance of the job? Is there a way for me to check that an instance of the job is currently running, so that I don't initiate a second instance of the job? Is there another solution for this that I am unaware of? (throughput is important)
