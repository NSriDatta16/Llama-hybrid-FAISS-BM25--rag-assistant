If your goal is dimensionality reduction, then you should not include GPA in PCA. Dimensionality reduction typically refers to reducing the dimension of your feature space or your input space. We do not include our dependent variable in this, only the independent variables. If you included GPA in PCA and then dropped one or more of your principal components, then you would be dropping some information from GPA as well. This is likely not what you intend to do, so it would be inappropriate to include GPA when you do PCA.
