While BalusC's answer tells you how to do it in your current setup, I have a more radical suggestion: get rid of the JSON. By idea JSON is not meant to store data - it is meant to be used as a "lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange". That is: low-traffic (as little non-meaningful data as possible) human-readable easy to handle with dynamic languages Data storages on the other hand have much more requirements than this. That's why databases exist. So move your storage to a database. If you don't want a full-featured database, use something like HSQLDB or JavaDB.
