From JLS ยง12.6.1 : A reachable object is any object that can be accessed in any potential continuing computation from any live thread. Optimizing transformations of a program can be designed that reduce the number of objects that are reachable to be less than those which would naively be considered reachable. For example, a compiler or code generator may choose to set a variable or parameter that will no longer be used to null to cause the storage for such an object to be potentially reclaimable sooner. So, under this definition array referenced by arr can be considered unreachable after line 6, therfore its elements are unreachable as well.
