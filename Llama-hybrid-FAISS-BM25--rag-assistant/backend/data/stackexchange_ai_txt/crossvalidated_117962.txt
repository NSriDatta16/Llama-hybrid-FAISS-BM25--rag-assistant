Testing for independence between variables in poisson distribution

I'm trying to figure out how to test if variables that I think follow a Poisson distribution are independent (which is a requirement of the Poisson distribution) -- or it it matters. Let's assume I count the number of shoppers, X, that come into my store in every 6-hour timeframe. After a month of doing that, I want to determine which of those timeframes saw a significantly smaller or larger number of shoppers. I can calculate a lambda (average rate of X/timeframe), plot a time series, and compare the result to a poisson distribution with the same lambda -- it's likely going to be similar. But, for Xi to be Poisson-distributed, they need to be independent. In most examples of Poisson-related work on time series (e.g., http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/tutorial.html ), the variables are more obviously independent: mining disasters, car crashes, text messages received, etc. In an example like mine, they might not be; for example, a large number of shoppers going into a store at once could motivate others to go into the store as well. How do I test for independence, beyond making assumptions about the situation? A chi-square test seems most obvious, but there's no degrees of freedom to run a chi-square test. [It probably doesn't matter for this question, but my goal is to run a very similar analysis to the one detailed in the pymc link -- to set up a Markov Chain model that shows when a likely change in frequency/lambda occurred. That model has the same independence requirement though.]
