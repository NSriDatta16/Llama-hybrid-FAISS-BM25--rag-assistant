Here's a somewhat lame suggestion: if practical, try using a different variable name. Alternately, there's the old Pragmatic Programmer "tracer bullets" idea: create a dummy variable in the controller which you print out in various views/fragments, just to make sure that the scope/lifetime of these values really is what you expect, rather than "something" stomping on this one variable due to its unique name (or code you forgot you wrote). Finally, you did try: % find . -name '*rb*' | xargs grep -B 2 -A 2 -n '@widget' or a similar code search in the application, right? Note that if you "freeze" your rails version, all of the rails framework code will be nested within you application, and you can search that, too.
