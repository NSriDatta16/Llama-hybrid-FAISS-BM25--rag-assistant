Unevenly spaced time series is a term that is used. While most statistics theory is about evenly spaced time series. In the comments there is also proposed point process , but that seems to be a special case where only the times itself are observed and of interest. So if the observations are occurrence times of earthquakes in California, that would be a point process, also since there is no value associated with other (non-nonoccurence) times. But when there is a continuous, underlying value, for example the luminosity of a variable star, but it is only observed at irregular times, due to weather conditions and observer availability, it is an unevenly spaced time series .
