Why? To reach to the somewhat highest performance of a model, you need to try different hyperparameters When? whenever you find an "appropriate" model for your task or made a architecture of a model (e.g. in artificial neural networks) then you need to tune hyperparameters to make sure that the model could make good enough predictions. It is when you could not improve the performance of the model by changing the model architecture . There are different approaches for tuning of hyperparameters such as grid search and random search that you could choose based on you preferences. The point is that the "appropriate" model may differ from one application to another.
