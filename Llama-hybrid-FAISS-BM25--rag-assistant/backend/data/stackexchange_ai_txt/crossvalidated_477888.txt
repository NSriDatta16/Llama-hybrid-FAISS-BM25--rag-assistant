What are some "data transformation" methods?

There's a tag here called " data-transformation " described as Mathematical re-expression, often nonlinear, of data values. Data are often transformed either to meet the assumptions of a statistical model or to make the results of an analysis more interpretable. Could someone run off a list of data transformation techniques, denoting which are linear or non-linear, for me to confirm what I think data-transformation means? Is it only about the transformation of raw data into an alternative form? (but wouldn't that just be manipulation of what exists in reality, thereby creating synthetic (false) data? a philosophical explanation to complement the list could help) I'm especially interested in those methods that relate to machine learning whose purpose is the enhancement of a model's out-of-sample performance. I leave the question openly general to get as many leads as possible, but a brief description of where each technique is commonly applied would be helpful too.
