Because the kernel matrix $K$ (positive semi-definite) is $m \times m$. When number of instances is not large, it can be stored in memory and we can effectively optimize the SVM objective function. If number of instance $m$ is large, say 1 million, then the kernel matrix is 1 million by 1 million an the SVM optimization is hard to solve. SVM optimization to solve $\alpha$, $$ \max_{0 \leq \alpha \leq c} ~ \sum_i \alpha_i - \frac 1 2 \sum_i \sum_j \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j K_{i,j} $$ When number of instance is large, storing the kernel matrix and performing optimization. On the other hand, for linear model, For example, linear regression number of features $n$ matters more. QR decomposition on data matrix with 1 million rows and 2 columns takes seconds, but not the other way around.
