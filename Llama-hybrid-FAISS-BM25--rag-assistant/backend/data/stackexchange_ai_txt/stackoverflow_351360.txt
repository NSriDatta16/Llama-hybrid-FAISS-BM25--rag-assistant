An algorithm to get the next weekday set in a bitmask

I've got this small question - given a bitmask of weekdays (e.g., Sunday = 0x01, Monday = 0x02, Tuesday = 0x04 , etc...) and today's day (in a form of Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3 , etc...) - what's the most elegant way to find out the next day from today, that's set in the bitmask? By elegant I mean, is there a way to do this without if/switch/etc..., because I know the non-elegant way? Edit I probably should've mentioned (to make this more clear) that the variable holding the bitmask can have several of the days set, so for example (roughly): uDay = Sunday | Monday; today = Tuesday; I need to get "Sunday"
