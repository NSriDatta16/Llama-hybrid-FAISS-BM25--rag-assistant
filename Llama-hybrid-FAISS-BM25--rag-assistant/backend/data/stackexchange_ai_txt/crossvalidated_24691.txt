When is it appropriate to use PCA?

My research is a about clustering a huge data set. Right now I'm not using any technique for feature selection, because I only need 3 attributes from each row. I hope I'm making myself clear, lets say I have 1000 rows of data and in each row there are at least 15 attributes (field with different category, e.g. IP add, timestamp, numbers .. etc.) From this 15 attributes I'm only using 3 attributes. Do I need to use PCA? I'm clustering when there is a perfect match. I'm still reading about PCA, it is talking about dimensional in the data, how to determine the need to use PCA. Will the PCA technique make my cluster more accurate?
