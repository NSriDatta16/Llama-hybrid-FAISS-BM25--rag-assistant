MySQL Daily Average over a month

I'm pulling several status over a specific time period and I'd like to pull another stat that would be "average sales per day" over this time period. I'm not sure how to do daily averages over a specific time period, can anyone provide some advice? $whereSql = 'WHERE created >= '.$endTimestamp.' AND created query->run(array( 'name' => 'get-figures', 'sql' => 'SELECT SUM(price) AS total_sales, COUNT(id) AS total_orders, AVG(total) AS order_total_average (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM `order_product` INNER JOIN `order` ON ( `order`.id = order_product.order_id AND `order`.created >= '.$endTimestamp.' AND `order`.created getId().' ) ) as total_units FROM `order` '.$whereSql.' AND type_id = '.$type->getId().'', 'connection' => 'store' ));
