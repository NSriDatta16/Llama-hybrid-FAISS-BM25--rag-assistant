Help setting up pymc to solve this problem relating to distribution of colors in M&M's

My overall goal is to work through the "Bayesian Methods for Hackers" book. So far I understand how to do simple things with pymc (like determining the parameters for a linear model and for a gaussian - e.g beginner stuff). I feel like I understand the example in the first chapter of the above Bayesian Methods for Hackers book as well (chat frequency trends). To test myself I've been trying to use pymc to work through "Thinking Bayes". I'm stuck on the following "M&M" problem: http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/html/thinkbayes002.html#toc12 I can solve this problem on paper and with a short snippet of python, but I'm at a loss how to think of this from a pymc direction. Any help pointing me towards how to think about this would be appreciated.
