how to manage large client side only web apps

I am building a project which uses jQuery UI for the client side. My goal is to have my web-app never do a postback and do everything client side. While developing though I found almost all my code goes into 1 .js file and 1 .html file where I have a lot of div's which I show and hide when appropriate. Is there a better way to organize this? Is an oldschool server side include the best way to do this? Also is there a way to have 2 javascript files be able to see contents from within one another? I think how it works only the second one can call things from the first one. I'm just not sure about the best way to scale because I'm used to building client side applications which have many source files.
