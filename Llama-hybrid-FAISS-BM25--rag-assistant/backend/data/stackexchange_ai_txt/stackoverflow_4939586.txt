Write a little javascript that creates 100, 500, 1000, etc divs depending on which option is selected. Check the memory usage of the browser before and after selecting your option and divide by the number of div's you created. Try to use really large numbers of divs to get a better average, and be sure to test on different browsers, different versions, and different platforms.
