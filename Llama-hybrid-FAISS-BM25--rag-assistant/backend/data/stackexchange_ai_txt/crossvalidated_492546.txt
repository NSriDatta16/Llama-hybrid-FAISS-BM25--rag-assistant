I think that you might be interested in Stachurski (2016) A Primer in Econometric Theory . The book is quite mathematically oriented. The book is organized into 3 sections: Background - which is all about pure mathematical foundations; vector spaces, linear algebra and matrices, foundations of probability, modeling dependence, asymptotics etc. Foundations of statistics - which covers rigorous mathematical definition of many basic statistical concepts, properties of estimators, confidence sets etc. Econometric models: this section covers some econometric models in great detail. It’s range of models is not wide but it goes quite in depth for each topic (there is whole chapter just on geometry of least squares). I think based on your description this is what you are looking for. It definitely covers most of the topics you listed (but not all I don’t think information criteria like AIC (they are mentioned but not discussed in great detail) but otherwise everything you listed should be covered). It is very in depth and focused on theory rather than practical applications.
