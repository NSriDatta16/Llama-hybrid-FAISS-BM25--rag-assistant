Poisson process on an $n$-sphere

I have an algorithm that embeds data points into Euclidean space. If I norm these points then they will lie on the unit $n$ -sphere, where $n+1$ is the dimensionality of the embedding space (generally 512 in my case). My problem is: I want to determine if a certain subset of these points is distributed as a uniform Poisson process . The idea here is I know a priori that a subset of points belongs to a certain class and if I can show that these points are not uniformly distributed then this suggests my algorithm is properly embedding similar points close together. I'm not sure how to formulate this problem, and in general the literature on Poission processes in $n$ -spherical spaces is minimal. Baddeley gives an example here (example 1.3 and figure 13) but it is only on the $2$ -sphere and doesn't generalize to higher dimensional spaces. I understand that I could generate a Poisson process on the $n$ -sphere by changing his measure function $$\Lambda(S)=4\pi\beta$$ to $$\Lambda(S)=\frac{2\pi^\frac{n+1}{2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}\beta$$ (i.e. the surface area of a unit $n$ -sphere with Poisson process intensity $\beta$ ). However, I don't know how to actually test the uniform Poisson process null hypothesis given a set of data points on the $n$ -sphere. I'm not testing whether the number of points is expected under a uniform Poisson process, but rather if the spatial distribution of these points on the $n$ -sphere follows a uniform Poisson process. Any help is appreciated!
