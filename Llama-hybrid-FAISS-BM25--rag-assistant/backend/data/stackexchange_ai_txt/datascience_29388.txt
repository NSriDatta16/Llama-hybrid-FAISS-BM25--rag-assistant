It's much easier to identify projects where a neural network won't work than to identify projects where it will work. For example, if you have fewer than 10,000 records (highly subjective rule of thumb), then a neural net will probably overfit and not work. If a human struggles with the labels, then a neural network will probably struggle too. In my subjective opinion, your problem sounds like it will be difficult for a neural network (or any model) to learn without a substantial amount of records. You would probably need several hundred thousand at a minimum, not including data augmentations like flipping images, etc, or something on the scale of an ImageNet dataset (i.e., millions). I say that because even as a human being I don't know what those collar types are that you described. On a dataset in the low tens of thousands you could probably train a convnet to identify shirts vs pants, but I highly doubt it could accurately detect collar types.
