I'd suggest at least namespacing things to ensure you don't pollute the global namespace. For example: var myNameSpace = { a: function(){//a function that applies plugin to an element}, b: function() {// another function} }; $(document).ready(function() { myNameSpace.a(); }); The main benefit is that you're able to compartmentalize your code into logical units of work which focus on specific tasks. It'll make code organization substantially easier. Rebecca Murphey did a wonderful write-up on this topic which you can read here: http://bit.ly/6og36U You can also separate your JS into their own unique files and write a routine to leverage jQuery's getScript() method to load the necessary files on-demand ( http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.getScript ). The key would be to determine the dependencies in your script and load the .js file at the appropriate time.
