iPhone Xcode Project Organization Question

I built a simple iPhone application for a customer This will be distributed via iTunes using Ad Hoc Provisioning profile I need to build two different executables 1) a test application and an 2) official application the only differences between the two applications are: . the Default.png startup screen . some image icons in the application . the application icon how can I organize my xcode project so I can use a single project for the two applications ? - do I need to create multiple targets ? - can I use the same Application name and Provisioning profiles for the two application or I need different ones ? - is it simpler to add a shell script at building start and just personalize the application graphics depending on a SWITCH VARIABLE defined in the project ? thank you for your help
