locating a flat file from SQL server 2005

I have built an SSIS job in visual studio 2005 that accesses a flat file and updates a table in SQL Server 2005. This works perfectly. I then store a copy on SQL Server by using the server storage option in the protection level property. When I try to run this it cannot locate the flat file. The flat file is located on a server and I use the IP address to access it. I have noticed that if I remove my maping to this server and run the job from visual studio, it cannot find it either. Hoe do I access the file from SQL Server 2005 ? I intend to schedule this job to run automatically on SQL Server. Many Thanks for any help you can give. Ronnie Carlin
