Since this is a desktop application it's a bit different. It's really how much data are we talking about here. If you've only got 100 or so users, and it's only profile pictures, I would store it in the DB for a few practical reasons: No need to manage or worry about a separate file store You don't need to give shared folder access to each user No permissions issues No chance of people messing up your image store It will be included in your standard DB backup It will be nicely linked to your data (no absolute vs. relative path issues) Of course, if you're going to be storing tons of images for thousands of users, I would go with the file system storage.
