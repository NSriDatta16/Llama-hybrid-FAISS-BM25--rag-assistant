Wikipedia has a comprehensive introduction to the functional principal component analysis. But it is too rigorous for people who have little experience in maths or statistics. The name of functional PCA is "misleading" in some sense since theoretically, it operates on a stochastic process composed of infinite functions, rather than finite sample functions. The smoothing is a numerical "correction" for the limited samples, as well as the "discontinuous" observance across the domain in reality (for example time). The Karhunen-Lo√®ve theory is the foundation of the functional PCA. It is an "eigendecomposition" of a covariance function of a centered, square-integrable stochastic process in $L^2$ metric space. On the other hand, PCA is an "eigendecomposition" of the variance-covariance matrix calculated from a centered finite dataset in $R^p$ metric space (p variables). Many similarities share between functional PCA and PCA once the correct "working directory" is set. So you have to figure out what is a stochastic process, what is $L^2$ metric space, in the first place. They are quite intuitionally accessible. a funny "fact", $$ \lim \limits_{\substack{sample~size~of~functions~ \rightarrow ~\infty \\ "discontinuity"~of~f \rightarrow ~ 0} } PCA \longrightarrow fPCA $$ without smoothing.
