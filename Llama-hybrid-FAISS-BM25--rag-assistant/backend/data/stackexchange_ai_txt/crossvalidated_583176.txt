Incorporating seasonality in regression #gTrans #rms

I have been looking into incorporating seasonal effects using the gTrans function in the rms R package. However, I am having some difficulty interpreting the statistical explanation in the document. As explained here: https://hbiostat.org/R/rms/gtrans.html#non-spline-basis section 6... We can make a function called hrm and then provide this to gTrans to model seasonality. hrm My model is actually a longitudinal logistic regression with additional predictors though I have pasted the code in the document for brevity. My questions are: I believe that 0.2 is the length of the seasonal cycle. So if my time variable, t, is in days am I correct to replace 0.2 with 365 to allow seasonal cycle to be one year? Am I correct to think of slopeChange, sin and cos just like other variables in the regression (since they will get a regression coeficient), its just that they are transformations of x? Regarding the slopeChange term, I think that it doesnt have any effect for x I think that we could also write the slopeChange term as: slopeChange=ifelse(x However, in both cases we are defining this new transformed x variable to have values between 0 and 5 (assuming maximum x is 1). I'm wondering WHY this choice of values? For example why not: slopeChange=ifelse(x where we have added the constant 1 on the end. This actually changes the estimated parameter for the variable slopeChange but I don't know why; if we simply add a constant to a predictor (each value in the vector) in a regression, this should not change the estimated parameter.
