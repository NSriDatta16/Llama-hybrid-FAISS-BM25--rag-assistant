Python: http://www.python.org Fast to develop in, huge standard library, lots of support, great interpreter, great scripting language. Perl: Do I really need to say more? Ruby: http://www.ruby-lang.org Another great scripting language, very powerful, OO to the core but still pragmatic. Very popular right now, with lots of addon libraries. Lua: http://www.lua.org A small,fast scripting language designed to be embedded in other applications. Small standard library with a reasonable set of basic stuff and additional libraries / C extensions to do other stuff. Very popular in games - the World of Warcraft client UI is built and extended in Lua.
