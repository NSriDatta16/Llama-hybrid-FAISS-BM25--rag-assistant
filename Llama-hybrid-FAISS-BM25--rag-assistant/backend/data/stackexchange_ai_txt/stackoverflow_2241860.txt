Lisp has been around for a long time, there are many (fragmented) communities. There's really no way to "create" a common community, especially from the outside. Paul Graham would be a likely (IMNO, N=naive) person to potentially unite a large lisp community, given his popularity among younger programmers, as well as his background in lisp (writing On Lisp ). However, he has chosen to create a yet another dialect of lisp, Arc . Many folks have written about the fragmentation of the Lisp community, or Lisp's inability to "catch on". Some examples: here , here , here , and here . So, while your idea is a good one, it is probably fruitless. That being said, don't let me stop you from rising up and being such a uniting figure in the Lisp community. As far as existing tutorials, the Emacs Wiki is a good starting place for learning Emacs Lisp . And for an introduction to Scheme - as well as a good introduction to programming in general, there's the classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs . I find those two resources to be good starting points for learning Emacs Lisp and Scheme. I haven't played with Arc, but presumably there would be some good tutorials on learning Arc - because it is designed in part to be a good language for creating basic web apps .
