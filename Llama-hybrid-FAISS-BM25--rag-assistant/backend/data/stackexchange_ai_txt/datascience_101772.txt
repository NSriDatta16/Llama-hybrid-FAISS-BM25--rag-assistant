How do you know PCA would work on your dataset?

From my understanding, PCA assumes that redundancy in features can be explained by linear relationships. It also finds orthogonal bases, so when the variance of your data is maximized along non-orthogonal directions PCA isn't going to give you what you hope for. In my, albeit limited, experience I've never worked on a dataset where I can safely assume the above two conditions hold. At the same time, when working with audio or video it has amazing results. What is it about audio and video that allow those assumptions to hold? When working outside those domains, how can you know PCA isn't just giving you random stuff? Thanks!
