Multinomial logistic regression with class probability as target variable

I have a multinomial classification problem where I have > 2 classes, and for each observation I have i) the class the observation is assigned to, and ii) the probability of it belonging to a class (you could interpret this as the certainty of the observation belonging to that class). Is there a regression technique that takes not just the class label but also these probabilities into account? I know I can easily convert the probabilities into a categorical target and run a multinomial logistic regression, but was wondering if there's a way to preserve this information? I guess what I'm looking for here is a combination of a multinomial logistic regression and a beta regression. Any pointers to what literature there is out there or any relevant R/python packages would be appreciated!
