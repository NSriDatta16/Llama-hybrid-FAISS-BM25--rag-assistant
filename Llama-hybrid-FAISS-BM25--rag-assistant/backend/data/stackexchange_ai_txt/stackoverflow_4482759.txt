The "C" in C++ has a long history. Naturally, it is the name of the language Dennis Ritchie designed. C's immediate ancestor was an interpreted descendant of BCPL class B designed by Ken Thompson. BCPL was designed and implemented by Martin Richards from Cambridge University while visiting MIT in the other Cambridge. BCPL in turn was Basic CPL, where CPL is the name of a rather large (for its time) and elegant language developed jointly by the universities of Cambridge and London. Before the London people joined the project, "C" stood for Cambridge . Later, "C" officially stood for Combined . Unofficially, "C" stood for Christopher because Christopher Strachey was the main power behind CPL. [Bjarne Stroustrup, The Design and Evolution of C++ , page 64]
