Update: August 19 I've now had a look at both Brewer's 1963 and 1975 articles. The 1975 method is indeed the generalization for (n>2) as Stas stated, with the same draw probabilities for n = 1 & 2. This has been a very informative topic. I wondered why there were two versions of "Brewer's Method" in Roberto's question.} The first formula Roberto gave is from "Brewer's Procedure" (Procedure 8) in Brewer and Hanif (1982). As Stas points out, it is based on Brewer (1975). However the second version that Roberto shows is that which Cochran (1977, p. 261) and the SAS manual also call "Brewer's Method" for n = 2. This turns out to be from Brewer (1963). It doesn't appear in Brewer & Hanif (1982) It does, as Procedure 8. Durbin (1967, p.54) created another method for n = 2 (Method I). It is Procedure 9 in B & H. Durbin was unaware of Brewer (1963), and prior to publication, JNK Rao pointed out to Durbin that the pairwise inclusion probabilities are identical to those in Brewer's 1963 method. Sampford (1967) extended Brewer's 1963 method to n>2. He gave several suggestions for implementation. That used by SAS is what Sampford called "method c" (p. 502). It is Procedure 11 in B & H, who call it the "Rao-Sampford Rejective" method. It is interesting because all draws are made with replacement; if a duplicate appears, the sample is rejected. Sampford's method is easy to write down. Define $$ \lambda_i = p_i/(1-n p_i) $$ Draw the first unit with probability $p_i$. Draw all others with probability $\lambda_j/\sum_k^N \lambda_k$, with replacement If a drawing duplicates any previously selected item, reject the sample and begin again with Step 1. The joint probabilities $\pi_{ij}$ of inclusion for elements $i$ and $j$ are needed to compute a proper variance estimate for the Horvitz-Thompson ($p_i$ weighted) estimator.. Sampford gives the formula for $\pi_{ij}$ on page 503 of his article and some examples of its calculation in his section 5. See also the SAS SURVEYSELECT manual, p. 8493.
