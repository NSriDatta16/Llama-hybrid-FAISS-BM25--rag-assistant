I don't think this can be solved with CSS alone since you have some DIVs with multiple colors. You could possibly simulate that in CSS, but it probably would not be very elegant. I haven't worked with JavaScript in a long time or much at all, so the solution may need some tidying up or syntax may need to be checked, but I think I have a potential frame you could work with. You set your three color buttons up, and have onClick (or jQuery equivalent) to a function. Then for the DIVs, you can put them inside a loop (there may be a better solution ... like maybe make the function make the loop go through again so it's not always running). Here's the function. Before the buttons, of course. function theSwitch(color) { if (color === 'red') { var redStatus = 0; return redStatus; } } Theoretically (since I'm not testing this), we change a variable to zero because we want to compare values for the div s that have multiple colors. This is how you could check the two colors, I believe: if (redStatus === 0 && greenStatus === 0) { document.getElementById("divRedGreen").style.display = "none"; } As you can see here, it requires BOTH buttons to be pressed before it is hidden, which is your desired effect. You can do many, many variations depending what you are trying to do or whatever is most organized, but I think this could helpful as a loose base.
