What is the best way to avoid data leaking in timeseries forecasting multiple labels?

I'm predicting crypto pairs volume. I want to increase my accuracy by using one model for different pairs. Question is how to avoid timedata leaking? Example n - pairs, t- time, m - features for each. I can put all data in one vector n*m and predict all pairs simultaniously, but it will be a lot of features and I don't like it. If I'm using some embedding or one-hot for pairs, model can get sequence of all pairs at time t, but model will get future info. What is the common/best approach to pass data in this situation? Maybe collect all pairs at time t in one batch, will it help?
