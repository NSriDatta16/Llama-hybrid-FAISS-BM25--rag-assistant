Normalizing matrix values python/R

I am trying to fill missing values in 1000 x 1000 matrices. Dataset1 contains such 1000 x 1000 matrice with value ranging 1-100. Any point which has value 0, that means it is missing. Sample dataset: Link Dataset2 is historical data to get missing values. It has 4k rows with 2 column. column1 contains any values among 1-100 and column 2 corresponding state value ranging from 1-4. It looks like this: Link My approach to get the missing value: Get average state value for each 1-100 value in ds2 replace each values 1-100 in ds1 with is mapping values in ds2 to get missing value, get average of all neighbour for each point having values 0 Is it correct for missnig value retrival? In python or R, is there any helping package for this stuff? doing mauanlly I could have done, but willing to know if any supportive function are there
