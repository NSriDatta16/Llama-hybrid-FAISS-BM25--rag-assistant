Since I don't see why removing that line would prevent the $.post line from happening, I'm going to start suggesting fixing some syntax problems that the browser may be having trouble parsing. You need quotes around the values you're putting in for class name and button id. Those lines were causing trouble for my syntax highlighter, so who knows... Remove Also this part is just a suggestion, but instead of embedding a per row, you should do something like adding a class to each button so that you only have to define your jquery action once. Consider this: Remove $(function() { $(".remove-button").click(function() { $.post('/?ajax', { csrfmiddlewaretoken: $('input[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]').val(), id: $(this).attr('id') }); }) }) The dev server is thinking it's a GET request -- can you try manually using the $.ajax function? I wonder if a previous version of jQuery got confused with you passing in get params to your POST? $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: '/?ajax', data: { csrfmiddlewaretoken: $(...), id: ... } }); PS: This is a place where google chrome dev tools or firebug come in really handy, you can just type away raw jquery commands :)
