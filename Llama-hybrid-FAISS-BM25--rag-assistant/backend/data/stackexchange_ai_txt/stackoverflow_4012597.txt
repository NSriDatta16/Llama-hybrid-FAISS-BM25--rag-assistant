You don't really define what the problem is and its difficult to debug anything without being able to run the website. However, it might be that function main() can't find the image control. ASP.NET automatically renames your ids to ensure that they are unique. So that MapImage element id will actually be Callback_Mapimage . function main() { alert("foo"); initWheelZoomEventhandler(); makeDraggable(document.getElementById("Callback_Mapimage")); } In Asp.net 4 you can set ClientIdMode="static" on the image to prevent this renaming.
