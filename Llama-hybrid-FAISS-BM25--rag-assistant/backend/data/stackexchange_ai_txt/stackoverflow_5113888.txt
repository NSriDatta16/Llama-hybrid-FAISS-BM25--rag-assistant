It is very important to have a proper project management software in an organization. A project management software helps in lot of areas like: application life-cycle management goal setting internal business analysis manage multiple projects at same time and more. If asked personally, I have been using a project management software for the last 6 months for strategy development process & application life-cycle management in my organization and it has also turned to be very helpful in managing projects. I will recommend you to opt for one to manage your work easily.
