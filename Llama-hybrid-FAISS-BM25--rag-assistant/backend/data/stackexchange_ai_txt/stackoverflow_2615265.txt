How to determine which source files are required for an Eclipse run configuration

When writing code in an Eclipse project, I'm usually quite messy and undisciplined in how I create and organize my classes, at least in the early hacky and experimental stages. In particular, I create more than one class with a main method for testing different ideas that share most of the same classes. If I come up with something like a useful app, I can export it to a runnable jar so I can share it with friends. But this simply packs up the whole project, which can become several megabytes big if I'm relying on large library such as httpclient. Also, if I decide to refactor my lump of code into several projects once I work out what works, and I can't remember which source files are used in a particular run configuration, all I can do it copy the main class to a new project and then keep copying missing types till the new project compiles. Is there a way in Eclipse to determine which classes are actually used in a particular run configuration? EDIT: Here's an example. Say I'm experimenting with web scraping, and so far I've tried to scrape the search-result pages of both youtube.com and wrzuta.pl. I have a bunch of classes that implement scraping in general, a few that are specific to each of youtube and wrzuta. On top of this I have a basic gui common to both scrapers, but a few wrzuta- and youtube-specific buttons and options. The WrzutaGuiMain and YoutubeGuiMain classes each contain a main method to configure and show the gui for each respective website. Can Eclipse look at each of these to determine which types are referenced?
