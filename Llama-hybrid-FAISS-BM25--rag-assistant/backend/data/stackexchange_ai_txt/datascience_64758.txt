By Default, SVM in Sklearn uses RBF Kernel. You have to try out all the 3 kernels, with different Gamma and C. SVM treats outliers better and add a penalty on every outlier it detects. You should understand your data well or vizualize well to know what kernel fits well. SVM literally adds a new dimension to the data to create a hyperplane.
