What if MNIST dataset had another feature

MNIST is a famous data set of hand written digits. Suppose we knew who wrote digits for example, female, left handed, 25 yrs old. How would I use these information in CNN in tensorflow? or any other library. Digits are images and that what CNN handles well but gender, dominant hand, and age are not images. How would you use that information?
