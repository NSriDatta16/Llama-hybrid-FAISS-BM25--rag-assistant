The most straightforward way to do this would be to set up your data-set with a row for each group within each study so you would have about 150 rows if all studies had all three groups. The fit a meta-analystic model with a random effect for study and a moderator variable with three levels for group. You would need to decide on which transformation to use for the proportions, options would include: raw proportions, log, logit, Freeman-Tukey and perhaps others. The advantage of this analysis would be that you would be able to incorporate all the studies even those with only one group. The disadvantage of that would be that you are then comparing between as well as within studies since if all the studies which just use group A are fundamentally different in some way that will confound your results. There are examples of how to do this on Wolfgang Viechtbauer's pages about his metafor package http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/analyses Having said all that you are studying thyroid cancer and although this has a good prognosis none the less human lives may be at stake here and I think you should consider getting expert help locally as if you thought that a $t$-test might work here you may need some more help than we can give you on a question and answer site.
