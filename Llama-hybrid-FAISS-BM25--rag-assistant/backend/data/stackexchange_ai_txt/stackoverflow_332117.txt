Embedding Video in a WinForms app

I need to be able to embed and control the playback of an AVI file in a WinForms app, using C#. The video needs to be embedded in the form, not launched in a separate media player window. What's the best approach to do this? I found the System.Media namespace, which sounded promising, but it appears that is only useful for sound. Do I use DirectX to do this? MCI? Or some other approach?
