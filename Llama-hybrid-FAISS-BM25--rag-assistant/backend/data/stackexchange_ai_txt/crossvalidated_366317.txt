I also have the similar question when reading the "deep contextual" paper. After checking the reference listed in the paper, I think the context independent token representations is trained based on character level RNN that for represent each token with a feature vector. I found a concise but clean version of tutorial talking about the paper: https://medium.com/@ayush2503/contextualized-word-representations-5df54663323f it also mentions that Token Representation: A context-independent token representation is computed with character convolutions.
