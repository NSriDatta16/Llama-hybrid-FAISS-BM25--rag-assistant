Mark Cidade's answer is right - you need to supply a tuple. However from Python 2.6 onwards you can use format instead of % : '{0} in {1}'.format(unicode(self.author,'utf-8'), unicode(self.publication,'utf-8')) Usage of % for formatting strings is no longer encouraged. This method of string formatting is the new standard in Python 3.0, and should be preferred to the % formatting described in String Formatting Operations in new code.
