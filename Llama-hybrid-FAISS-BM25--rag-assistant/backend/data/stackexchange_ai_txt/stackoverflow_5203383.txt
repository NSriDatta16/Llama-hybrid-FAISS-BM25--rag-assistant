As Austin said in SL4 you can't just pass your collection with type IEnumerable as parameter when your method expects a IEnumerable . But if you don't want to go 'dynamic', don't forget you can still do this (using System.Linq) : var abc = new EntitySet (); new Consumer().SetFunctionalAreas(abc.Cast ()); new Consumer().SetFunctionalAreas(FunctionalAreas.Cast ()); Not quite elegant, but hey, that does the trick ;)
