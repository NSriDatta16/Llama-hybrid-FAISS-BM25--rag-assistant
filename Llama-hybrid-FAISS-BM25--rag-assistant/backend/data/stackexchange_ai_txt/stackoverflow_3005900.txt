I want to select a particular list of words containing certain characters using php

I want to select a particular list of words in a paragraph containing certain characters $query_search_text= "SELECT * FROM para where para_main='%text_words'"; I tried using the % sign, but it does not work. It works if I give in the full text. Thanks Jean
