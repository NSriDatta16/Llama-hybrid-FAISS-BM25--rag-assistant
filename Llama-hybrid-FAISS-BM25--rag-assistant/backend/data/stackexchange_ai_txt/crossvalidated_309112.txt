For persons aged 25 and over in the US would the average or the median be higher for income?

Question: For persons aged 25 and over in the US would the average or the median be higher for income? I'm not sure how to answer this. If I assume that the wage increases with age, and that every age range is equally represented, then perhaps I'll (extremely roughly) have a graph like this : There the y axis is the wage,and the x axis is representing age. Then the median wage is where half people earn more, and half of the people earn less. And the mean wage is the average wage that people will earn. In this case the mean will be greater than the median. But I'm not sure if this is an appropriate way to consider this problem, or how to explain it clearly.
