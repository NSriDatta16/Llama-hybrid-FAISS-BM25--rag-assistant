Tweepy API: how to get a user's id from a status SearchResult object?

I'm trying to write a script to follow people on twitter. The tweepy API seems pretty good, but I'm running into some unintuitive behavior related to the mapping from user's ids to their screen names. In [1]: import tweepy In [2]: api = tweepy.API() # get an arbitrary tweet In [3]: tweet = api.search("anything")[0] In [5]: tweet.text Out[5]: 'Currently mourning the [potential] loss of around 500 pictures I took while in Oklahoma. Anyone know anything about Canon Rebels?' # who tweeted it? In [6]: tweet.from_user Out[6]: 'helloregan' # get the tweeters id In [7]: tweet.from_user_id Out[7]: 101962792 # i'm paranoid. just want to make sure its right. In [8]: helloregan = api.get_user(user_id=tweet.from_user_id) # yep, same id. In [9]: helloregan.id Out[9]: 101962792 # lets check to see if its the same screen name? no. different person. In [10]: helloregan.screen_name Out[10]: 'kikiiputh' What gives?
