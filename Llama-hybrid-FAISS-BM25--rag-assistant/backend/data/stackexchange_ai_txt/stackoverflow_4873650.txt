embedding multiple Twitter buttons in one page?

I'm using Drupal and I have a list of items (View with many nodes) in one page. I want to add a Twitter button for each of these items in the list, however I'm only able to create a tweet button for the page and not for each item http://twitter.com/about/resources/tweetbutton Any idea how to embed multiple Twitter buttons in one page ?
