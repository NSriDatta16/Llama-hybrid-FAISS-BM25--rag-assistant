Following Bishop's notation, the FA model is written as (Eq. 12.64, p. 584): $$ p(x|z)=\mathcal{N}(x|\mathbf{W}z+\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\psi}) $$ where $\boldsymbol{\psi}$ is a $D\times D$ diagonal matrix of so-called variable uniquenesses, that is the variance not accounted for by the latent factors, whereas $\mathbf{W}$ reflects factor loadings $\lambda_i$, that is the correlation of variable $i$ with factors represented in $z$ (more exactly, the square of $\lambda_i$ is the variance explained by the latent factor). If you're not familiar with the FA literature, I would suggest "lighter" approach, e.g. William Revelle has good tutorials on his website personality-project.org ; especially, I would suggest Chapter 6 of his forthcoming book on Psychometric methods entitled Constructs, Components, and Factor models . You will shortly understand the relations between PCA and FA. Specifically, with PCA, we are constructing linear combinations of observed variables (this yields a composite variable), whereas in FA we are expressing each variable as a weighted combination of hypothesized latent factors (where weights are called loadings) plus an error term (the $\boldsymbol{\psi}$ in the above formula). In sum, the FA model incorporates a model for noise--this is what is expressed in Equation 12.65; but see What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis , for additional discussion.
