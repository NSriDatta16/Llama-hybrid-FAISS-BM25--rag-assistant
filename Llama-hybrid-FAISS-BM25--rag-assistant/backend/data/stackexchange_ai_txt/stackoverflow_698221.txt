If you have access to the script you could add msgbox() at various parts in the script to try to see what specific line is failing. That is the way I trouble shoot vbscripts. There are more elegant ways to do the debugging but it is quick and dirty. Just remember to remove them afterward. =) So... Msgbox("Phase1") Msgbox("Phase2") Msgbox("Phase3") Msgbox("Phase4") so if Phase 2 shows up before the error message that means the problem is after Phase 2 but before Phase 3. Space out the msgboxes between your code. Once you isolate the area you can then be very specific about the location of the msgboxes and find the exact line that is causing the issue.
