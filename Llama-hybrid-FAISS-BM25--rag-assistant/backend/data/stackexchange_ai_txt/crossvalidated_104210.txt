Efficient solution of fmincg without providing gradient?

I'm working on multiclass logistic regression model with a large number of features ( numFeatures >100). Using a maximum likelihood estimation-based cost function and gradient, the fmincg algorithm solves the problem quickly... However, I am also experimenting with a different cost function and do not have a gradient... Is there a good way to speed up the calculation process? E.g. a different algorithm or fmincg setting?
