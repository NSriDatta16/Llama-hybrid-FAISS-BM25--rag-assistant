This is not a matter of different types of probability. It is really a matter of what you can use to estimate it. In the case of the woman they want to predict the probability of an accident say over a 3 year period given personal characteristics. The insurance company can look at people that have been insured and can compare those that had accidents over a 3 year period with those that don't. Then with this data they can create a logistic regression model using characteristics such as age and gender. The model is then applied with the characteristics for the woman in question to estimate the probability that she will have an accident in the next 3 years. The cost of the premium will then depend on how high this estimated probability is. The difference between the court and the insurance company is that the insurance company found that gender was useful to include in their model. The court is saying that inspite of that they see using gender as being discriminatory against women. So they are telling the insurance company that they cannot use gender in their model. They would probably also rule against race as a variable to use in the model but would allow age. Once gender is taken out the new model will give a different estimate of the probability for this woman and probably it would be lower which may mean a lower premium.
