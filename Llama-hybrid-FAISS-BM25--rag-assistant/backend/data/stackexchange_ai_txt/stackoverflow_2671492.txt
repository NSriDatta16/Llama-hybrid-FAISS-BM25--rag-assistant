Apparently this just isn't possible. My first hint was getting absolutely no response from this site. I began to look into making a web setup project but was unsatisfied at having to edit the installation dialogues to get a custom installation folder. All I really need is something that will copy the published output of a Web Application (not Web Site you 2.0 peeps). I think I have cheated the system by creating a simple Windows Setup program. Surprisingly I am able to include the primary output of my web application which satisfies my need. I DO have to manually add each projects debug symbols if I want them so the process can be lengthly but doable. Like I said, not completely satisfied because I wanted to get the files in a nice deploy folder for my QA group to work with but feeding them an MSI has its advantages I suppose. I leave this for anyone to comment on. I still can't believe I can't do this from msBuild or any other tool.
