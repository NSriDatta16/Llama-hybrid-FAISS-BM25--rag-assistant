There are a number of methods to choose from but there is not one definitive method (although it would be nice). In our environment we use agile. This makes sense for us due to a number factors: Typical time contraints (although every project is not the same, the way the time constraints are determined is pretty consistent) Development resources What type of client interaction are you able to have (are they responsive or un-responsive) Organization guidelines (e.g. do they expect a certain document artifact before the project begins and do they have requirements for what is in that artifact) Budget (again not always the same, but consistent in method for determining the budget) I would also recommend looking at other companies in your industry and seeing how they handle things. The single biggest thing I would recommend, don't get to hung up on the process, just build some great stuff and let the process start to refine from that. Although we use agile methods, it is kind of our own blend which works for us. Hope that helps, I am sure there will be way better answers than mine :-)
