xsd defines the data structure, not really the access approach. I don't think you can express "this is a lookup" in xsd : everything is either values or set of values/entities. If you want specific handling, you might consider custom serialization - or alternatively consider your DTOs and your working classes as separate things, and simply translate between the two. [edit] As leppie notes - you can write your own indexer (typically in a partial class if generating cs from the xsd) that loops over the list to find the item: this will give you the caller usage, but not really the full dictionary experience (uniqueness, O(1) retrieval, etc)
