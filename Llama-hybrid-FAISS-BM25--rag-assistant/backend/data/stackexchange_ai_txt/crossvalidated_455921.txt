R package for Bayesian generalized non-linear model

I would like to know if it is possible to fit the Lee-Carter model in a Bayesian setting. This model is used to forecast population mortality dynamics and has the following form: $$ log(\mu_{xt})=\alpha_x+\beta_x \kappa_t ,$$ where $\beta_x $ and $\kappa_t $ are factors for age and year, respectively. Due to the multiplication of predictors, this model does not fit in the GLM framework and cannot be fitted with the stan_glm function of the rstanarm package. In the frequentist setting, this model can be fitted with the gnm package but I couldnâ€™t find a Bayesian equivalent. Do you know if there is a Bayesian equivalent to the gnm package? Or should I define a stan model with specific priors and likelihood function? Thank you very much for your help!
