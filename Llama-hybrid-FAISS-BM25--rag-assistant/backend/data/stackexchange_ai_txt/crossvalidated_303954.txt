two questions; how to interpret the AUROC (area under the ROC curve)

Suppose I have fitted a Logistic regression model that predicts $P(Y=1|\boldsymbol{X})$ the presence of a disease which is encoded to $1$, and if not then $0$. The AUROC (area under the roc curve) shows a high discriminatory power say: $85\%$. So any randomly chosen person with the disease will have a higher predicted probability than a person without the disease - $85\%$ of the time. If the regression model gives me a subject $A$ with a predicted probability of $0.6$ and this seems to be a high probability compared to other subjects. Would it be correct to say that there is $85\%$ chance that $A$ has the disease? Can you give me some examples on how I can utilize my regression model knowing that it has strong discriminatory power?
