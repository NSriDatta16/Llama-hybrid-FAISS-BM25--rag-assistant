So we can see that in prediction outputs we have 1-step lag. How can I resolve that? When you use historical data to predict future data, you will frequently find that the predictions appear to lag the realizations. Here is why; many macroeconomic and financial time series behave similarly to random walks (maybe with a drift, maybe with time-varying variance, but ultimately dominated by the random walk nature). If the data generating process is a random walk, $$ x_t = x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t $$ with $\varepsilon_t \sim i.i.d.(0,\sigma^2)$, the optimal* one-step-ahead prediction is $$ \hat x_{t+1|t}:=\mathbb{E}(x_{t+1}|x_{t},x_{t-1},\dots)=x_{t} $$ which happens to be the realization $x_{t+1}$ lagged by one ($x_t$ is $x_{t+1}$ lagged by 1). Given the data generating process, this apparently lagging prediction is the best we can get*. Then there is no way we can "fix" the "problem of lagging predictions; the problem is built-in due to the nature of the data generating process. Is this same problem mentioned HERE? Broadly, yes, although I am not an expert on real output (some more subject-matter knowledge could be helpful to determine how well the process can be approximated by a random walk). ** under square loss and/or directional 0-1 loss
