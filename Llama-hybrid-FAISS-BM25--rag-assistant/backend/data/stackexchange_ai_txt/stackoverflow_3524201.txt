Keep in mind, the best practice for CakePHP (and most MVC architectures in general) is: Model = fat Controller = thin View = skinny That being said, putting functionality into the Model is not bad, as long as it is applicable to the data you are manipulating. Think of the Model as handling all of the data specific issues (i.e. storage, queries, manipulation, optimization, etc.). The controller handles all of the Business Logic, and Views manage the display of the combination of the two. Helpers are designed to facilitate view functionality while elements are reusable views. As for the rest of your questions, it may be simpler to break them out into individual questions with code samples if you are getting stuck somewhere.
