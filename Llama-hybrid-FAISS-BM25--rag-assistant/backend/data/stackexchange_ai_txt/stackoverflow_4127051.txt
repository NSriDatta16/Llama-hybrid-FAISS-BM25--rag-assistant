IsolatedStorage causes Memory to run out

hey. I'm reading an image from Isolated Storage when the user clicks on an item like this: using (IsolatedStorageFile currentIsolatedStorage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { using (var img = currentIsolatedStorage.OpenFile(fileName, FileMode.Open)) { byte[] buffer = new byte[img.Length]; imgStream = new MemoryStream(buffer); //read the imagestream into the byte array int read; while ((read = img.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0) { img.Write(buffer, 0, read); } img.Close(); } } This works fine, but if I click back and forth between two images, the memory consumption keeps increasing and then runs out of memory. Is there a more efficient way of reading images from Isolated Storage? I could cache a few images in memory, but with hundreds of results, it ends up taking up memory anyway. Any suggestions?
