Can i use SAPI directly to convert Speech to Text from stored audio in real-time

What i really want to achieve is this--> Suppose i play an audio file(using my application) which can either be streamed from the internet/or accessed directly from the local storage. Now i want to configure SAPI to listen to this source instead of the microphone and convert the speech from the audio to text like it does normally.
