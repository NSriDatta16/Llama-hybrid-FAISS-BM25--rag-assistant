Another approach could be to have your authorizator react differently to your xmlhttprequest ... by analizing the $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] variable. If you can conclude that the request is sent by a "XMLHttpRequest" you could display a login form in the modal without doing the redirect. This way the user isn't redirected to another page to again log in but he can log in right from the dialog he opened and continue where he left off. This ofcourse requires some clientside modifications in your script to handle the loginform submit ect ... but is the most elegant solution in terms of usability.
