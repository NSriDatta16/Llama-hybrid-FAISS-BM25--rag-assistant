Bayesian approaches allow you to impart on the model your outside domain knowledge, such as zip code mattering but probably only a little bit. A nice part about this is that you really do have domain knowledge that you want to give your model. Two drawbacks of Bayesian approaches are that a strong prior can be hard to overcome, and there can be lengthy computations. Nonetheless, you might have some luck looking into Bayesian regression and neural networks.
