Please explain why lottery wins can be used as an instrumental variable

I'm reading a research article on the use of instrumental variable and lottery wins as a common example. The topic is using regression to investigate the impact of non-market outcomes on life satisfaction. It is commonly used in well-being valuation research. I kind of understand the use of instrumental variable to tackle endogeneity, that is, the interaction between independent variable and error term. But I don't understand why and (1) how to use another variable to assure exogeneity and randomization, in my case, lottery wins instead of income, and (2) the rationale behind. The amount and frequency of lottery wins is different from income. What's more, we can still report the impact of income on life satisfaction. I get stuck of this for long. Very much grateful if you can help. This is one of the explanation paragraph that may help you get into context: Source: Measuring the Social Impact of Community Investment: The Methodology Paper - by Daniel Fujiwara
