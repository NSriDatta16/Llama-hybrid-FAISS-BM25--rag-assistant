What sort of algorithms can RNN not learn?

People are developing things like a neural Turing machine which can learn simple algorithms. What is the limit of what an RNN can learn? For example for a RNN text generator, can it learn to copy a general character? Or does it have to learn to copy each character separately? What are some things that an RNN can't possibly do that a neural Turing machine can do.
