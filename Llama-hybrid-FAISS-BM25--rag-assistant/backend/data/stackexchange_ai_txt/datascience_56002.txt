Saving images in a non-retraceable way, but still able to train R-CNN's on them

For a computer vision project I am working with images that the company only allows me to have on my computer for a maximum of 24 hours due to regulations. Every day a few hundred images come in via the system. I am trying to solve a object detection problem to prioritize workflow. For this I need more than a few hundred images to train RCNN's. Q: I am wondering if there is a way to save images in such a way that they are NOT re-traceable anymore to the original image, while at the same time it IS possible to train some kind of RCNN on them? I was thinking about saving saving convolutional features and labeled bounding boxes instead of the images. But that way it might be re-traceable and I want to be compliant with the regulations. Also, this way I can't train the convolutional layers of a network anymore, since I will only be working with it's output.
