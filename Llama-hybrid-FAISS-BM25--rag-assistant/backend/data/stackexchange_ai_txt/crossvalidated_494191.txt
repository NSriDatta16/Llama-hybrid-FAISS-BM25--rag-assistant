Non-graphical seasonality tests

I have a problem with identifying seasonality without using plots. From what I have understood, the best way to detect seasonality in a time series is by understanding the data, plotting it and analyzing the autocorrelation plot. Now I would like to apply this process to sales data about multiple products from multiple companies, which means thousands of different time series. Since I cannot take the time to understand and plot data for every product, I would like this process to become "automatic". Automatic in the sense that there would be a data pipeline where, amongst other things, there will be a seasonality test and then a seasonal difference (if seasonality is detected) etc... Just so you can understand: the pipeline's final goal is to return forecasts. That is why I am trying to make my data stationary. I don't think plot analysis is possible (or, at least, easy to implement for a beginner like myself) in such a pipeline. Therefore I cannot rely on it. So my question is: Are there any non-graphical tests that I can use in order to detect seasonality ? I have looked into Ljung-Box but it seems that it is only used for residual analysis when fitting models, which is not what I am looking for. Thank you for your help!
