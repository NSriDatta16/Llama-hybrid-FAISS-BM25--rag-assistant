A lot of applications ask you some initial settings at the first start (Microsoft Office, Visual Studio, etc.). So this behaviour is commonly known by the user. Maybe the problem is more, that these initial settings revive an update of your application. To accomplish this you could save your data in a version independent path within the registry or somewhere below %AppData%. Also it would be helpful to prefill these dialogs at the first startup, by getting these informations somewhere out of the machine (e.g. Company Name can be get from registry [HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\RegisteredOrganization] or as Application Server take the Gateway address, AD Server, whatever most commonly matches). So in a best case the user will be presented with a already correct filled out form and just has to press enter or he makes only the changes that are necessary, but doesn't to fill out the complete dialog by himself. Update: So if the user doesn't know the Application Server path. Who does it? Where resides this information? Maybe you can enforce your customers to provide this information all the same way. Maybe they set some environment variable within the logon script or they put a file with the needed informations on a global accessible place (e.g. where the logon script resides).
