Have a data set for 3 consecutive days. What are my options?

Let's say I have a set regarding the transportation methods(Eg: car, bus, train) used for three consecutive days b y $n$ number of people. For simplicity let us assume that everyone use only one type of a transportation method on a given day so that we have only one data point for a single person for a given day. So the data set for few people would look like as follows. So can I do something meaningful (other than drawing bar charts, pie charts etc. ) with this data? If we have, say data of about 100 people of a certain region I thought of constructing a Markov chain which would lead me to a whole lot of options and results that can be used to predict the future behavior of people under certain assumptions of course. What are the other methods like this that I can use to say something meaningful or to predict the future behavior just by using this data set? Can I use simulation to do something? I am not really familiar with simulation so any ideas related to that will also help me out a lot. Thanks in advance and hope the question is not confusing.
