I bumped into the same problem, found this question, and thought that the solution provided by Ash wasn't what I was looking for; Having to create the HTML myself means less flexibility compared to the built-in Html.DropDownList() function. Turns out C#3 etc. makes this pretty easy. I have an enum called TaskStatus : var statuses = from TaskStatus s in Enum.GetValues(typeof(TaskStatus)) select new { ID = s, Name = s.ToString() }; ViewData["taskStatus"] = new SelectList(statuses, "ID", "Name", task.Status); This creates a good ol' SelectList that can be used like you're used to in the view: Status: The anonymous type and LINQ makes this so much more elegant IMHO. No offence intended, Ash. :)
