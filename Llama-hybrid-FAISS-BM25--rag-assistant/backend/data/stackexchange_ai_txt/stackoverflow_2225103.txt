BizTalk Server is a platform. Part of that platform is SQL Server. This just isn't sales pitch. It has a good portion of its functionality built on SQL Server in the form of stored procs, scheduled jobs, DTC and more. It would not be advisable, let alone possible, to easily port this over to Oracle. I understand your thought process. Many applications use the database tier as just a persistent storage mechanism. BizTalk does not.
