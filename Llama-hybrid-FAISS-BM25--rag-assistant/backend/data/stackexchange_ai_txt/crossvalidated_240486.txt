What is the best way to handle missing data in categorical data where that may have some meaning?

I working with some data to perform some basic logistic regression. The data looks something like this (simplified here): userid eventid eventdate label 1 A 2016-10-15 1 2 A 2016-10-15 0 5 B 2016-09-15 1 1 B 2016-09-15 0 2 C 2016-09-10 0 1 C 2016-09-10 0 So, one of features I'm trying to create is the number of days since the last event, last event before that and so on. This would lead to something like this. userid eventid eventdata days_last_event days_last2_event label 1 A 2016-10-15 30 35 1 2 A 2016-10-05 35 NA 0 5 B 2016-09-30 NA NA 1 1 B 2016-09-15 5 NA 0 2 C 2016-09-10 NA NA 0 1 C 2016-09-10 NA NA 0 So, as you can see the feature columns created will have a lot of NA rows depending upon if the userid has occured before or not. I think having these replaced with 0 would imply something different than what NA would. And ignoring these rows isn't an option. So, what is good practice to handle these kinds of cases? Should it work if I just replaced 0 for NA ?
