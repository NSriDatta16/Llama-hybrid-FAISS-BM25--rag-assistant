Confidence intervals for population proportion $p.$ As in my Comment, if the margin of error $E$ in a confidence interval (CI) for a population proportion $p$ is $1/\sqrt{n},$ where $n$ is the sample size. So the sample size required for margin of error $E$ is $n \approx 1/E^2.$ This relationship is very simple because $E$ is a function of one parameter $p.$ Thus $n = 2500$ gives the confidence interval $\hat p \pm 0.05,$ where $\hat p = X/n$ is the number $X$ of favorable responses divided by sample size $n.$ E = seq(.01, .1, by .01); n = ceiling(1/E^2) cbind(E, n) E n [1,] 0.01 10000 [2,] 0.02 2500 [3,] 0.03 1112 [4,] 0.04 625 [5,] 0.05 400 [6,] 0.06 278 [7,] 0.07 205 [8,] 0.08 157 [9,] 0.09 124 [10,] 0.10 101 For a large majority of surveys, the relationships in the table above are sufficient. For completeness, one should be aware of a couple of special cases For $n$ less than 20% of the population size and $p = 1/2$ these margins of error very nearly reflect inherent sampling error. (Slightly different results might result from a different sample of the same size chosen at random from the population.) For samples larger than 20% of the population size the required $n$ is a somewhat smaller, but surveys with $n$ greater than 20% of population size are rare. If $p or $p > .7,$ then the sample size needed for a given $E$ is also somewhat smaller. For a 95% CI, $E = 1.96\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}.$ when $p=1/2,$ we get the largest $E$ for a given $n.$ Notice that $(0.5)(1-0.5) = 0.25,$ while $(0.3)(0.7) = 0.21$ is not much different. For $p$ very near to $0$ or $1$ the margin of error $E$ for a given $n$ decreases, but then issues other than sampling error may lead to difficulties conducting a survey. Confidence intervals for population mean $\mu.$ For $n$ as large as in a typical survey, the formula for a 95% CI for unknown population $\mu$ is of the form $\bar X \pm 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n},$ where the point estimate of $\mu$ is $\bar X= \frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.$ Ordinarily, $n$ is sufficiently large that, the population standard deviation $\sigma$ can be estimated by the sample standard deviation $S = \sqrt{{\frac{1}{n-1}}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i = \bar X)^2}.$ Thus $E = 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ or $n \approx \left(\frac{2\sigma}{E}\right)^2.$ Beyond the confidence level 95%, we see that two value need to be known or approximated in order to determine the sample size $n.$ First, we need a value for the population standard deviation $\sigma$ and the size of the margin of error $E$ relative to $\sigma.$ For example, if we believe $\sigma = 3$ and we are satisfied to have $E = \sigma/3,$ then the required sample size is $n = \left(\frac{2\sigma}{E}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2(3)}{3/3}\right)^2 = 6^2= 36.$ The task now is to find reasonable ways to estimate $\sigma$ and then $E$ in terms of $\sigma.$ This may not be as difficult as it sounds at the start. If we want to know the mean height $\mu$ in the population of students at a particular university, we can look at height information online to find that $\sigma \approx 3.5$ in is a reasonable value. Or we may guess that a span of heights that includes 95% of students is about $14$ in, which could run from 5"0" to 6'2". Such a span divided by $4$ also gives $\sigma = 3.5.$ Having a CI of width $2E =2$ in, might seem OK. So we would need $n = \left(\frac{2(3.5)}{1}\right)^2 = 49$ subjects. Suppose a certain pharmaceutical drug can be sold if is within 85% to 115% of nominal potency. For pills marked to contain 100mg of the drug. It is known that $\sigma = 4$ mg is the current manufacturing capability (which should keep pills well within the 85ng to 115mg limits). We want to assay drugs sampled from pharmacies to see what average potency customers are getting. We want $E = \sigma/5,$ which is a company standard. Then $n=\left(\frac{2(4)}{4/5}\right)^2 = 100$ pharmacies. Note: For a discussion of $n$ needed for a specified power of a two-sample test in terms of effect size see this link
