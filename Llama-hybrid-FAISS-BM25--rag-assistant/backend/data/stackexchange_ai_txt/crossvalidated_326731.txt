Let me give you a real-world example. Consider the case of a bivariate normal variable $S=(s_t,s_{t+1})$. To make it simple, let us also transform $S$ to $S'$ so that it was centered around $(s_t^*,s^*_{t+1})$ and now is centered around $(0,0)$ by transformation. This puts the problem in the errors space centered around $(0,0)$. Now let's define a new variable as $r_t=\frac{s_{t+1}'}{s_t'}$ Since $S'$ is bivariate normal, this requires $r_t$ to follow a Cauchy distribution. Now let us assume that $r_t$ only has support on the non-negative real numbers. Now one has the truncated Cauchy distribution for $r_t$ and let's untransform $S'$ to $S$ by noting that $\mu_r=\frac{S_{t+1}^*}{S_t^*}$, so we now have a density for $r_t$ of $$\left[\frac{\pi}{2}+\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\mu_r}{\gamma}\right)\right]^{-1}\frac{\gamma}{\gamma^2+(r_t-\mu_r)^2}.$$ Of course, I left out a lot of steps. $\mu_r$ is located at the mode and not the median and of course, no mean exists for this density. Now as to practical application. If $S$ is the set of stock prices for going concerns, then $r_t$ is the instantiation of the reward for investing. Nicely, this also matches the data closely in the real world. The same would be true for anything that experiences exponential growth, such as tumors. For a variety of reasons, you are left with just a Bayesian solution for this and if $\gamma$ were either marginalized out or was known, then $\hat{\mu_r}$ does converge nicely to $\mu_r$ Do note though that $\bar{r}$ does not converge to any value.
