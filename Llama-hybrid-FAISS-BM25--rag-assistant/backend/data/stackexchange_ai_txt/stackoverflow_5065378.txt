When you drag an edge out of a vertex and create a new vertex, a complete clone of the cell is created. If you look in com.mxgraph.model.mxCell the clone() method calls cloneValue(). The default user object (the value) is an XML Node and uses cloneNode on the DOM API. If you wants to change the default behaviour, you could override mxCell for your particular cell type(s) and implement cloneValue() to do something else.
