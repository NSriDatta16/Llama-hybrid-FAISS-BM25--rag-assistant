Access Security level (ACL) with Java EE 6?

I am developing a web application where there are few roles like Admin,Reporter,Manager,Customer.Agent.Based on Role, some menu item need to be displayed . Admin can give permission (dynamically) to user say Agent ( which is not default permission ).Is there a better way to handle this situation ?? Thanks
