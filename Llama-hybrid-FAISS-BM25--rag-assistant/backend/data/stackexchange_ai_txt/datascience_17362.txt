Can BRAT be installed on Microsoft Windows?

I would like to create some annotations on some texts using BRAT (brat rapid annotation tool) . Can BRAT be installed on Microsoft Windows? If so, how? The installation instructions do not rule out Microsoft Windows: The brat server is a Python (version 2.5+) program that runs by default as a CGI application, and the installation script assumes a UNIX-like environment. If you are setting up brat server in a compatible environment with an existing web server that supports CGI, the quick start instructions for using CGI should work. If you don't have a web server installed and want to try brat out locally, you may want try out the quick start instructions for the standalone server. (For security reasons, we strongly recommend serving brat via a full web server such as Apache in production environments.) However they don't seem to give any instructions for Microsoft Windows. I don't want to use some in emulation of Unix such as virtual machines or Cygwin . If interested, to use BRAT with Cygwin : https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/NeuroNER/blob/master/install_windows.md After installing Cygwin, run Cygwin.bat (by default located on C:\cygwin64\ if you used the 64-bit installation for Cygwin). Then, in the terminal that just opened, run: mkdir brat cd brat wget http://weaver.nlplab.org/~brat/releases/brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog.tar.gz tar xzf brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog.tar.gz cd brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog ./install.sh -u python standalone.py BRAT should now be accessible through the web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8001 .
