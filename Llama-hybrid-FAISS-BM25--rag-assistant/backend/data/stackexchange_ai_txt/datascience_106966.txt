I don't think you need machine learning for this. Firstly, lets assume each pattern repeats daily. Extract the lamp feature and then reshape it to be shape (n,24), where n is the number of days you have data. To add a recency bias you could take the m most recent of the n days. From here you can apply the same process as Jayaram suggests. However, what if you don't know the period of the pattern in a feature? To find this out you could use a Fast Fourier Transform . Look for the peaks in your FFT graph, those are the periods. Be careful, as its common for a feature to have multiple periods, so multiple peaks on the graph.
