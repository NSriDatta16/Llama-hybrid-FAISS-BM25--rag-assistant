One way of doing this would be to generate the Laplacian matrix for the graph, then calculate the eigenvalues, and finally count the number of zeros. The graph is strongly connection if there exists only one zero eigenvalue. Note: Pay attention to the slightly different method for creating the Laplacian matrix for directed graphs.
