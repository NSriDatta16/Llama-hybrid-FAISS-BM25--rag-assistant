Fig. 2 and 3 are hyperparameter response surfaces. The diagrams are a level plot for a function of two variables. The authors computed values of the SVM performance at a grid of hyperparamter tuples, and then some plotting algorithm identified level sets. A common choice of the best hyperparameter tuple is to choose the more strongly regularized model within 1 standard error of the optimum. This is called the 1 standard error rule, and it is described in Elements of Statistical Learning . This is done to avoid choosing an overly optimistic model. Another way to display the hyperparameter response surface is a false color diagram, where the color of a particular polygon (usually a rectangle) corresponds to the value of the performance metric at the hyperparameter tuple. But it's only possible to construct these diagrams for very small numbers of hyperparameters, as constructing plots in a larger number of dimensions is impossible.
