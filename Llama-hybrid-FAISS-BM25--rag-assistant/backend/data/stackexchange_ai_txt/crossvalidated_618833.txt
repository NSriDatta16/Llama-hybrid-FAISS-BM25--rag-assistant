What is exact code used for SVM in sklearn library? What is its criterion to stop training?

I am learning SVM. I have 2 questions in mind. First, what criteria use SVM to stop training? when I search for SVM tutorials, I found some. But, in all of them, training is done for example for 1000 iteration. But in sklearn, there is no limit for it. Still, SVM in sklearn perform much faster and sooner its over. How is it possible? What is its advantage over from scratch SVMs that perform much faster? Can some one give me a link to exact code that sklearn used for it, to compare and see why it is faster?
