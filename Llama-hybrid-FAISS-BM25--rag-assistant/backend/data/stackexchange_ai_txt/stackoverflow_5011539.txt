What methods would I use to achieve this (besides SQlite)? An XML file. Or a JSON file. Or a CSV file. Or a plain text file with one string per line. Or any number of other file-based storage strategies. Use standard Java file I/O coupled with whatever parsing/encoding (XML, JSON, CSV, etc.) approach you want. Store the file in the directory retrieved from getFilesDir() in your activity.
