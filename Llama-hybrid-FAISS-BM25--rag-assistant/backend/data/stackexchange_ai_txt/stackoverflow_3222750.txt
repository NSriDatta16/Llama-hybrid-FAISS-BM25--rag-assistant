It is generally not a good idea to override the default build rules, as using the defaults leads to greater portability, and changing them can be incredibly fragile (believe me, I've tried to do what you've asked before. It may work for one platform, but then try to cross-compile the library or build it on a different system and you're toast). I have two suggestions for you that you will hopefully find agreeable. Define a "clean" target that cleans up the mess of ".o" files, or better yet: Use the C++ Project Template (which uses CMake ), which puts ".o" files in a "build" directory.
