How to disable/enable network connection in c#

Basically I'm running some performance tests and don't want the external network to be the drag factor. I'm looking into ways of disabling network LAN. What is an effective way of doing it programmatically? I'm interested in c#. If anyone has a code snippet that can drive the point home that would be cool.
