Yes, if the UIImageViews cover the window and they accept touches the touches will not get passed through. You can place code like this in your UIImageView's touchesBegan to pass touches through to the next object in the layers of objects. [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; Having gone down this road before (have the window or a main UIView control a bunch of things in my game) I would encourage you to think about having each UIImageView capture touch events and deal with them. The UIImageView can then pass information along to other objects as needed. Apple's documentation for UIWindow and the View Programming Guide seem to suggest that you should try to keep code outside of the window and place it into views.
