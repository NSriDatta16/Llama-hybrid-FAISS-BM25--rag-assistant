Openmp support is compiler dependent. So you can't just take omp.h from gcc and use it with sun pro. Use option -xopenmp in sun pro (read more at http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/studio_openmp.html ) And you can take Full installation of recent gcc (4.2 and later) and use it for compiling all your programs with openmp pragmas.
