JW-player Not working in IE

I've the following problem, the following code: $link = $_GET['link']; $id = $_GET['block']; echo " The player will show in this paragraph "; echo " "; echo "var s" . $id . " = new SWFObject('" . COMPANY_URL . "/system/addons/player/player.swf','player". $id ."','210','170','9');"; echo "s" . $id . ".addParam('allowfullscreen','true');"; echo "s" . $id . ".addParam('allowscriptaccess','always');"; echo "s" . $id . ".addParam('wmode','opaque');"; echo "s" . $id . ".addVariable('file', '" . $link . "&repeat=always&autostart=true');"; echo "s" . $id . ".addVariable('skin', '" . COMPANY_URL . "/system/addons/player/simple-sources.swf');"; echo "s" . $id . ".write('preview". $id ."');"; echo " "; This is called every time by a jQuery load (this works because the echo " The player will show in this paragraph "; is showing). In IE the player just leaves the 'player will show in this paragraph' while in all others browsers it is replaced by the jw-player. I can't find any solution on the forum of the jw-player or on stackoverflow... Hope you guys can help! Updated The generated Source firebug
