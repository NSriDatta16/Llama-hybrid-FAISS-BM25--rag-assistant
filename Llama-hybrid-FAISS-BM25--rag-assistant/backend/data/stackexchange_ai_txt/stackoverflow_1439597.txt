Can't you just pull it up in Character Map and take note of the character ranges that are not defined? There's probably a programmatic way to parse a TTF file for this information but if it's just one particular font then it's probably easier just to open Character Map, set the Group by to Unicode Subrange and Group by "Japanese Hiragana/Katakana" and just take note of the defined ranges.
