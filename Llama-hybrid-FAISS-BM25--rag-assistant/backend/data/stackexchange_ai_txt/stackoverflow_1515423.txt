Java EE is made up of many specifications. For example, Java EE 6.0 has spec links here: http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/javaee6.jsp Some specifications can be implemented in non-Java EE containers, such as Tomcat webserver. So, they include jsps and servlets though they implement just a tiny bit of Java EE. So, you can look at here for more about JSP. http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/ It is just a tiny part of the overall Java EE framework, but you don't have to use a Java EE container to use JSPs.
