Personally I have tried several, but my preference is two: 1: TestDriven.NET - for simple testing; I tend to use it with Team Coverage which lets me see the coverage directly in the editor, even though the tests are NUnit (not MSTest) based. 2: a tiny add-on that lets me group files the same way the IDE does - simpler than editing the csproj (DependentUpon IIRC) by hand. From here , but there is an (unlinked) updated msi here with better support for choosing which file is the parent (hold [Ctrl] when choosing "Group Items") I've never found I've needed ReSharper etc, but I should give it another try some day...
