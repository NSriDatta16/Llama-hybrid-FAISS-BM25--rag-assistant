Issue with scrollviewer and canvas

I have a custom canvas control which sits inside a scrollviewer - I have implemented drag, drop and move for items on the canvas and overridden MeasureOverride so that when I move an item around on the canvas its size reflects the changes so if I move the item beyond the visible portion of the canvas it will resize to accommodate the moved item and scrollbars will show appropriately. However if I then bring the item into view by using the scrollbars then start to move the item back out again the scrollbars go a bit haywire. It's a rather poor explanation of the problem I afraid but I am not sure how else to put it but hopefully it will contain enough info for somebody to point me in the right direction.
