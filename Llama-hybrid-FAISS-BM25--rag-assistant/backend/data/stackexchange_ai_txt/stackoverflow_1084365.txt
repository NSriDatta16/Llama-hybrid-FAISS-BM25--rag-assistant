Finding the Nth largest value in a group of numbers as they are generated

I'm writing a program than needs to find the Nth largest value in a group of numbers. These numbers are generated by the program, but I don't have enough memory to store N numbers. Is there a better upper bound than N that can be acheived for storage? The upper bound for the size of the group of numbers (and for N) is approximately 100,000,000. Note: The numbers are decimals and the list can include duplicates. [Edit]: My memory limit is 16 MB.
