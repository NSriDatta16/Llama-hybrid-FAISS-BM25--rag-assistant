Dummy variables and likert scale

So I have two related questions. I am performing a logistic regression model and want to know how to enter these variables. 1) For one survey I have questions and the responses are Yes, Don't know, and No. Can I just create a dummy variable for Yes (1) with Don't know and No coded as 0 or do I need to exclude the Don't know's (this significantly cuts down my sample size). 2) I have a likert scale for another survey (1 strongly agree, 3 neither, 5 strongly disagree) what is the best way to enter this into the model? Just as categorical data. Some people have argued to use as continuous or again to create dummy variables.
