Problem: Anchored controls are overlapping

Let's say we have two panels, listboxes, etc... on the same "row" .. by "row" I mean their TOP property is the same so they are horizontally at the same level. now If I set the anchor property of these two controls to top-left-right and I drag the right side of the form, the contorl that is at left hand side will overlap the control at the right hand side and it gets so ugly. How can I both achieve this resizing goal and also NOT to use the new things we have in C# like TableLayout . thanks
