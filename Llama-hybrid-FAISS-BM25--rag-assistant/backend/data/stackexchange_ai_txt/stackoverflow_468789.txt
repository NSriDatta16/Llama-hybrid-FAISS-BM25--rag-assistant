Is there a way in Java to determine if a path is valid without attempting to create a file?

I need to determine if a user-supplied string is a valid file path (i.e., if createNewFile() will succeed or throw an Exception) but I don't want to bloat the file system with useless files, created just for validation purposes. Is there a way to determine if the string I have is a valid file path without attempting to create the file? I know the definition of "valid file path" varies depending on the OS, but I was wondering if there was any quick way of accepting C:/foo or /foo and rejecting banana . A possible approach may be attempting to create the file and eventually deleting it if the creation succeeded, but I hope there is a more elegant way of achieving the same result.
