I'll give it a shot. Silverlight enabled controls means that you can embed Silverlight controls into Intraweb pages. Technically, this was done back in v9, but not really completed. I am using 10 and have rolled my own control for embedding SL into some of my pages. The controls communicate with the page through JS. Will it be able to host 3rd party SL controls? Yes and no. Yes, 3rd party vendors can make SL controls that you can use in IW. No, not the ones you mention, because they are not just SL, they are also ASP.NET as well. That is, they use the ASP.NET infrastructure to do AJAX and communicate with the page and server. IW will not handle that communication. Crosstalk is a library that will make it possible to access .net assemblies. There is an emphasis that these will not be visual libraries, but just non-visual ones. All of this said, new support for jQuery should provide lots of new controls from 3rd party vendors. Clean jQuery code is not tied to ASP.Net and should work well inside an IW app.
