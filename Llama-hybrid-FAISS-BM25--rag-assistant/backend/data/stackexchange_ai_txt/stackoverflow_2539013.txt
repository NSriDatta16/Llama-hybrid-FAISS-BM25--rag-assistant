Facelet does not convert formatted currency correctly

I have the follwing code inside a facelet page: The converter is because there can be a kind of default value inside the input field, which comes from the bean property. Everything is rendered correctly. The value inside the input field is rendered with an "€" character (e.g. "1.453 €". When I submit the form there comes an error up: "nameOfInputField" konnte nicht als ein Geldbetrag erkannt werden '304,00 â¬' In english it is some like: "nameOfInputField" could not be regognized as an amount of money '304,00 â¬' Please have a look at the "€" character. It seems to be printed as "â¬". While it was rendered correctly before submitting the form, now it looks like "â¬" inside the error message and inside the input field. All pages are encoded in UTF-8. What is the reason for this error? How can fix it? Thanks in advance
