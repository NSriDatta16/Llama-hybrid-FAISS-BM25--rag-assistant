http://nefariousdesigns.co.uk/archive/2010/10/object-oriented-javascript-follow-up-part-2-technical/ has a decent section on namespacing worth reading. http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/ is also another good overview. For more great material on good javascript practices, check out http://javascript.crockford.com/ After our discussion in the comments, I've changed the example to this: var storageLocker = function (selector) { var _selector = selector || "default value"; function myPrivateFunction() { } var public = { get: function () { return _selector; }, uppercase : function () { _selector = _selector.toUpperCase() return this; } } return public; }; // use: var test = storageLocker("search for this").uppercase().get();; alert(test); While this isn't exactly an example of a library/module (because you're accessing the code by calling the constructor directly), it is an example of keeping the same object in scope for further chaining of methods. Actually it's not returning the storageLocker object, it's returning the 'public' object, but that object has access to the storageLocker 's scope through closure. There could be other better ways to do this by perhaps returning the storageLocker object itself, but that would require a bit more thinking through.
