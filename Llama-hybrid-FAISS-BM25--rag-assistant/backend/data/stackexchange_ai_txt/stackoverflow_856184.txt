You're sure you're not making this too complicated, right? This is something Excel does natively. Example: Highlight cell B100 in the above example. Notice in the cell's outline that there's a little black box in the bottom right corner of the cell. This lets you AutoFill. Click that black box and drag it right (to cell C100). You should have just AutoFilled over one column, and C100 should have =SUM($B$99:C99). And if you drag down instead, you'd get =SUM($B$99:B100). If your goal is to repeat this behavior in C#, I would guess that the best way to do this is to figure out how to hook into Excel's AutoFill functions. I don't know exactly how you'd do this in C#, but certainly they're available in VBA (and you can just record a macro, do the above steps, and then look at the generated code to see the AutoFill VBA code). Hope that helps.
