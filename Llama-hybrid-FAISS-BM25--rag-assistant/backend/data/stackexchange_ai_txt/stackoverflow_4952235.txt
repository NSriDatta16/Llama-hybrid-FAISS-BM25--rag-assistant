How to increase icons size on Android Home Screen?

I am trying to make changes to default Android Home Screen (like changing cell dimensions, number of elements per row etc) and wondering if there any way I can change apps icon sizes placed on the home screen? I know that platform takes care of picking up the right dimension image from ldpi (36x36), mdpi (48x48) or hdpi (72x72) directory based on the screen density, but I would like to know if there is any way to increase the icon sizes when application icons are put on the Home Screen irrespective of the screen density?
