What is the fastest sort algorithm for 0-65535 integers?

I have to sort a number of integers, which can have values between 30.000.000 and 350.000.000. There will be between 0 and 65.535 integers, with the average count being 20.000. RAM usage is irrelevant and speed only is important. Later on i will also have to split them into groups, with the divide always being set whenever the gap between two of these values is >65.535, which is what i need the algorithm for. If it makes any difference, the algorithm will be used in a Perl script. Edit: After thinking it over and reading the answers i've come to realize something: I don't actually care about the data itself. As i really only want to find the start and end values of groups with small gaps, the sorting only needs to create buckets and can discard the data. Edit2: After some testing and trying out the answers provided, the fastest way i found was this: my @sort = sort {$a $b} @item_offsets; my @buckets; my $start = shift @sort; push @buckets, [$start,$start]; for my $item ( @sort ) { if ( $item
