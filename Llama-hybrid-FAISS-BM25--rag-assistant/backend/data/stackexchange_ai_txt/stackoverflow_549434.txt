What about non calculus programming?

I recently asked about new languages and language features of the last 10 years , but apparently there is none. However I noticed one issue is that most of our focus is on calculus of various types. But thinking about it, theoretically I can see Neural Networks and Genetic Programming as non calculus based models for programming, that although lack stand alone implementations, are interesting ideas born in recent years (say less than lambda 1930). Also equally out-of-the-box are query languages, regex and graph/tree based designs, that although mathematical in part, are not calculus, which got me thinking about what other non calculus designs in programming are important now, and what other fields might provide us with new programming paradigms? **Note: ** this question is not about "new", but about not originating from calculus.
