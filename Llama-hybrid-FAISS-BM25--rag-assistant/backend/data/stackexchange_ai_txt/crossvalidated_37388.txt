Why is the amount of variance explained by my 1st PC so close to the average pairwise correlation?

What is the relationship between the first principal component(s) and the average correlation in the correlation matrix? For example, in an empirical application I observe that the average correlation is almost the same as the ratio of the variance of the first principal component (first eigenvalue) to the total variance (sum of all eigenvalues). Is there a mathematical relationship? Below is the chart of the empirical results. Where correlation is the average correlation between DAX stock index component returns computed over 15-day rolling window and the explained variance is the share of the variance explained by the first principal component, also computed over the 15-day rolling window. Could this be explained by a common risk factor model such as CAPM?
