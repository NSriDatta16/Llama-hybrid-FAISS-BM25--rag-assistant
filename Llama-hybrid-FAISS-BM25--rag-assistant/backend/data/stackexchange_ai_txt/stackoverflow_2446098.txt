How does jQuery store data with .data()?

I am a little confused how jQuery stores data with .data() functions. Is this something called expando ? Or is this using HTML5 Web Storage although I think this is very unlikely? The documentation says: The .data() method allows us to attach data of any type to DOM elements in a way that is safe from circular references and therefore from memory leaks. As I read about expando, it seems to have a risk of memory leak. Unfortunately my skills are not enough to read and understand jQuery code itself, but I want to know how jQuery stores such data by using data() . http://api.jquery.com/data/
