Numerical evaluation of predictive likelihood

I want to evaluate to predictive models based on their predictive likelihood. In a standard framework I would proceed as follows: The two models predict $y_{t+1}$, whereas model one is based on assumption $$y _t \sim \Pi_1(y_t |\Theta_1)$$ and model two is similar with a different set of parameters $$y _t \sim \Pi_2(y_t |\Theta_2)$$ Bayesian estimation helps me to compute the posterior distribution of the parameters given observed data $D=(y_1,\ldots,y_t)$ by computing $$\pi(\Theta_1|D) \text{ and } \pi(\Theta_2|D)$$ After observing $y_{t+1}$ I could evaluate $$\Pi_i (y_{t+1}|\Theta,D)$$ for the two models and check which model returned the highest score. However, I am faced to the problem that in my case I am interested in $z_{t+1}= f(y_{t+1})$, and this functional $f ()$ does not allow me to evaluate the likelihood at $\Theta$. Is there a suitable (and accepted) way to generate draws from the posterior predictive distribution of $z_{t+1}$ and in a next step compare the (empirical) distribution function of the sampled $z_{t+1}$ with the observed realization?
