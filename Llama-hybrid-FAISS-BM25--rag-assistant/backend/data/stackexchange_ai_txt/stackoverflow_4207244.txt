a: Yes, this is very easily done. Assuming your block of text is one huge string, and that string is called 's', then you could split the text by the new line character, loop through each line, and grab the comments, as follows: string s = @" MikeSmith randdesign chapter 1 paragraph 1 book randdesign a:) comments on the book are futile Johnblack randdesign chapter 1 paragraph 1 book randdesign a:) comments on the book are futile if the book is left open and sometimes these lines can be multiple and long comments willsmith randdesign chapter 1 paragraph 1 book randdesign a:) no comments on the book are futile "; foreach (string line in s.Split('\n')) { if (line.Trim() != "") { string comments = line.Substring(line.IndexOf("a:) ") + 4); } } b: Perhaps, but this will be pretty speedy for you. c: Try altering your IndexOf() method if you need to. You can tailor it to look for anything, such as 'b:)', and 'c:)', as you mentioned above.
