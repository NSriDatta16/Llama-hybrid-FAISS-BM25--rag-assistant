As soon as your mouse enters the flash rectangle, it can only control the flash content and you lose all control over the html, javascript or not. I imagine this to work like a paddling pool on wheels. Try to push the paddling pool around by moving the water, and all you end up with is wet hands. It may be possible to add a 'handle' to the outside of the flash content, which will then move the flash content around when dragged. alt text http://cnb-host3.clickandbuild.com/cnb/shop/powerranger?imageID=1218&op=imgLib-viewImage
