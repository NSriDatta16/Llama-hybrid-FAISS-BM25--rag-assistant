Multiple OpenCl Kernels

I just wanted to ask, if somebody can give me a heads up on what to pay attention to when using several simple kernels after each other. Can I use the same CommandQueue ? Can I just run several times clCreateProgramWithSource + cl_program with a different cl_program ? What did I forget? Thanks!
