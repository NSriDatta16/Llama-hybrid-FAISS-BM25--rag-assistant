What's the link between optimization and classification?

I am learning about machine learning and one of the things that still not clear in my mind is how classification is done via optimization? In the couple of papers I read I just don't get how authors manage to model their problems, how does minimizing a function lead to clustering or classification, how do they know they are dealing with the right function?
