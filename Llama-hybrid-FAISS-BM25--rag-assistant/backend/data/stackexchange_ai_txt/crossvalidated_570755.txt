Feature engineering is an art, there is no single way how this can be done or the single way that would be universally best. You have many possibilities, for example: Binary variable for the drug being ever prescribed or alternatively if it happened in some time window (last 5 years, last year, last month, etc). Count how many times did it happen in some period of time, as above. Count of days since the last prescription of the drug. You can treat it as a binary time-series where each prescription is a positive signal. There are probably many other possibilities. Some of the solutions may make more or less sense for the problem, this is something worth discussing with domain experts. In the end, this is something to be verified empirically: some of the features might prove to work better for your problem than others and it might not be able to tell this a priori.
