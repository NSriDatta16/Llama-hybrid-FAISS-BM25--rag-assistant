Compile to xslt?

The answer to this may very well be no, as much searching has turned up nothing. I thought long ago I saw something like this, but it may all have been a mirage. Basically, it's so atrociously awful writing xslt out by hand. It's not the functional paradigm that bothers me. What bothers me is the fact that it uses XML based syntax. I wonder if there's anything available that can compile from some simpler more legible syntax into an XSLT stylesheet. Doesn't have to have curly brackets, but the angle brackets are a bit eye boggling. thanks.
