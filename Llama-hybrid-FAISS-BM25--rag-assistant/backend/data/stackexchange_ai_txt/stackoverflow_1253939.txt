At the moment using cookies is your best bet. You can serialize the JavaScript objects to strings, and unserialize them back into objects later. A good choice format is JSON, since it is a subset of JavaScript. There is also storing objects in Flash. Storing in Google Gears.

Then only refresh the child frame. You can then store content in the parent frame. You can see this used in sites like GMail, and others where the only thing that changes in the URL is outside the #.
