Machine learning to predict Equipment Failure

I am in a confused state of Mind to actually decide if My use case does qualify to be resolved by Machine learning algorithms. I have a temperature measuring sensor connected of an equipment. so the sensor mainly captures two attributes , One being temperature itself and other being Time of measurement. My Aim is to send out an alarm signal when the temp remains high after certain time frame , Lets say the temp sores to 70 degree and remain constant or increase even after 1 Minute (Sensor measure data once in every 5 seconds) - So with successive 10 reading shows the Temp not going down and remains As high as 70 degree or sometime going further up - This is a Alarm situation and Must predict that equipment can burn out with such high temperature. So in this case , the previous Dataset is of no use , as the outcome is predefined (Temperature >= 70 degree & stable for 10 readings) . Can this be treated as Machine learning use-case ? I only have live data and no prior data for this use case.
