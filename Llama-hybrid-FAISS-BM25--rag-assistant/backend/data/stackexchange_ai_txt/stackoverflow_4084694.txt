Had the same problem with CPU. It could be caused by non-efficient local implementation of the Azure Queues. In the end I added exponential sleep policy (for implementation - check out in the Lokad.CQRS for Azure project), where queues are polled frequently, but if there are no messages in either one, we gradually start increasing the sleep interval till it reaches some upper boundary. If the message is discovered - we drop the interval immediately. This way on the overall the system does not waste the storage transactions (and local dev CPU), but stays extremely responsive, if multiple messages come in a row.
