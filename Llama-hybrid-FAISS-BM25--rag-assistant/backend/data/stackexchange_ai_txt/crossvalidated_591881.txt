How to interpret the Rasch reliability?

I am tasked to model a set of questionnaires in order to investigate about the food insecurity in the region where my project takes place. Using the Rasch model, I was able to conduct the protocol provided by the FAO organisation and the values respect the ranges of validity. However, I will be charged of communicating my results with my team, and I am a bit confused on how to explain to them in a simple way the Rasch reliabilty. Would appreciate the help. You can check here for more details about the FIES protocol : https://www.fao.org/3/ca9318en/ca9318en.pdf
