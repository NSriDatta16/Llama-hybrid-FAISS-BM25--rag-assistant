When I have decided to leverage a third party control, what I do is create a custom control in my project that acts as a simple container for the third party control. Then, I create my own properties that allow me to define how the setup and customization of the underlying control is done. Why go to all this trouble? Because if I want to switch from 3rd party vendor A to 3rd party vendor B, I only have to change my custom control, and all the references to the vendor A controls are now gone and replaced with vendor B controls. Depending on the complexity of the controls that you are wrapping this may not be a viable solution for you. However, if you're having to find all these old controls and switch them to something else anyway, maybe a little bit of time up front now can save you any future headaches as you find other controls that you like better (or even choose to implement yourself). Good luck!
