@Chris Rackauckas and @EDM's answers are spot on. There are many ways to approach simple linear regression that don't require plotting or visual explanations of ordinary least squares estimation, and they give very solid explanations of what actually happens when you're running OLS. I might add that using scatterplots as an instruction tool to learn any kind of new modeling procedure, whether it's old school parametric model, advanced machine learning stuff, or bayesian algorithms, graphing can help cut down on the time it takes to learn what a particular algorithm does. Graphing is also very important for exploratory data analysis when you are first beginning to work with a new dataset. I have had situations where I collected lots of data, worked out the theory, carefully planned out my model, and then ran it, only to end up with results that essentially had no predictive power. Plotting bivariate relationships can take out some of the guesswork: in your example, it's possible that home price is linearly related to area, but maybe the relationship isn't linear. Scatterplots help you decide if you need higher order terms in your regression, or if you want to use a different method than linear regression, or if you want to use some sort of nonparametric method.
