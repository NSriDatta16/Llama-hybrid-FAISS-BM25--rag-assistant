How to identify possible false negatives in labels?

I am working on a drilling difficulty prediction project using machine learning method. The dataset has lots of geological data as the main features. It also has total drilled depth of each hole. Not surprisingly, the holes that are seeing drilling difficulty had significantly longer drilled depth than the ones that did not have difficulty. However, the geological difficulty should not be dependent on the drilled length: Based on particular type of rock, difficulty is always there no matter if it is drilled or not. If we drilled the holes that didn't have difficulty longer, I am sure lots of them will see difficulty eventually. Having said that, the labels probably have a lot of false negatives (because the difficulty hasn't been encountered yet). How do I identify these false negatives in the labels?
