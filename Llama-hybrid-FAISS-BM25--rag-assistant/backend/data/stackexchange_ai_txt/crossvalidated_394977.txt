As far as I understand this, you could use Queuing theory and specifically the Birth-Death process . If you assume exponential arrival, this could classify as a M/M/1/FCFS queue. You could estimate the arrival rate per hour $\lambda$ as a simple average of the number of people arriving at each hour in the day and assume the service rate $\mu$ $\geq$ $\lambda$ . You are asked to find the average number of people in the queue, $L$ , which is obtained using Little's formula as below. $$L = \lambda \cdot W$$ where $W$ is the average waiting time in queue, which gives, $$L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$ where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the traffic intensity .
