Bayes' theorem relates two ideas: probability and likelihood. Probability says: given this model, these are the outcomes. So: given a fair coin, I'll get heads 50% of the time. Likelihood says: given these outcomes, this is what we can say about the model. So: if you toss a coin 100 times and get 88 heads (to pick up on a previous example and make it more extreme), then the likelihood that the fair coin model is correct is not so high. One of the standard examples used to illustrate Bayes' theorem is the idea of testing for a disease: if you take a test that's 95% accurate for a disease that 1 in 10000 of the population have, and you test positive, what are the chances that you have the disease? The naive answer is 95%, but this ignores the issue that 5% of the tests on 9999 out of 10000 people will give a false positive. So your odds of having the disease are far lower than 95%. My use of the vague phrase "what are the chances" is deliberate. To use the probability/likelihood language: the probability that the test is accurate is 95%, but what you want to know is the likelihood that you have the disease. Slightly off topic: The other classic example which Bayes theorem is used to solve in all the textbooks is the Monty Hall problem: You're on a quiz show. There is a prize behind one of three doors. You choose door one. The host opens door three to reveal no prize. Should you change to door two given the chance? I like the rewording of the question (courtesy of the reference below): you're on a quiz show. There is a prize behind one of a million doors. You choose door one. The host opens all the other doors except door 104632 to reveal no prize. Should you change to door 104632? My favourite book which discusses Bayes' theorem, very much from the Bayesian perspective, is "Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms ", by David J. C. MacKay. It's a Cambridge University Press book, ISBN-13: 9780521642989. My answer is (I hope) a distillation of the kind of discussions made in the book. (Usual rules apply: I have no affiliations with the author, I just like the book).
