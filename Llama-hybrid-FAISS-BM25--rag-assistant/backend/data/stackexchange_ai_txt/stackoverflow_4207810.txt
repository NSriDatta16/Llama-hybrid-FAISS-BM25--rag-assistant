:select with :include or similar activerecord functionality in rails 2.3

Does anyone have an elegant way of doing an activerecord call containing a :select AND an :include statement? I have seen a lot of really old information about getting this working in rails 2.3 and I also know that it is functional in rails 3 but unfortunately not in activerecord core as of 2.3. I am using rails 2.3.4 ruby 1.8.7
