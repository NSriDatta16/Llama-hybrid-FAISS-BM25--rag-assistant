Linear machine learning algorithms "often" have high bias/low variance?

In this blog, which explains the meaning of bias and variance in machine learning, there's a line under the heading "Bias-Variance Trade-Off" which says: Parametric or linear machine learning algorithms often have a high bias but a low variance. I know that there's an "often" in the first sentence, but how can it be true? If a linear ML algorithm has high bias how can we expect it to have low variance?
