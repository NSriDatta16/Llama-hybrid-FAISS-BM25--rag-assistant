2SLS with endogenous variable $X_1$ and interaction terms $X_1 \times X_2$, $X_2$ exogenous

I would like clarification on the correct way to set up the first-stage regression(s) for a hypothetical 2SLS regression. Say we have the following formula: \begin{align} y = x_1 + x_2 + x_1 \times x_2 + \text{controls} + \epsilon \end{align} Where $x_1$ is numeric and assumed endogenous, $x_2$ is categorical and assumed exogenous. Assume, also, that a variable $z$ is a valid instrument for $x_1$ . Now, my first intuition was to use a single first-stage regression to find $\hat{x_1}$ like so: \begin{align} \text{First-Stage:} && \hat{x_1} = z + x_2 + z \times x_2 + \text{controls} + \epsilon \end{align} And then simply replace both the stand-alone $x_1$ and the instance of $x_1$ in $x_1 \times x_2$ in the second-stage regression like so: \begin{align} \text{Second-Stage:} && y = \hat{x_1} + x_2 + \hat{x_1} \times x_2 + \text{controls} + \epsilon \end{align} However, it came to my attention that it might actually be necessary to run a separate first-stage regression for $x_1 \times x_2$ , and find fitted values for that, instead of simply using $\hat{x_2}$ hat from the previous first-stage regression. That is, we would need another first-stage regression, which I will call the 1.5 stage regression: \begin{align} \text{1.5-Stage:} && \widehat{x_1 \times x_2} = z + x_2 + z \times x_2 + \text{controls} + \epsilon \end{align} And our final second-stage regression would then be: \begin{align} y = \hat{x_1} + x_2 + \widehat{x_1 \times x_2} + \text{controls} + \epsilon \end{align} Which uses $\hat{x_1}$ from the first-stage equation, and $\widehat{x_1 \times x_2}$ from the 1.5-stage equation. I honestly thought the two methods would boil down to identical results, but I seem to get different results when doing some tests in $\texttt{R}$ . The first method seems the most correct to me, however, I understand that in the scenario where you have two separate endogenous variables (and two instruments), you do indeed create two separate first-stage regressions, and get fitted values for each, like in method two. However, I was unsure if that holds up when, in this case, the second endgenous variable is an interaction term, and the endogenous half is already being instrumented. I feel like I'm overlooking something obvoius, and overthinking this, but the fact that I get different results for the two methods is what confuses me. If I am making a mistake, please let me know. Thanks!
