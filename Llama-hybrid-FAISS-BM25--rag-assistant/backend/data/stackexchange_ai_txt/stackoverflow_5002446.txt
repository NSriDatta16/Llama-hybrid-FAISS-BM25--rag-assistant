Instead of FTP, use Rsync. It has lower overhead than FTP and is well suited to synchronising a large filebase. Rsync documentation Akamai Netstorage supports Rsync as an upload method. It may need to be enabled in the Akamai control panel - whoever administers your Netstorage user accounts can enable it. Rsync is included in all Linux distributions, if you are on Windows you can get it as part of cygwin .
