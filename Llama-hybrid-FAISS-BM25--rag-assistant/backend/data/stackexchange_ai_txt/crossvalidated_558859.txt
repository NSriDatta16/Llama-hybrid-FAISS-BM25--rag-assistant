Is the t-test to test the difference from 0?

I have a variable x with a mean 1 and sd of 3. So most of the mass is above zero. Let's say I have n=100 observations. A t-test will tell me whether the mean of x E(x) is different from 0 or above 0. It will give me a confidence interval, say in [.8, 1.2] in which I can find the mean. The higher n is, the more confident I become in this. But what I really want to know is whether (the distribution of) x is mostly above 0. In my case, about 60% of x is positive. What would be a good test, Bayesian or frequentist, to measure this?
