It depends entirely on the purpose of generating this string. If you're generating strings in order to test the performance of a search algorithm then you may want to generate "English-like" text containing a distribution of words similar to a typical document. One way to achieve this would be to build a Markov Chain , whereby for each state you generate a given word; e.g. "The" and then transition to a new state with a certain probability; e.g. "The" -> "first". You could auto-generate the Markov chain using a large body of sample text, such as the Brown Corpus . Or even simpler, you could test your algorithm using a particular corpus (such as the Brown Corpus) rather than having to generate any samples yourself.
