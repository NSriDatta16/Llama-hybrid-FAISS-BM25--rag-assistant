eclipse 3.4 (ganymede) package collision with type

We have a package that ends with exception e.g. package a.b.c.exception; Our code base had no issues up till eclipse 3.3, however when we shifted to eclipse 3.4, it started giving errors related to this package: "The package a.b.c.exception collides with a type" When I refactor the package name to a.b.c.exceptions, there are no issues. Is this due to a bug in eclipse 3.4 or is there some setting to rectify this behavior?
