Pretty sure you need to do this when embedding anything more complex than scalars inside double quotes echo " {$row['CustomerID']} {$row['address']} {$row['city']} "; So whenever you have a more complex var name than "test $var" in quotes, wrap with {} - and even then, it's good practice to wrap scalars too like "test {$var}"
