How to derive p value of whether there exists a difference (given before and after correlation, averages, and standard deviations)?

I am trying to solve the following question: A chemical refining process is monitored before and after the plant is shut down and cleaned. At 40 randomly selected outputs, before cleaning, contaminants are measured at an average of 210ppm (SD52); afterwards, at the same outputs, contaminant sare measured at an average of 196ppm (SD 56).The correlation between contaminants before and after cleaning is 0.15. What best describes the p-value for a hypothesis test, checking whether there was a difference in contaminant levels associated with the cleaning? A. 0.2 This is what I have tried so far: The null hypothesis is: There is not a difference in contaminant levels associated with the cleaning. Z-score: This is the part I am totally confused about. I know the z-score formula is: $z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt(n)}}$ However, what exactly do I put for $\bar{X}$ , $\mu$ , $\sigma$ , and $\sqrt{n}$ given two different values (before and after) in the question? I am also confused as to what the correlation has to do with determining the p-value too.
