Other answers have been giving good and clear examples. I'd like to try a different wording for this. Consider you are going to sample a city's population to know its average income. Some of things that will "stratify" your population: Income level (high, medium, low) Type of job (skilled labor, unskilled labor, etc.) Education level (none, highschool, bachelor, master, autodidact, skill from experience, etc.) Those things will "stratify" your population because you know that you'll find people with different income level or type of job or education level will have different amount of income; while people within the same income level or type of job or education level will more-or-less have the same. In contrast, some of things that will not "stratify" your population but rather a "cluster": Neighborhood or city block If you can assume that any neighborhood in the city are not really different from one another, you can consider neighborhood as a "cluster" rather than a "strata", since you don't believe different neighborhoods will have really different income. In sampling methodology, strata are designed to make sure you include all different parts of population in your sample, i.e. you have all strata represented. In contrast, clusters are designed so that rather than picking samples from the ENTIRE population at random (which in real-life situations is expensive and more difficult), you can just pick a cluster at random and say "this cluster represents the population at a smaller scale". To demonstrate why cluster sampling is easier and cheaper than sampling entirely at random, consider you're sampling a city population. Sampling directly from the city residents list will result in you having to deal with some of sampled people that are really far away. This will make the sampling harder and more expensive. If you do a cluster sampling, that is you randomly choose neighborhoods/blocks, THEN sample from the residents list of these neighborhoods, the resulting people sampled will be more easier to access because they're closer together. If all the neighborhoods of the city is not that different one another, you can safely say that the cluster you chose will still represent the entire city.
