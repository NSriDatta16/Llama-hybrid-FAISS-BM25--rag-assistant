In my final solution for my problem I closely followed the strategies detailed in [1]. As described in my question, my targets were two-fold: Calculate a confidence-interval Estimate the necessary sample size to determine a confidence interval of given width. Among the strategies outlined in [1], the simplest one is based on the central limit theorem which states that for samples $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ from an arbitrary distribution with mean $\Psi$ and variance $\Theta^2$ it holds that $$ \frac{\overline{x} - \Psi}{\Theta/\sqrt{n}} \overset{n\to\infty}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N}(0, 1), $$ where $\overline{x} := 1/n\sum_{i=0}^n x_i$ . If $n$ is large enough, a confidence-interval for the mean of any distribution can thus be created by $$ \left(\overline{x} - z\frac{\sigma(x)}{\sqrt{n}}, \; \overline{x} + z\frac{\sigma(x)}{\sqrt{n}}\right) $$ since sample mean and standard deviation $\overline{x}$ and $\sigma(x)$ are unbiased estimators of $\Psi$ and $\Theta$ respectively. Since this expression additionally easily allows to estimate the sample size $n$ for a prescribed confidence-interval width, this method was theoretically perfectly suitable for my purposes. However, the question left was: Is $n$ large in my application? To check this, I wrote a small script to estimate the coverage of the so-determined confidence interval for various parameter combinations $(\Psi,\Theta,n)$ in the vicinity of the expected parameters of my application. Turns out, coverage for the 95% confidence interval is between 93% and 97%, which is completely sufficient for what I wanted to achieve. [1] Pek, Jolynn & Wong, Augustine & Wong, Octavia. (2017).
