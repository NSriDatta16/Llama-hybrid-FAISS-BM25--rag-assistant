As Greg said, there's a lot of work ahead. However, there are many ways in which to approach the problem, and the best for you depends on what contextual information passes down from the client to the application/database layers already. For example, if a session token or transaction identifier is passed from the client to the application in the normal course of executing a query/transaction or an acknowledgement reference passed back asynchronously from the application to the client, then for those queries/transactions for which progress reporting was necessary you could have the application update a status table that the client could query. This could reduce the amount of re-work required. Basically, you need to consider the "middleware" in place already and see if any of that can be leveraged to correlate transactions across tiers.
