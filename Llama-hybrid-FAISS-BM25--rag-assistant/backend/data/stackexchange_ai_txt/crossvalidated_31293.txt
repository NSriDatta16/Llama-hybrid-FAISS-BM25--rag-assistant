Using his notation, for the loss defined by $$ L_{k_1,k_2}(\theta,d) = \begin{cases} k_2(\theta-d) & \textrm{if $\theta>d$,} \\ k_1(d-\theta) & \textrm{otherwise,} \end{cases} $$ Robert uses this identity to get $$ E^\pi[L_{k_1,k_2}(\theta,d)\mid x] = k_1\int\limits_{-\infty}^{d} P^\pi(\theta y\mid x)\,dy\, .$$ You want the decision $d$ which minimizes this expectation, so you take the derivative with respect to $d$ and make it equal to zero, which gives $$ \frac{\partial E^\pi[L_{k_1,k_2}(\theta,d)\mid x]}{\partial d} = k_1 P^\pi(\theta d\mid x) = 0 \, ,$$ where we've used the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , and this is equivalent to $$ P^\pi(\theta
