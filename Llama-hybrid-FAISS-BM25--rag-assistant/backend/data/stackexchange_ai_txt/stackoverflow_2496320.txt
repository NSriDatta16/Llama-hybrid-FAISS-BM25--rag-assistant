The key to this sort of problem is devising good metrics. Once you have a vector of input values, you can use one of a number of machine learning algorithms to classify it as authorised or declined. So the first step should be to determine which metrics (of those you mention) will be the most useful and pick a small number of them (5-10). You can probably benefit by collapsing some by means of averaging (for example, the average length of any key press, rather than a separate value for every key). Then you will need to pick an algorithm. A good one for classifying vectors of real number is Support vector machines - at this point you should read up on it, particularly on what the "kernel" function is so you can choose one to use. Then you will need to gather a set of learning examples (vectors with a known result), train the algorithm with them, and test the trained svm on a fresh set of examples to see how it performs. If the performance is poor with a simple kernel (e.g. linear), you may choose to use a higher dimensional one. Good luck!
