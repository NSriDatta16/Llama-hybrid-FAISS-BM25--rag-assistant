Time series plots interpretation: big spike, business cycle

I am reading an online time series book and get confused with two pictures. According to the author, picture (b) "Daily change in the Google stock price for 200 consecutive days" and g) "Annual total of lynx trapped in the McKenzie River district of north-west Canada" are stationary plots. However, in picture b, there is a big spike, (not constant variance?) and in picture g, it looks like a business cycle (every 40 years) existed. I am not sure if you could call it seasonality. According to Wikipedia , a seasonality is the presence of variations that occur at specific regular intervals less than a year, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. As a starter, I would like to get help on how to interpret this kinds of pictures when there are spikes and business cycles in the pictures.
