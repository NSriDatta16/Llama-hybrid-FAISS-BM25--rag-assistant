In complement to Taylor's fine answer, let me signal that a Markov chain that is not strongly irreducible, that is, a chain that can only move to a limited number or range of values as in the "3 is followed by 2 or 4" example in the comments, can be turned into one by random (e.g., Poisson) subsampling: Given a transition kernel or matrix K, at iteration $t$, generate $X_{t+1}$ as$$Y \sim K^\kappa(X_{t},\cdot),\qquad\kappa\sim\mathcal{P}(\lambda),\quad\lambda>0$$ as this makes the Markov chain strongly irreducible, i.e., able to go from anywhere to anywhere.(The associated Markov kernel is called the skeleton in Meyn and Tweedie (1993).)
