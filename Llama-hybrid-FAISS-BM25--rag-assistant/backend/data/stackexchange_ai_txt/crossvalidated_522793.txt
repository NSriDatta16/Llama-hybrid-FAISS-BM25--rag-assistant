ARMA Models with Trend Question

I am looking to build an ARMA model for a time series with a significant trend component. Let's assume for the purposes of this question that I don't want to build an ARIMA model. (The reason has to do with how I am looking to incorporate exogenous features into the model.) I can make the series stationary with first differencing. I build an ARMA model with the first differenced result. I use the at level data going into the model and Hyndman's equations to convert the resulting first differenced forecast into an at-level result. Do I need to be concerned that this approach will ignore the trend I observed in my initial data?
