Reshaping time series data from wide to tall format (for plotting)

I have a data frame containing multiple time series of returns, stored in columns. The first column contains dates, and subsequent columns are independent time series each with a name. The column headers are the variable names. ## I have a data frame like this t I want to plot each time series as a line on a separate plot, in a lattice, with each plot labeled by the variable names. To plot this with lattice, the data must be in a tall format, as such: t symbol price 1 2009-01-01 X -1.8763317 2 2009-01-02 Y -0.1885183 2 2009-01-02 Z -6.655663 What is a good function call to do this?
