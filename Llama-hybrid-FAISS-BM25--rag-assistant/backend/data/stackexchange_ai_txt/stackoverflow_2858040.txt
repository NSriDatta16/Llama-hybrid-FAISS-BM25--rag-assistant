Django Inlines user permissions + view only - permissions issues

I'm not sure if this is a bug or I'm just missing something (although I have already parsed the documentation about inlines), but: Let's say I have a model A. Model A is an inline of model B. User U has full access to model B, but only change permissions to model A (so, no add, nor delete). However, when editing model B, user U can still see the "Add another A" link at the bottom, although U hasn't add permissions for that respective model. What's wrong? Why does that link keep on showing? My logic says that if U does not have permissions to add A, the link shouldn't appear anymore. Also, ideally, I would like to give U only view rights to model A (so no add, delete or change - only view), but I've read about that (strange, if you ask me) philosophy according to which "If you don't trust U, just deny him access to the admin area all together". Kind of a stupid doctrine. Right now, I'm trying to simulate this 'view only permissions' by leaving U with just change rights and set all fields as read only. But I think this is kind of a stupid approach and may also cause problems like the permissions thing above... How does an average Django programmer like me achieve view-only permissions, and most of all how should I get rid of the "Add another A" link at the bottom of the admin edit form? Thanks in advance!
