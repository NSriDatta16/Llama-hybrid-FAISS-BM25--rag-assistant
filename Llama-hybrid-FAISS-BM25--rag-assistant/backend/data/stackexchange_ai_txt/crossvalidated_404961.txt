The most popular example is the decoder part of the seq2seq recurrent neural network (RNN). Such networks are one of the most basic examples of networks that can be used for machine translation. They consist of two sub-networks: encoder RNN network that takes as input sentence in one language and encodes using some vector representation for the whole sentence, and decoder network that uses the vector representation of a sentence to produce a sentence in target language. You can find many examples and tutorials on such networks online, e.g. here (above image was taken from this blog), here , here , or here . Moreover, Keras code example can be found on StackOverflow .
