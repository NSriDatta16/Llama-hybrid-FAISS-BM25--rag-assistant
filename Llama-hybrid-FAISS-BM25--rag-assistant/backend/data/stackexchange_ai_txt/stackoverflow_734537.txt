For those logicians out there, !string.IsNullOrEmpty is not equivalent to string.IsNotNullOrEmpty. @Guffa has it correct. Using DeMorgan's law, it would have to be string.IsNotNullAndNotEmpty to be equivalent. ¬(null ∨ empty) ⇔ ¬null ∧ ¬empty ¬(null ∨ empty) ≠ ¬null ∨ empty The point here, I guess, is that the way it is currently is unambiguous, where as making the opposite unambiguous would be cumbersome.
