There are PCA-like procedures for the so-called "oblique" case. In stat-software like SPSS (and possibly also in its freeware clone) PSPP one finds the equivalently called "oblique rotations", and instances of them named as "oblimin","promax" and something more. If I understand things correctly the software tries to "rectangularize" the factor-loadings by re-calculating their coordinates in an orthogonal, euclidean space (as for instance shown in your picture) into coordinates of a space whose axes are non-orthogonal perhaps with some technique known from multiple regression. Moreover I think this works only iteratively and consumes one or more degrees of freedom in the statistical testing of the model. See wikipedia for rotation-methods in factor analysis An article with an example of comparision PCA and oblique rotation The reference-manual of SPSS (at the IBM-site) for oblique-rotations contains even formulae for the computation. [Update] (Upps, sorry, just checked that PSPP does not provide "rotations" of the oblique type)
