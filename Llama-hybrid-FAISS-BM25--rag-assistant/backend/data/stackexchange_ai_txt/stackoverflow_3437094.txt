You can write your own DNN Authentication module that leverages your current system and code. Our shop uses DNN, but hands off authentication to our university's centralized authentication system. I didn't write it, but I don't get the impression that it was too hard. Now when we create a portal, we install and enable our authentication module and then turn off DNN Authentication. Works like a charm.
