$().mouseMove <-- Empty selector in jQuery 1.4

The following bit of code breaks in the upgrade to jquery 1.4: $().mousemove( function (e) { defaults.mouseX = e.pageX; defaults.mouseY = e.pageY; }); }; What appeared to be a reasonable fix was adding "html" as the selector, ex: $("html"). The fix works fine - except now when the user mouses off the page, it doesn't register the mouse position beyond the boundaries. When attempting to use the mouse position for a drag, for example, the amount of movement beyond the screen is really important. Anyone got any ideas? Thanks in advance.
