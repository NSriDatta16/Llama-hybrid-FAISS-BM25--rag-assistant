Measuring coherence score for Top2Vec models

I am working on creating a number of Top2Vec models on Reddit threads. I am basically changing the HDBScan cluster sizes to get different clusters of the Doc2Vec embeddings representing a different # of topics. I am trying to compare different models using their coherence score. I have tried using Gensim's coherence score but failed. I got an error message indicating that a word in the topics is not included in the dictionary. I also tried using tmtooklit . While I could get the Document Term Matrix (DTM) easily, I have not been able to get the topic-word distribution using Top2Vec. Questions: Can I resolve either of the issues indicated above (get the dictionary to list all of the terms necessary or producing the topic-word distribution)? Are there other metrics that can be used to be compare Top2Vec models?
