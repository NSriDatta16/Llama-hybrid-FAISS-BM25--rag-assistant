Drupal 6: Using Organic groups for Educational page

I am working on a departmental website within a big university and want to add different types of functionality for different users depending on their roles. There are 3 main types of users: Publicly listed Alumni (listed but based on different fields and using a custom template file) Others (users on site but not listed) Right now we are using Content Profiles for the publicly listed users and list the content in the core profile tables for the alumni. The problem is : If I'm faculty I still see all the fields for alumni (although it is in its own tab) and if I am alumni I see all the fields for faculty. Question : What I would like to do is provide them different views of editing "My Account" based on their roles. So I wonder, would it be possible to do this with organic groups or is this something that needs custom PHP coding? Thanks for the help
