Using jQuery Validation and Field Hinting at the Same TIme

I am trying to use the jQuery Validation plugin (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/) in conjunction with field hinting. The problem is that the field hinting puts text in the value attribute, and since there's text in the value attribute, the Validation plugin doesn't see that anything is wrong. My thought was to have the validation throw an error if the field is empty OR if the field contains the same text as the field hint (ie: if someone were to enter "First Name" in the first name field, then an error would result. Is there an elegant way to use validation in conjunction with code hinting? Thanks! Doron
