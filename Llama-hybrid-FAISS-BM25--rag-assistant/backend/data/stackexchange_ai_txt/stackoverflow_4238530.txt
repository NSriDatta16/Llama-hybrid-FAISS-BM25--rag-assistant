Android MapView draggable marker

I would like to create a draggable marker in Android MapView (com.google.android.maps.MapView), exactly like this: http://koti.mbnet.fi/ojalesa/exam/draggable.html . I've already got an overlay pointing to the location I want, but I'd like the marker icon to be draggable like in the above example. Is there something ready to use for this or is it necessary to implement the dragging logic myself?
