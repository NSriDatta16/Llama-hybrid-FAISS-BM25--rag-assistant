Yes, it is coordinate descent, here's the code for the solver for L1 regularized logistic regression: https://github.com/cjlin1/liblinear/blob/6cd15778c0f271566a333c88cb86ba7c70ba14a1/linear.cpp#L1648 There's also a solver for the dual form of the problem, again using coordinate descent: https://github.com/cjlin1/liblinear/blob/6cd15778c0f271566a333c88cb86ba7c70ba14a1/linear.cpp#L1206
