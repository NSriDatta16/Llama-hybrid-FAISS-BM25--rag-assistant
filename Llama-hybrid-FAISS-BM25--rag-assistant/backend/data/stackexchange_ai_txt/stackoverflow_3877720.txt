Jeet, you don't have to build a sitemap for blogspot as one is automatically built for you. Take, for example, my test blogspot blog's robots.txt file - http://brettmorgan-test-blawg.blogspot.com/robots.txt - you will see that a sitemap is already listed that lists all posts ordered by update date.
