Well guys, looks like after 2 days and 4h later I got the solution :) I was looking to this in a complete wrong way. When using Drag and Drop with List based components, the 'format' is always 'itemsByIndex' and I was trying to be accepted with 'artist' 'format'. Problem: You have more than one List accepting data with a drag-and-drop method. Different lists has to accept different types of data. Solution: Wrap the in and manually call the dragEnter event and with it you call a function that can accept or reject the dragged data by checking it's 'format' . Accepting the drag source, the dragDrop event is dispatched and with that you can call a function to do whatever you want in your app ... for example, add the dragged data to the list. NOTE: Remember if tou set the dragEnter and dragDrop directly on the component, you will ne be able to check the dragged data 'format' given all list controls uses the 'format' 'itemsByIndex' Demo: Hope this helps other people with the same problem! :)
