(Cross) Correlation of time series with very different sampling intervals (sec. vs days)

This is my first post on Cross-Validated. I read a lot of question related to my problem, but no one was completely satisfying. I have two time series that are sampled at very different time intervals, e.g. one is sampled every 10 seconds, while another every day. I'd like to evaluate the correlation between the two series (perhaps something like cross-correlation). Is it right to align the one series to the other (maybe averaging the value of the one with the finest sampling rate)? Is there any common practise in treating this problem? Is there any Spark-based library that can be used to easily deal with such problems (with Java support, as sparkts )?
