SharePoint permissions for a specific group

I'm trying to establish whether a specific group has Read access to a particular site collection. I have been trying for a day and a half but feel as if I have found three halves of different solutions! The code fragments I have so far are: using (SPSite site = new SPSite(this.GenerateAbsoluteUri(moduleCode, academicYear))) { using (SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb()) { for (int i = web.SiteGroups.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--) { SPGroup group = web.SiteGroups[i]; if (Regex.IsMatch(group.Name, theGroupImLookingFor)) { but then what?! Most of my Google results tell me about roles but I don't know how to tie a role to a group. Please help!
