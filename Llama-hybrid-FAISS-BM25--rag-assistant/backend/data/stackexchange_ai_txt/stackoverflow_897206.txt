Python cgi FieldStorage slow, alternatives?

I have a python cgi script that receives files uploaded via a http post. The files can be large (300+ Mb). The thing is, cgi.FieldStorage() is incredibly slow for getting the file (a 300Mb file took 6 minutes to be "received"). Doing the same by just reading the stdin took around 15 seconds. The problem with the latter is, i would have to parse the data myself if there are multiple fields that are posted. Are there any faster alternatives to FieldStorage()?
