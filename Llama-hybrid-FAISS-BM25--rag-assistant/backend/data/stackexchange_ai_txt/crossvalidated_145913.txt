How can Markov cluster algorithms be used to cluster strings?

I have just start learning about Machine Learning and while surfing on the web, I saw that another CV user in those post has offered Markov cluster algorithms to cluster long strings. As far as I know, MCL is cluster algorithm for graphs, how could it be used to cluster strings? Should it be modified for this purpose, or naturally it can also takes strings as input?
