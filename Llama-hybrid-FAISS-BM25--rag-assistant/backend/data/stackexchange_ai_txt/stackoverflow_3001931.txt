I have the exact same problem, but neither placing the image file in res/drawable (which I first had to create, I hust had drawable-hdpi, -ldpi and -mdpi already existing) or using the file:///asset/ URL worked for me. Here is what I do: Activity: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); mWebView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview); mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true); String summary = " "; mWebView.loadData(summary, "text/html", "utf-8"); Then in res/drawable I placed the banner300.jpg - but it does not show up. Any ideas?
