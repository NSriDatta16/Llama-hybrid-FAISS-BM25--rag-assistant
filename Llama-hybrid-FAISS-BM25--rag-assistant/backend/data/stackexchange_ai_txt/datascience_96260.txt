The author uses binom.test - The binomial test is used when an experiment has two possible outcomes and you have an idea about what the probability of success is and similar to other statistical test, you measure if the success in observed set is significantly different from what was expected. From now it is getting more complicated : the author is trying to calculate To obtain a confidence interval for **the overall accuracy** . Therefore, the test is not the accuracy per group (each seven oil type) but rather the whole model: whether it predicts correctly or not. So you are dealing with a binary output: success vs fail and you calculate the confidence interval of that. So I assume if you play with the data and make various model with different data size (more/less than 76 data points), you will see using more data leads to a narrower confidence interval. How confidence interval is important when it comes to predictive analysis, is another question which I encourage you to ask and follow the sister community https://stats.stackexchange.com/
