Significance of Low Variance Components of PCA for Lower-Dimensional Clustering

I'm trying to apply PCA to reduce my fairly high dimensional dataset (~140 dimensions) down to 2-3 dimensions, for the explicit purposes of building an unsupervised clustering model that can be visualised. After applying normalization (Z score) and centering, I find that the 'explained' output of the first principal components is quite low. The first PC accounts for 40% of the variance, second 9% etc. etc., and even 10 PCs still only accounts for 75% of the total variance. I'm aware that not having high variance in the first few PCs isn't necessarily a bad thing, and that I can try to look at other methods of lower dimensional embedding, but I just wanted to know if this means it would not be a 'good' idea to try and build a clustering model from the first 2-3 PCs based on these results for PCA.
