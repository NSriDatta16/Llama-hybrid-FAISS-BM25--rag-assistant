Yes. You are talking about a reverse proxy (or "http accelerator" which is an imprecise term for the same thing). It can be very efficient, and very many high throughput sites use the technique. The key element to get right is the caching-related HTTP headers. So I strongly recommend reading the HTTP RFC (it can actually be done). If you don't get headers right, you can have little effect, or maybe even security problems (if personalized pages are cached and presented to the wrong people). Also: You may have to split up your page into parts, to gain best caching effect. Example: If you insist of having a clock in a corner of your pages showing current server time down to the second, then the whole page becomes cacheable for only a second. So 1) drop the stupid clock, or 2) have it be generated by a client-side script - or 3) have the client side script pull that particular part of the page from a special URL which then only outputs a small ever-changing, non-cacheable HTML fragment. I've once used Squid as a reverse proxy for a large web site. Nowadays, if I were to do it again, I'd try out Varnish .
