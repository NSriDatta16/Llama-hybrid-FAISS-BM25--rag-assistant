Note there is a service you can explicitly ask for, to get file access to the computer (unless you go all the way and ask for full access (which requires signed jar files)). Then you need to determine where these files need to go - basically you have no idea what is where and whether you may actually write anywhere. You can create tmp-files but those go away. Would a file system abstraction talking to the JNLP-server do so you store the users data on the server?
