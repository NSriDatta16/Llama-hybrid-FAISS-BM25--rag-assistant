Definiately take a look at OpenCV because when you begin to need more room to move then OpenCV will let you do many more computer vision tasks. And use boost::filesystem to do the 'for each image in dir' code. Note that the cv::compare function basically does half the work for you already...I'll let you read that and enjoy leveraging the OpenCV API.
