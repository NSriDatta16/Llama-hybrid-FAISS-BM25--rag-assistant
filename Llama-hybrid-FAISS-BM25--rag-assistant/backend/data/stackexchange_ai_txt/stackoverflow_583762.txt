I'm also interested in this topic. Tried do dive into Ruby and Rails a while ago, and it really helped me to grasp the ASP.Net MVC stuff, which i think is a bit too chalenging at first for average .net developer. If you're interested more on moving in this direction, or curious about how some developers moved from static to dynamic languages as their full time jobs, i highly recommend this Alt.Net podcast .
