Well, if you have indication (you say Box-Tidwell indicated non-linearity), you must be careful with interpretations. The best solution is probably to model in such a way that the model assumptions is pretty probable to hold, upfront. With continuous predictors in logistic regression, linearity is a pretty strong assumption. My preferred choice would be to model your seven continuous predictors using regression splines. In R that would look like: library(splines) mod ) See also Choosing between transformations in logistic regression .
