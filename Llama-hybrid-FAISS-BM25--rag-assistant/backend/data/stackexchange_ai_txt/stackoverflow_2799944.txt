How long is too long for a script to execute?

What is the max time do you think is acceptable for a web script (PHP for example) to execute before it starts to become an annoyance for the user (on average)? I always thought that if the user has to wait more than 1 second for the page to load (this of course after images and css have been cached..this rule really only applies for subsequent requests) they would start to get annoyed.
