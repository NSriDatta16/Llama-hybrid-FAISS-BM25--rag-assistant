What is F1 Score for this diagram?

I have this Venn chart that represent a dataset prediction of Identifying if our products are classified as "A41" standard or not The Blue Circle represents a Machine Learning Model prediction results The Yellow Circle represents the actual A41 standard classification The Green Circle represents another method we tried called Mapping. You can see that the number of products that are not classified as A41 by either method or actually is 2011 and it is outside of all Venn shapes Now I wanna know what is the F1 score for our model. How is that?
