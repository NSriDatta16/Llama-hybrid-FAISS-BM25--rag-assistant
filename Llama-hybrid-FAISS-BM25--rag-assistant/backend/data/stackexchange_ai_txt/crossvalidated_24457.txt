The scikit-learn has an HMM implementation . It was until recently considered as unmaintained and its usage was discouraged. However it has improved in the development version. I cannot vouch for its quality, though, as I know nothing of HMMs. Disclaimer: I am a scikit-learn developer. Edit : we have moved the HMMs outside of scikit-learn, to https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn
