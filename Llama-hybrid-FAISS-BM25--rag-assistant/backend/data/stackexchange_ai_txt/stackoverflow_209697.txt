Your output does constitute a well-formed XML fragment. In other words, it looks okay and so does your XSLT. It seems the error message tries to tell you the following: Applying this XSLT produces a document that is invalid according to the DTD or Schema, or whatever I am using to validate the output, and my conformanceLevel tells me complain about invalid output. If you do not care about validity, set my conformanceLevel to something less anal. Note the important difference between "well formed" (a conformant non-validating xml parser can read it) and "valid" (the structure does not follow the grammar specified in a schema). Also note that it is impossible in XSLT to produce output that is not well-formed XML.
