I'm assuming that you're using linq-to-sql. I would recommend using a stored procedure to do that job. When creating your DataContext, just drag your stored procedure to the methods window. If you, for some reason, cannot use a stored procedure, linq-to-sql has an ExecuteQuery method which you can use if you want to do a 'direct update' and don't want to fetch all records and then update them.
