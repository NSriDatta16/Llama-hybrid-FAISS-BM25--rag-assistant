Data augmentation

In many papers on CNN,I have read that data augmentation is carried out on a per epoch basis. My thoughts regarding this were that data augmentation is carried out prior to starting the training procedure on the train set. What I mean is that split the data into train and test, and then augment the train data. Is carrying out augmentation on a per epoch basis the recommended method, and are there any flaws/drawbacks regarding my understanding of the augmentation procedure?
