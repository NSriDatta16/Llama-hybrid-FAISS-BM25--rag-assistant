I think you are looking for an expression evaluator in C#. Google found a few that I think you should look at: The Fast Lightweight Expression Evaluator on Codeplex. ILCalc on CodePlex - "This project was inspired by the FLEE project, but written in different, much easier way." NCalc is another one on CodePlex - evaluates custom functions and works with Unicode, which might be important for you. There is a related CodeProject article . There's this C# Expression Evaluator article by Jonathan Wood. There's one in the Spring.net Framework . A CodeProject article by Pascal Ganaye. Or you can work on your own starting with the DynCalc example by Bart de Smet. You might also need implementations of all those built-in Excel functions. There's a library with all the financial functions re-implemented in F# by Luca Bolognese - find it on MSDN .
