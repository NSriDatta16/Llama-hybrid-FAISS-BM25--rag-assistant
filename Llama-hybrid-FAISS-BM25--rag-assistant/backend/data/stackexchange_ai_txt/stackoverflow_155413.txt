I found this code a while back, maybe it will help you determine the smallest you can push it up by then just increment it by that value. Unfortunately i can't remember the reference for this code: #include int main() { /* two numbers to work with */ double number1, number2; // result of calculation double result; int counter; // loop counter and accuracy check number1 = 1.0; number2 = 1.0; counter = 0; while (number1 + number2 != number1) { ++counter; number2 = number2 / 10; } printf("%2d digits accuracy in calculations\n", counter); number2 = 1.0; counter = 0; while (1) { result = number1 + number2; if (result == number1) break; ++counter; number2 = number2 / 10.0; } printf("%2d digits accuracy in storage\n", counter ); return (0); }
