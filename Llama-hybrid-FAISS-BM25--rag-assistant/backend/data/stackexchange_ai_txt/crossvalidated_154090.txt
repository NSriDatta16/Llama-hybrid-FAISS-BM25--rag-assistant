Typically the uncertainties from counting measurements are made using Poisson statistics. The standard deviation of such a distribution is just the square root of the counts. I am not sure why your uncertainties are slightly off from this. Why do you need to interpolate the data at all? I am not too familiar with Reitveld refinement, but why don't you just merge the datasets? You gain no statistical power by adding together two data points. For example, even if you had two independent measurements at the same x value, there is nothing gained by averaging the counts other than making prettier plots of the diffraction data. Finally, are the x positions actually different? I assume you ran the same scan twice. The slight differences in the x values in the data are either from the instrument having higher accuracy in measuring position than in its motors or it is just a result in always writing out the data to a precision higher than merited. Either way, treating the x-values as the same introduces very little affect on your uncertainties. If you treat the range of x-values as the uncertainty in the x-position and estimate this contribution to uncertainty in y by looking at the local slope, you'll see that it is ~3 orders of magnitude lower than the counting uncertainty. Were I do this, I would merge the data and just have twice the data points. If for some reason you cannot do this, I would just take the average x-value as doing so introduces negligible error.
