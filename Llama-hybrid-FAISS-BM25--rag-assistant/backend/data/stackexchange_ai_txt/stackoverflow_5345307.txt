Tool to discard packet payload?

I'm trying to anonymize packets from a pcap file that I have. I need to discard all the packets payloads/content (leaving only header information) and was wondering if there would be a tool that I could use for this (on Linux)? I have thought about using tcpdump with specifying the snaplen but with the header length changing, I don't think that would work. If there isn't a tool that could accomplish this, a point in the direction of what library for coding would be best(easiest) would work as well. I'd rather not take that route since I have virtually no experience in network programming. Any help is much appreciated.
