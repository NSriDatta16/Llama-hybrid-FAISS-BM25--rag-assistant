It looks like WebSQL is on it's way out, to be replaced by IndexedDB support. Firefox and Internet Explorer have no plans to support WebSQL, they want to implement IndexedDB for Firefox 4 and IE9. Chrome is busy implementing it to, I'm sure Opera and Safari will follow suit. Currently all HTML5 capable browsers (and some IE versions) support LocalStorage which is a simple key/value database that can only store strings, so if you need more structured storage capabilities, you'll have to wait until the end of this year (approx) for broad IndexedDB support.
