Predicting the winner of a contest

This is just a general question, but I ran into a few situations lately with this same framework and I'm not sure what to do with it. Suppose we have 100 contests worth of data each with 8 individuals in it. There is just 1 individual in each of the 100 contests that can win. Suppose, I have a number of variables for each individual. What statistical tool can I use to predict the likelihood that a particular individual would win the contest? I first thought this would be a simple logistic regression, but the fact that each row in the data set is not independent (if individual C wins, then the other 7 cannot win) seems to suggest that may not be the best tool to use here. It effectively would be P(A wins | A has these variables and is playing against B, C, D, E, and F each with these variables). Any ideas?
