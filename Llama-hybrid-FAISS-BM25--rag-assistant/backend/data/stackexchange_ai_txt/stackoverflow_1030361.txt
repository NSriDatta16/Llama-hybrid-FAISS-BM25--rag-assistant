Does Visual Source Safe really lack renaming functionality?

I'm using Visual Source Safe at a new job and it hasn't been too bad... then I renamed a file. I clicked through the warning prompts not really paying attention realized that by renaming the file I lost all of my history. Is this really the case? I can't believe VSS doesn't support renaming. I refactor lots of code and not having a renaming work properly really bites. Thanks for the answers. I guess VSS does have renaming functionality, just not in Visual Studio. What a dealbreaker though, switching apps to rename a file in source control? :/
