The algorithm that is used in this case is called one-vs-all classifier or multiclass classifier. In your case you have to take one class, e. g. number 1 , mark it as positive and combine the rest seven classes in one negative class. The neural network will output the probability of this case being class number 1 vs the rest of the classes. Afterwords, you have to assign as positive another class, e.g. number 2, assign all other classes as one big negative class and get the predicted probability from the network again. After repeating this procedure for all eight classes, assign each case to the the class that had the maximum probability from all the classes outputted from the neural network.
