IE6 invisible text in 7 lines HTML, is there a fix?

It took me forever to reduce the problem to this. I cannot express the amount of frustration I'm experiencing, and if I did, it would not be suitable for any website. Ever. Here is the HTML code that is causing me epic pain: This text is invisible. Remove either padding or background to see this. left The text is invisible, unless you highlite it or drag a window over top of it, or something crazy like that. This problem is resolved if you remove padding or remove the background. How can I fix this?
