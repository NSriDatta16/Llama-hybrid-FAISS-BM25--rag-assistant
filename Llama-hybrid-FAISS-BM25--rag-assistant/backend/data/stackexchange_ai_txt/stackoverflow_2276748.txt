Automating Account Disabling in JIRA

I've been reading some feature request-style threads in Atlassian's own JIRA install on how to disable (not remove) users in JIRA, and their suggested solution involves a series of UI actions. For the number of users that our organization supports, this needs to be automated with the rest of our employee account provisioning logic. I've been looking in the JIRA database and found the membershipbase table, but simply removing records from here WHERE USER_NAME="$username" doesn't seem to have a completely successful outcome. When I go to the User Browser in the Administration section and look up that user, groups still appear for the user. Does anyone have any experience with this that could point me in the right direction on any other tables I need to modify? Thanks in advance, -aj
