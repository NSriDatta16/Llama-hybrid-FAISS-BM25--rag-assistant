Chi-Squared for demonstrating confounding in Logistic regression (or not...)

I am using logistic regression for inference and classification, using data from 190 X-rays/subjects. We want to see if certain X-ray measurements could predict development of a disease (Case vs Control) later on. I want to understand the effects of confounding on my Logistic regression predictions. I have an important known confounder : the position of the patient during the X-ray capture (Sitting/Standing, 0,1). Since this is clinical retrospective data*, there is some randomness to as to who is Sitting/Standing. But there is a definite bias towards case patients having more X-rays while sitting: Control Case Sitting: 13.16% 48.42% Standing 25.26% 13.16% I know that some (not all) of my measurements are VERY influenced by the Sit/stand condition. To better demonstrate the confounding effect of Sit/Stand, I have obtained the predicted classes for my data. I have then obtained a binary variable for each sample on whether the Prediction was correct (1) or incorrect (0) . I figured, one way I could look at the relationship to my confounder (Sit/Stand) is with a Chi-Square test, since Correct/Incorrect + Sit/Stand are both binary: Univariate LogReg--> Prediction---> Chi-Square (Prediction Correct/incorrect ~ Sit/Stand) ---> P-value Testing with X-ray measurements I know are strongly related to Sit/Stand (measurement 1) generates a very small Chi-Square P-value. I am interpreting this as Sit/Stand exerting its effects on model predictions. Similarly, using X-ray features we know are NOT influenced by Sit/Stand (measurement_22), generates a large P-value: XR-measurement_1 XR-measurement_22 Chi-Sqr p-value: 0.0002 Chi-Sqr p-value: 0.21 Chi-Square Statistic: 13.44 13.47 Chi-Square Statistic: 0.65 This is an idea I came up with. So it cannot be very good... However, I am struggling to find ways to make inferences about how my predictions are being confounded. I feel like trying to look at the attributes of correctly and incorrectly classified samples could help me understand where Sit/Stand is confounding my X-ray measurements. I think the model struggles with Cases who are standing (since 2/3 of cases are sitting) Is this an unnecessarily complicated way of demonstrating confounding? Is it even demonstrating confounding? Are there better tools to explore this? Is this a dead end, and I should just finish 'Applied Logistic Regression by David Hosmer JR.'?** *We are studying a rare disease... Its very unlikely we will be able to prospectively collect data. So the Sit/Stand issue is unlikely to go away. **I am slowly making my way through: Applied Logistic Regression by David Hosmer JR. But so far I've just read about confounding observation using coefficients/odds ratios/model summaries.
