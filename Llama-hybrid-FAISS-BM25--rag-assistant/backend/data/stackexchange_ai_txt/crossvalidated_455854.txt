The reason is that you are calculating your MSE using the predictions for data.train that are obtained considering all the resulting model of combining each tree. However the Random Forest is calculating the MSE using the predictions obtained from evaluate the same data.train in every tree but only considering the data is not taken from bootstrapping to construct the tree, wether the data that it is in the OOB (OUT-OF-BAG). Then it averages the predictions for all the OUT-OF-BAG predictions for each sample of data.train that comes as input.
