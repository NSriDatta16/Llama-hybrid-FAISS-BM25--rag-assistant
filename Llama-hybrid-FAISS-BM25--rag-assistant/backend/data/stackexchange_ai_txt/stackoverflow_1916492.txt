You just need to traverse all strings until they differ, then take the substring up to this point. Pseudocode: loop for i upfrom 0 while all strings[i] are equal finally return substring[0..i] Common Lisp: (defun longest-common-starting-substring (&rest strings) (loop for i from 0 below (apply #'min (mapcar #'length strings)) while (apply #'char= (mapcar (lambda (string) (aref string i)) strings)) finally (return (subseq (first strings) 0 i))))
