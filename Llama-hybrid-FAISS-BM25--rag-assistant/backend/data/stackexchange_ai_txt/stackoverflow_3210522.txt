how to deploy a project on client's computer?

I have a built a . net application using visual studio . This application is coded in C# and uses SQLSERVER for database purposes(storage,retrieval and manipulation of data). Please tell me how to give this application to client ? Do I have to install .net framework on client's computer..? Do I need to install complete sqlserver on client's computer to access database? or giving the .exe file to client would be okay to solve the purpose..? help please...
