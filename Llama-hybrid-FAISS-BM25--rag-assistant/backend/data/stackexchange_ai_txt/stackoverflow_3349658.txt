It appears that it may be a known issue that SQLEXEC has no regard for comments in the SQL command when encountering question mark characters ? which normally represent parameters in ODBC and likewise in VFP. Just a warning - VFP's parser will catch any question mark in the SQL string, even if it's within a SQL comment (i.e. on a line beginning with -- or bracketed between /* */) and will error out if there's nothing there that can be a variable. If it can be a variable but you don't have it defined at runtime, you get an ugly inputbox to enter it. Worse, your user gets it. So watch out. -- Dragan Nedeljkovich
