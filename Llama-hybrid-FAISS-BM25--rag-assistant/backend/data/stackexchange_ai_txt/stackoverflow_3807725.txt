please check out, if there doesn't exist more than 1 image with the same name/id-Attribute. In that case, IE would take the last of the images with the same name(note that document.images['somename'] can be an Array ), while other UserAgents will take the first One. Maybe in that case you only don't see the change, for example if the changed image is outside the viewport. greets
