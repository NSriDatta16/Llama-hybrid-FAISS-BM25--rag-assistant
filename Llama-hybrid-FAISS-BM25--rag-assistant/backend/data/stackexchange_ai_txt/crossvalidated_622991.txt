I'm assuming we are talking about the simple linear regression model $$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i,\quad i=1,\ldots,n, $$ with $\epsilon_i\sim N(0,\,\sigma^2)$ , $\sigma^2>0$ , independently and identically. Doing the calculations yourself will notice that the OLS estimator for $\beta_1$ is \begin{align*} \hat \beta_1 &= \frac{\sum_i (Y_i-\bar Y)(X_i-\bar X)}{\sum_i(X_i-\bar X)^2} = \frac{\sum_i Y_i(X_i-\bar X)-\sum_i \bar Y(X_i-\bar X)}{\sum_i(X_i-\bar X)^2}\tag{*}\\ &= \sum_i a_iY_i.\tag{**} \end{align*} The first equality in (*) is just OLS, the second equality is algebra and equality in (**) is due to a certain property of the average. I'm leaving the rest of the details to you since this is a self-study question.
