I think the car market is itching for something like this. Currently, the only option is something along the lines of Rev, which uses a wifi enabled OBD-II to connect to the iPhone. Once you get a hard attachment, diagnostics and tuning will be incredibly easy and should be much cheaper than the wifi attachment. Plus, I feel like a big portion of the car-tuner market already has iPhones, so adding an attachment and application isn't a big leap. I already have a solid mount in my car for my phone. If I could information about my car while driving, that would just make things better! Next, I think it would be cool for someone to program a universal remote control (universal meaning for home automation/electronics/anything rf like remote extenders, garage door, etc) for the iPhone. It would pretty much need to be Logitech doing this (for the electronics side). They've already got the Harmony remotes, so it wouldn't be much stretch to use that knowledge and database of remote control codes to add it to the iPhone; they would only need a small attachment that allows the iPhone to send IR & RF, obviously wifi and bluetooth are already covered. As for the keyboard, I don't think it should be something that should be plugged into the iPhone, I think it should be something that you just set your iPhone next to and you get a bluetooth keyboard. I know they already make products like this, I'm just not sure if they work with the iPhone yet.
