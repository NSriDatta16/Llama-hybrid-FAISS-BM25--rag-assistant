Why R is not significant (and very low), while all predictors are significant?

I used a network logistic regression to regress five predictors against a dependent. They are all significant, instead the R is not significant and it's even very low. I can understand that it may be low because I need to add predictors but I cannot explain why it's not significant. Do you have any idea about?
