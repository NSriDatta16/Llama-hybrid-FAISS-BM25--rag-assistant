I don't see why you couldn't; your choice of storage engine is a MySQL implementation detail. All you should need to do is set :options => "ENGINE=MEMORY" in your create_table declaration in your migrations. Of course, I also don't see why you would -- especially in production. The MySQL documentation for the MEMORY engine is full of caveats , like fixed length field allocation, and the speed gain you'd realize has got to be trivial compared to the risk of losing everything. If your application is such that nothing needs to be persisted, ever, why not just skip ActiveRecord completely and layer your models on top of Memcached?
