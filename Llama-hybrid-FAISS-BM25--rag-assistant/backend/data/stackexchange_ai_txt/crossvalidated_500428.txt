Similarity with a rubber band model. This problem got me to think of the model for a 'rubber band' (See for instance wikipedia or section 3-7 in Herbert B. Callen's thermodynamics and an introduction to thermostatistics ). With a bit of hand waving: consider the distribution of only one axis/component of the $U_i$ (the marginal distribution along a single axis) approximate this with a normal distribution (the approximation becomes more accurate for larger $n$ and also for larger $d$ ) because the distribution needs to be spherically symmetric we assume the other components to be identical and independently distributed. The squared length will be the sum of $d$ squared normal distributed variables. Then the distribution of $M$ is approximately a scaled $\chi$ distributed variable with $d$ degrees of freedom. The scaling factor is $1/\sqrt{dn}$ To know the scaling we need to know the variance of the distribution of the component. The contributions of each $U_{i}$ follow some sort of beta distribution (it is only the projection of $U_{i}$ that matters) $$f(x) \propto (1-x^2)^\frac{d-3}{2} \quad \text{for $-1 \leq x \leq 1$}$$ or with $t = x^2$ $$f(t) \propto t^\frac{1}{2}(1-t)^\frac{d-3}{2}\quad \text{for $0 \leq t \leq 1$}$$ This means that the mean of $T$ or the variance of $X$ is equal to $1/d$ (the mean of a beta distribution with $\alpha = 1/2$ and $\beta = (d-1)/2$ ). For the mean of $n$ of those variables, you get that the variance is $1/(dn)$ . Simulation Below is an example for the case of $n=20$ and $d=4$ This is computed with the following r-code: n = 20 d = 4 ### sample from sphere simsphere
