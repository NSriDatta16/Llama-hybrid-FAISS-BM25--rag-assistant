Why is Android looking for QVGA resources in the wrong order mdpi > hdpi > ldpi?

I'm trying to do some testing with a QVGA emulator and I find that it looks for an image resource in the mentioned order. drawable-mdpi 1st drawable-hdpi 2nd drawable-ldpi 3rd (it does get found only after I change the name of the image in the other two dirs for testing) I would expect it to be ldpi first. When running other emulators (HVGA and WVGA) they use their appropriate drawable dirs... it's only QVGA. The only code that I see could affect this is here (based on the docs) I have tested this with a 2.0 emulator and a 1.6, I get the same result. Any ideas? Thank you very much.
