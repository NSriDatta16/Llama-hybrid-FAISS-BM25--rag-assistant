You've hit the nail on the head - it's about abstraction. Start out right now by abstracting away from storage-specific semantics in your business logic. Develop a clean, object-oriented DAL and do all CRUD/Query operations through it, and while your object model (or domain model, if you want to recognize a difference between the two) can use concrete classes, your DAL operations should be defined in an interface. Whether you use a factory depends on your particular use case, but if you're developing with this sort of abstraction in mind, it makes sense to adopt an inversion of control container and handle this sort of wiring by dependency injection. There are lots to choose from .
