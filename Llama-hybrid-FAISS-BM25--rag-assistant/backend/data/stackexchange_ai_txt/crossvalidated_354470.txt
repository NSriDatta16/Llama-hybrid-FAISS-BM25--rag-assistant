What are my options for dependent variable as percentage of quality?

First of all, thanks for taking your time to answer me. I'm aware that this can be a self-study question and I wanted to make it as generic as possible so other people could also benefit from it In my problem I have: A set of numerical independent features (X) One dependent variable which represents a percentage of quality between 0 and 1 (Y) I have a training dataset with different values of features, and the quality as output. Let's say that I want to obtain the best feature (X1) that maximises the quality (Y) by keeping the other features constant. What approaches do you recommend to follow? For the modelling, I was thinking about Logistic Regression but that would be for binary classes. I could create a threshold in the percentage of quality, for example =0.7 = 1 but that would limit the problem and the parameter that I want to obtain wouldn't be very accurate in my opinion. Once I have the model, I can iterate different values of the feature (X1) until I maximise the quality, but my doubt is in how can I model this problem. Thank you
