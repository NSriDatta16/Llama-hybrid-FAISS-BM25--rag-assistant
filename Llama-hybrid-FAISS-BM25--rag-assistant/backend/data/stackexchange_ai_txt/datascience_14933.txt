You can possibly use a combination of Named Entity Recognition and Syntactical Analysis - while the word Edwin is certainly propping up, imagine a situation where the name is Edward Philip Martel . NER detects each word as a separate entities (hence 3 different entities) - thus, you will anyways have to string them together based on some logic. Further, in the case of multiple names being present, it can get harder to disambiguate (e.g. John & Ramsey dined at Winterfell ). This is where the analysis of the sentence syntax would also help (assuming that the end user enters a relatively coherent and proper sentence - if slang and short forms of text are used, even the Stanford NLP can help upto a certain extent only). One way of leveraging on syntax analysis / parsing and NER is in the following examples - 1. User: Edwin is my name. 2. User: I am Edwin. 3. User: My name is Edwin. In each of the cases (as is generically the case as well), the Entity Name (Proper Noun / Noun) is associated in close proximity to a Verb. Hence, if you first parse the sentence to determine verbs and then apply NER to surrounding (+/- 1 or 2) words, you may have a relatively decent way to resolve the problem. This solution would depend primarily on the syntax rules you create to identify NERs as well as the window around the verbs.
