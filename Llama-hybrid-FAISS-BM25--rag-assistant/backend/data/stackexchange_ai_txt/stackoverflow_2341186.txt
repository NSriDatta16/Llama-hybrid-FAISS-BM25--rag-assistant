Safely delete a TFS branch project

I'm currently reorganising our TFS source control for a very large set of solutions, and I've done this successfully so far. I have a problem at the moment where I need to delete a legacy "Release Branch" TFS project that was branched for the old structure, and is no-longer required since I now host a release branch within the new structure. This is an example of how the source control now looks after moving everything: $/Source Project /Trunk /[Projects] /Release /[Projects] $/Release Branch Project /[Projects] /[Other legacy stuff] So far I've found information that says: tf delete /lock:checkout /recursive TestMain to delete a branch. TfsDeleteProject to delete a project tf delete seems to be only relevant when I need to delete a branch that is within the same project as the trunk, and TfsDeleteProject doesn't seem like it will delete the branch association from the source project (I hope I'm wrong, see below). Can someone tell me if the above will work, and in what order I should perform them in, to successfully delete the TFS $/Release Branch Project while also deleting the branch association (from right-click $/Source Project -> Properties -> Branches)?
