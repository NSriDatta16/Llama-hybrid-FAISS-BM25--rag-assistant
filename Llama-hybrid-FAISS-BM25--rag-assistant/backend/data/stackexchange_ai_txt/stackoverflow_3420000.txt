It probably takes many millions of entries to run out of RAM on modern machine if the algorithm is correct. Assuming this, you have to use some persistent storage for the data to process only chunk at a time. Why not use simple database table with 2 columns to store the dict? key value 1 1999 1 2000 1 2001 2 440 2 441 ... Then you can use either column as a key by selecting with order by on needed column and grouping values from other column with simple python code.
