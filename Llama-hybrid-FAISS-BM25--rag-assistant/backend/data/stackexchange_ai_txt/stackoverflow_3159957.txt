bash trick to copy files to a previously visited directory

here's the scenario you are in bash :~/dirA$ cd /dirb :/dirb$ cp filex __here_i_want_trick_to_reference_dirA example of a similar trick is cd - , which puts you into the previously visited directory. I want this because, in reality, the paths I am dealing with are huge and I'm looking for a shortcut. furthermore, a trick which handles this: :a$ cd x :x$ cd y etc. :y$ cp file _ref_to_original_dir_a I am looking for the least intrusive way to accomplish this, if the 2nd part is not doable without too many shenanigans, then it's probably not worth it for my usage. thanks just an update - thanks for the replies. http://www.hccp.org/modding-cd.html That page describes what i am choosing. it just adds the alias to the mix for the pushd solution.
