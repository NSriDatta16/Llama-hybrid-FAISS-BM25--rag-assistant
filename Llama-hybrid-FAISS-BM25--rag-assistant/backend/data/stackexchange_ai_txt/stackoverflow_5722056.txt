Ditto (although on a quite simple schema, have to say). "Just worked". Hibernate magic. I had my peace of mind because we had 100% test coverage for DAO layer. So when schema was recreated on MS SQL, and some table and column names were updated in the mapping (don't remember why, but DBAs asked to, may be naming convention), we just run our tests and found no failed ones. P.S. Recalled one interesting detail: functional tests were all OK. But when PTE started on MS SQL database, we have found that a concurrent access to one particular table was times slower than on Oracle due to locks propagation. We had to redesign that functionality.
