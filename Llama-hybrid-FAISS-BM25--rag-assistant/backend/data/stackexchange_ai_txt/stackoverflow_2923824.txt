Undefined symbols GCC / C++ dynamically loadable *.so objects

-I am trying to compile a netsnmp mib and extend the functionality of the snmp agent. When I try to start the daemon and load the shared object (*.so) , the daemon complains about undefined symbols. "dlopen failed: Filename.so: undefined symbol: netsnmp_container_table_row_extract" On further prodding #nm -D -u Filename.so prints out a number of undefined references/ symbols Some of these references are system calls specific to the snmp agent. I do not have any problem in compiling the code. All of the missing references/symbols are calls to the netsnmp agent. Question : 1. How am I able to compile without resolving these symbols ? AFIK : These symbols must have been resolved statically. 2. I assume the system is not able to resolve these at run time ? 3. How could i get over this problem ? Any suggestions Thanks S.S
