I've been struggling with the same problem and finally stumbled across an article entitled "Subject Specific Treatment to Neural Networks for Repeated Measures" . They recommend one-hot encoding the subject ID and using that as an additional input to the model (and they specifically suggest that it's better to provide the input to a deeper hidden layer, not the first). However, if you need to make predictions on new data, it's not exactly clear how best to do that. Their solution strikes me a pretty clever, and it is probably worth testing your architecture with and without the subject ID input.
