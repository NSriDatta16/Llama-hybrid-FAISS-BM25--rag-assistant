If you are really interested in going global across all cultures, take a look at the HR-XML specification of Person . Given name & surname just doesn't cut it when you move outside of the West. Eastern standards of FamilyName GivenName will trip you up on defining FullName. Besides, you have all the potential complexities of alternate scripts (not everybody uses the Latin alphabet, y'know), prefixes and suffixes (NN Sr, van der Waals). It's a standard intended for transmission and integration rather than storage, but don't let the XML schema syntax scare you. I wouldn't implement every aspect of it, but it's an excellent provider of corner cases which aren't immediately obvious, and which you can then ignore consciously. In particular, check out the examples at the end! And for goodness' sake, don't create an American application which assumes a middle initial for everyone!
