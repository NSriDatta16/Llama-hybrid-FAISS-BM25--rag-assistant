Binary logistic regression with interaction terms

I have been reading several CV posts on binary logistic regression but I am still confused for my current situation. I am attempting to fit a binary logistic regression to a series of continuous and categorical variables in order to predict the mortality or the survival of animals ( qual_status ). Please see the str below: > str(logit) 'data.frame': 136 obs. of 9 variables: $ id : Factor w/ 135 levels "01001","01002",..: 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 ... $ gear : Factor w/ 2 levels "j","sc": 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 ... $ depth : num 146 163 179 190 194 172 172 175 240 214 ... $ length : num 37 35 42 38 37 41 37 52 38 37 ... $ condition : Factor w/ 4 levels "1","2","3","4": 1 1 4 1 4 2 2 1 2 1 ... $ in_water : num 80 45 114 110 60 121 56 140 93 68 ... $ in_air : num 60 136 128 136 165 118 220 90 177 240 ... $ delta_temp : num 8.5 8.4 8.3 8.5 8.5 8.6 8.6 8.7 8.7 8.7 ... $ qual_status: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 ... I have no issues fitting an the following additive binary logistic regression with the glm function: glm(qual_status ~ gear + depth + length + condition + in_water + in_air + delta_temp, data = logit, family = binomial) ...but I am also interested at how these predictor variables interact with one another and possibly influence survival. However, when I attempt the following interactive binary logistic regression: glm(qual_status ~ gear * depth * length * condition * in_water * in_air * delta_temp, data = logit, family = binomial) I receive a warning message "glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred" , along with missing coefficients due to singularities (NA or * ) when I use summary : Call: glm(formula = qual_status ~ gear * depth * length * condition * in_water * in_air * delta_temp, family = binomial, data = logit) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [36] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [71] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [106] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coefficients: (122 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.419e+30 5.400e+22 26274077 Fitting only the continuous variables to a binary logistic regression doesn't yield any warnings or singularities but the addition of the ordinal predictor variables causes issues. Along with avoiding these warnings, is there a function/package that can handle dummy variables (I believe that is what I am looking for) in logistic regressions in R ?
