How to remove JQuery Dialogs from the DOM

I have run into a situation where I need to manually remove old dialogs before creating new ones. In another thread, the following method was suggested: $('.ui-dialog').empty().remove(); And I think this would work, but I do have other dialogs that I do not want to remove from the DOM, and I think this method would get rid of all of them. Inspecting the page with Firebug shows that once JQuery creates a dialog out of the html you provide, it gives it standard wrapper divs, all with the same classes. These are: ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all ui-draggable So they're pretty generic, and it's hard to find a unique characteristic about the outer wrapper classes that need to go. I'm trying to find a way to only remove the dialogs that I want to remove, and leave the others. Any ideas?
