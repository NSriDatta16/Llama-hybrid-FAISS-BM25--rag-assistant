You may be able to consider JIBX , you may be able to define a mapping from your domain model classes to your target XML schema. Alternatively, if that's not possible, although I know you state that you've discounted using binding technologies I'd encourage you to review that decision, copying from your domain model into a generated model will most likely make for cleaner, more maintainable and less error prone code than what you're proposing, (which JIBX can also do). I should probably add, in my experience asking questions about JIBX here is fruitless but their mailing list is very helpful.
