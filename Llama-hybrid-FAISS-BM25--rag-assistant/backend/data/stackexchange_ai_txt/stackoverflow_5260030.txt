You say you have a animated character in Blender format and wish to import it into your application written in C++, right? To export data from Blender and use it in your application, consider using Open Asset Import Library . It reads a huge bunch of file formats. It even supports the native Blender file format, but currently with no animations. Note - I am biased here, since I'm one of the project's founders . Unless it's for learning purposes, I'd strongly discourage you to write your own importers. It's painful and most likely to distract you from your original aim (write a game). Finding proper exporters for Blender can be tricky, but I'd try Collada, X, MD5, 3DS, Obj, DXF .. usually, one of these formats works (keep in mind, however, that some support animations and more sophisticated materials while others don't).
