Estimate of an AR model

I have this part of a project which states this: Once you choose the best three models for each series (according to AIC, the PACF and ACF, and "from general to specific), the next step is to estimate these 6 models. You should present the final models (estimates and t-stats) and the proof that the residuals are white noise (you can use for this Q-stat or check if residuals have serial correlation with 5% significance level). In the previous step I had to find the parameters of the AR model, and in order to check if residuals are white noise I run the Ljung-Box test in this way (given the cutoff of the PACF of my differentiated time series is 6, I wanted to validate an AR(6). I defined x as my diff(log(gdptimeseries)). ar6=arima(x,order=c(6,0,0) Call: arima(x = gdplogdiff, order = c(6, 0, 0)) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 ar4 ar5 ar6 intercept 3.3058 -4.5471 3.0440 -0.6789 -0.3044 0.1651 0e+00 s.e. 0.0579 0.2025 0.3345 0.3343 0.2021 0.0576 4e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 8.669e-09: log likelihood = 2250.22, aic = -4484.44 What I'm I now supposed to do? how do I estimate the parameters and the t-stats of the model?
