From Kleinbaum and Klein 2010, logistic regression, p304. In most epidemiologic analyses, the primary goal is to assess an exposure–disease relationship, so that we are usually more interested in deriving the “best” model for the relationship (which typically involves a strategy requiring the comparison of various models) than in using a GOF procedure. Nevertheless, once we have obtained a final (i.e., best”) model, we would also like this model to fit the data well, thus justifying a GOF procedure This is my reasoning: We study asociation through ORs (Sometimes RR) which are related to probabilities. With probabilities you predict. If your predictions are too bad (there is statistical evidence of lack of fit) so are your probabilities and there for you measure of association (OR) is also a bad one . For me the difference with the prediction goal is the process of fitting the model. In the latter case, we seek maximum prediction power no matter what. In the association case ( not causal , as you asked) we seek for valid $\beta$s sacrificing GOT but not too much (to the point where the $\beta$s are useless).
