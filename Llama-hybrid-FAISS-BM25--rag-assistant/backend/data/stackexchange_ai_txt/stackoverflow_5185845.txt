Using PHP To build a form but having trouble naming with square brackets

I am trying to use PHP to build HTML that I will later display. I have the following lines: $currentName = "test"; $numberToGiveDropDownHTML = " \n"; But I get the following error: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ']', expecting T_STRING or T_VARIABLE or T_NUM_STRING in... What is wrong with that? I thought I could that and later use the $_POST super global. Thanks!
