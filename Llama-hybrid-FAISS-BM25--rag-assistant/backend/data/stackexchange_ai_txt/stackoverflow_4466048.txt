Selectable & Draggable jQuery to make a Windows Explorer-like window

I'm now facing another thing that I can't figure out how to do. I'm new to jQuery and I'm trying to make an icon draggable and when you drop it in the folder(.folder div) It will be moved there. Drag the icon (I know how to drag it but it is only visible in the parent div and not on the entire webpage.) Drop on a folder on the #navbar (at the left) (Again, I can't figure out how to make it droppable over a specific div) Remove the div moved on the original content and realign all other div Call a php page to move the file associated with this div to the selected directory div on the center of the page (I want them draggable) are icons, when you drag them and then drop them on a folder on the left, it will be moved there. Here you can see what it looks like (Better using Firefox) : http://narks.xtreemhost.com/ This is only a test page to show you. Anyone can help me with that please? To know the structure of the webpage, see Windows 7 explorer in CSS layout (Thanks again to Ivan IvaniÄ‡ for his precious help1) EDIT jQuery Drag & Drop : $( "div.explorer_icon" ).draggable({ opacity: 0.50, revert: true, distance: 30, zIndex: 9999, scroll: false, appendTo: 'body', containment: 'window', helper: 'clone' }); $( "#navbar div.item_list" ).droppable({ accept: '.explorer_icon', hoverClass: 'item_list_hover', tolerance: 'pointer', drop: function(event, ui) { } });
