It seems your Gui will be the client and will Reference the other 3 assemblies. Gui.Controller will reference Core and DataEntities, and Core will reference only DataEntities. The AccountController should fetch the list and return it to the Gui.Controller. It's fine if the list is ObservableCollection. The list itself should be placed in the Gui or Gui.Controller, depending if you can access the properties of Gui.Controller from Gui. When you put the ListBox in a Window which will be placed in the Gui, you need to bind it to a collection. The collection can be a property of the Window. Or you can bind it to a method, which can be part of Gui.Controller. It really depends on how you want to organize it.
