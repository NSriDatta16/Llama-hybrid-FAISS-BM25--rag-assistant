These solve different problems. char* (or char const* ) points to a C style string which isn't necessarily owned by the one storing the char* pointer. In C, because of the lack of a string type, necessarily you often use char* as "the string type". std::string owns the string data it points to. So if you need to store a string somewhere in your class, chances are good you want to use std::string or your librarie's string class instead of char* . On contiguity of the storage of std::string , other people already answered.
