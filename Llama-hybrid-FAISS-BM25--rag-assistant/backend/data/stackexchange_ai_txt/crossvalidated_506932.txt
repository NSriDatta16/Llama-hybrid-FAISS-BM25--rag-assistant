testing the accuracy of a probability logistic regression

I had a dataset with binary data. I created a logistic regression model with continuous data on the x-axis and binary data that has values 0 and 1 on the y-axis. Then I plotted my model, a line that shows the possibility of belonging to the '1' value on the y-axis. The probability line seems fine, but how can I test the accuracy of this model?
