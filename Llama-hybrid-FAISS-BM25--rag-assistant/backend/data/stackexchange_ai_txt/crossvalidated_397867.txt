Why ARIMA/ARMA is performing very bad on out of sample (future) prediction?

I am working on a time series forecasting problem. The time series is - I plotted the rolling mean and rolling variance - rolling mean - and the rolling variance- The rolling mean/variance has not that specific pattern(increasing or decreasing).I used augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test and the p value is 0.0008.(I assumed that the I don't need an integrative component). Here's the partial auto correlation plot - Since only 1st and 4th lag seems significant ,I tried searching for the best parameter for ARMA but prediction on the out of future dates is quite strange. Here's the plot on the training data - which gets worse on the future points and quite similar if I use ARIMA with I equals to 1- Fit on seasonal Arima (1,0,0)(0,0,0)7- I want to predict the future trend in this time series ,but due to very poor performance I am not sure how to proceed . I am a beginner in time series analysis ,please correct me if I have done some conceptual mistake. My specific question is how to model the trend for future points in a time series if the time series model is not a good fit ?
