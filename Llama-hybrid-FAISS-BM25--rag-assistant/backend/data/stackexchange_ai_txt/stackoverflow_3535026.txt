I'm not sure where your GUIDs come from, but if they're being generated during the insert, using the NEWSEQUENTIALID() in SQL Server instead of NEWID() will help you avoid fragmentation issues during insert. Regarding the choice of a clustered index, as Kimberly L. Tripp states here : "the most important factors in choosing a clustered index are that it's unique, narrow and static (ever-increasing has other benefits to minimizing splits)." A GUID falls short on the narrow requirement when compared to an INT or even BIGINT. Kimberly also has an excellent article on GUIDs as PRIMARY KEYs and/or the clustering key .
