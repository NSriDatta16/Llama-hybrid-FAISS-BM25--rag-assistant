Inverse prediction of SVM because AUC is lower than 0.5

I am training SVM by a dataset with 8 features using 10-fold CV. The AUC for testing data is under 0.5. I remember that somewhere it had been written that in cases with AUC , we can inverse the answer of the classifier to test samples. For example, in a two class problem, if SVM predicts class '1' for a test sample, we consider it as class '2'. Is it correct?
