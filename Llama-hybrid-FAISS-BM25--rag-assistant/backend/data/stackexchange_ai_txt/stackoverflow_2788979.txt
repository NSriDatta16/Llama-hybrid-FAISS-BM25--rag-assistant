The Spring session does not exactly match the HttpSession, and even the Spring documentation on the @SessionAttributes annotation says that it might be stored in the session or "some conversational storage". I got that from The Spring docs for 2.5 I've basically quit trying to make sense of it, and just got on with my life, if I want something stored in the HttpSession, I just have Spring inject the HttpSession to me, assuming you're using Spring MVC its pretty easy, instructions on the same page.
