You could probably also hack one together using an image that looks like the progress bar at it's smallest size and then create a stretchable image with it. UIImage *progressBarImg= [someImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:5.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; Then you could set the image as the backgroundImage for a disabled UIButton and animate the button width incrementally to indicate progress. I haven't tried this, but I think it would work.
