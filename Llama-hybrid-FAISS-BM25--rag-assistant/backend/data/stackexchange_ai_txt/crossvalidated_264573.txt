software for genome wide associations studies (GWAS)

I have just started learning about genome wide associations studies (GWAS) as I will have to run some of them in the near future, and I am pretty confused about which are the best computational tools available for my dataset. In particular, I have almost 10 millions SNPs that I would like to test against clinical numerical covariates such as blood pressure. Moreover, I have some high dimensional phenotypes that I would like to reduce to 40/50 variables using dimensionality reduction (PCA etc.) and test them in the same multivariate model. Which software/implementation would you advise for performing this statistical analysis, please?
