I was hoping it had a knife tool like photoshop and allowed me draw the lines and it would cut the images for me... â€“ Haoest (Oct 13 at 20:22) From what I can tell you're looking for something that does the code for you - have you tried ImageReady? I think there's a free trial of it like Photoshop. If you aren't (and good job if you're willing to code something properly) then you can use GIMP, it's a little different though. Load your image into GIMP, and then start to drag rulers across where you'd like to slice. From what I can remember there is a slicing tool in GIMP but I preferred to select portions manually and save as seperate images and then write the code myself.
