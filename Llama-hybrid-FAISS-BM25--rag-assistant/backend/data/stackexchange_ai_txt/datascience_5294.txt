How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms?

This is an interview question How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? I could find papers that talk about methods to process the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) by a single-layer neural network with a linear transfer function. Is there some other correlation that I'm missing?
