How do the mapping function phi(x) of a RBF kernel?

I'm trying to implement a paper that used SVM and an improve of it with Bayesian decision theory. How do I do the mapping feature $\phi(x)$ that appears in the decision function? The paper used an RBF kernel, I have the kernel from the Mercer, with the inner product of the vector x. But I do not understand how to do the function $\phi(x)$.
