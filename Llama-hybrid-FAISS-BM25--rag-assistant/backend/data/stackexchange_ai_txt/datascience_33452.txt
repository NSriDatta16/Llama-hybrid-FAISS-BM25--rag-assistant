Neural style transfer is part of convolution neural network but not machine learning. The way we define supervised and unsupervised learning is seems to be part of machine learning but it is not, supervised learning is just weather we are focusing on a desired output and whereas in case of unsupervised learning we don't really focus on any predefined output. So similarly in case of neural transfer learning we are not focusing on any predefined output rather than we are just getting modified version of two image. So this not case of supervised learning
