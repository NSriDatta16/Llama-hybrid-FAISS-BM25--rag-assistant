Javascript, UI: Looking for a good list explorer component

Think Windows Explorer's 'Details' view. I need to output my database to this view. Here's what I need: Columns should be horizontally resizeable. Columns should be able to be reordered via. dragging and dropping their headers. I need to be able to sort the data by a given column, like when its header is clicked on (with toggling for ascending/descending order). It can be a jQuery plug-in, if you know of one that does this. Preferably free. Thanks in advance.
