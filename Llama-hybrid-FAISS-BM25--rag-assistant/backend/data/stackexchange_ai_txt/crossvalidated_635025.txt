The whole multiple comparisons question has been discussed here many times. See e.g. here , here , and here , and the whole mutltiple-comparisons tag. Then there's the whole question of the utility of hypothesis tests and p values in the first place, also discussed here many times, e.g. here , and here (and all those threads link to other threads). As to your other question on how many tests in a medical research article, while an individual journal may have some limit (although I don't know of any that have explicit limits), in general, as many as needed. Finally, in one of my favorite statistics books, Statistics as Principled Argument , Robert Abelson argues strongly against statistical "rules" of this sort and instead argues that analysis should be base on what can be justified in any particular situation.
