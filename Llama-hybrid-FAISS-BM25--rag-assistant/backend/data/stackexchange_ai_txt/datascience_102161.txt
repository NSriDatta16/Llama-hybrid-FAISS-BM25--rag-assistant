These are great first attempts! However, neural networks are notoriously bad at working with tabular data. You'd might be better served using a traditional ML model (e.g., linear regression, SVM). Regardless of whether you're using a neural net or otherwise, you should normalize/transform your input features and the output feature (i.e., your closing price). Transforming your inputs would remedy the right-skew problem that you're facing and shrink the overall scale of your regression data -- which helps your prediction models converge towards a minimum loss. I hope that this helps!
