In PHP pretty much everything is instantiated on every page hit. If you want to maintain state you have a number of choices: For user-specific data you can put it in a cookie ( not recommended for security reasons); Put user-specific data in the session, which basically means writing it to file and loading it from file on every hit; Storing it in some form of persistent storage, such as a file or database table; Store it in a cache of some kind (eg memcached). Which one you use depends on factors such as if the data is global, user-specific, etc and a number of other factors (such as how often it is read, how often it is written, etc). So it's impossible to give you a definitive answer as the nature of what you want to be persistent is unclear. If you're worried about the cost of creating an object then, unless it is really expensive, don't. Don't optimize a problem until you have a problem.
