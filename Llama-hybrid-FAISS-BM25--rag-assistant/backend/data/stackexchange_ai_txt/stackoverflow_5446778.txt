Select from one table matching criteria in another?

I'd really appreciate some help with an SQL query across tables. I realise this sort of thing is asked constantly, but I can't find a similar enough question to make sense of the answers. I want to select rows from table_A that have a corresponding tag in table_B . So, for example, " select rows from table_a which are tagged 'chair' " would return table_C . Also, id is a unique in table_a , and not in table_b . table_A: table_B: table_C: id object id tag id object 1 lamp 1 furniture 3 stool 2 table 2 furniture 4 bench 3 stool 3 furniture 4 bench 4 furniture 4 chair 3 chair Alternatively, is there a better way to organise the data?
