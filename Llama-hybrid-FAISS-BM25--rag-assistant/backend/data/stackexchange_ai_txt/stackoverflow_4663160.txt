CoreData issue with appDelegate

I'm relatively new to Objective C. So far everything has been going really well until I hit CoreData. I just can't get it to work! After spending many hours on something that seems to be pretty straightforward, I'm at my wits' end. PLEASE help me figure out what I have done wrong: I created a new Windows-Based app and checked 'use Core Data for storage' In the xcdatamodel, I created an entity named 'RecipeData' with only one attribute 'recipeName' it is a string in the app delegate, I load an XML file and parse it. When I parse the recipe name, I use the following: recipeData *dataName = (recipeData *) [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"RecipeData" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext] ; I get the following error: terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '+entityForName: could not locate an NSManagedObjectModel for entity name 'RecipeData' Which leads me to the big 3 questions: is there anything really obvious that I am doing wrong? since I checked 'use Core Data for storage,' it seems the following code is injected automatically into the app delegate .h: @private NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext_; NSManagedObjectModel *managedObjectModel_; NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *persistentStoreCoordinator_; @property (nonatomic, retain, readonly) NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext; Does this interfere with the code I am using? I tried creating a new NSManagedObjectContext called *myManagedObjectContext but that did not work. One other tidbit, when I add the following right above my code: if (managedObjectContext == nil) { NSLog(@"NO CONTEXT"); } The console prints "NO CONTEXT" I really appreciate any help. Thanks.
