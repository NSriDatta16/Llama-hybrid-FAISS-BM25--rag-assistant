I'd say try to store the minimum amount of data that will be enough to recreate the necessary environment in a subsequent request. If you're storing in memory to avoid a database round-trip, then a true caching solution such as Memcache might be helpful. If you're storing these sessions in memory instead of a database, then the round-trip is saved, and requests will be served faster as long as the memory load is low, and there's no paging. Once the number of clients goes up and paging begins, most clients will see a huge degradation in response times. Both these variables and inversely related. Its better to measure the latency to your database server, which is usually low enough in most cases to be considered as a viable means of storage instead of in-memory.
