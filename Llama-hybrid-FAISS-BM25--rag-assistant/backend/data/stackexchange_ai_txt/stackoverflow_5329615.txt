There are a few ways to do this: 1) Perl and LWP use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; my $response = $ua->post('http://bip.weizmann.ac.il/oca-bin/lpccsu?9955', { param1 => 'value1', param2 => 'value2', }); my $content = $response->content; // your regular expression code 2) Autohotkey, which has regular expressions and a library written by a user that handles POST requests, see http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic33506.html 3) Write a batch file that uses wget --post-data and --post-file, pipe it to a series of files, and read the output with your favortite script language Reference: http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/HTTP-Options.html Hope that helps
