If the prior accurately reflects your beliefs about the parameter and you are willing to make the assumption that the model for the data is correct, then the posterior is the rational way to update your beliefs after seeing the data. The assumption that your model for the data is correct is implicit and sometimes not discussed, though it doesn't make sense to use conditional probability notation to make the assumption. Admittedly though, this would draw more attention to the assumptions being made that are sometimes not discussed explicitly. Similarly, $P(X)$ is understood to mean the marginal probability of the data averaged over your prior beliefs. Saying $P(Y)$ does not exist is odd, though it is true that it can be difficult to construct $P(Y)$ in such a way that it does accurately reflect your prior beliefs.
