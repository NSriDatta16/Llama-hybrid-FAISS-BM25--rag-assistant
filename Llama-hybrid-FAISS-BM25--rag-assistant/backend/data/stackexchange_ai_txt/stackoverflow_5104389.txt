A common misunderstanding is that Something x = {0}; should initialize all members to the same value. The C standard states that if all of the elements in an "aggregate" (arrays, structs etc) are not initialized explicitly, then the remaining values should be initialized as if they had static storage duration. And all elements that have static storage duration, ie those declared with keyword static and all global variables, must be initialized to zero if the programmer didn't initialize them explicitly. So in your example, "rollno" and "cgpa" are initialized explicitly, to zero in this case, and the rest of the struct is initialized as if it had static storage duration, meaning it will be zero as well.
