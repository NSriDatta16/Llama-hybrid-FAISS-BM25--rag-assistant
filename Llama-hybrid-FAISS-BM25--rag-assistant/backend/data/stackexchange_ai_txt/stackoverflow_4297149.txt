enum('yes', 'no') vs tinyint -- which one to use?

What's the best practice for fields that hold true/false values? Such columns can be defined as enum('yes','no') or as tinyint(1). Is one better/faster than the other? Is it better to use enum('1','0') vs. enum('yes','no') (i.e., does it write 'yes' or 'no' as a string to every row so the database storage size gets bigger)?
