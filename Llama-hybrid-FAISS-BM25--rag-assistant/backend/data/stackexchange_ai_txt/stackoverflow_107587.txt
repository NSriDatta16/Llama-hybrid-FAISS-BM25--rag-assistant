In our organization we have three classifications of applications - Low Business Impact - no PII, clear-text storage, clear-text transmission, no access restrictions. Medium Business Impact - non-transactional PII e.g. email address. clear-text storage, SSL from datacenter to client, clear-text in data center, limited storage access. High Business Impact - transactional data e.g. SSN, Credit Card etc. SSL within and outside of datacenter. Encrypted & Audited Storage. Audited applications. We use these criteria to determine partitioning of data, and which aspects of the site require SSL. Computation of SSL is either done on server or through accelerators such as Netscaler. As level of PII increases so does the complexity of the audit and threat modelling. As you can imagine we prefer to do LBI applications.
