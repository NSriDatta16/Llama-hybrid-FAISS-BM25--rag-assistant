Higher level sentence similarity (meaning instead of 'just' embeddings)

I am looking for the correct model / approach for the task of checking if two sentences have the same meaning I know I can use embeddings to check similarity, but that is not what I am after. I suspect BERT style LLM have nice higher level vector that mights be useful, but I'm not sure how to apply that. For example this sentence: I am very lazy Has a somewhat similar meaning as: I don't like to work hard But not A lazy horse is not very useful Using 'just' embeddings (for example HF: allMiniLM-L6-v2) gives results that are not useful. What would be a good appoarch?
