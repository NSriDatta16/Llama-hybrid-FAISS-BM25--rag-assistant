Generating images: Alternate font by User Agent (OS)

I need to generate small images for certain parts of text. Those will have to fit into the text seamlessly. I know I can not make up for every browser font settings available, but how do I have to check for Linux, Mac and Windows users depending on the user agent? I want to use the right font (of the three "Verdana, Arial, Helvetiva") for the right user agent OS. So: How do I check for the OS? What do I have to compare to in the user agent? Where can I get the other two fonts. Does the Windows-included Verdana look the same as the one used on Linux (or, is it free anyway? I don't know much about fonts)? Where do I get Helvetica? Is it Mac OS licensed? Any code examples can be in either c# or VB.NET. I can read both. Thank you in advance.
