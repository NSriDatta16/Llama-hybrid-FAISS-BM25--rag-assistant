You can learn PLC programming from various sources on the internet, one of which is this(wikibooks) or this The program that you write will be pretty much the same across different brands of PLCs for LLDs (Ladder Logic Diagrams) unless you use PLC specific functions. But there will be much more differences if you use some language like IL (Instruction List). But once you have written the program, the format of storage and execution differs widely across brands Ladder logic is one of the 5 programming languages for PLC, the others being FBD (Function block diagram), ST (Structured text, similar to the Pascal programming language), IL (Instruction list, similar to assembly language) and SFC (Sequential function chart). These are just various representations of the programming language, various flavours if you will. But usually, a given brand supports only one of these. In USA, LLDs are widely used, while in Europe, ILs are more popular.
