Using an actual parser would probably be more robust, although it may be overkill depending on how complex your problem is. JavaCC and ANTLR are probably the two most popular parser generators in the Java world. If a parser generator is overkill (possibly because you don't have/want to create a formal grammar), you could probably use Ragel to implement a custom parser.
