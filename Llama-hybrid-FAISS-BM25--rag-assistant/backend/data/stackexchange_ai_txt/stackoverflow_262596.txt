Add references to project when control dropped from Visual Studio 2008 toolbox

When I drop a third-party control onto a visual design surface in Visual Studio, any library references required by the control are automatically added to my project. I have an inherited version of a third-party control that I've added to the toolbox. However, when I drag it onto a form, only some of the references to the underlying third-party libraries are added. How can I specify additional references to be added?
