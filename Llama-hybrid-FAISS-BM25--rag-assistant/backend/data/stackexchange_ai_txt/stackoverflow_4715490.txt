It sounds to me like you're going along the route of creating an open source project and then giving commit access to all. I'd advise against this, whatever measures you try to put in place, someone stupid will come along at some point and sod the whole lot up. Instead, I'd advise taking a different approach with commit access and handing it out only to people that prove they pay attention to the rules and restrictions you've put in place. They can generate patches, submit them to you and eventually if they're regular and trustworthy enough, you can hand out commit access. One other point, something like Hudson may be of use here (it has a checkstyle plugin as well.) It won't prevent people committing crap code, but it can create a build and run checkstyle every so often, notifying people on a mailing list if someone screws up the code (either because it won't build or because someone's broken checkstyle rules.) Not foolproof, but this would enable you to keep an eye on things more easily.
