Font size or other formatting in RichTextBox

I am very disappointed by Silverlight's RichTextBox. I tried to use it for rich text editor, but I found that it supports only a few basic formatting properties: paragraph, endline, bold, italic, underline. And nothing else. Please, can somebody explain how is this crippled down "rich" text box meant to be used? Is it possible to add more formatting features like font size, font color, font face etc. to it without writing tons of source code in C#? I know that it is possible to add custom UIElements to it, but I don't think that is suitable for adding more text formatting capabilities. Also adding of custom UIElements render built-in import/export xaml functionality useless, as it throws out all UIElements on export. This control is so crippled and unfinished! Or am I just blind and missing something somewhere? Also, does anybody know if this control is going to be enhanced in upcoming Silverlight 5? It would be nice to have a real "rich" text box with some decent HTML export and import.
