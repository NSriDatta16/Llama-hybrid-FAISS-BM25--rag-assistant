The usual approach would be to look at the returns (i.e., log-price differences) rather than the raw prices. If the relative changes in the prices are constant (or vary around a certain constant average growth rate), then the returns will be (or vary around a) constant. And then you can either use exploratory or ad hoc approaches like the one you describe above (checking the means and standard deviations per year) or try a somewhat more formal analysis (e.g., testing and dating structural breaks).
