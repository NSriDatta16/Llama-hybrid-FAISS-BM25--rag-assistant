Yes, you can take the transformation of MCMC outputs: Presumably your initial MCMC work has given you a joint chain of values $(\log \alpha_i, \log \beta_i)$ for all $i = 1,2, ..., N$. Discarding burn-in values and taking large $N$ gives you a set of points generated from the joint posterior for those parameters. Applying the transformation of values directly to get $(\alpha_i, \beta_i)$ gives you a set of points generated from the joint posterior for those latter parameters.
