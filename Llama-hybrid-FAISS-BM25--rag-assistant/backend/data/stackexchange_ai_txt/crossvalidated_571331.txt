What type of prior to choose for one-hot encoded (dummy coded) variables in Bayesian logistic regression?

I'm going through Rethinking and Kruschke's Puppy book. After the examples I want to try myself with other data and have a problem. What if (unlike the examples in the book and online) categorical variables have no hierarchy. Thus numerical encoding feels wrong (maybe this is too traditional logistic regression thinking). If I one-hot encode them, what kind of prior would I use? I am thinking Bernoulli but my Model diverges. Thank you very much for any tips, hints and insights!
