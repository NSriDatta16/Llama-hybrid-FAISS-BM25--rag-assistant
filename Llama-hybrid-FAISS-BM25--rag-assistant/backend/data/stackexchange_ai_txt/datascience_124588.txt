Logistics or linear regression for a regression task involving outputs between 0 and 1

Problem Consider a regression task of mapping inputs $X$ to outputs $y$ where $y \in [0,1]$ . Two linear models that we can use to model this input-output relationships are logistic regression $f_\theta$ and linear regression $g_\theta$ : $$f_\theta(X) = \sigma(XW_\theta+b_\theta)$$ $$g_\theta(X) = XW_\theta+b_\theta $$ With $\sigma$ being the sigmoid function. Question In this case is there a practical or a theoretical reason for choosing one over the other? My question arises because logistic regression is mainly used for classification, but my intuition tells me it has a good property of natively producing values between 0 and 1.
