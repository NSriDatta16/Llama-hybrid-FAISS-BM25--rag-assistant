Have you tried using coverage.py ? It underlies "nose coverage", but can be run perfectly well outside of nose if you need to. If you run your tests with (hypothetically) python run_my_tests.py , then you can measure coverage with coverage run run_my_tests.py , then get HTML reports with coverage html . From your description, I'm not sure what problem you had with nose, especially whether it was a nose issue, or a coverage.py issue. Provide some more details, and I'm sure we can work through them.
