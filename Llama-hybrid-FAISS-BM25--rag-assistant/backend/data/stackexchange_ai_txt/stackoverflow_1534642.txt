iPhone SDK strange console message launchd_core_logic.c

I am running release version of the app on the iPhone, it works fine. There is no error messages in the XCode debugger: Runningâ€¦ Switching to thread 11779 Switching to thread 11779 sharedlibrary apply-load-rules all (gdb) continue Switching to thread 12291 Switching to thread 11779 Switching to thread 13059 Debugger stopped. Program exited with status value:0. However I see these messages in the console of iPhone when connect to it via Organizer: WWed Oct 7 15:37:01 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.blah.blah[0x830c]) Bug: launchd_core_logic.c:2649 (23909):10 Wed Oct 7 15:37:01 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.blah.blah[0x830c]) Working around 5020256. Assuming the job crashed. Wed Oct 7 15:37:01 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.blah.blah[0x830c]) Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault Wed Oct 7 15:37:01 unknown com.apple.debugserver-43[6124] : 1 [17ec/1603]: error: ::read ( 7, 0x28091c, 1024 ) => -1 err = Bad file descriptor (0x00000009) Wed Oct 7 15:37:01 unknown SpringBoard[25] : Application 'blah' exited abnormally with signal 11: Segmentation fault I have tried Apple's UICatalog sample and empty view based app generated by the XCode. They both report exactly the same message as my code in the console. So this is NOT my app related. There is no crash logs created, so I don't think it is a crash. What is it? Is it a problem, even though application works perfectly fine? Thanks
