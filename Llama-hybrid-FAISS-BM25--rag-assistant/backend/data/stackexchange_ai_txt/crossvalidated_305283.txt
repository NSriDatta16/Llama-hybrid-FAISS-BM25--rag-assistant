You have certainly identified an important problem and Bayesianism is one attempt at solving it. You can choose an uninformative prior if you wish. I will let others fill in more about the Bayes approach. However, in the vast majority of circumstances, you know the null is false in the population, you just don't know how big the effect is. For example, if you make up a totally ludicrous hypothesis - e.g. that a person's weight is related to whether their SSN is odd or even - and you somehow manage to get accurate information from the entire population, the two means will not be exactly equal. They will (probably) differ by some insignificant amount, but they won't match exactly. ' If you go this route, you will deemphasize p values and significance tests and spend more time looking at the estimate of effect size and its accuracy. So, if you have a very large sample, you might find that people with odd SSN weigh 0.001 pounds more than people with even SSN, and that the standard error for this estimate is 0.000001 pounds, so p
