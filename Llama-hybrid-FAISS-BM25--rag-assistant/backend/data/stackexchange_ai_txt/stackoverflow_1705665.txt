Organize a python library as plugins

I would like to create a library, say foolib, but to keep different subpackages separated, so to have barmodule, bazmodule, all under the same foolib main package. In other words, I want the client code to be able to do import foolib.barmodule import foolib.bazmodule but to distribute barmodule and bazmodule as two independent entities. Replace module with package as well... ba[rz]module can be a fukll fledged library with complex content. The reason behind this choice is manifold: I would like a user to install only barmodule if he needs so. I would like to keep the modules relatively independent and lightweight. but I would like to keep them under a common namespace. jQuery has a similar structure with the plugins. Is it feasible in python with the standard setuptools and install procedure ?
