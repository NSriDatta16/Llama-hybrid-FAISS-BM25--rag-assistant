Using Validation Set in Transfer Learning for Feature Extractor Preprocessor

I have a set of images of products. I am using transfer learning for images feature extraction in this way : I load a model (res-net, vgg) I add 2 dense layers, first one will be my features and the next one is a softmax layer for classification I freeze all the model's layer and I train the neural network for a classification I get my features by returning the result of the before last layer My question is whether to use a validation set in the training, or not.
