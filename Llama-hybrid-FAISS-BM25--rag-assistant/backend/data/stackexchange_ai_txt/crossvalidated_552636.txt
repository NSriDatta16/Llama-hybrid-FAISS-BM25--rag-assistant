Firstly, I've seen boosted GAMs being used a fair bit recently. So there is at least some variety. e.g. here and gamboost in caret . Secondly, a point that seems underemphasised here is that the base learners should be fast. In boosting you want to sequentially fit hundreds or thousands of learners, therefore each fit needs to be fast. This will be an important reason for why Gaussian Processes and large neural networks are rarely boosted.
