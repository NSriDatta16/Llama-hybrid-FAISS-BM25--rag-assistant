You should try a technique called ''ordered logistic regression''; while logistic regression has a binary outcome as the dependent variable, the ''ordered logistic regression'' has an ordered categorical outcome as the dependent variable. So if you have historical data on the $x_{ij}$ and historical data on the output class like ''no loan granted'', ''high interest loan granted'' 'low interest loan granted', ... (ordered) then you can apply ordered logistic regression. The output of the ordered logistic regression are the estimates for the $\beta$'s but also the cut-points . So using ordered logistic regression you will be able to compute a score (a probability or a real number (the log-odds of the probability)) and then it will also give you thresholds $T_1, T_2, ...$. These thresholds are estimated by the ordered logistic regression, so after estimating you know these . Using the score and the thresholds you will be able to predict the outcome i.e. one of (see supra) ''no loan granted'', ''high interest loan granted'' 'low interest loan granted', ... (ordered). E.g. It will tell you that if the score is between the thresholds $T_i=4$ and $T_{i+1}=9$ (the numbers are just examples of what the estimation may give you, so the 4 and 9 come out of the estimation) then it is ''high intrest loan granted'' (just an example of how you can predict). In R it can be done using the polr function.
