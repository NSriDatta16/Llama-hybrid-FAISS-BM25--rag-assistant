Textile on Ruby. Restrictions? Proxies?

Can I restrict a specific "rule of conversion" from Textile markup into HTML markup? What should do to prevent such a text to be converted? p Is there a convenient way (maybe by means of Redcloth?) to create a proxy for a Textile -> Proxy -> HTML conversion? In the proxy I'd like to apply the class attribute with a specific value to entered paragraphs. Any ideads/realisation?
