Here's what I ended up doing: I organized the HTML to have the pair of elements paired under a new parent for naming purposes: MsgA1 MsgA2 MsgB1 MsgB2 Each of the pair has class "flap" on it. Then I can write a function: function flip_flap(sel, cond) { /* Find sel, then show flaps within it according to cond. */ var flaps = jQuery(sel + ">.flap"); var f0 = jQuery(flaps[0]); (cond ? f0.show() : f0.hide()); var f1 = jQuery(flaps[1]); (cond ? f1.hide() : f1.show()); } I liked the idea of using toggle(), but unfortunately, it doesn't work for inline elements, only block level, and I needed to use spans. Then I can replace my original Javascript with: flip_flap("#first_flap", conditionA); flip_flap("#second_flap", conditionB); Much more concise! Thanks.
