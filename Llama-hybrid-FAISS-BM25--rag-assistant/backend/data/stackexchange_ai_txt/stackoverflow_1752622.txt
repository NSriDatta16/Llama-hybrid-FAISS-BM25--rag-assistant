How to handle "order" of a list of items in DB (php)

I would like my client to be able to order items in the backend. I figured the easiest way to do it is to have the database table for an item have a field called "order" which gets a value. This is a value the client puts in. Then I can just run SQL queries ordering by the "order" field. Right now I have it very simple.. there is no logic.. so the user would put in order=100 for one item and order=200 for another.. and the one with the lower value would get listed first. Is there a more elegant way of doing this? I am thinking of something like "move up" and "move down". etc. I am trying to make administrating items more convenient. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
