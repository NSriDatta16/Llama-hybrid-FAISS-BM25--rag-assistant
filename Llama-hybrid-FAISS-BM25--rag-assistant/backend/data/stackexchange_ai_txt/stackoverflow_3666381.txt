ASP.NET MVC 2 - Organizing

I'm having a ASP.NET MVC 2 Project where I'm making some management system... The thing is that I have 4-5 controllers that are all related to a specific thing in the management system and having 4-5 diffrent view folders dosent make it any easier.. Any suggestions? Since its "a part" of the management system I dont really see how I can make use of areas. All ideas welcome. UPDATE: For example I have a thing in my management system called "Product Management", this thing have following controllers attached: CategoriesController = Add/Delete/Edit categories. ProductsController = Add/Delete/Edit products in categories. OrdersController = Add/Delete/Edit orders from users. Seems like a waste that I need to create 3 diffrent view folders for those controllers.. Would be much easier if I could create a folder under the "Views" named "Product Management" and then just create a sub folder for each controller...
