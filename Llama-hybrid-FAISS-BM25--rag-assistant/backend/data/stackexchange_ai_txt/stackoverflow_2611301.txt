The "forever" loop is popular in embedded systems as a background loop. Some people implement it as: for (; ;) { // Stuff done in background loop } And sometimes it is implemented as: while (TRUE /* or use 1 */) { // Stuff done in background loop } And yet another implementation is: do { // Stuff done in background loop } while (1 /* or TRUE */); An optimizing compiler should generate the same or similar assembly code for these fragments. One important note: the execution time for the loops is not a big concern since these loops go on forever, and more time is spent in the processing section.
