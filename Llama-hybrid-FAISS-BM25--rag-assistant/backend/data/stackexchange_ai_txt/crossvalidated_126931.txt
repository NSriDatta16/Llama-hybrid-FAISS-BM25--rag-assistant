How many individuals must be measured to determine the true mean?

I saw this was asked earlier, but I also have the same question. This was the question: "Anatomy: The human height is the distance from head to toe. When populations share a genetic background and other environmental factors such as diet, the average height is frequently characteristic within a group. In a large group of Caucasians, how many individuals must be measured to determine the true mean height of a male within 0.5 inches at the 10% level of significance, given that the standard deviation is 1.5 inches." What I'm confused about is the 10% level of significance...this is not the confidence level is it? I'm also going to assume the 0.5 is the interval of confidence as in plus/minus 0.5? Should I be using this equation: $n > (\frac{\sigma \frac{z_\alpha}{2})}{E})^2 $? Any help/pointers would be appreciated! EDIT: would the E value be the 0.5? and the 10% is alpha, making $\frac{\alpha}{2}= 0.05$ giving it a Z score of 1.65? $$n > \frac{(1.65)(1.5)}{0.5}$$ $$n > 4.95$$ ?
