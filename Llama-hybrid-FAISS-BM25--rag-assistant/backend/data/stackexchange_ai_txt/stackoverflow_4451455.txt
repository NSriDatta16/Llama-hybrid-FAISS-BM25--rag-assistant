SQLite drives the sqlite.org web site and others that have lots of traffic. They suggest that if you have less than 100k hits per day, SQLite should work fine. And that was written before they delivered the "Writeahead Logging" feature. If you want to speed things up with SQLite, do the following: upgrade to SQLite 3.7.x Enable write-ahead logging Run the following pragma: "PRAGMA cache_size = Number-of-pages;" The default size (Number-of-pages) is 2000 pages, but if you raise that number, then you will raise the amount of data that is running straight out of memory. You may want to take a look at my video on YouTube called " Improve SQLite Performance With Writeahead Logging " which shows how to use write-ahead logging and demonstrates a 5x speed improvement for writes.
