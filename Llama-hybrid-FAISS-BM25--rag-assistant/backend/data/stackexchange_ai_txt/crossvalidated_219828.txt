Interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression output

I am doing logistic regression in R on a binary dependent variable with only one independent variable. I found the odd ratio as 0.99 for an outcomes. This can be shown in following. Odds ratio is defined as, $ratio_{odds}(H) = \frac{P(X=H)}{1-P(X=H)}$. As given earlier $ratio_{odds} (H) = 0.99$ which implies that $P(X=H) = 0.497$ which is close to 50% probability. This implies that the probability for having a H cases or non H cases 50% under the given condition of independent variable. This does not seem realistic from the data as only ~20% are found as H cases. Please give clarifications and proper explanations of this kind of cases in logistic regression. I am hereby adding the results of my model output: M1 |z|) (Intercept) 1.6416666 0.2290133 7.168 7.59e-13 *** X -0.0014039 0.0009466 -1.483 0.138 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1101.1 on 1070 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1098.9 on 1069 degrees of freedom (667 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 1102.9 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 exp(cbind(OR=coef(M1), confint(M1))) Waiting for profiling to be done...

There are 19.95% fall in (H=0) category and remaining are in (H=1) category. Further this binomial dependent variable compare with the covariate X whose minimum value is 82.23, mean value is 223.8 and maximum value is 391.6. The 667 missing values correspond to the covariate X i.e 667 data for X is missing in the dataset out of 1738 data.
