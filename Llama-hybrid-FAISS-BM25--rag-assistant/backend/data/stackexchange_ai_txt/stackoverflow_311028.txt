Tiles are just fragments of one html page. There's no notion of ajax unless you manually add it. Therefor: Pressing 4 buttons on one page would be the same as clicking 4 links on any html page. The browser will send the appropriate request to the server. When the server answers very quickly, you wouldn't even have time to press the second button. When it's slow enough, the first request (browser to server) would be cancelled and the second (third, fourth) would be sent (and cancelled with the next button pressed). The rest depends upon the backend implementation: At some point in time the server will notice that it cannot send back data for 3 of the 4 requests. What will be served/displayed in the last (open) response also depends upon your implementation. If there's some server side state holding the web services response, all 4 results might show up. If one web service hasn't returned yet, only 3 results and one old tile might show up.
