Kanbanish visualization and workflow management for multi-project, multi-team department

I'm trying to think of a simple (and agile in nature) way to visualize a large department's work and bottlenecks, with the idea of gradually improving the process once we have the necessary data. The problem is that we have multiple groups of developers working on multiple projects. Some developers are cross-project and some projects are cross-team. Developers are very set in their ways (we don't want to force C# or Java developers to learn Delphi 6 during pair programming). Another issue is that a very small QA team is shared between all developers/projects. I need ideas for how to organize a Kanban (or similar) taskboard so that stories are categorized by project (or team?) but that the WIP limits are still applied across the board. Also, how would the standup meetings go? Including everyone in a single meeting would take up too much time and result in information overload, but splitting the meeting makes us lose out on a lot of the transparency that agile enforces. So, any ideas related to taskboards and standup meetings are welcome. Also, alternatives to Kanban with the same level of prescription as Kanban (in other words not much) are very welcome.
