If every user with a page open is requesting loadmore.php every second, you'll quickly bring the server to its knees (assuming you have more than a couple users). Think of it this way: if the average user clicks a link every minute or two, you're increasing server load by 60-120 times. You're much better off using XMLHttpRequest from AJAX to load dynamic content. You shouldn't need to make a call every second to get responsive updates, no matter what technology you decide to use.
