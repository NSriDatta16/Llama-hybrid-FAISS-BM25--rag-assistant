Can selectable jquery ui be forced to select in order

I want to use jQuery's (or something similar) selectable functionality: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/#display-grid . However, I would like to be able to force selections. For example, for the grid, if a user starts at 1 and drags to item 6 only 1,2,5, and 6 are selected. However, I want 3 and 4 to be selected because they are between 1 and 6 (the start and stop points). Couldn't find any implementation of this online. Thanks.
