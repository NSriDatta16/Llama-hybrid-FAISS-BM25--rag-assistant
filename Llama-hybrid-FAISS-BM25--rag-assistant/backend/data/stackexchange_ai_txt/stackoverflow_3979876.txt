Here is the answer. After trying a lot of different paths, it is definitely the MasterPage that frags the post to Authorize.net. I tried re-"name"ing the controls among several other things and for time conisderations I gave up trying to resolve the issue and just reformatted the page to not use my masterpage file. I am also building a silverlight e-commerce solution and I am a little concerned that I will not be able to use authorize.net for the same reason.
