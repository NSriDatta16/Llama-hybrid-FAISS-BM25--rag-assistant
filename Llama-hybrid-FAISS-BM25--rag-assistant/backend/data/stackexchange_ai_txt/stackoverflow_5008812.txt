Does the LGPL differentiate between linking dynamically and statically? I don't think so. The library code (i.e. embedding your own SSH implementation) looks most versatile to me. Except the fact that you might inherit security problems. On MacOSX/Linux/Unix, you can simply invoke 'ssh' and assume it exists (or make it as a precondition). On Windows, you would rely on putty and friends. I don't think that's a good idea.
