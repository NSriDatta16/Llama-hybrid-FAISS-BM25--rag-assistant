I am also learning the SVM and a novice. In your case, this is my thought: Initially you had two points (X,Y) in 2D space. When you transform into feature space(3D in your case), I believe you don't have to add X 2 term to the existing variable. The X 2 term is an extra coordinate to identify your 2 D points in 3 D. Here X 2 can be considered as a point in 3rd axis to identify the points in 2D. The way I understood the relation between feature space and original dimension is by the following example. Consider you want to create separation between two gender(Male and Female) by their age and height. You can easily plot them 2D. But on plotting you see that the separation between these two genders are not clear. So we transform it to feature space. By saying feature space, I mean that probably we can find a weight in 3D or an extra parameter in another dimension so that we can distinguish between the the two classes. Here weight can be considered as a feature. You are including a third coordinate along with your existing 2 coordinate and asking how to draw a separation among these three coordinate which I think is not the right way to interpret. You still be having two classes in third dimension but your third coordinate might help you to distinguish the two classes by drawing better plane. In this case X 2 .
