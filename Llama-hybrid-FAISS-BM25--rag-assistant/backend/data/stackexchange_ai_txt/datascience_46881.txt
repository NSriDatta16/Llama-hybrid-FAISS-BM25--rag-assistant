Why do we choose principal components based on maximum variance explained?

I've seen many people choose # of principal components for PCA based on maximum variance explained. So my question is do we always have to choose principal components based on maximum variance explained? Is it applicable for all scenarios i.e text count vectors(BoW, tfidf..) where number of dimensions are really high. Does maximum variance means most information about my data in higher dimension is captured into lower dimension? Usually I'd plot something like this to see the variance explained. plt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)) plt.xlabel('Principal Components') plt.ylabel('Variance ratio') plt.show()
