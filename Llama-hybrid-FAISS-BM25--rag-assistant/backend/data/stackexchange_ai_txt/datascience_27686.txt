What is the relationship between AI and data science?

I think they share a lot (e.g. machine learning is a subset of both, right?), but maybe both have elements the other doesn't have? Could you name some in that case? Or is one a subset of the other? What is the relationship between AI and data science? For example, when it comes to the relationship of AI and ML, I always say AI is a superset of ML. And the distinguishing set is search algorithms, which I would include in AI but not in ML. Would search algorithms be included in data science?
