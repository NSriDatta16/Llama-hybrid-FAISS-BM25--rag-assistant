If session.connect() is now deprecated, how am I supposed to do that? You have to use Session#doWork(Work) and the Work API, as mentioned in the Javadoc: connection() Deprecated. (scheduled for removal in 4.x). Replacement depends on need; for doing direct JDBC stuff use doWork(org.hibernate.jdbc.Work) ; for opening a 'temporary Session' use (TBD). You have some time before Hibernate 4.x but, well, using a deprecated API somehow looks like this: :) Update: According to RE: [hibernate-dev] Connection proxying on the hibernate-dev list, it seems that the initial intention of the deprecation was to discourage the use of Session#connection() because it was/is considered as a "bad" API, but it was supposed to stay at that time. I guess they changed their mind...
