I ran into this problem with MVC V1 and xVal. I ended up using "buddy classes" as detailed here Schotime (google cache as he's having website problems). It works great for me, but I'm not familiar with MVC v2's method of doing this to know if its routines will "pick up" the metadata in your buddy classes. It's hard to argue with anybody who starts with "everybody has a different opinion", but I'd be loathe to modify the generated files for LINQ. I see the point about a scaffold, but when I'm in development I'm making so many changes to my db (and relationships) that I frequently drop a class and recreate by dragging the table back over. Sometimes I remove all classes and drag the entire db over. On the other hand, I guess this is evidence of poor planning on my part.
