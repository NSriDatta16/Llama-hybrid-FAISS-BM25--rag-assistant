GQL: is myList.contains(myField) any faster than 30 separate myField == myList(i) queries?

I've got a list with 100 Longs in it, and an Entity kind with a Long field. I want to find all the entities whose field value is in the list. I was thinking, "Great! I'll just write where :p1.contains(field) ," but AppEngine will only split this out on less than 31 elements (new Baskin Robbins' slogan?). So, now I'm thinking I'll have to split the list of 100 into multiple lists of 30. But at this point, my hopes of a one-liner shot, I realized I could do something like for (Long number : list) GQL("select * from Kind where field = " + number) essentially splitting into all the subqueries myself. My question is... is this equivalent to letting appengine split my list of 30 into 30 separate queries? Or is there some back-end magic they do to fetch all 30 sub-queries simultaneously?
