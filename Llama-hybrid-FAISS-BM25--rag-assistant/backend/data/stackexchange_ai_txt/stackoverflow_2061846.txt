Unfortunately this is a known bug in the DragPanelExtender. I would recommend dropping the modal extender all together if it's an option and you're comfortable with javascript. With jQuery/jQuery UI for example, your page would look like: Clicking the button will bring up the modal dialog $(function() { $("# ").click() { $("#myModal").dialog({ buttons: { "Ok": function() { $(this).dialog("close"); } } }); } }); This is a whole different way of programming, but results in a much richer UI experience for the user. If you're willing to learn jQuery and how it hooks up, it's a really natural/fluid syntax that can add a great deal of power/flexibility to your web pages. Now keep in mind that I prefer jQuery but that there are many other javascript libraries available . You should at least browse around and see what looks the most comfortable if you're just getting started...it's possible since you're from a VB background (I'm from C#) that another libraries coding style/syntax is much more appealing. Now if you're unwilling to go down that road and it's too unfamiliar, your only alternative as far as I can see is to do what you don't want to...compile the AJAX Control Toolkit yourself. If you want to go this route, grab the latest source from codeplex and modify the below section of Release\AjaxControlToolkit\Compat\DragDrop\DragDropScripts.js : _drag: function(isInitialDrag) { var ev = window._event; var mousePosition = { x: ev.clientX, y: ev.clientY }; To this: _drag: function(isInitialDrag) { if (!this._activeDragVisual) return; var ev = window._event; var mousePosition = { x: ev.clientX, y: ev.clientY }; The _onScrollerTick operation in certain browsers bombs out and nulls the dragVisual function. Credit is due here : A post on the ASP.Net forums by freakyer led me down this debug path to figure out where it's breaking...but I see no other solution as there is an actual bug in certain browsers not-fixable without a script change and recompile. I urge you to consider the jQuery/other framework path, there's a ton of community support and examples out there to help get you started. This question from a while back is worth a read if the framework options interest you at all.
