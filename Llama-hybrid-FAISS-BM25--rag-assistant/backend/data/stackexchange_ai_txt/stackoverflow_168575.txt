Call Web Services Using Ajax or Silverlight? Which performs best?

I'm building an ASP.NET AJAX application that uses JavaScript to call web services to get its data, and also uses Silverlights Isolated Storage to cache the data on the client machine. Ultimately once the data is downloaded it is passed to JavaScript which displays in on the page using the HTML DOM. What I'm trying to figure out is, does it make sense for me to make these Web Service calls in Silverlight then pass the data to JavaScript once it's loaded? Also, Silverlight will be saving the data to disk using Isolated Storage whether I call the Web Services with JavaScript or Silverlight. If I call the Web Services with JavaScript, the data will be passed to Silverlight to cache. I've done some prototyping both ways, and I'm finding the performance to pretty much be the same either way. Also, one of the kickers that is pointing me towards using Silverlight for the whole client-side data access layer, is I need to have timers periodically check for updated data and download it to the cache so the JavaScript can loading when it needs to. Has anyone done anything similar to this? If so, what are your experiences relating to performance with either the JavaScript or Silverlight method described?
