A few things to mention here... I would recommend using actual "locales" (a language code plus country code ) to reference your languages rather than your two letter country code. Your example includes "fr" for French. Typical convention is to use locale names instead. For example fr_FR for French (France) and fr_CA for French (Canadien). Language can very greatly based on country (if you're a native US English speaker and take a trip to Australia, you'll understand what I'm talking about). Depending on the size of your site, you probably don't want to keep this as a PHP dictionary/assoc array. There are lots of options here (putting translations in a database, shared memory, etc.). If you do keep it in PHP memory, opcode caching would be a great idea and is relatively easy to setup. I would encourage you to look at how other frameworks achieve this (and ideally maybe use an existing framework to achieve this). You mention translating "words". Generally, when internationalizing a site, you want to translate phrases. Translating words and then gluing them together typically results in poor translations. If you do stick with the dict route, I would highly encourage you to drop the dynamic interpretation of the the variable name/language name in favor of a nested associative array. For example $dict['fr_FR']['hello'] = 'bonjour';
