From what is described it appears you have computed some bootstrap prediction intervals through the "bootstrap pairs" procedure; "bootstrap residuals" procedures are more common but what you did is perfectly fine too (albeit more expensive). I think that looking into a reference like Khosravi et al. (2011) Comprehensive Review of Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals and New Advances will be very helpful. The author explore a number of different ways to get prediction intervals from core ML algorithms (Delta, Mean-Variance Estimation, Bayesian and Bootstrap Methods). Finally to answer your side question directly: Yes, the mean value of those 10K estimates will be very close to the prediction of the single XGBoost model.
