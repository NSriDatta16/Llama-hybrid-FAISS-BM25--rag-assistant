What is the correct way to average random variables and get correct quantiles

Say I have two random variables $A$ and $B$ which may or may not be independent. I also have their $0.95$ quantiles $Q95_A$ and $Q95_B$ . What is a valid way to average these densities and obtain valid quantiles? Example Use Case I am able to get draws from $A$ and $B$ . In reality these random variables are probabilistic forecasting methods. I would like to obtain a combination forecast by averaging these densities. More Clairity - Is this a question about mixture densities or about convolution operations? From the wikipedia page on mixture distributions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_distribution there is a distinction between when one would desire a mixture distribution vs a convolution operation. Mixture densities are used when the the random variable's density is the sum of components Convolution operators are used when the random variable's value is the sum of the underlying random variable values. An example is given on the wikipedia page As an example, the sum of two jointly normally distributed random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution. On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution. The goal here is convolution not a mixture density.
