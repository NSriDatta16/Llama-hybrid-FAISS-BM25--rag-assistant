Why could an overfitted CNN model have a higher validation accuracy?

I am currently training a CNN model by using cifar10 images (50000 for training, another 10000 for validation). I plot training loss, validation loss and accuracy against training iteration: I am not sure when should I stop the training, should I stop it at around iteration 1250, since overfitting happens beyond that point? Or should I stop it at around iteration 5000, since I can get the maximum validation accuracy? Why can the overfitted model have a higher validation accuracy?
