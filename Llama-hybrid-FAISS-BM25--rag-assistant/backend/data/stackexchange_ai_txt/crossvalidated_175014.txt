If I understand your question correctly, you have predicted the probability for each individual, but want to know the average probability of a segment of those individuals? For instance you have 1000 individuals with the average rate of 65% but only 300 have blue eyes, what is the average rate of those with blue eyes? Then you can simply average your estimated probabilities for those with blue eyes.
