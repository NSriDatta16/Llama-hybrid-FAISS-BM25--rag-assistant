If you imagine XY trend then Data Fields will be Y coordinates, Category Fields will be X coordinates and Series Fields will be values for grouping data in different lines. Talking about chart, usually Data Fields are for values, Category Fields are for dates and Series Fields may be products or departments. Category and Series Fields may be switched but usually fields with a lesser amount of descent values are chosen for Series Fields.
