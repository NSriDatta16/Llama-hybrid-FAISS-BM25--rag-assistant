Based on what @Jind≈ôich replied above, I made another literature survey. I found an architecture schema for Transformer-XL from the paper Language Modelling for Source Code Using Transformer-XL which I copy here to serve as a reference/guide for those with the same question in future: Note that the paper doesn't appear to be peer-reviewed yet. So corrections (if any) suggested by the readers are most welcome.
