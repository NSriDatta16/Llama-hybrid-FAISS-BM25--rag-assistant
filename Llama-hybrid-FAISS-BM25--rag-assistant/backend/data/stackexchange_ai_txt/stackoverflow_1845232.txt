How to fight flooding for a website?

I know,time restriction implementation as adopted on stackoverflow.com is a way to fight flooding. But sometimes I really want to input another message soon after I input a previous one and I want to wait until the time restriction is lifted. Is there other elegant way to fight flooding?
