If all your visitors happen to use modern browsers then you can use sessionStorage. Session storage works like a JavaScript object that persists between requests for as long as the window remains (or until you delete the data manually). Javascript example: sessionStorage.varName = 3;. It works in at least Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
