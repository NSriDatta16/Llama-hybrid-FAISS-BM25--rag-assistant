The advantage of studentized residuals is that they have a known (t with N - k - 1 df) distribution, hence you can do significance tests of the residuals. You can't do that with regular residuals (or standardized residuals). If you want to do visual inspection to look for outliers and leverage points, regular residuals are fine.
