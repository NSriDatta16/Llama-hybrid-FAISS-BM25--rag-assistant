I answer to my own question, thanks to PhiLho who put me on the right track: an article from Codeproject with the right algorithm to get a window icon (wether it's java or not): //first, try: SendMessageTimeout(WM_GETICON) //if no icon found, try GetClassLong(GCL_HICONSM) //if still no icon, try SendMessageTimeout(WM_WM_QUERYDRAGICON) //if still no icon, you're doomed, return an error, or a void icon For some reason a java app answers to the first call, but not to the others, which seems to be handled by javaw.exe. Thanks again PhiLho.
