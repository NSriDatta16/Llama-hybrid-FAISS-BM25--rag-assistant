Looks like the debug build is linked against both debug and release runtimes which would be a very bad thing -- you haven't included either in the list of libraries you're linking against -- might be worth checking though Edit: Might also be worth checking for any #pragma comment (lib...) statements which can force the linker to include an additional library, causing potential conflicts (see also documentation on MSDN )
