Detecting Taps on a subview in UIScrollView *and* ignoring pan gestures

I have displaying image thumbnails in a UIScrollView , if user taps on a thumbnail, the application should open that image. if, however, user drags on a thumb, the scroll view should pan. Right now the scrollview only scrolls if user is able to drag on the small empty space between the thumbnails. the subviews (the one's displaying image thumbs) use a UITapGestureRecognizer to detect taps, and exclusiveTouch on subviews is set to NO , UIScrollView has its canCancelContentTouches set to false.
