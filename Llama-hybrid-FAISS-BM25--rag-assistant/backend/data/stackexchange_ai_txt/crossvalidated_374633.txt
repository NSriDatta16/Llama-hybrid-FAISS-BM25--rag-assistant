Increasing the sample size decreases the width of confidence intervals because it decreases the standard error and approaches towards original dataset. As long as we're talking about a CI for a population percentage. The standard error for a population percentage has the square root of the sample size in the denominator. Hence, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4 (i.e., multiplying it by 4) is equivalent to multiplying the standard error by 1/2. Hence, the interval will be half as wide. This also works approximately for population averages as long as the multiplier from the t-curve doesn't change much when increasing the sample size (which it won't if the original sample size is large). Thus, given exponential distribution parameter- Î¼ have lower C.I. for larger sample size. Here with the larger differences in sizes of datasets, you might want to play with the significance level. I would suggest using 99% C.I. for the smaller dataset and 90% C.I. for the larger dataset then see the difference in width and overlapping in groups.
