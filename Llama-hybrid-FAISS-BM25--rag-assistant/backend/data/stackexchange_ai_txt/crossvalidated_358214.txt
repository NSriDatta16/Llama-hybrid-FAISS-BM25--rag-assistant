NLP: any classification method about sentence semantics, sentence completeness, and question generation?

I come across some interesting areas in natural language processing (NLP) and I am trying to find resources on them. Do you know is there any existing method/research on these NLP areas: sentence completeness: whether a sentence is a complete sentence. e.g., "I am a boy" vs "I am boy" OR "Who are you?" vs "Who you?" semantic classification: whether the sentence make sense. e.g., "The dog run" vs "The dog flies" question generation: can I generate questions from a sentence. e.g., "I am a King and I rule the space." --> "Who is King?" "Can king rule the space?" Thanks!
