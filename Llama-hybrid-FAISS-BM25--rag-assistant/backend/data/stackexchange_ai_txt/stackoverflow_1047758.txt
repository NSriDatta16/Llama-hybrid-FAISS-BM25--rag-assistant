What can be alternative metrics to code coverage?

Code coverage is propably the most controversial code metric. Some say, you have to reach 80% code coverage, other say, it's superficial and does not say anything about your testing quality. (See Jon Limjap's good answer on "What is a reasonable code coverage % for unit tests (and why)?" .) People tend to measure everything. They need comparisons, benchmarks etc. Project teams need a pointer, how good their testing is. So what are alternatives to code coverage? What would be a good metric that says more than "I touched this line of code"? Are there real alternatives?
