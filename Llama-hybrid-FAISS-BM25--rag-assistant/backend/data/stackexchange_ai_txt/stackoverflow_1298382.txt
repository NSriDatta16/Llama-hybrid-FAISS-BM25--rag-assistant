DeepZoom is a feature of the Silverlight 3 product, and helped by the free Deep Zoom Composer application. The Silverlight platform is open for anyone to build applications on top of, so go at it and build something great! For the second part, I'm a little unsure. As far as I can tell, the SeaDragon AJAX is more of a "backup" plan, and being part of the Live Labs, might not be as well supported as a fully released product. However, there's nothing on the site to indicate that it cannot be used on a commercial site, other than the typical Live terms.
