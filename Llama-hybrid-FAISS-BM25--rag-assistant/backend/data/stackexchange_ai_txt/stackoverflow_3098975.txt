Giving a WPF treview to do Richtext (Xaml) displaying and editing and drag drop

To give the ability to display and edit Richtext (Xaml) inside a treeview item,I have used a bindable Richtextbox (custom user control that used a richtextbox) to the HierachicalDataTemplate that used to populate the TreeViewItems. This works fine but at the same time I want to have the drag and grop functionality in the treeview. My problem is when I click on the richtextbox (inside the treeviewitem) and do a drag it will do the richtextbox content dragging. What I want is to drag the treeviewitem insted (fire the drag and drop events of the treeviewitem). NOTE: If I used a textblock this can be done but can't display richtext. Any Help?
