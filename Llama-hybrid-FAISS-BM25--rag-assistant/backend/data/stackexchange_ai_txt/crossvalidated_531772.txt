How does na.pass treat NA in irregular time series?

I cannot figure out how na.pass in the acf function in R addresses NAs. For example: a I get the following results: > a$acf , , 1 [,1] [1,] 1.0000000 [2,] NA [3,] -0.3333333 To be honest I really couldn't get the value -0.3333333. I am so confused about how the function treats NA in the very bottom? The original equation is: But what is the equation for an irregular time series? (I don't want to use na.exclude , I want to keep the NAs in my data!) Thanks!
