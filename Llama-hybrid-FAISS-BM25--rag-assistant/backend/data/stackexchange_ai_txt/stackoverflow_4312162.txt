Facebook like or share with dynamic document title

I found this problem all over the net but no answer yet, so maybe here someone solved it ...? I built a page relying heavily on jquery.address. It's got one index page and the rest loads dynamically via Ajax following Google's /#!/ scheme for crawlable pages. Now I want to add Facebooks Like or share button but I can't get it to grab the actual page title or url. Whatever I do, it always falls back to title and url of the index page. It tried: (obviously) changing title an openGraph meta on load of the new parts. "linking" the crawler page ( ?_escaped_fragmet_=xyx ) but specifying the #! page in meta "sharing" with a given title and url. I never get anything but a link to the index page or a blank "share" to the right url with title and thumbnail ignored. Has anyone got a similar setup working? Thanks for any hints, thomas
