You could certainly perform a permutation test (of the null that the two are uncorrelated) in the manner you suggest, but you wouldn't normally "use that distribution to get a confidence interval" for the correlation. You would instead use that distribution to get a p-value, or an acceptance (/rejection) region. You could use another resampling approach - the bootstrap - to get an interval for the correlation, but that, too, is justified by large-sample arguments and may not get all that close to the desired coverage in small samples. However, if your data are strongly non-normal, it's pretty common for the relationship between variables to be curved rather than linear. You might want to consider monotonic rather than linear association. In that case there are several measures of monotonic association (i.e. 'do the variables move up/down together?' type questions) that don't have normality assumptions required to test them. What are you testing correlation for? (i.e. what's the aim here? What are you trying to figure out?)
