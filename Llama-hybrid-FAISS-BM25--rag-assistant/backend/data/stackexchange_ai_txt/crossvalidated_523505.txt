This may be off-topic, but some metrics, like the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) do provide one with the kind of information you describe in your post. For example, if I measure the height of 100 men and 78 women and compute an AUC of 0.7 with men being taller on average, then this implies that if I tell you the height of a new person you can say with 70% probability of being correct the gender of the new person.
