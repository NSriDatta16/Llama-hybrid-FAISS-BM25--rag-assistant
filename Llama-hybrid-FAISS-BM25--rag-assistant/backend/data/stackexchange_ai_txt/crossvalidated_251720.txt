How to calculate the logLik of a linear model acquired through matrix operations

If you were to run a linear model with the lm function, it is easy to obtain the log liklihood of the fit with the following: lm1 However, how would one calculate the log likelihood of a model fit through matrix operations? As there seems to be no defined method in logLik for this. x "To assessing the overall quality of the model, We can look at the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These can be used to compare the performance of different models for a given set of data." > AIC(fit) [1] 263.8177 > BIC(fit) [1] 271.6332 > logLik(fit) 'log Lik.' -128.9088 (df=3) Source: https://www.r-bloggers.com/fitting-a-model-by-maximum-likelihood/ One of my aims is compare multiple models of the same data and need the logLik or eqv of the model fit through matrix operations.
