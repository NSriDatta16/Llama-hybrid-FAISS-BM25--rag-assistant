How to add multiple handlers to an attached event in XAML?

Code Sample: .... I want to add 2 handlers to a particular event like shown above. However this won't compile - 'attribute can be set more than once'. I have multiple methods because they do different things (are named appropriately). e.g. the first handler has nothing in common with the second. My other option was to kludge a SetFlagForCursorTrackingAndCheckForViewLink method - which is "Yech!". Any ideas ?
