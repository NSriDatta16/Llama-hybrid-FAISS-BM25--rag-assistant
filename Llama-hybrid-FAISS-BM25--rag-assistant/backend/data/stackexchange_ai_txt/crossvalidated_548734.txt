It would be useful to provide the loss over time for both training and testing data set. From your description, it seems like you can minimize the training loss, but the testing performance is not going well. If that is the case, try to regularize the model more. One useful approach is doing data argumentation more. From the comments, it seems we have problems even with training data, then it is not overfitting but under-fitting issue. Try to increase the network complexity. Also you can read this post What should I do when my neural network doesn't learn?
