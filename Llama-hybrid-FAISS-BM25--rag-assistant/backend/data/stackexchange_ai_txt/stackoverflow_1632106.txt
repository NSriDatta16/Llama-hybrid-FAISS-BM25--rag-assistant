Algorithm for effective connection resource management

difficult to look this up if it has been asked previously since I don't know the name for it. So here goes: I'm making this server which connects to messaging gateways in order to send msgs. A session with this gateway requires a username/password combo. This way the gateway knows who to bill. Now I could have thousands of messages queued up to send, belonging for instance to 5 different username/password combos. However, the gateway is restricted that I only have say 2 connections open at the same time. So effectively it is a question of supply and demand with constraints: I have a gateway which can only handle N concurrent connections (username/pw combo) I have X messages stacked up belonging to Y different of these connections how do I, in a nice and clean way, efficiently manage these connections so that they sometimes give breathing space for other connections, perhaps even take into account priority, perhaps even allow multiple connections with the same username/password for extra speed (if it doesn't sit in the way of other queued connections) Does anyone have a clue what kind of algorithms exist for this? So I can google for it. Or perhaps someone already can give me some pointers. I've given a few stabs at it myself, but I feel I'm still not yet creating an elegant solution, but somehow endup in long nested if statements thanks
