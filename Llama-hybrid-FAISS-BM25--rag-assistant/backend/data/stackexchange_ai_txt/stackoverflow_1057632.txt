SQLite is not written in Java so, what you're asking for is either making it available as a non-standard Java API, via some JNI-like interface or translating most of the SQLite source code into pure java code that would presumably use a JSR75 file connection for storage. The first solution is tantamount to adding a new JSR to the J2ME implementation on the phone, which is usually very hard if not impossible if you're not the phone manufacturer or one of its close partners. While I haven't looked at that specific part of the source code yet, I suspect this is how the Android platform allows Java developers to use SQLite. As far as I know, the second solution hasn't been implemented yet (or at least it hasn't been made public) so would require quite some work on your part to make it work. I would be worried about the performance implications of moving SQLite to an interpreted language with very little control on file access performance.
