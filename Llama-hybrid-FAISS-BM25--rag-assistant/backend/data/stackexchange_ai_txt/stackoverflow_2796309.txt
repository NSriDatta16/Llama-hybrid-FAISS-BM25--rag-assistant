Zend Framework: Surviving The Deep End has some good sections explaining MVC. Check out the MCV Intro and especially this seciton on the model . There are numerous interpretations of the Model but for many programmers the Model is equated with data access, a misconception most frameworks inadvertently promote by not obviously acknowledging that they do not provide full Models. In our buzzword inundated community, many frameworks leave the definition of the Model unclear and obscured in their documentation. To answer "where's the controller": Controllers must define application behaviour only in the sense that they map input from the UI onto calls in Models and handle client interaction, but beyond that role it should be clear all other application logic is contained within the Model. Controllers are lowly creatures with minimal code who just set the stage and let things work in an organised fashion for the environment the application operates in. I think you'll fine it (and his references of other articles and books) a good read.
