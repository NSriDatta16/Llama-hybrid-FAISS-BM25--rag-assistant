Yes there is a way to do this. The output between item 1-5 and item 6-10 (assuming they're 2 groups) will yield a 2x2 table of 'classification1' and 'classification2', followed by 0 or 1. The problem then becomes very similar to this question here: Testing binary data Likely since machine learning is involved I assume the data set will be pretty big (N>1000) so significance testing here would lose a lot of its meaning because even minimal differences are significant. Therefore I suggest looking closer to statistical power such as Phi Ï† , which would be done with the Chi Square. So if there is a difference in significance you can know how large this difference is.
