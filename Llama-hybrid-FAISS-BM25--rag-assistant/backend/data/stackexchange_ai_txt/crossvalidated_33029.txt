How to measure smoothness of a time series in Excel?

I've found how to measure the smoothness of a time series in R from this previous CV question , and I think I understand it, but I don't have access to R, only to Excel. How would I calculate this? Given this formula for a normalized version of smoothness: sd(diff(x))/abs(mean(diff(x))) How do I calculate the diff() portion in Excel, since that is the part I am stuck on?
