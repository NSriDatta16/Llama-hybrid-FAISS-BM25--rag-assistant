Answer in comments by @Juho Kokkala : flag I am not sure if I understand your question - perhaps you could just do MCMC sampling from p(α,β∣D) and discard the βs? See answers to stats.stackexchange.com/questions/125570 stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134027 ? "Thank you! It hadn't occurred to be that by sampling from the joint density you could very cheaply find the marginal. I think this solves it. "
