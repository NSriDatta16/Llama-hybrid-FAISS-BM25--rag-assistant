You first need to preprocess your text to convert it into features that can be consumed by a machine learning algorithm. Then you can try this algorithm (a classifier, in this case) with the known examples you have. Then you can use that trained model to recognise logs it hasn't seen before. If you don't have a preference of language you'd like to use, python with the scikit-learn library would be a good start. For your problem, work through this tutorial which is very similar to what you're trying to achieve: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html
