SHA256 or SHA384 for password hashing . I've heard that some US organisations' policies disallow software components using SHA with higher bit length, but that depends. Avoid MDx for hashing secure things like passwords if you can use SHA. See Is MD5 really that bad? CRCxx is for checksums, they're bad for hashes as their value range is much smaller. The others, I don't know about their use-cases.
