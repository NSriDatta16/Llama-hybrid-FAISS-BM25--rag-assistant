Embedded Wordpress Feature - What do I Need?

I would like to create a feature that would allow Wordpress users to be able to insert this into their blog posts: Car Title (heading) Car Description (paragraph) Photograph of car (image) List of items (bullet list) Steps for how to assemble car parts (e.g. a gearbox) (heading, paragraph, heading, paragraph...) It should be really easy for users to insert into their blog post. Is this possible? If so, what would I need to develop for this - a plugin, widget, other?
