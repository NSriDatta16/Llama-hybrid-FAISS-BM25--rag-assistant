All parameters can be time varying. This includes the variance of the observation error $v_t$. If you instead let $y_{100}$ denote the average of what is observations 100 to 120 in your current notation, then the observation error at time $t=100$ has variance $\text{Var}(v_{100})=V_{100}=V/21$ while all other observation errors have variances $V_t=V$. You then plug this time varying variance into the appropriate places in the forecast, filtering and smoothing recursions.
