Erlang with its lightweight threads and awesome binary handling will make it a great fit. As far as the hardware goes, I can't see that you will need an extremely expensive server if the protocol is very lightweight, but that would depend on other processing that needs to be done after the packet have been received. Edit If you need to do data lookups by index or something Mnesia is also greater and supports both in memory and disk based storage and is fully distributed if you end up needing to move to more servers Some real world info on Erlangs connection handling capabilities http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html
