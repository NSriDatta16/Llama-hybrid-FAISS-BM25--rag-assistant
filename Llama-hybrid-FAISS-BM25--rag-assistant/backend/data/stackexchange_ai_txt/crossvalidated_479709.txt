Since applying PCA simply transforms the feature space, adding PCA values doesn't make any more sense than normalizing and then adding the original feature values. I don't have the domain knowledge to say whether it makes sense to use the sum of your liquidity measurements as an overall liquidity measurement, but applying PCA wouldn't affect that.
