Absolutely not although having your controller inherit from a shared, base controller is pretty common. public KittyController : MySharedBaseController { } Like Greg Roberts points out that although having a ControllerBase is common it is not always the best place to store shared functionality. MVC has a lot of extensibility points and picking a narrow place to wedge in your code is a lot better than smushing tons of things into a base controller.
