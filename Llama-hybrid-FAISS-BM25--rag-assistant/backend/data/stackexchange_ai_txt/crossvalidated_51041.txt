Rank items based on different parameters

Let's say I have N items to be ranked based on e.g. 5(it could be few or less) different performance measurements. And ranking must reflect combined effect of all perfornance parameters. Which stastical model should I use ? I know this is too little information. But, I don't know what else I should write. I can edit question as and when more clarfication asked by you guys. EDIT: Let me elobrate more and get into specifics. I want to rank my VoIP carriers in my application to optimize my call routing based on two performance parameters. 1) ACD(Avg Call Duration) = Total Duration / No of Successful calls 2) ASR(Avg Seziure Ratio) = No of Successful calls * 100 / Total Calls (Including failed calls) I measure above parameters from time to time from accumulated past Call Detail Records. Usually the sample period is 6 hours. I may consider ranking individual dimensions and then averaging them. But,I don't want a particular dimension to dominate. That means, if a carrier provide good ACD but bad ASR - it's bad for me. Vice versa.
