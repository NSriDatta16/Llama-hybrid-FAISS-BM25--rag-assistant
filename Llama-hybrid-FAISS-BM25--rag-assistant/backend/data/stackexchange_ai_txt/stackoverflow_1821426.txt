Linking to Wikipedia abstracts (the way Google Earth does it)

I'm embedding Wikipedia pages in my app, and I'd like to show the same simplified abstract that Google Earth shows. (It gives the first several paragraphs and a link to the full content, without any serious layout.) I know about the printable=true option, but that's not what I'm looking for.
