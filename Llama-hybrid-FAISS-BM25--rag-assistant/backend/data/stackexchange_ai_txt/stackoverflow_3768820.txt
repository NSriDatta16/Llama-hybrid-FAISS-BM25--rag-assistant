Trying setting the environment variable _NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1 in the program's initial environment. This disables Windows' internal debug heap, which might make it harder to debug memory corruption problems. This KB article mentions the flag, and you can infer that the default (low-fragmentation heap) is disabled if the program is run in a debugger without that environment variable. See also this blog post , which discusses how the debug heap can slow down their program by 3-5 times.
