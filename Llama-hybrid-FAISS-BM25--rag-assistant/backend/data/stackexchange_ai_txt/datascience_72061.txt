Here's a simple example that I took from Aurelion Geron's book, Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. Imagine that we want to make sure that our web site blocker for our child only allows 'safe' websites to be shown. In this case, a 'safe' website is the positive class. Here, we want the blocker to be absolutely certain that the website is safe, even if some safe websites are predicted to be part of the negative or unsafe class and are consequently blocked. That is, we want high precision at the expense of recall. In the case of airport security, where a safety risk is the positive class, we want to make sure that every potential safety risk is investigated. In this case, we will have high recall at the expense of precision (a lot of bags where there are no safety hazards will be investigated).
