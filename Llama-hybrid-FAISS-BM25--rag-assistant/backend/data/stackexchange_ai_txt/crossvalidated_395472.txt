What OLS assumptions need to hold when fitting a linear model with machine learning?

I often hear that machine-learning algorithms are not restricted to the assumptions behind the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator for linear models, e.g.: The conditional mean should be zero. There is no multi-collinearity (or perfect collinearity). Spherical errors: There is homoscedasticity and no autocorrelation. Is this true? If so, wouldn't it be much easier to abandon OLS and only use machine learning?
