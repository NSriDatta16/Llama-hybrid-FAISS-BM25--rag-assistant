How, in practice, are spatial covariances determined?

How, in practice, are spatial covariances determined? If one has a single realisation of some observed field, how can the spatial covariance ever be determined? Unless one has access to the many other realisations associated with that particular observation then its surely impossible to ensemble average over all of them? Is the choice of spatial covariance just an educated guess based upon the assumed underlying phenomenon that has given rise to the single observation? What selection criteria is used to determine the spatial covariance? Expansion: I understand that, as some of the comments have pointed out, there are many covariance functions to choose from. Some of these covariance make the assumption that the field is stationary, i.e. an isotropic field as oppose to anisotropic one. These covariance functions are derived on the hyper-sphere and result in the Mat{'}ern family, which includes the exponential cardinal-sine and Gaussian covariance functions. Many of these functions intrinsically contain the rule that on the whole objects have more in common with their nearest neighbours than they do with their distant neighbours. However given a single observation of a random field, I don't see how one can possibly select one covariance function over another? There is simply not enough information to make an informed choice. How then are researchers and academics supporting the justification in the choice of covariance which will later be used to model the phenomenon? It appears, at least from a naive physicists point of view, that one makes assumptions about the underlying phenomenon to later built a model to make future predictions regarding the underlying phenomenon. There's nothing wrong with this ad hoc approach however I don't see how the solutions to the model can be taken as anything more than hypothetical.
