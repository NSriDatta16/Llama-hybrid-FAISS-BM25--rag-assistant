iPhone: touches on UIViewController

I have a UIViewController, on top I put an UIImageView, then a UIScrollView. I can process touches on the UIScrollView just fine, however I want to process certain touches on the UIViewController. I only need touches on the UIScrollView that are held for 5 seconds (This part works fine). Anything less than that I want to pass to the UIViewController. On the UISCrollView I call this: - (void) touchesBegan: (NSSet *) touches withEvent: (UIEvent *) event { // some custom code to process a specific touch. // all other touches [super touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; } Is there a way to pass touches from the UIScrollView to the bottom UIViewController, or do I have to pass a references to the UIViewController into the UIScrollView?
