Generating data for logistic regression

Maybe I have to brush up on logistic regression but I'm trying to generate some fake data here using a binomial distribution and a vector of probabilities, fit a glm and then plot confidence intervals. It works but doesn't seem right ... the confidence bands are way too wide. pr = c(0.1,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.9,1,1,1) time
