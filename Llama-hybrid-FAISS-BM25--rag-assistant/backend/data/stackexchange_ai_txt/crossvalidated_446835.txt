Good source for learning about Binary Classification

When dealing with binary classification, I most often find myself estimating a logistic regression model. I have tried a few other approaches as well, but to be honest I feel like I know way too little about all of the other possibilities. I understand that it isn't as easy as following a 'model choice' guide. So what I'm looking for is a source where I can read up on the theory behind the different approaches, and then take it from there. Any ideas?
