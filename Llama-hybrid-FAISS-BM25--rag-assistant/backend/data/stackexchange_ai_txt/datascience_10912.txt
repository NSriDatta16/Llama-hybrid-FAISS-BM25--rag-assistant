Is there an easy to use .net library for neural networks?

I know 'easy to use' is going to be subjective, so let me qualify the question a little. Is there a library or working scrap of code that I can essentially copy into my project, change the number of neurons in each layer, the number of layers, and the source of the inputs and then click run. I've written at least 15 of these myself, not a single one has worked properly - I need to see something working in a language I understand so I can get to grips with why I'm apparently a moron! (I can post some of my own code if anyone is interested, but it's lengthy and not too related to the question)
