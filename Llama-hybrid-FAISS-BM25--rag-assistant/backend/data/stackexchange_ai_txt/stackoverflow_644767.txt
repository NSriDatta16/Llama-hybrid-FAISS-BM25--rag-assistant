Converting from mod_python to mod_wsgi

My website is written in Python and currently runs under mod_python with Apache. Lately I've had to put in a few ugly hacks that make me think it might be worth converting the site to mod_wsgi. But I've gotten used to using some of mod_python's utility classes, especially FieldStorage and Session (and sometimes Cookie ), and from a scan of PEP 333 , I don't see any equivalents to these. (Not surprising, because I understand that those kinds of utilities don't belong in the WSGI spec) Question is, are there "standard" (i.e. commonly accepted) replacements for these mod_python utility classes that I can use in WSGI, or could I/should I write my own? (FYI: currently using Python 2.5)
