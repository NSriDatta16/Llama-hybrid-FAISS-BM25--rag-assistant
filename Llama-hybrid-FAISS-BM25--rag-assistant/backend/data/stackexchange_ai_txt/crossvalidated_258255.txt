Perhaps you are confusing the prior distribution with the proposal distribution. The prior distribution is part of the posterior distribution. In particular, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood $p(y|\theta)$ and the prior distribution $p(\theta)$: $$ p(\theta|y) \propto p(y|\theta)\,p(\theta) , $$ where $y$ denotes the data and $\theta$ is the unknown parameter (or parameters). In your case $\theta = (\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. As you say, you have some prior information. In particular, $\alpha \sim \textsf{N}(0,1)$ and $\beta \sim \textsf{Exp}(3)$. You also have some prior information about $\gamma$, namely $\gamma > 0$. Beyond that sign restriction, you wish to use an improper prior $p(\gamma) \propto 1_{[0,\infty]}(\gamma)$. The proposal distribution plays a role in the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler that is used to make draws from the posterior distribution. Let $q(\theta'|\theta)$ denote the density of the proposal distribution for $\theta'$ given $\theta$. Let $\theta^{(r)}$ denote the current state of the Markov chain. Then $$ \theta^{(r+1)} = \begin{cases} \theta' & R \ge u \\ \theta^{(r-1)} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ where $u \sim \textsf{Uniform}(0,1)$ and $$ R = \frac{p(y|\theta')\,p(\theta')}{p(y|\theta^{(r)})\,p(\theta^{(r)})} \times \frac{q(\theta^{(r)}|\theta')}{q(\theta'|\theta^{(r)})} . $$ It appears the software allows you to choose different proposal distributions depending on the prior bounds of the parameters. Since $\alpha \in (-\infty, \infty)$ you would choose the uniform proposal for it. Your other two parameters are constrained to be positive, so you would choose the log-uniform proposal for them. (I am not endorsing these proposal distributions; I am only trying to help you understand what I think the user guide is trying to tell you.)
