We really need more of the markup and relevant javascript to give a useful answer, but in general you just assemble the required HTML and append it to the item you created. A quick additonal note though - you're using suspiciously generic id's. You do know that you can only have one unique id per page, so once you've added a single element with an id of 'btn' and a span with an id of 'remove' you can't add any more with the same id to other dragged elements?
