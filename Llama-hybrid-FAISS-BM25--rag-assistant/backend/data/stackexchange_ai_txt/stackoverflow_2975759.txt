javascript function won't stop looping - It's on a netsuite website

I need to change the shipping carrier drop-down and shipping method radio button once via a javascript function, not forever. However, when I use this function, which executes when on the Review and Submit page when the order is function setFreeSampShipping(){ var options = document.forms['checkout'].shippingcarrierselect.getElementsByTagName('option'); for (i=0;i It gets called from within this part of the function setSampPolicyElems() which you can see I've commented out to stop the loop: if (carTotl Sample & Shipping: No Charge. (Your sample order is "); } To see the issue, go to the order review and submit page here: https://checkout.netsuite.com/s.nl?c=659197&sc=4&n=1 (or go to http://www.avaline.com , hit "checkout", and login) You can log in with these credentials: Email : test2@gmail.com Pass : test03 My solution so far was to swap out the onchange() event trigger line with this, since then I'm not running document.location.href twice: instead, I'm passing the two variables in the one URL query string: var dropdown = document.getElementById('shippingcarrierselect'); document.body.style.cursor = 'wait'; document.location.href='/app/site/backend/setshipmeth.nl?c=659197&n=1&sc=4&sShipMeth=2035&sShipCarrier='+dropdown.value;
