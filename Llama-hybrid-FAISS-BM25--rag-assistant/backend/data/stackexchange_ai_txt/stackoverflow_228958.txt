nmdb sounds like its exactly what you need. Distributed, in memory cache, with a persistent on-disk storage. Current back-ends include qdbm, berkeley db, and (recently added after a quick email to the developer) tokyo cabinet . key/value size is limited though, but I believe that can be lifted if you don't need TICP support.
