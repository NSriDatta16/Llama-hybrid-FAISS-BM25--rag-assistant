Binomial distribution - Question with exercise

I have the following exercise which they give us a hint that the binomial distribution is likely to apply. A company manufactures car components. The quality control scheme for a particular type of component consists of taking random samples of six components at regular intervals. The number of defective components are counted and recorded. Out of 100 such samples, in 52 cases no defectives were found, in 34 cases one defective, in 10 cases two defectives and in the remaining cases three defectives. Are these results consistent with the view that the process is operating with an average of 10% defectives? In my understanding I need to use the following formula: \begin{equation} P(x)=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}p^xq^{n-x} \end{equation} In 52 cases, 0 defectives: \begin{equation} P(52)=\frac{100!}{(100-52)!52!}(0.1)^{52}(0.9)^{100-52} \end{equation} Should I put $p$ = 10% and $q$ =90%. Because is says with an average of 10%. Or should I calculate $p$ and $q$ differently?
