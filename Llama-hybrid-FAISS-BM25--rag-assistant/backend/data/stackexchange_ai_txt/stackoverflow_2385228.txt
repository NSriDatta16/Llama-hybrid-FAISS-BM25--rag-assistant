From how I see the problem you will not be able to hide magento completely and use your site as well in the same time. If you want Magento in the root of the public folder you should just point the virtualHost to your magento installation but this will let your blog and your main controller out of the public view. This is more or less the same with what you did by redirecting all calls in the .htaccess to magento folder. What I suggest is to change the magento name to something more anonymous like "shopping" or "cart", and remember that a folder rename is preferable to a .htaccess file in terms of security and performance.
