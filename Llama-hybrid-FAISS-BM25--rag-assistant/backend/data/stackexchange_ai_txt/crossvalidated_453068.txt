Classifying 10 top features using SVM

I'm new in R. I have a problem with classification using SVM. In my train_data, I have 82 samples and 25770 features while in my test_data I have 36 samples and 25770 features. The last column is the class-label. I would like to classify my samples into "normal/control/0" and "diabetes/1" using 10 top features/genes that I gained from Feature Selection. From feature selection, I have this: And this is my code for classification: training_dataset $FeatureID],y=train_data[,ncol(train_data)]) training_dataset$ y $y) test_data$ y $y=factor(class.dataset$ y) svm.RBF=svm(y~., data=class.dataset,cost=c,gamma=gamma,kernel='radial',types='C-classification') predict.svm.RBF=predict(svm.RBF,test.data) confusionMatrix.RBF=confusionMatrix(predict.svm.RBF,test.data $y) print(confusionMatrix.RBF) plot.confusionMatrix.RBF y, predict.svm.RBF)) } training_dataset10 Now the problem is, the model that I just made have high accuracy but low in AUC. My questions are : Is this the correct way to do classification using 10 top features? Is this the correct way to plot my classifier? Do you have a better suggestion to increase my AUC? The data already balanced. I already did generalization error and parameter tuning so those are the best parameter that I get.
