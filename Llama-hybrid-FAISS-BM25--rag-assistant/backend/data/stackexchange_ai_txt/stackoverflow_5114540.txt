It really depends on the type of data that you are storing, do you really need the data to have referential integrity? For most 'information system' this is a must. Referring to your second paragraph: I mean it would seem a lot easier to do a delete then write some extra lines to update the other tables that were linked to it in the PHP code. Yes it is perhaps easier when you're only making a small scale system, but imagine that your application is successful, and you have more customers, more features needed to be implemented, more programmers needed, then you will inevitably forget to update/delete/insert relevant data to your database, that will be the moment that you'll understand that Codd wasn't joking when he said that Integrity constraints must be specified separately from application programs and stored in the catalog. It must be possible to change such constraints as and when appropriate without unnecessarily affecting existing applications. read up codd's rule here
