It sounds like something has gone wrong a bit/the transformation does not achieve entirely what you want it to do, because I would guess that the model "thinks" that values $f(y) = y^4$ , they actually end up being values that are higher than (some) values >0. Some transformation can be okay for inferential analyses, but problematic for prediction (e.g. square-root transformation for integer valued count data). I would be tempted to consider an alternative transformation - e.g. if all values are strictly positive a log-transformation could be a candidate (then a machine learning model can predict any number in $(-\infty, \infty)$ and they all map to a number in $(0, \infty)$ ). Alternatives include using an output-/final-activiation-/link-/loss-function in your machine learning model that implicitly does a meaningful transformation.
