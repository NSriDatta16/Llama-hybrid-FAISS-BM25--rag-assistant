See Handling very large numbers in Python . Python has a BigNum class for holding 200! and will use it automatically. Your teacher's statement, though not exactly true here is true in general. Computers have limitations, and it is good to know what they are. Remember that every time you add another integer of data storage, you can store a number that is 2^32 (4 billion +) times larger. It is hard to comprehend how many more numbers that is - but maths gets slower as you add more integers to store the exact value of a very large number. As an example (what you can store with 1000 bits) >>> 2 I tried to illustrate how big a number you can store with 10000 bits, or even 8,000,000 bits (a megabyte) but that number is many pages long.
