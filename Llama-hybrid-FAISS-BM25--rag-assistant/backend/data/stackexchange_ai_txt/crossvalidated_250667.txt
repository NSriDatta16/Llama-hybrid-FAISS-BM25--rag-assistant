How to choose bandwidth parameter for RBF

I am implementing a logistic regression with RBF (Gaussian) kernel. Here are the steps I tried: first finding centers with k-means perform the transformation using $e^{-(||x-c_i||)^2/2\sigma^2}$ Currently I am estimating $\sigma$'s by calculating the variances of distances between each cluster center and points in that cluster. This gives poor result compared to standard logistic regression. Then I multiplied the variances with different numbers, and with increasing the multiplier, the accuracy increases upto a certain value of the multiplier. My first question is, why this is happening? Second question, how actually I should estimate the variances? Thanks
