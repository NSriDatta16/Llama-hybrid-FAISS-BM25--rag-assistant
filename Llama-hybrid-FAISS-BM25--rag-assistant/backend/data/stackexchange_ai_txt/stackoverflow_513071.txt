I'm not trying to justify my mistake, but it would be great if the java compiler was smart enough to promote the int to a long before the calculation (once the calculation is being assigned to a variable of type long) By the way, I used to work with C/C++ and if it was a C program, I'd had the same problem, but some years ago I'd been more careful with this kind of operation. I'll pay more attention next time (or switch to python)... :D
