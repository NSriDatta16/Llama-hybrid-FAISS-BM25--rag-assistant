OK I hope this helps someone else as I found out what the problem is. Basically, sprocs and views will not replicate without a table (there was an MSDN blog I found about this here link text ). So in my example, I already had all the tables and data, so when I started adding views they were the only things coming across and it doesn't work. I also had a function that was referencing a column that had been deleted (so when it was CREATED at the subscriber it failed). We also had a lot of data to replicate (we were doing HTTP web sync replication) so had to adjust the settings in the agent on the server so it sent less data per hit.
