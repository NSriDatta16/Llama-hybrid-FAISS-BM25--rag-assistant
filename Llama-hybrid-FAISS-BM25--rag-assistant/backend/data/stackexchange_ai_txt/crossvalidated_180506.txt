Hosmer Lemeshow for correlated data

Is it OK to use HL to judge the goodness-of-fit of a Logistic Regression when the data is a time series correlated from one period to another? I know that HL assumes independence of events, but I wonder what can be done when your data is not independent. Can I still use HL because data is rarely perfectly independent anyway? Or should I definitely use a different goodness-of-fit test? Does it make any difference that my model is looking at the time series just as data points? ie the equation just takes inputs from independent variables but does not take into account past values.
