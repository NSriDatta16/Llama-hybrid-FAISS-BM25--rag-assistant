Implementing friend (available in C++) functionality in Java

Ok, let's leave the debate of whether friendship breaks encapsulation, and actually try elegantly come up with a coherent design. It is a two fold function: 1) General question on how to implement: public class A { friend class B; } 2) Why do I need this functionality? Some of my classes implement Serializable interface. However, I want to make Serializable methods protected in the Derived class so that I don't expose them to a client (as well as in the documentation -- javadoc). However, internal classes should be able to access them. What is the General way to solve this problem in java? Note: I am using friendship as defined in the current C++ standard. Thanks
