Rather than using the Gelman-Rubin statistic, which is a nice aid but not perfect (as with all convergence diagnostics), I simply use the same idea and plot the results for a visual graphical assessment. In almost all cases I have considered (which is a very large number), graphing the trace plots of multiple MCMC chains started from widely varied starting positions is sufficient to show or assess whether the same posterior is being converged to or not, in each case. I use this method to: Whether the MCMC chain (ever) converges Assess how long I should set the burn-in period To calculate Gelman's R statistic (see Gelman, Carlin, Stern and Rubin, Bayesian Data Analysis) to measure the efficiency and speed of mixing in the MCMC sampler. Efficiency and convergence are slightly different issues: e.g. you can have convergence with very low efficiency (i.e. thus requiring long chains to converge). I have used this graphical method to successfully diagnose (and later correct) lack of convergence problems in specific and general situations.
