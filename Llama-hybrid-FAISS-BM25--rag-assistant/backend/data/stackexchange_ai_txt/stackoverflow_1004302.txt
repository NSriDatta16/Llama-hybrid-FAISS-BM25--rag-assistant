Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Google is lovely because it has just one text box, two buttons, and some links to other features. Google is also lovely because Advanced Search is there if you want it, and not if you don't. Google is also lovely because you can embed it in a personal home page and get all sorts of neato widgets that you, yourself, select. In all cases, Google conforms to the user, rather than asking the user to conform to the Google. That's the essential nature of good design - fitting the user. I've seen users point to some pretty hideous screens and even paper forms and say - "please make it just like this, because this has everything I need, nothing I don't, and I know just where to find all of it". To them, the frightening, cluttered screen is just perfect. I'd hate it. In many cases, a customizable screen (like Google home page) is a win, because users can make it as complex or as simple as they like. But only if you can find an elegant way to offer the customizability without distracting from the main task. For example, the google home page customization links are a very small peice of real estate compared to the search area (easily 1/3 of the screen space) or the widgets. And google starts with the simplest of options (www.google.com) and lets the user dig until they find a suitable complexity level. You can't please all the people all the time on the first click, but you can please most of the people on the first click, and more of them on the next click...
