web is not print Layouts can be fluid. elements don't have to be absolutely positioned web pages need to be checked in several browsers for compatibility avoid divitis; from experience people coming from print into this field do everything by brute force instead of trying to think of elegant solutions for optimization and semantics purposes print is consumed visually - the web is consumed by people with visual impairments as well.
