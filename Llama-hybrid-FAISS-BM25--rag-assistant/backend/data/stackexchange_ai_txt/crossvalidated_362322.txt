The idea with MCMC is that you run the chains until well after they have converged to the same distribution. Then discard samples from before convergence. At which point you can't distinguish between samples from the two chains. So you throw all samples in one big pot. If you still want to see how far apart the chains are, you could look at the convergence diagnostics.
