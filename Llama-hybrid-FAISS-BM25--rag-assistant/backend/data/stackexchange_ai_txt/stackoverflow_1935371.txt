I get an exception if I leave the program running for a while

Platform : Win32 Language : C++ I get an error if I leave the program running for a while (~10 min). Unhandled exception at 0x10003fe2 in ImportTest.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x003b1000. I think it could be a memory leak but I don't know how to find that out. Im also unable to ' free() ' memory because it always causes (maybe i shouldn't be using free() on variables) : Unhandled exception at 0x76e81f70 in ImportTest.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x0fffffff. at that stage the program isn't doing anything and it is just waiting for user input dllHandle = LoadLibrary(L"miniFMOD.dll"); playSongPtr = (playSongT)GetProcAddress(dllHandle,"SongPlay"); loadSongPtr = (loadSongT)GetProcAddress(dllHandle,"SongLoadFromFile"); int songHandle = loadSongPtr("FILE_PATH"); // ... {just output , couldn't cause errors} playSongPtr(songHandle); getch(); // that is where it causes an error if i leave it running for a while Edit 2: playSongPtr(); causes the problem. but i don't know how to fix it
