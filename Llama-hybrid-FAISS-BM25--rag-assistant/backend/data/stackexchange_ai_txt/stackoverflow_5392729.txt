Javascript invalid date in iOS/Android 2.2

I have this string containing a date I need to parse to get a Date javascript object. It works if I execute the code in a PC browser but gives me an invalid date if I run the web page in a iOS (tried iPhone 4.3) and Android 2.2 emulator. $(document).ready(function(){ var date = new Date('2011-03-04T08:14:00+01:00'); $('#test').html(date.toString()); }); Does anybody know what may be wrong? I can always parse the date manually (considering it'll always be in the same format) but anyways it seems like a strage problem to me. Cheers!
