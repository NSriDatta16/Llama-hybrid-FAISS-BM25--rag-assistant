Why is GPU accelerated node much slower than CPU node for training a random forest model on databricks?

I have a dataset about 5 million rows with 14 features and a binary target. I decided to train a pyspark random forest classifier on Databricks. The CPU cluster I created contains 2 c4.8xlarge workers (60GB, 36core) and 1 r4.xlarge (31GB, 4core) driver. The GPU cluster I created contains 3 g4dn.4xlarge (64GB, 16cores) nodes, 2 as workers and 1 as driver. The hourly costs are very similar. I assumed that GPU cluster would outperform since random forest is an algorithm born for parallel computing, while the result kinda shocked me that the GPU cluster trained the model near 5 times slower than the CPU cluster. Is there anything I misunderstood about GPU acceleration or is it just not used for pyspark.ml modules.
