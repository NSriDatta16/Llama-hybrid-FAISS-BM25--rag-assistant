I've used prototype for quite some time, and scriptaculous with it ; I now use jQuery on some projects, Mootools on others, and prototype on others... Why do I use a JS Framework ? Well, three main reasons : They provide lots of stuff I do not want to re-develop by myself They are well-tested ; more than my own code would be They provide a layer of cross-browser-compatibility (And I prefer having a framework that deals with that, instead of having to fight this war by myself !) As for which JS Framework you should use, that's another question - it's entirely up to you ^^ When including prototype.js and/or scriptaculous.js : prototype.js : on any page that needs some JS stuff (most pages generally) scriptaculous.js : at least on pages that require effects like drag'n drop, autocompleter, etc... Same thing with other JS frameworks too, btw...
