Best Data Science & Machine Learning Conferences 2019?

What are the best data science conferences you have attended? I am looking for a conference that will help me further develop my Data Science and Machine Learning competencies. Topics that are particularly interesting to me include model explainability, model pipelines, and model governance. I am specifically looking for a conference that have hands-on Spark training. Do you have any conference suggestions that align with my interests?
