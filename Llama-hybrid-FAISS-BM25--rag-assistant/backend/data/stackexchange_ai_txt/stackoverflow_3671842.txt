As I can see, others recommend using PowerShell. Well, personally, I would pay more attention. Why? Each web request should be processed as quickly as possible and without any blocking. If the script contains commands that work with network, then there could be some timeouts (e.g. if the computer is not accessible). The processing thread will be blocked for all the time and can't serve any other web request. Then soon you might get Internal Server Error and similar responses. Besides that (not proved) I suspect that PowerShell consumes more memory than similar code in C#. I don't claim don't use Powershell , just pay attention ;)
