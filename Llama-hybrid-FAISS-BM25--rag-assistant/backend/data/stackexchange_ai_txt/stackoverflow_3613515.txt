Magento Commerce has complex multi layered models (www.magentocommerce.com) which you may pick up a trick or two from. But my (personal) experience with Magento was frustrating: I was hacking with it around version 0.8-1.1 and it appeared over engineered and poorly documented. Trying to figure out how it actually worked was complex: you'd end up with tons files open in your editor, most of them called Abstract.php. Hopefully things have improved a long way since then.
