Create a new one if you need to. Don't if you don't. Patterns are not about data structures, they're about organizational patterns among communicating components. If the same controller is appropriate for more than one view, great - especially if you can use it without modification . If you have to change it, then you have a case for two separate controllers. If there is shared code between them, then consider moving it to another class - either a base class or (my personal preference) shared via aggregation. The easiest way to think about MVC is a command-line program. The program is the Model. The Controller is STDIN. The View is STDOUT.
