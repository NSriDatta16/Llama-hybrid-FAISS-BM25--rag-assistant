Well "Security through Obscurity" is never a best practice; your equipment should be able to maintain integrity against an attacker that has extensive knowledge of your setup (barring passwords, console access, etc). Can't really stop a DDOS or something similar, but you shouldn't have to worry about people finding out you OS version, etc. Still, no need to give away information for free. Fudging the headers may discourage some attackers, and, in cases like this where you're running an application that may have a known exploit crop up, there are significant benefits in not advertising that you're running it. I say change it. Internally, you shouldn't see much benefit in leaving it alone, and externally you have a chance of seeing benefits if you change it.
