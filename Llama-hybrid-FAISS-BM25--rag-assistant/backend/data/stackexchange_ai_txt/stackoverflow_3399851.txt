How do I stop Wordpress dashboard widgets from being dragged?

I'm setting up Wordpress 3.0.1 for a novice user. The Dashboard widgets are appropriately placed, and I'd like them to stay that way. As far as I know, there's no add_filter or add_action hook to prevent dragging, so another approach would be to make a plugin that uses jQuery to disable dragging. What handler(s) would I override -- click, mouseUp, mouseMove, etc -- and on which DOM elements?
