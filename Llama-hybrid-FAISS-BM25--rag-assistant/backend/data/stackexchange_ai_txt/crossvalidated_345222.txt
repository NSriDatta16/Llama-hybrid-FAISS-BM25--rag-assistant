Determining a probability of a response variable value being true given a specific value for a predictor in R (binomial logistic regression)

I've produced a binomial logistic regression using glmer in R explaining the failure response of O-rings in the challenger space shuttle with respect to temperature at the launch site. Model: model Where: Failures = Number of O-rings failed during a given launch (out of a possible 6) Successes = number of o-rings that did not fail during a given launch (out of a possible 6) Temperature = Temperature of launch site during a given launch (in Fahrenheit) Obs = Random effects variable I want to determine the probability of more than 2 o-rings failing during the launch in which the space shuttle challenger exploded shortly after launch using the temperature of the launch site (31 degrees F). I'm very new to GLMs/GLMMs and do not know how to go about assigning a specific value to the predictor variable/a threshold of the explanatory variable to reach in order to deduce probability. Any help is much appreciated. Should you need it, an image of the data should be attached.
