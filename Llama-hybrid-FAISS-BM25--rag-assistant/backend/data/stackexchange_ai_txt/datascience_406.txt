How can I predict traffic based on previous time series data?

If I have a retail store and have a way to measure how many people enter my store every minute, and timestamp that data, how can I predict future foot traffic? I have looked into machine learning algorithms, but I'm not sure which one to use. In my test data, a year over year trend is more accurate compared to other things I've tried, like KNN (with what I think are sensible parameters and distance function). It almost seems like this could be similar to financial modeling, where you deal with time series data. Any ideas?
