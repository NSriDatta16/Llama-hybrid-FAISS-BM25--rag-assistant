Hopefully your team understands object-oriented design principles. You group related information into classes that have operations that work on that information. Namespaces are (or should be) similar. You use namespaces to group related classes together and together they provide operations to work on the collective information of the namespace. This helps with code intelligibility. Grouping your data layer classes into a single namespace identifies them as related, and related in a way to provide the functionality indicated by the namespace [As an aside, this is why you would need to provide meaningful names for your namespaces as well as your classes]. If you group all of your classes in the same namespace, then it all becomes a big ball of mud. You've lost the semantic clues to the organization of the code and have to dig through it to find out which classes work together to provide the required functionality. The point is: it's not merely a matter of personal preference. In the same way that you can't expect to pour all of your sentences in to a single paragraph, but rather have to organize them into several paragraphs, in which the sentences are related; you need to take your classes and organize them into namespaces. Breaking your writing up into paragraphs of related sentences provides clarity and meaning, breaking your classes into namespaces improves the clarity of your code. As the number of classes grows, this only becomes more and more important.
