I think a mixed effects model or a marginal model using generalized estimating equations (GEE) might work for you. Using GEE you could specify a working correlation matrix that designates those observations later in the series as being more highly correlated with one another and you could add a variable into your model for the time component. You could, of course do something similar with lmer and mixed effects (minus the working correlation matrix bit). The mixed effects approach has the added benefit that it isn't using a population averaged approach like GEE. Taking this a step further, you may even be able to build several predictive models using classical statistical modelling techniques and machine learning techniques like boosted regression trees and then use a machine learning ensemble method to combine them into a single, more powerful predictor. Using Stacking for example, you might build several models and then combined all of the models into one final prediction model. These models generally outperform Bayesian model averaging approaches as well.
