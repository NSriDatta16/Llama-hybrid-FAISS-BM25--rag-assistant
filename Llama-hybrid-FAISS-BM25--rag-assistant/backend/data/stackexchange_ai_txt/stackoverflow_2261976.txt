More of a side note than an answer to your problem, but you say you don't want to average the framerate, however you're effectively averaging it over a second by calculating it like that. If you want to have the framerate updated every frame, you might want to try something like: currentTime = timeGetTime(); fps = 1000.0f / (currentTime - prevTime); prevTime = currentTime; Though timeGetTime is going to start to be a bit inaccurate at this point, as the numbers are likely to be small. QueryPerformanceCounter might be a better timer to use.
