I don't know the specifics of the two tests you mentioned but I can address the general question posed in the title of your question and maybe that applies to these specific tests. Stationarity is a property of stochastic processes (or time series in particular) where the joint distribution of any k consecutive observations does not change with a time shift. There can be many ways to test for this, or its weaker form covariance stationary, where only the mean and the second moments remain constant with time changes. If the time series specifically follows an autoregressive process there is a characteristic polynomial corresponding to the model. For autoregressive time series, the series is covariance stationary if and only if all the roots of the characteristic polynomial are outside the unit circle in the complex plane. So testing for unit roots is a test for a specific type of non-stationarity for a specific type of time series models. Other tests can test for other forms of nonstationarity and deal with more general forms of time series.
