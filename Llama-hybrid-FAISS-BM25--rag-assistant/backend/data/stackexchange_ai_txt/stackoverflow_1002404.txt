Can Vim/GVim Show Other Files within the Same Project while Editing a File?

While I am editing a file in Vim, I need to see other available files to edit within the same project. Are there any project management features for Vim (GVim actually, if it makes any difference), either natively or in plugin form? I'm not looking for anything extravagant, just something which will keep my files under one project name, and some sort of buffer which will display what files go under what project. You know what I mean, you see it in every IDE.
