I don't see a reason why you should implement some app to store some info there. You can as well use smth like OneNote or any other available organizer, development wiki, etc.: there are tons of ways to store info in such a way that it comes handy when you look up for it in future. If you can make some inner changes, you can change keys' constraints names to readable pattern, like table1_colName_table2_colName . And at least you can make some diagram, whether hand-made or using some design application. If all this doesn't solve your problem, some more details are needed on what exactly you need to solve :)
