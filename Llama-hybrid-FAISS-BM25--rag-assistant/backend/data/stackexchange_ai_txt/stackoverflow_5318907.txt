How to get these files as elegant as possible?

I have some files in the form of: blur.static.shadereffect blur.dynamic.shadereffect blur.virtual.shadereffect soften.static.shadereffect soften.dynamic.shadereffect soften.virtual.shadereffect median.static.shadereffect median.dynamic.shadereffect median.virtual.shadereffect ... Right now I am getting the .static.shadereffect files and then filtering out the last 2 parts so only the name exists like "blur", "soften", "median" , etc. Some shader effects can have more or less types so I don't want to hard code .static.shadereffect . So in the end the method will return the names of the .shadereffect files: {"blur", "soften", "median"} How do I do this most elegantly with as little code as possible? Performance is not important. EDIT: A small detail. The file names can also have more than 2 dots, so something like "blur.sharpen.dynamic.shadereffect", which shouldn't throw off the results.
