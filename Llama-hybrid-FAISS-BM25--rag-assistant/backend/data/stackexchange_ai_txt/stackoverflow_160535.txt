As for SimpleDB , it has a very limited query language and it is very restrictive. If you planning on having lot of complex queries, you must first sit down and think how to organize your data to make those queries possible. One thing missing, but that will probably will be added, is the ability to count the results of a given query, much like SQL's COUNT. Performance is ok, but I consider the latency maybe a little high.
