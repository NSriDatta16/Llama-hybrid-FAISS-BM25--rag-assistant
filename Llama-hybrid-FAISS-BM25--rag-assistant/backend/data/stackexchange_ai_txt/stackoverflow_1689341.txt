You can use Action delegates. This is much more elegantly then using data you will never need (I mean EventArgs). Here you define events: public event Action EventWithoutParams; public event Action EventWithIntParam; And here you fire events: EventWithoutParams(); EventWithIntParam(123); You can find all the information you need at Action or Action . Either of these events can be initialised with a no-op delegate ... = delegate { }; so that you don't need to check for null before firing the event.
