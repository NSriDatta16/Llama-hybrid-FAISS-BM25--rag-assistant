Interpretation of Coefficient

In Poisson Regression, suppose we have the following regression equation: $\ln(E(Y_i|X_1)) = \beta_0+ \beta_{1}X_{1}$ where $Y$ is the number of heart attacks. Also suppose $X_1$ is a binary variable (e.g. smokers versus non-smokers). How would you interpret the coefficient $\beta_1$? Smokers, on average, have $\exp(\beta_1)$ more heart attacks than non-smokers?
