Any ideas how I can detect mouse events beyond containment for a jquery-ui draggable?

I just made a div draggable, as in: .draggable({ axis: 'x', containment: [ pLeft+margin, 0, pWidth-(margin*2), 0] }).css('opacity', 0.6) and I can see the div overlayed over the parent and draggable along the x axis within the parent a few pixels away from left and right edge (from margin). This is the scenario. Question How do I detect draggable events beyond the containment and whether the user is trying to go beyond and towards the left or towards the right (so I can change the background-position of the parent div giving it a scrolling effect) Any ideas how I can detect mouse events beyond containment for a jquery-ui draggable? (along with an info whether it is towards left or right)?
