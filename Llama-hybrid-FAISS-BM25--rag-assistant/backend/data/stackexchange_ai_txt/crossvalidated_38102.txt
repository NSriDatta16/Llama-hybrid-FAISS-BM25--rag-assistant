Paired versus unpaired t-test

Suppose I have 20 mice. I pair the mice in some way, so that I get 10 pairs. For the purpose of this question, it could be a random pairing, OR it could be a sensible pairing, like trying to pair mice from the same litter, of the same sex, with similar weight, OR it could be a deliberately stupid pairing like trying to pair mice with weights as unequal as they could possibly be. I then use random numbers to assign one mouse in each pair to the control group and the other mouse to the to-be-treated group. I now do the experiment, treating only the to-be-treated mice, but otherwise paying no attention whatsoever to the arrangements just made. When one comes to analyze the results, one could either use unpaired t-testing or paired t-testing. In what way, if any, will the answers differ? (I'm basically interested in systematic differences of any statistical parameter that needs to be estimated.) The reason I ask this is that a paper I was recently involved with was criticized by a biologist for using a paired t-test rather than an unpaired t-test. Of course, in the actual experiment, the situation was not as extreme as the situation I've sketched, and there were, in my opinion, good reasons for pairing. But the biologist didn't agree. It seems to me that it's not possible to incorrectly improve statistical significance (decrease p-value), in the circumstances I sketched, by using a paired t-test, rather than an unpaired test, even if it is inappropriate to pair. It could however worsen statistical significance if mice were badly paired. Is this right?
