if you divide instead of multiply, it fixes your test cases. Overall, it will yield better result as the "Power" result won't have a fractional value. I'm afraid it might not have a 100% case coverage, but unless a better solution is proposed, this should be better than what you have. function Func(Value : Double) : Integer; begin Result := Trunc(Value / Power(10, (Floor(Log10(Value))))) end;
