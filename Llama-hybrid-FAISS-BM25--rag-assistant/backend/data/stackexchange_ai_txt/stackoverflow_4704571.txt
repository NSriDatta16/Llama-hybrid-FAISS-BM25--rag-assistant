MacVim honors "gvim" settings. GVim being the Gnome Vim gui variant that is rather prevalent on Linux. This means that you should perhaps set overall settings specific to your user in "~/.vimrc", and override the ones you want in MacVim specifically by defining them in "~/.gvimrc". It's up to you to decide what organizational method suits you best.
