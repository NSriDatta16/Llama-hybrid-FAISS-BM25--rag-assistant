Before we start, a good general DTW guide. https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/DTW.pdf There is a simple trick for this. You can compute the DTW between the reference time series and ONE of the 50 time series. Then you can project the 49 other time series onto the discovered warping path. If you need help, just email me (source: I have 100+ papers on DTW)
