One way to make a "real-valued beta distribution" would be to transform the interval $(0,1)$ onto the real line. One way of doing that is the logistic function $$ \text{logit}(x)= \log(\frac{x}{1-x}) $$ known from, for example, logistic regression. So if $X \sim \mathcal{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ , let $$ Y=\text{logit}(X)= \log(\frac{X}{1-X}). $$ Then $Y$ will be a random variable with range on the full real line, with a distribution we can call logistic-Beta. By standard transformation methods we find the density function of $Y$ as $$ f_Y(y) =\frac{e^{\alpha y}}{B(\alpha, \beta) (1+e^y)^{\alpha+\beta}} $$ where $B$ is the beta function. This will give a flexible family of (unimodal) distributions on the real line. In this comprehensive reference that I just found, this distribution is called the Beta-Logistic Distribution . That is a useful search term! An example is below: The same transformation could be used with mixtures of betas, for instance, to get even multi-modal distributions. In reality, this example is a special case of the log-ratio transformation used with Compositional data , see also How to perform isometric log-ratio transformation . Transforming a beta random variable to the positive line (in a specific way) only gives the beta prime distribution, a recent post with an example is Distribution of the exponential of an exponentially distributed random variable? . Code use for the figure is below: dlogisticBeta 0)&&(beta>0) ) logans
