The article you have linked for the formula where the residual is divided by sigma is not the original paper from Wu (1986), but instead the link leads to a paper from Prášková (2002) called "Bootstrap in nonstationary autoregression", so I don't know where you found the information about the residual being "standardized". Further, this formula does not really depict a standardized residual, since the standardized residual is the original residual divided by the estimated standard error of the residuals not the estimated standard deviation of y (see here ). In Wu's original article (p. 1282) he describes the i th unstandardized residual being transformed (divided by the square root of 1 minus the i th leverage value)and multiplied by a bootstrap variable t* (or v*). Variations of this version of the wild bootstrap can be found in e.g. MacKinnon (2011) , or Cribari-Neto (2004) . In other iterations of the wild bootstrap, f.i. the one implemented in SPSS, the residual is not transformed prior to multiplying it with the bootstrap variable t*, but it is again the unstandardized residual that is used. I personally would not think it correct to use standardized residuals, since the goal of each bootstrap iteration is to compute a vector of bootstrapped y-values with which the unstandardized regression coefficients can be computed. This would require the y-values (and thus the residuals) to remain in their original metric.
