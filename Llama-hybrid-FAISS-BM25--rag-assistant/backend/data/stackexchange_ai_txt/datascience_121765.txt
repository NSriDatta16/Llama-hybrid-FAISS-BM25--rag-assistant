Data Analysis Process

How do you feed data from a data warehouse to Python for ad-hoc analysis? My day-to-day work is to answer ad-hoc questions, and 95% of the data I need is in our data warehouse. I often query data from our warehouse to CSV file(s), then use Python to load these files with other sources to analyze. I am going to work with a very gigantic data warehouse that may not be possible to use the same csv method. Our data warehouse is in Redshift. What is your experience to feed python/R for data analysis?
