Better way to refer to structure size( #pragma pack VS defined size )

Assume I have the struct Foo struct Foo{ int a; short b; char c; }; And I has to write this struct in to n/w buffer. I need to know the size of this struct. In my environment, sizeof(Foo) returns 8, That's ok, I understand. These are two way to refer to the exact size that I want to write to the buffer 1. #define SIZEOF_FOO 7 , And use this instead of sizeof(Foo) 2. By using #pragma pack so I can use sizeof(Foo) which will return 7 Which one is the better way to do, or Is there any other way to do this ?
