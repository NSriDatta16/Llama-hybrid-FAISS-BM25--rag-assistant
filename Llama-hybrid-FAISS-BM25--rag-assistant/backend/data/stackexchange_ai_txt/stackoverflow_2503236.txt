Django Inline formset for editing multiple related records at once - the right way to go?

When using inline formsets, how does one do paging? I'm using django 1.1. The situation I'm in, is that the user needs to be able to edit the related objects quickly and easily (which is why I think I should be using an inline formset). However, there can be a more than a hundred objects to edit, which makes a pretty large formset, so paging would make sense. Is there a better way to be doing this? Thanks Bert
