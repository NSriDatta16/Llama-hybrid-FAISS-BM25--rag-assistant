Your problem is with the date field? In Machine Learning algorithms you have to feed the model with numerical data and date is not numerical. You can see in this posts what are the common techniques of encoding time: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/311494/best-practice-for-encoding-datetime-in-machine-learning So you have either two options: encoding date time or drop it. ds = ds.drop('Date', axis=1)
