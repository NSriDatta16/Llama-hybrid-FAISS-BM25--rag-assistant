What does clustering algorithms do with missing data?

I wonder in clustering, what does algorithms like KMeans do with missing value data? For example, if in one of our samples, the information for one of the dimensions is NaN, what KMeans do with that dimension when compare it to others? Does it give a value like average of others or just ignore this dimension when comparing to other samples? What is best strategy?
