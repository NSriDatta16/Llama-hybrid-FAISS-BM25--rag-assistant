What is the effect of balanced class weights on logistic regression coefficients?

I'm specifically using sklearn 's LogisticRegression on my unbalanced dataset, which has around 97% negative responses and 3% positive responses. I'm primarily interested in interpretation and figuring out which predictors are the most important for my responses. I've tried using statsmodels but unfortunately I couldn't find a way to weight the classes. I performed LogisiticRegression with and without class weighting, and compared the coefficients. Below is a distribution plot of the difference between coefficients with and without weighting. For reference, here is a distribution plot of the without weighting coefficients (the weighted coefficients plot looks similar). My understanding is that the cost function is changed so that it is costlier to make incorrect predictions on the minority class. What I'm wondering is how will this effect regression coefficients when compared to running a logistic regression without class balancing? Are weighted coefficients more correct?
