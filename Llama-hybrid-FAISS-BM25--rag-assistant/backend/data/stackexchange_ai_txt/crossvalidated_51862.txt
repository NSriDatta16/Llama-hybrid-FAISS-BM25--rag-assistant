The method you use, a normal approximation, is an archaicism and should never be taught or even offered as an option in software. It has very poor coverage properties, particularly for small proportions as in your example. There are many alternative approaches to calculating these intervals, with varying assumptions and coverage characteristics. Some are very ad hoc in design and so are hard to prefer for pedagogic purposes. My preference is the method of Wilson, sometimes called Wilson's scores intervals. It approximates a conditional interval and has excellent frequentist properties. See this answer for a little more detail: Discrete functions: Confidence interval coverage? See this question for a formal statement of the meaning of different types of CI for binomial proportions: Statement of result for binomial confidence intervals This one for confidence interval coverage: Clarification on interpreting confidence intervals?
