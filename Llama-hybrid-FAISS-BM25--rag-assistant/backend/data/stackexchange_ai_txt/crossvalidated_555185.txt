I think you said you wanted all this stuff averaged over the predictors besides GAIT_ and TIME . Also, if you really want slopes , you need to specify two TIME values one unit apart as suggested in a comment. It doesn't matter what two values you use, as long as they are 1 unit apart. So I would do something like new_rrg = qdrg(formula = ~ GAIT_*TIME+AGE+FAQ+medical, data = df, coef = fixef(tmtar), vcov = as.matrix(vcov(tmtar)), at = list(TIME = 17:18)) # average over the predictors... emm = emmeans(new_rrg, ~ TIME | GAIT_) # obtain the average slopes for each TIME... pairs(emm, reverse = TRUE) This should work the same for either choice of contrast codings in tmtar . While it is possible to use contrast codings in a one-factor model to make the regression coefficients interpretable, it gets more and more confusing as you add more factors, and IMO you're creating a situation where the increased risk of making mistakes outweighs any advantage in interpretability of regression coefficients. By the way, when you show two different models in a posting like this, please give them different names. Otherwise, it's very confusing to try to discuss the difference between the first tmtar model and the second tmtar model. (And totally impossible to compare them in your workspace, since they can't both be present.)
