How to create and format an image dataset from scratch for machine learning?

I've only worked with ML with .csv formats. I've worked with image formats too but only premade imagesets (MNIST,etc). If I were to create an imageset from scratch, how are the class labels typically formated? Would I have to manually title the image of a jpeg? Best, Jeremy
