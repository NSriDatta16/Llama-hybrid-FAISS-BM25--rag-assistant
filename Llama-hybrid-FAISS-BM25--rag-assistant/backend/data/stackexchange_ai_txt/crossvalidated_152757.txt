Correct interpretation of linear regression coefficient?

Let's say I'm running a survey and I ask "Are you confident in the economy, yes or no?" Then I ask the respondent "are we spending too much or not too much on scientific funding? I let the answer "yes" and "not too much" be 1, and the other two answers a 0. Let's say I run an OLS model on the relationship and I get: Scientific-funding-view_predicted = .009(confidence-in-economy) + B Am I correct in interpreting this as "the model predicts a respondent who becomes confident in the economy will increase their probability of believing the government is not spending too much on scientific funding by .9%" ? I want to find a better way of wording in, but I can't seem to think of anything. Thank you! EDIT: Let's say I ran a logistic regression, and let's say I got the exact same coefficient. How would I interpret this? I take exp[.009] which is 1.009. Would I interpret that, if someone doesn't think we are spending too much on the economy, the odds of them being confident in the economy versus not confident in the economy is 1.009?
