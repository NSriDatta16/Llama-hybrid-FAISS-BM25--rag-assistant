What is the lag associated with Moving Average smoothing?

In a tutorial I came across this: "Recall that the forecast value is: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = \frac{y_t + y_{t-1} + ... + y_{t-m+1}}{m}$ It's worth pondering that formula for a minute. While easy to understand, one of its properties may not be obvious. What's the lag associated with this technique? Think it through. The answer is $\frac{(m+1)}{2}$ For example, say you're averaging the past 5 values to make the next prediction. Then local changes will yield a lag of $\frac{5+1}{2} = 3$ periods. Clearly, the lag increases as you increase the window size for averaging." Before going through this, I thought I have the correct intuition of a moving average model. If I choose a window of m, then the prediction y(t+1) is based on m previous values and thus the lag is m. How does this tutorial come up with this formula for lag? As an example, how does a window size of m in a moving average smoothing model, correspond to a lag of 3?
