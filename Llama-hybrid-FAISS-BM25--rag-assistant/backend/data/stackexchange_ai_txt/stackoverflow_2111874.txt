The form elements you're adding to the DOM don't have names. You need to assign names to them before those names can be used in a form submission. var cboOffsetGroupOperator = document.createElement("select"); cboOffsetGroupOperator.setAttribute('name', 'cboOffsetGroupOperator1'); // this is what you're missing p.appendChild(cboOffsetGroupOperator); And please, as SQLMenace said, fix the SQL injection problem you have in there... to get started, put the following text into the detail comments field and submit it. abc ';create table bork(a varchar(30));insert bork values ('all your base are belong to us'); -- However, I encourage you to pay attention to the answer that says your javascript will not work cross-browser. It looks like you need to dig into things a bit to get your code really right.
