As jAndy states the problem is event bubbling here, but you since you asked "is there a more elegant way", yes there is :) If we take advantage of .slideToggle() and the :visible selector , your code comes very terse indeed, you can do this: $('#clickme').click(function(e) { $("#cart").stop(true, true).slideToggle("slow"); e.stopPropagation(); }); $(document).click(function () { $("#cart:visible").stop(true, true).slideUp("slow"); }); .slideToggle() does almost exactly the check you're doing, The difference is it checks when it gets there, so in the case of queued animations it's even better. And by using :visible we're only selecting #cart if it's visible and needs sliding up, otherwise there's nothing selected. The .stop() call is just to prevent animation queue-up for fast clicks, test it out and see what behavior you want, this part is optional. And last the event.stopPropagation() call is to prevent the click event from bubbling up to document and triggering it's .click() handler, ( click here for more info on that ).
