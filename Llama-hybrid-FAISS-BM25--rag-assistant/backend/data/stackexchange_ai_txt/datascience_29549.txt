If you want to use an LSTM for time series prediction, you have to try every possible parameter to find the best possible result. In order to check your model performance, you should also check your train/validation loss (this will probably show that 10 epochs is too few). Check your network architecture. Why do you use three layers? More layers won't mean better results. Try different optimizers with different learning rates. Finally, ask yourself why you are even using an LSTM for prediction? Have you tried other methods? LSTMs aren't magic, they won't have perfect prediction without any pattern to draw from, and you have pretty small samples for training.
