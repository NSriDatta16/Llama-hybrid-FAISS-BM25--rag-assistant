I found the answer to my question. The reason is that because of the SVM- Type summary(svm.model) Call: svm(formula = train$OVERBILL ~ ., data = train, type = "C", cross = 10, scale = FALSE) Parameters: SVM-Type: C-classification SVM-Kernel: radial cost: 1 gamma: 0.02173913 Number of Support Vectors: 148 Number of Classes: 3 Levels: 0 1 6 10-fold cross-validation on training data: Total Accuracy: 87.16578 Single Accuracies: 94.44444 89.47368 84.21053 88.88889 94.73684 100 66.66667 78.94737 84.21053 89.47368 conf_matrix svm_pred 0 1 6 0 13 0 0 1 7 19 0 6 0 0 8 > Accuracy(svm_pred, test_labels) [1] 0.8510638 > AUC(svm_pred, test_labels) [1] 0.825
