A simple way to approach this will be to cluster samples based on their means and then check the distribution of the variances across the members of each cluster. It will be dependent on whether you want to cluster using only the averages or use the entire distribution. These are two different questions. For the second part, you could use something like the bhattacharya coefficient or the Kullback-Leiber distance as the (dis)similarity measure. Bear in mind that the two approaches will give you different clusters.I think you can also specify different assumptions for the underlying variances in the mclust package.
