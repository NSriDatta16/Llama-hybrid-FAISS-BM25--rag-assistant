Logistic regression for abiotic influences on behavior

What I am looking to do is test for a correlation between an activity (in this case nesting) with cumulative rainfall from the previous two weeks. For example, say one individual nested on DayX where the total rainfall from the previous 2 weeks is 4cm and another individual nested on DayY with 8cm of prior rain, and there are days where it had rained with no nesting events. An example of the data is such: Day 2wk_rain number_nested number_available 1 2 0 9 2 2 0 9 3 4 0 9 4 3 1 9 5 6 1 9 6 2 2 9 : : : : 15 8 9 9 Analyzing this with cumulative rainfall throughout the period seemed straightforward, but when I decided to look further at a more localized temporal scale it threw me for a loop. My main objective is to find out whether rainfall can trigger nesting behavior within a few days, hence scaling it down. I still think I need to stick with logistic regression due to the nature of the response variable, but how I go about analyzing it and presenting it in an understandable way seems to elude me.
