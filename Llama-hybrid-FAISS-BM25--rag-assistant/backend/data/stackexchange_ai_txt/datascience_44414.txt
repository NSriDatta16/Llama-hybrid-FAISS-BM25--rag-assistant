Preprocessing for finetuned CNN model from pretrained models

Is it necessary to preprocess the images the same way as they were during the training of pretrained models in our finetuned model to use it for a different classification task ? Say, I have a pretrained VGG16 model which I am finetuning to use it for a different classification task ? Now, before feeding my dataset to this finetuned model, should I necessarily use vgg16.preprocess_input() for training on this dataset or I can use my own preprocess_input ?
