is it bayesian to calibrate probabilities

I am getting introduced to Bayesian framework for modelling. I generally use glm models for large datasets of the order ~10m. While I understand that it may not make much difference if I use frequentist or bayesian approach for modelling such a large data. However I also use Naive Bayes to calibrate the resulting posterior probabilities. Is this approach considered truly bayesian, irrespective of the size of the data?
