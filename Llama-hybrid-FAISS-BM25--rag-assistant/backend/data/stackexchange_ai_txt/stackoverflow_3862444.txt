How to define two persistence units (one for production, one for unit testing)?

This is my stateless bean: @Stateless public class Finder { @PersistenceContext(unitName = "production") EntityManager em; [...] } It explicitly defines that the name of persistence unit is production . This unit is configured in persistence.xml , and everything is fine. When I'm unit testing this class I have to use another persistence unit, with different set of properties and configuration settings. How should I organize it? Create another element in persistence.xml ? Does any best practice exist for this?
