how to break the input character into grid format?

Hey, i have been trying to create a program on neural networks using Java language,which will be used for character recognition. we want to use the bitmap image of all 26 characters stored earlier. the problem is in breaking the input character into grid format with variable dimension so that we can overlap it on the pre-created bitmap images. till now, i haven't been able to get any information related this problem.
