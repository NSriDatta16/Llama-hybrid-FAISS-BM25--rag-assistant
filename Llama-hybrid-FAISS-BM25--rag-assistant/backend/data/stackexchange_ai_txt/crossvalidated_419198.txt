Splitting on noise features sometimes yields information gain (reduction in entropy, reduction in gini) purely by chance. When more noise features are included, it's more likely that the subsample of features selected at each split will be entirely composed of noise features. When this happens, no signal features are available. By the same token, the split quality is probably lower than it would be had a signal feature been used, so more splits (i.e. a deeper tree) will be required to attain the termination criteria (usually leaf purity). Typically, random forest is set up to split until leaf purity. This can be a source of overfitting; indeed, the fact that your random forest is pulling in noise features for splits indicates that some amount of overfitting is taking place. To regularize the model, you can impose limitations on tree depth, the minimum information gain required to split, the number of samples to split, or leaf size to attempt to forestall spurious splits. The improvement in model quality from doing so is usually modest. These claims draw from the discussion in Hastie et al, Elements of Statistical Learning , p. 596 More information about how spurious features behave in random forest can be found in https://explained.ai/rf-importance/
