I think PHPUnit uses XDebug, which provides literally coverage data for files actually executed. It can't provide data for files never executed, because the debugger never sees them. You could hand-patch the PHPUnit machinery to add a list of all the files you believe are in your application, to the result returned from XDebug. Our PHP Test Coverage tool works differently. You give it a list of all the files you think are part of your application; it helps you build this list. (This is the same list you'd have to patch into the first solution) It instruments all the files mentioned, and collects test coverage data. The coverage data you get now includes everything correctly. It should work fine with PHPUnit. You can go further. You can create test coverage for each of your "seperate" applications, and run them separately. You can then combine the coverage data for all them, to see coverage for the overall set.
