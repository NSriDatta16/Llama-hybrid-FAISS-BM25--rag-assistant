Best way to transpose a grid of data in a file

I have large data files of values on a 2D grid. They are organized such that subsequent rows of data in the grid are subsequent lines in the file. Each column is separated by a tab character. Essentially, this is a CSV file, but with tabs instead of columns. I need the transpose the data (first row becomes first column) and output it to another file. What's the best way to do this? Any language is okay (I prefer to use Perl or C/C++). Currently, I have Perl script just read in the entire file into memory, but I have files which are simply gigantic.
