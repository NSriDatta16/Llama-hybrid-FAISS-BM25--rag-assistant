Free Tool(s) / Tips to assist me in filling out forms on Win7?

I am doing some web development on some long forms. There are many fields for me to fill out to get through the form. Instead of typing out the same things every time (contact information, address, business information) I'm hoping there is some tool out there / combination of tools that will assist me in filling this out. Requirements: I am doing development / testing in FF, IE, and Chrome on a Win 7 system, so the tool would leverage one of those platforms. Oh yeah, one more thing: It's got to be free and lightweight, otherwise, I'd rather just type out responses to the form fields.
