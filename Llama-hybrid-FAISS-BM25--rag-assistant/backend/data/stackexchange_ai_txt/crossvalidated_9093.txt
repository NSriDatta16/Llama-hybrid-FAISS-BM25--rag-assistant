Some people think of programming as simply entering a command line statement. At that point then perhaps you are a bit lost in encouraging them. However, if they are using spreadsheets already then they already have to enter formulas. These are akin to command line statements. If they really mean they don't want to do any programming in the sense of logical and automated analysis then you can tell them that they can still do the analyses in R or Stata without any programming at all. If they can do their stats in the spreadsheet... all that they want to do... then all of the statistical analyses they wish to accomplish can be done without 'programming' in R or Stata as well. They could arrange and organize the data in the spreadsheet and then just export it as text. Then the analysis is carried out without any programming at all. That's how I do intro to R sometimes. No programming is required to do the data analysis you could do in a spreadsheet. If you get them hooked that way then just reel the fish in slowly... :) In a couple of years compliment them on what a good programmer they've become. You might also want to show this document to your colleagues or at least read it yourself to better make your points.
