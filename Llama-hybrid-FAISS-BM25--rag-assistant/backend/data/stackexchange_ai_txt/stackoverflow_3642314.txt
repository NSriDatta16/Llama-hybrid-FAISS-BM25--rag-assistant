My recommendation would be to either use a master page, or break the code out into a static function that takes a System.Web.UI.Page object as a parameter. Of course, you could always use inheritance (which will work), but you will lose the ability to layout your page using drag-and-drop design time functionality, since the VS.NET web form designer does a big freakout with ASPX pages that don't derive from System.Web.UI.Page or System.Web.UI.MasterPage directly.
