As long as the client keeps a connection open you can send the data. If you are using http then the connection is closed after each request, unless you use something like Comet. You can look on wikipedia, but this article may be helpful from a java POV: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2008/jw-03-asynchhttp-test.html Update If you are using a regular socket-based server and a client that is set up to have a constant connection, you are free to send the data whenever you want, as long as the connection is open. It will only be closed by those connected, or a network problem. But, if you are using http then the rules change a bit, which is what the second paragraph is for.
