You should name your classes so the underscore ( _ ) translates to the directory separator ( / ). A few PHP frameworks do this, such as Zend and Kohana. So, you name your class Model_Article and place the file in classes/model/article.php and then your autoload does... function __autoload($class_name) { $filename = str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, strtolower($class_name)).'.php'; $file = AP_SITE.$filename; if ( ! file_exists($file)) { return FALSE; } include $file; } Also note you can use spl_autoload_register() to make any function an autoloading function. It is also more flexible, allowing you to define multiple autoload type functions. If there must be multiple autoload functions, spl_autoload_register() allows for this. It effectively creates a queue of autoload functions, and runs through each of them in the order they are defined. By contrast, __autoload() may only be defined once. Edit Note : __autoload has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 7.2.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. Please refer to PHP documentation for more details. http://php.net/manual/en/function.autoload.php
