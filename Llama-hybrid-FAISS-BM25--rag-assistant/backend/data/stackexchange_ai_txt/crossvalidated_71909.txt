Check whether your leave-one-out procedure leaves out a single sample each time or a triplet of samples (one for each class). If it leaves only a single sample, then your training set is always biased against the test sample. That can explain below chance performance. For example, consider a classifier that instead of looking at the data, simply outputs the most common label of the training set - that would achieve 0% classification rate in a leave one-sample out scheme. You are of course not using such classifier, but classifiers like SVM do have some susceptibility to bias.
