This website has a really nice overview of the different methods for storing hierarchical data in mysql and PHP. To answer your question, the easiest way is to use php and recursion. There are other methods you could use such as the modified preorder transversal , which don't require multiple database queries. But this method can be more complex to implement when dealing with a lot of insertions and updates. Another really cool method and my personal favorite is the so called "closure table" / "adjacency relation" mentioned in What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? Regarding your comment you basically have to make a loop or a recursive function that selects the parent of chicago, then the parent of the parent and so forth. $stack = array(); $parent = 3; while($parent != 0){ $data = (put your mysql to get the row with parentID = $parent) $parent = data['parentID']; $stack[] = $data; } $stack = array_reverse($stack); Stack will then contain the parents of Chicago, (ie. location, USA)
