How to calculate error of percentage ratio?

I have the following problem: I am counting a subset of cells from a tissue in Drosophila (fruit fly) at different days after "birth". At Day0 I obtain a population of flies, and dissect some of these flies at each time-point (I.e. I have a population of 30 flies at Day0. I dissect 3 of them right away, 3 more after 1 day, another 3 after 3 days, and so on up to 15 days after birth). To obtain these results I need to dissect (thus killing) the fly, so I cannot assay the differences in a single individual fly changing overtime, but I can assay the differences in the whole population. What I obtain is a n number of around 50 for each timepoint. I could just plot the average for each timepoint on a chart and show the variation overtime this way. I would use standard error of the mean to build up the error bars. My problem is that I need to show these data not as raw data, but as a ratio over the first Day, in order to better show the decrease in the cell number overtime. To do this, I am showing my data as a percentage ratio over day0 [(Day1Mean/Day0Mean)*100]. To make it more clear: Day0 mean: 5 Day1 mean: 4 Day3 mean: 3.5 Day6 mean: 3.5 Day9 mean: 3 Day12 mean: 2.5 Day15 mean: 2 Instead of making a dispersion chart with those data (that are the average of the number of cells I counted) I would like to show them this way: Day0: (Day0/Day0)*100 = 100% Day1: (Day1/Day0)*100 = 80% Day3: (Day3/Day0)*100 = 70% Day6: (Day6/Day0)*100 = 70% Day9: (Day9/Day0)*100 = 60% Day12: (Day12/Day0)*100 = 50% Day15: (Day15/Day0)*100 = 40% Now my problem is this: If I am using the "raw" data, I can just plot them in and use the standard error calculated on the mean. I cannot use the standard error with the second kind of setup since my number is completely different. If it was possible I would have liked to "convert" the standard error to the new visualization. I thought it could be possible with some kind of mathematical transformation, in a similar way as reported in this document: http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/Accuracy/PercChg.pdf Many thanks for Your help
