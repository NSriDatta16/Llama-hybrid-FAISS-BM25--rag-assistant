Bayesian parameter estimation of a Poisson process with change/no-change observations at irregular intervals

Consider a Poisson process with unknown parameter $\lambda$. We perform a sequence of $n$ observations at intervals $\overline{t}=t_1,\,t_2,\,\dots,\,t_n$. Each observation is a binary variable $x_i$ equal to zero if no changes occurred during interval $t_i$ or equal to one if one or more changes occurred: $\forall i,$ $\Pr[X_i = 0 | \lambda,\,t_i] = \exp(-\lambda t_i)$ $\Pr[X_i = 1 | \lambda,\,t_i] = 1 - \exp(-\lambda t_i)$ The likelihood function for all observations is: $P[\overline{x}| \lambda,\overline{t}] = (\prod_{x_i=0}\exp(-\lambda t_i)) \cdot (\prod_{x_i=1}(1-\exp(-\lambda t_i)))$ Assuming that the observation intervals are chosen independently from anything else, I would like to estimate the parameter $\lambda$ under some reasonable prior $\lambda^\star = argmax_\lambda P[\lambda | \overline{x},\,\overline{t}]$ $P[\lambda | \overline{x},\,\overline{t}] \propto P[\overline{x}| \lambda,\overline{t}] \cdot P[\lambda]$ If possible, I would like to use a conjugate prior in order to perform recursive estimation, but I'm not sure whether one exists. My questions: 1. Does a conjugate prior for that likelihood exist? 2. If a conjugate prior does not exist, what estimator can I use? I'm interested in an estimator that can be updated incrementally for each observation, without keeping track of all the observation history.
