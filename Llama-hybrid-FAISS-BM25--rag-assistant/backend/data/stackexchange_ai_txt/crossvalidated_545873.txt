Brain tumour detection using CNN

I have a fairly basic mathematical and implementational understanding of ML algorithms and CNNs, and I am trying to think of an approach for this task: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data?select=test . The "data" section explains the task and also gives a preview of the dataset. 1) Doubts on general Implementation approach. From what I understand, we have 4 input parameters: FLAIR , T1W, T1Gd, and T2W. (call them $x_{1}$ , $x_{2}$ , $x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$ ). Based on these 4 parameters, we have to compute the "MGMT status"(Presence of MGMT), which is binary, i,e takes on values ( $0/1$ ). We can then use a CNN architecture that has $1,x1,x2,x3,x4$ in it's input layer, and uses a sigmoid activation function (to get the output in $(0,1)$ ). However, this approach works if the $x_{i}$ s were numeric values . However, in my case, the parameters FLAIR , T1Gd etc are in the form of images . Now, I am aware that images are fed to neural networks as inputs, eg. in object detection programs, however in those examples a single image is fed as an input, and features are subsequently extracted by the network. How should I approach my particular case, where I have multiple images as input parameters?
