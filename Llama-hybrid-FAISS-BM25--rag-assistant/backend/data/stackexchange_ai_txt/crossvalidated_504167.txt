PCA with components of the same size as the feature-vector

I have implemented a model where I use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of my feature vectors. I would to look at how the model would perform if I skip the step of dimensionality reduction. As I have implemented quite some lines to normalize the vectors after PCA, it would be quite some work to "delete" PCA. Now my Question is if I use as many components for PCA as the feautre-vector has dimensions, would the feature-vector after PCA still be the "same"? I know that the components of PCA would build a new coordinate system, but the vectors itself would still be of the same proportions right?
