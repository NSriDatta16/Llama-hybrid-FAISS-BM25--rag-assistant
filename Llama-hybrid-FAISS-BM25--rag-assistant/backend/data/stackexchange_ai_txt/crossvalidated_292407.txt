ARMA vs AR process differences

According to wold representation theorem every covariance-stationary time series can be written as a linear combination of lagged values of a white noise process (MA(∞) representation). Now if a MA(∞) representation can be written in terms of an AR(1), why is there a need of using an ARMA model?
