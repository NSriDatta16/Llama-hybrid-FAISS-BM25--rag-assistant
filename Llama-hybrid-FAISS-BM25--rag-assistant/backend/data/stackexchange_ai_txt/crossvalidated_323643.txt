how to analyze overdispersed binary data

In my substantive research, I often use dichotomous scoring (1 correct, 0 wrong) for my tests (tests with $15~yes/no$ items). My goal is often to compare the the proportion of correct answers to all items across two groups (e.g., $n1 = n2 = 25$). Each test-taker's sum of $15$ item scores, will be binomially distributed. But we want to compare $25$ such test-takers from group1 to $25$ other independent test-takers in group2. What is a reasonable plan to do such a comparison (preferably via Bayesian estimation )? Note: I believe such a data may be 'overdispersed' due to the fact that $p$ (probability of success) may not be common within each group. Here is my data comprised of sum of $15$ $yes/no$ item scores for each person in the R code: group1 = c(7, 11, 10, 9, 7, 11, 7, 7, 9, 9,12,11,11, 9,10, 8,10, 9, 5,10, 8, 7,11, 9, 12) group2 = c(6, 7, 3, 7, 10, 7, 7, 8, 7, 6, 9, 8, 9, 5, 9, 7, 9, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 4, 7, 9)
