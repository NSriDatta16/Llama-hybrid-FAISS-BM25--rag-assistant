Reinforcement learning in real world without OpenAI Gym

I have been searching for reinforcement learning libraries or examples that aren't using a simulated environment like OpenAI Gym. I havn't been successful at all until yet and I would really appreciate if someone knows some examples/libraries. If someone is familiar with Optunas ask-and-tell procedure, thats would be exactly what I am looking for.
