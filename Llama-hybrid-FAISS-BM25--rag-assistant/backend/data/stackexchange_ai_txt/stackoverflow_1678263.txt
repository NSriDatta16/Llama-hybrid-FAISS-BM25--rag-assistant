How can I extend Moose's automatic pragma exports?

You know how Moose automatically turns on strict and warnings during import? I want to extend that behavior by turning on autodie and use feature ':5.10' in my Moose classes. I've tracked down where Moose does this, in Moose::Exporter , which assembles a custom import sub for Moose that calls strict->import and warnings->import for the calling class. However, I can't figure out a way to extend this import method in a Moose-ish way. How should I handle this? http://www.friedo.com/bullwinkle.gif
