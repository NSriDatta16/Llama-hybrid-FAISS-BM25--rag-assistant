Latex --- Is there a way to shift the equation numbering one tab space from the right margin (shift towards left)?

I have been formatting my dissertation and one little problem is stucking me up. I used the following code to typeset an equation \begin{align} & R=\frac{P^2}{P+S'} \label{eqn:SCS}\\ &\mbox {where} \quad \mbox R = \mbox {Watershed Runoff} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox P = \mbox{Rainfall} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox S' = \mbox{Storage in the watershed $=\frac{1000}{CN}-10$ }\notag \end{align} My output requirement is such that: The equation should begin one tab space from the left margin The equation number should end at one tab space from the right margin With the above code, I have the equation begin at the right place but not the numbering. Any help will be extremely appreciated. Thanks MP
