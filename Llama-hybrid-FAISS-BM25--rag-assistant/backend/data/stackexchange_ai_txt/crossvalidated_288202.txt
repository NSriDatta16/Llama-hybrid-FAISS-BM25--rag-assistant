SAS PCA first 10 eigenvalues only explains 10% of the variance

I am running a Principal Component Analysis on intra-day second level returns of all the stocks that trade in the U.S. The matrix is constructed as where each row is the return of all stocks in each second. For example: 9:30:00 (SPY, S&P500, AAPL, MSFT, …, BABA, BIDU, AMZN) 9:30:01 (SPY, S&P500, AAPL, MSFT, …, BABA, BIDU, AMZN) However, the PCA results are kind of weird. It seems that the first 10 eigenvalues only explain 10% of the total variance. Is this normal? If capital asset pricing model CAPM holds, I expect a market portfolio that explains most of the variance in the daily stock return data. But this is not the case. I am using SAS to run the PCA. The code I am using: ods output Eigenvectors=PRINCEEV Eigenvalues=PRINCEEVAL; proc princomp data=REPLACED; run; ods output close;
