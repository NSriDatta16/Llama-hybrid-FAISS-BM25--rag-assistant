How to paginate a QPlainTextEdit?

I've been using QPlainTextEdit for editing text in our application. Recently it was decided that we need to display the text in a paginated format instead of a consistent block of text. After lots of research, I've come to the realization that while QPlainTextEdit does not have any knowledge of pages or pagination, QPlainTextDocument does. It sounds like internally we want to be doing the pagination, but what I can't figure out is how to modify QPlainTextEdit to show the text in pages instead of a gigantic field. Side note: I know it doesn't matter but I am using qtruby, not plain Qt.
