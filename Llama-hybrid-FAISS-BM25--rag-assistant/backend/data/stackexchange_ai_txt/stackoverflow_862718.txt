Well, based on the practice by many larger corporations and organizations to wait until a service pack 1 is available for any given Microsoft product, it might still be a while before you can deploy SQL Server 2010 - pardon me: 2008 R2 :-) SQL Server 2008 is indeed quite an extensive update, and if you have the option to deploy it, I personally would definitely recommend doing so. It does have a plethora of new features that no doubt will make your life easier one way or another. Marc
