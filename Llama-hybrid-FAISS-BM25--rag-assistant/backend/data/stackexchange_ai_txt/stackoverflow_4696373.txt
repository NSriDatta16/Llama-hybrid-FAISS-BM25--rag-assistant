styling p tags but not when they have a tags

My first post here and unfortunately it won't be that exciting and I need an answer that includes IE6. To get space between paragraphs, I'm styling my tags like this: div.content_cms p { margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px 15px 0px 0px; } The margin bottom to space the paragraphs. This of course works fine. But then I also need to style a link with html is this: Text When there is a link as in the example above, I don't want the margin-bottom to be applied. I tried to fix it with this: div.content_cms p a { margin-bottom: 0px !important; } Which of course doesn't work. I'm adding a class to the tags with jQuery so I can automatically add an icon to links. I tried adding margin-bottom: 0px !important; to the class I'm adding with jQuery but that didn't work either. What's the best way to style spacing between paragraphs with text but not paragraphs with links? Thank you.
