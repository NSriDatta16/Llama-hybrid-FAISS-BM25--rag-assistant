Where can I get an enterprise directory structure?

I want to be able to load up an Active Directory server with a realistic medium-to-large enterprise directory structure (groups, users) so that I can run performance tests on an application which makes use of that data. In my fantasy world, some big company would export their (anonymized) AD structure in a way I could import directly. Since this seems unlikely to happen, does anyone know of a source for test data that would provide a reasonable simulation of a 10-to-100k employee organization's structure? I could generate data myself, but I don't want to make too many assumptions about levels of group nesting, how many groups a given user is a direct member of, etc.
