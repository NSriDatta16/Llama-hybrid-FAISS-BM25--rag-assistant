Most common way of evaluating SVM classifier

I used a SVM to classify my features. With cross validation, on my testing set, I obtained an accuracy of 81%. I want to measure how good/bad this is. Is the technical term for good/bad statistical significance? With my SVM we predict that an 8 dimensional feature vector is in 1 out of the 2 classes. I wanted to use a permutation test to find the p-value, but I do not know what to use for the test statistic. What can I use for the test statistic? Is this the wrong line of thought? What else can I do to show that 81% is a good/bad baseline? Thanks for all the help!
