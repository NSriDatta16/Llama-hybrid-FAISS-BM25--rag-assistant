Changing constraints on the fly

I have a dijit.form.NumberTextBox input field that starts out with these parms: new dijit.form.NumberTextBox({ id: din1, style: "width:60px", constraints: { places: 0, pattern: '######' } }, din1); Everything works great..My question is I would like to change 'places' and 'pattern' parms on the fly. So I wrote this to change 'places' and 'patterns' parms: var myFldObj = dijit.byId(din1); if (myFldObj) { var myConstObj = myFldObj.attr('constraints'); if (myConstObj) { myConstObj.places = 2; myConstObj.pattern = '#####.0'; } } So, after I show the form again, I'd expect the entry field to allow 2 decimal places but the form still acts like places=0 and pattern='######'. When I check the values of 'places' and 'pattern' I get what I'd expect (2 and #####.0). My question: Can you change these values on the fly?? OR Do you have to destroy the original dijit object and recreate with new parms?? Thx!!
