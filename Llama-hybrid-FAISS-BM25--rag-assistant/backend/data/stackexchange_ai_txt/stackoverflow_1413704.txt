Use now() or sysdate() in your insert query: insert into mytable set datetimefield=sysdate() Just make sure that the server time is synchronised, and that it's in the right timezone. Otherwise you'll have to do some extra tricks to shift the date/time. If timing is crucial, keep this in mind: As of MySQL 5.0.13, SYSDATE() returns the time at which it executes. This differs from the behavior for NOW(), which returns a constant time that indicates the time at which the statement began to execute. (Within a stored routine or trigger, NOW() returns the time at which the routine or triggering statement began to execute.)
