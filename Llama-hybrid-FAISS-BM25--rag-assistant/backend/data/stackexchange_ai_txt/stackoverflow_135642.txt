how to add a simple message to a php-gtk statusbar?

I have a simple GtkStatusBar created with glade,and want to add a simple message with the date of the last update of the database (just a simple and plain date). I don't want to use the whole stacks, context and all the other things that gtk developers put on the statusbar code. (I could simply use a label but I would like to keep the drag bar). I'm using Gtk 2.0.1 with php 5.2.6;
