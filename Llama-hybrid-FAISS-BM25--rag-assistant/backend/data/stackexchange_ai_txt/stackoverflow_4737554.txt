I would like to throw my hat in the ring for this as well. Not because I want to get something out of it, but more that I enjoy being able to contribute to the community. I've been around here for quite a while and I try to stay on top of questions. I personally try to do what I can to encourage questions to be kept open if they are relevant, and forming a sense of community. Yes, I understand we don't want duplicates, but the tone and nature of the discussion is something I always pay attention to. StackOverflow is a great community and I always try to do my best to help those that are new to understand the rules, without taking on a negative tone. I think the combination of my experience and contributions and my dedication to keeping this a peaceful place would make me a good candidate for moderator on the site. I also have existing experience serving as a moderator on other online communities.
