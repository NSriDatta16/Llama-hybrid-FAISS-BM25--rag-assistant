Is possible to inherit from SPWeb?

Is possible to inherit from SharePoint classes such like: SPWeb, SPList etc. or this classes are sealed? I couldn't find right answer. Chris Thanks for replys. Rich, you are right - the constructors are internal. So it means that I coudn't extend the functionality of these classes in any elegance way?
