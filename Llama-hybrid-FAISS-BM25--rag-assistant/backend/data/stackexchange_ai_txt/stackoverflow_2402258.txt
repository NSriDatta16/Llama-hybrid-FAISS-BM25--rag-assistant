php: what is the fastest way to display related data between three db tables

I'm looking for the best way to display data from 3 tables. Let me explain. I have one master table that lists events each event can have a number of categories so I'm using a join table linking the categories to the events. I want to loop through all the events and display under each event the categories that have been related via the join table and I'm not sure what is the most efficient way of doing so? more info: I can easily do this by adding in an SQL statement placed inside the events loop which pulls out the selected categories by updating the event id in the statement each time it loops, but I'm sure there is a more elegant method which uses one sql query which creates an array that can then be used within the events loop - I'm just not sure where i should start looking?
