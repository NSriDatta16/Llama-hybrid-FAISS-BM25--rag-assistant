Does weighting the Likelihood Ratios by a prior give the Likelihood ratios any Bayesian property?

I have a question regarding Bayesian Hypothesis testing using "Bayes Factors". Does weighting the Likelihood Ratios by a prior give the Likelihood ratios any property (e.g., removing conditionality on Hypotheses, changing p(Data | Hypothesis) =to=> p(Hypothesis | Data) etc.) that Likelihood ratios did not have before weighting? If not, what does multiplying likelihood ratios by a prior do to Likelihood ratios? Here is R code to compute a Bayes Factor for a binomial experiment: h = 35 ## Number of `h`eads n = 100 ## All Trials p0 = .5 ## probability of each head x = seq(0, 1, len = 1e5) prior = dbeta(x, 1, 1) Like.ratios = dbinom(h, n, x) / dbinom(h, n, p0) W.Like.ratios = Like.ratios * prior ## `W` stands for `W`eighted BF10 = mean(W.Like.ratios) ## A Bayes Factor(H1/H0)
