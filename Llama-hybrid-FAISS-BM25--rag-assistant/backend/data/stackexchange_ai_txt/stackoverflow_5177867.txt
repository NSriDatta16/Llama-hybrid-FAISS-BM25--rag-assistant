How to find out about the "snapped to" element for jQuery UI draggable elements on snap

I'm working a few draggable elements that should be snapping to other elements, which all have classes, something like, ".classes" and also a unique id, "#class_id" . Once the draggable elements are done being dragged, I would like to find out which of those ".classes" that the draggable element has snapped to. I suppose I could compute the closest element based on the current position of the dragged element, but I feel there should be an easier way than brute force, since jQuery would have to keep some sort of variable to make sure the snapping works. Any suggestions? Thanks!
