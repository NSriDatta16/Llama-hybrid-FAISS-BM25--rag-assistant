Graduate Level Degree for Simulation/Statistics/Prediction?

I am wondering if anyone has any insight into this. I am thinking of going to grad school to get some computer science related degree. I have always been intrigued by people who are working on problems using statistical packages or simulation to solve problems. What would I study to get a good breadth of knowledge of these things? Do they fall into machine learning? Thanks
