Want to extend XML Web part, what is the easiest way when the existing Web-part is sealed class?

I need to extend XML Web-part to allow some custom properties. What is the easiest way as the existing XML Web-Part class is sealed? The extended custom properties will be used to derive attributes of the XML Web-part like XML Url, XSL Url etc. -Gandalf
