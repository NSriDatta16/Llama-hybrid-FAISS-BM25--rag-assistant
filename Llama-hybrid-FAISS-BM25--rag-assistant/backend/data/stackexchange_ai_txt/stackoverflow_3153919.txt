Sean, are you asking if it is possible to have more then one custom pipeline per assembly? If so then yes. Whether or not it is a good idea is more organizational then anything. Personally we generally decide by our deployment needs or desires. Do we want to be able to deploy the pipelines piecemeal or by a certain customer where multiple pipelines makes sense.
