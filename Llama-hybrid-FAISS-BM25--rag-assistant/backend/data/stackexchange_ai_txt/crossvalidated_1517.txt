Useful statistical functions for business -- for use by a newbie

I am a database developer working for a sales and manufacturing business. I am mostly ignorant about statistics. We need useful metrics. Our managers are tuned to accounting, and the vagaries of production tend to confound us. We do very little measuring of our production, and what we have is poorly formed. I should note we are a "job shop", not a "flow shop" -- we do a lot of engineer-to-order work, so the usual MRP standards are often hard to apply. Some tradition business metrics are known to us; for example "inventory turn-over rate." But we are unable to convert those to useful information. I believe our inability to qualify data statistically is a big reason why. Of course we perform averaging all the time. Rolling averages (smoothing data over time using a 3-week rolling average, for example) is a helpful extension. Recently I discovered how to apply standard deviation to labor costing with wonderful benefits. Now that I understand (A) averaging, (B) rolling averages, and (C) standard deviation, what are the next useful functions or functions I should seek to learn? I would love to have your insights on "business intelligence," I mean defining and using metrics. But it's the use of stats to get from raw data to usable information that I'm really after. No matter, give me whatever you've got.
