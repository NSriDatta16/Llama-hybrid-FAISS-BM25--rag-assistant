The Java programming language provides two built-in classes for representing floating-point numbers: float, and double. The " Float " class takes 4 bytes of storage, and have 23 binary digits of precision . The " Double " class takes 8 bytes of storage, and have 52 binary digits of precision . In your example, you create one-of-each, but they have different digits of precision.
