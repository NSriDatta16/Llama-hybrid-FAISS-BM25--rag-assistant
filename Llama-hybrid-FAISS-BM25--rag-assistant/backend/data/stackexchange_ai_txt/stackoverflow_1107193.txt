I finally got this to work after, like, 4 separate tries after incurring the same problem that was originally posted. So here's what happened, I am not sure if this is an old issue now (2009-07-09), but I will post anyway in case it is helpful to you. What worked for me... might work for you... start anew and delete the old private keys, public keys, and certificates in the keychain go through the whole process, request a certificate from a certificate authority, get a new public key, a new private key, and a new certificate. Note: when it worked I had exactly one private key, one public key, and one certificate Make a new provisioning profile (which utilizes the certificate that you just made) and put that in your organizer window in Xcode. Delete all the old BS. Run it. Hopefully this helps.
