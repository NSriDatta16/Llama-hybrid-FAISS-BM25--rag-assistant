Variables for SVM

I would like to predict if an email is spam or not spam based on the information that I have, i.e. date, email address, subject and text. Three of these parameters are text data, so they would need to encode them. Letâ€™suppose the model considered is SVM (I read this algorithm is very common in text classification), could you please provide me an example of how it works (encoding part)? What I would need is an explanation of steps required to considered variables that may be important for prediction, for example: subject, text, key words, email address (for instance: @paybal could be a misleading address). It would be great if you could show me how to integrate the variables into the model (numerical and text)
