Running a simple linear regression model on the 300 pairs is a viable option. However, as you suspected, it would presume that there is no difference between the individuals. So the next possibility would be to fit a new model for each of the 30 people, giving you 30 different models. This, however, would ignore the fact, that those 30 datasets (of size 10) all come from the same experiment, always with human beings, which would suggest that they should be similar. That's why you might want to consider random effect models , which, intuitively, fit a new model for each individual but at the same time make sure that they are similar, borrowing information from each other. There are good implementations available, e.g. in R . In your situation, the standard first step would be to use a random intercept and a random slope. Other models, which also combine the individual time series in a smart way instead of considering them either equal or independent, thus benefitting from correlations, would be e.g. VAR , state space models , or fully-fledged Bayesian models , but those are somehow more involved.
