A redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is a technology that provides increased storage reliability through redundancy. RAID 0 generally doesn't provide higher input / output speeds because any given file that you want to access is striped across the two disks. If you have huge files, you might see some improvement in read access times in a RAID 0 configuration. Higher levels of RAID provide redundancy, not necessarily performance.
