In many organizations (OSS or other), the first digit of a version corresponds to a complete new generation of products, usually tied to a major reorganization of the code base or even a complete rewrite. Releases that bring significant change, but are still built upon the same architecture or internal framework would see their second digit change. One usually adds a third digit or a release number for minor maintenance releases. Without explicit examples, I'd guess that is the kind of numbering scheme you're seeing.
