RIA Services, how do I organize the services?

I am working on a project that is going to be using RIA services. The visual studio solution file has 2 projects, one for the UI and the other for the domain logic. The initial approach was to have multiple domain service classes inside of the domain logic project (to keep it organized). After receiving a certain compile error I came across this issue with RIA. http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/111058/257398.aspx So my question is, if I have to use one service file it is going to have thousands of stubs and queries because of the magnitude of the database/project, how would I go about organizing this. An even better question would be, Is there a workaround to the problem listed in that forums post I linked. Thanks in advance for the responses.
