Embedding IronRuby in C# and DateTime

When I embed IronRuby what is the proper way to get a reference to either Ruby's DateTime/Date classes or .NET's System.DateTime. I'm running into errors when I try require 'date' I get the error - no such file to load -- date when I try require 'mscorlib.dll' I get the error - no such file to load -- mscorlib.dll What is the right way to do either of these? UPDATE : see comments to Jon Skeet
