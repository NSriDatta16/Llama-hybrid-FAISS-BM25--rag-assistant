I can think of some sophisticated approaches that might work better (e.g., shooter as a random effect in a logistic regression), but sticking two groups of $100$ counts of hits into a two-sample t-test seems like it would be a solid approach. Since that just multiplies the values by the ten shots taken instead of using the proportion of hits (since everyone takes ten shots), this isn’t fundamentally different from what you seem to have proposed. If your advisor gripes about a t-test requiring normality of the two groups as well as equal variance: Welch’s t-test, which is the default in R software through t.test , handles the case where equal variances are not safe to assume (which I think it is not safe to assume here). Both the usual and Welch t-test are quite robust to deviations from normality. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test ( wilcox.test in R) could be a viable alternative.
