It's because the "method=get" section of the form implies that the query values have to come from the form values. The collection which contains "id=value" is overidden by the collection containing the form values. This behaviour seems to be built into each browser, so I expect that it's part of the HTML specification. Update Ahah: This has been asked before: submitting a GET form with query string params and hidden params disappear To Quote: As the specifications (RFC1866, page 46; HTML 4.x section 17.13.3) state: If the method is "get" and the action is an HTTP URI, the user agent takes the value of action, appends a `?' to it, then appends the form data set, encoded using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type.
