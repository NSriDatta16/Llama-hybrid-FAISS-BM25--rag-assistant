I would fit a multilevel model. You would have to put your data in long format, with each time being whenever the person responded. $Response_{it} = \gamma_{00} + \beta_1Time + u_{0i} + e_{it}$ Where: $\gamma_{00}$ is the average intercept across subjects $\beta_1$ is the fixed effect of time $u_{0i}$ is how much a subject deviates from the average intercept $e_{it}$ is the residual term The R code in lme4 would look something like: response ~ 1 + time + (1|animal) Observations would be nested within animal. Multilevel models allow some people to have 3 measurement occasions, others 10. Some can have times at 7, 10, 13, and 21 days, another animal could have times at 10, 30, and 50 days.
