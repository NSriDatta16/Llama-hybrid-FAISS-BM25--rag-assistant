One method that could be used in a situation like this - although one would need to take a great deal of caution in doing so - is linear interpolation . For argument's sake, let's suppose that you are trying to forecast hourly temperature values. At 12:00am, the outside temperature is 7째C, and rises to 15째C by 3:00pm that day. Given that 8/9 = 0.8889, one could conclude that the temperature is rising by 0.8889째C per hour within that time period, and formulate dummy data that "fills in the blanks" of the time series, so to speak. However, as I mentioned, such a method requires a great degree of care and knowledge regarding the proper structure of your data. One obvious disadvantage is that this method does not account for outliers, e.g. the temperature could drop to 2째C at 6:00am before rising - the data will never follow a perfect linear pattern. Your best bet is to try to obtain real data wherever it is possible. Simulating data in this manner could be another option, but it is not ideal and you need to take a lot of care in doing so.
