Can a neural network work with support datawhich was not there while training?

I am giving a hypothetical example to convey my question. Suppose I want to train a neural network that abbreviates strings with a preset list of words that are likely to be present in full form of the word. So database = db because data and base are words. We can definitely train a network that can be trained to learn this kind of mapping given large training set with enough instances for each word. But can I train a general neural network which can work with a novel set of words with pre-trained network In my example, I should be able to train a network which once trained can accept a new set of words that might appear in the examples without a need for retraining with those words. I am thinking something along the lines of NN working with support data which could be changed as per needs.
