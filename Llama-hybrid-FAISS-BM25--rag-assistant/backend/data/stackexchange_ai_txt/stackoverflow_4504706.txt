Okay Guys, I caved in and began writing my own simple class. I'm using XFBML but i'm not using the name spaced tag in my doctype, nor am I using xhtml. Those were the two things that bugged me about it. Not sure if this is correct but it is working for me in modern browsers. If you are interested, here's my code. http://pastebin.com/qmgpmJYU To use it, change your app key and secret (either in the init function or directly in the class). Then call facebook::fetch(); just before the end of the body. you can then use facebook::user_info() to detect if a user is logged in, and pop in the login button if they are not.
