A gotcha for asp.net applications: the processing of a single request might switch threads, namely if there are parallel requests in the same session. Because of this, anything you put in TLS before the HttpApplication.PostRequireRequestState event might not be there later, because you are on a different thread. [Edit by the asker] For my particular use case, I ended up adding a key-value pair to the SqlException.Data dictionary, which I then retrieve when I log the exception details. This gives me the functionality I was hoping to use thread local storage for.
