I doubt you will find any photos sites supporting https. One of the main problems with running a website over https is that nothing gets cached - this would potentially cause a large increase in bandwidth usage for the site serving up the photos. Consider whether you need to use https for something that is viewing photos, or whether your site could better be organised so that you use https to log in, or edit secure content, but switch back to http when you are simply viewing non-secure content such as photos. Under Internet Explorer, you will never be able to get around the secure/non-secure message problem.
