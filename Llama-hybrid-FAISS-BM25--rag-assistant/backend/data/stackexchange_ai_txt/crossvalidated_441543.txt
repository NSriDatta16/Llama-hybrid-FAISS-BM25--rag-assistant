Meaning of Neural Network Doesnt Imply More Structure on the Model

I am watching a video on Thompson Sampling for Machine Learning and at [16:38] the presenter mentions that we can use various models to fit the data, (such as Gaussian Process, SVM in my opinion), but he used Neural network as it doesnt imply any structure on the model so it can go and discover what ever. What does in it mean that neural Network doesnt imply any structure, what is structure here?
