In my experience, putting any application logic in the database always results in a WTF. It doesn't matter how smart the database programmer, how advanced the database, it always ends up being a mistake. The reverse question is "how often should my C# code manage relational data using its own flat-file structure and query language", to which the answer is (almost) always never . I think the database should be used for data storage, which is what it's good at.
