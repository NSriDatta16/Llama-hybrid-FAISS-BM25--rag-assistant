If your just looking to run a command and get a copy of a web site, use the tools that others have suggested, such as wget , curl , or some of the GUI tools. I use my own personal tool that I call webreaper (that's not the Windows WebReaper though. There are a few Perl programs I know about, including webmirror and a few others you can find on CPAN . If you're looking to do this inside a Perl program you are writing (since you have the "perl" tag on your answer), there are many tools in CPAN that can help you at each step: Downloading content: LWP::Simple , LWP::UserAgent , WWW::Mechanize Link extraction: HTML::LinkExtor , HTML::SimpleLinkExtor Link rewriting: HTML::Parser Good luck, :)
