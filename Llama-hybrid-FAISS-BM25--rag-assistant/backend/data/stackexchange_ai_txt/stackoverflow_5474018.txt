Magento: product pages (only) throw error

So I've created a new install of Magento 1.4.1.1, set up the whole system again from scratch, installed the theme, and brought in the products from a csv file from previous install (same version). All is working well now, homepage, category pages, account pages - all good. When you click on a PRODUCT, to go to the product page, Magento throws the "There has been an error..." page. Every product, simple, config, and I made a couple of new products too, these give the same error. Have not edited the .htaccess file, have flushed and re-indexed everything. Can anyone recommend something to try? I've got a hunch it's a URL re-write issue, but I havent really done anything to cause this. Before importing the products I cleared the url fields in the csv file too, to allow the server to make new ones. Urgent help required - am very greatful for your help.
