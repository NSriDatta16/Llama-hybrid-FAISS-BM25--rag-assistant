(This is not yet an answer - but it may develop into one...) What kind of measurements do you have? If I had to compare spectra (just because that's the data I work with and you only told us what your data isn't, and 630 measurements per observation may very well be spectra - I'm quite willing to delete the answer if it doesn't fit the question), I'd probably do something along these lines: for a PCA, I'd rather center on the average before spectrum as that is a meaningful "base point" If I had to search for differences between the data sets before and after, I'd try to set up directly a supervised model, either a classification (LDA is related to PCA and PLS) or a regression (PLS, particularly if the inversion in the LDA is a problem) and then interprete that model. then I'd check how much the models change if I change the data set "a bit" - technically that's a cross validation or bootstrap. Just make sure you pick the correct "base unit" for splitting the data (do you need to leave out batches or days instead of single measurements?). You may need Procrustes-like roations for this. The variation between models give a very good idea what could be real and what is spurious. If the measurements have known physico-chemical meaning wrt. your process, checking this against the results / interpreting the models under this knowledge is a tremendous advantage over the usual settings of gene analysis. I'd consider "I'm not interested in which of them did change" throwing away much information that could help to judge what could be caused by the process change and what difference may just be random. With spectra I'd never consider univariate tests for each wavelength as something I'd seriously want to do (unless there are physico-chemical reasons to look for a difference at a particular wavelength): good spectra have a lot of correlation among neighbour wavelengths. This is a very different situation from "just" multiple testing (and if you have 630 different pH, T, p, ... measurements I imagine them being correlated about as much as spectra)
