Thanks Everyone, I have finally resolved the issue with all your help, I was using Vista 64 bit so I got the error like system.dllnotfoundException. When I changed the platform from 'Any CPU' to 'X86' and compiled the application it worked and I placed the dll in the "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\". I used the DllImport function, it worked. Thanks you guys for your kind help, Gan
