How to assess the validity of random effects assumptions in models with interaction and time covariates?

Suppose you had 2 waves of longitudinal data. The univariate outcome $y$ was measured at baseline ( $Time=0$ ) for $N$ units, each unit randomly received a treatment ( $Treat=1$ ) or control ( $Treat=0$ ), then y was measured post-treatment ( $Time=1$ ). We can estimating the effect of the treatment while using baseline information with a hierarchical model with "random intercepts" for each unit (sometimes called "multilevel ANCOVA") as follows: $$y_{it} = N(\mu, \sigma_y) \\ \mu = \mu_0 + \mu_i + \beta_1Time_{it} + \beta_2(Treat_i \times Time_t)$$ $$\mu_i \sim N(0,\sigma)$$ Where: $y_{it}$ : the (univariate) outcome of unit $i$ at Time $t$ $\mu_0$ : "grand baseline mean" outcome across all observations $\mu_i$ : "random intercepts" capturing time-invariant unit-specific deviations from the grand mean $\beta_1$ : mean control group ( $Treat=0$ ) change in $y$ between $t=1$ and $t=2$ $\beta_2$ : Average treatment effect. i.e., the mean treated group ( $Treat=1$ ) deviation from the control group's change (i.e. deviation from $\beta_1$ ). Question(s) My understanding is that one of the assumptions of this model is that the individual-specific errors ( $\mu_i$ ) are not correlated with the other covariates (Time, Treat*Time). However, I'm struggling to understand how to substantively interpret the assumption to assess its validity because one of the covariates is an interaction and "time" is fairly abstract as a covariate. Is this assumption the same as saying unobserved, time-invariant between-unit differences affecting $y$ cannot vary with (a) time or (b) magnitude of treatment effects? (a) is ensured since the intercepts are time-invariant, but I'm quite uncertain about (b). Is it possible for $Corr(Time, \mu_i) \neq 0$ ? What does it mean if they are correlated - that units with higher/lower intercepts have systematically different changes from $t=0$ to $t=1$ ? Is it possible for $Corr(Time*Treat, \mu_i) \neq 0$ ? Treat is randomly assigned, so it is uncorrelated with all time-invariant features, but I have no idea how to think about the interaction.
