Must you use a DB, rather than reading a text file? A simple C-type compiled language can run a simple parser in a fraction of the time it takes to read the file, so it should be basically "I/O bound". It would be a program similar to unix wc , word-count. Sounds like the math is trivial and should not even be noticeable. EDIT: OK, I didn't understand that you wanted to build a dictionary of the unique tokens, and count each one. In that case, a trie or hash-based dictionary should suffice. The storage size of that will depend on the typical length of tokens and how many different ones there are. This could be similar to the unix sort | uniq idiom.
