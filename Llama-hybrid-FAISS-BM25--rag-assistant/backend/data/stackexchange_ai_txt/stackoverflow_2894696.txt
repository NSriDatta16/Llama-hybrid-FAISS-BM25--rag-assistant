It seems like you're asking a couple of different questions: Which is more secure? : Logging to a DB is not more secure than logging to a file and vice versa. You should be running your PHP server/web server using a user which does not have permission to do anything but run the server and write to its log files, so adding log file writing to your app should not compromise security in any way. Have a look at http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/113744 for more info. Which is better? : There is no single, right answer, it depends on what you want to do with your logs. What do you want to do with the log files? Do you want to pipe them into another app? If so, putting them in a DB might be the way to go. Do you want to archive them? Well, it might be better to toss them into a file. Notes : If you use a logging framework like Log4PHP, http://logging.apache.org/log4php/index.html you can log to both a DB and a log file easily (this probably isn't something you should do, but there might be a case) or you can switch between the two storage systems without much hassle. Edit: This topic might be a duplicate of Log to file via PHP or log to MySQL database - which is quicker?
