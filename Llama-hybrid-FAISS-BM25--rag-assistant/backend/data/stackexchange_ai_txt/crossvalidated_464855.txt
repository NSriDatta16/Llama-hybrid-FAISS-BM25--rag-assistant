It is depending on how do you define "test it". If you want to test it to see if it works on non-missing cases, just remove the data with missing features, and test it as usual. On the other hand, if you want to see if it works for data with missing features, then you may need to think about how to pre-process data before feeding into model. Question to think about: in this case, are you testing your imputation algorithm or logistic regression?
