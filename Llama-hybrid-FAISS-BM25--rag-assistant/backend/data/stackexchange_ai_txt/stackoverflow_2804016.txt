Quicksand looks like it will do what you want: from the documentation - 'At the very basic level, Quicksand replaces one collection of items with another'. I think you just need to add an element to display the results of the filtering, like so: Vanilla Strawberry Asparagus Your jQuery would be something like: $(function(){ //To load the unfiltered list into the display as the initial state: $('#display').quickSand($('#source li')); //To filter based on clicks in the menu: $('#flavourFilter li').click(function(){ $('#display').quickSand($('#source li.' + this.className)); }); }); There's possibly a way to modify quicksand to use the same element for the source and the display (by hiding/showing elements, instead of adding and removing them from the DOM), but this should get you up and running, I think. Let me know if you need more detail!
