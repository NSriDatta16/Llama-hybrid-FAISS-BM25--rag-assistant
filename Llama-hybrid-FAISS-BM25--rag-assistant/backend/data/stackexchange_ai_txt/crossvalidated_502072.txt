What is The Main Difference between PCA and NMF and why to choose one rather than the other?

I have to develop some analyses to study cancer data. I want to use NMF and PCA. Basically these tools choose the best factorization rank and the number of components that is meaningful to your analysis. Apart from this, is there anything more subtle that should push me to use one rather than the other? If so, could you please indicate some papers to cite along the paper to justify my possible choice? Thanks a lot!
