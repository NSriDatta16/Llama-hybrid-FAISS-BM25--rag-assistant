From what you are saying on can make up that you predict scores for each class and that the highest score is your class prediction. A question you may ask is whether or not the class prediction is affected by the ensembling at all. For the sake of the example consider an example where Model A predicts a class always with a normalised score of 1.0 (i.e. full confidence, recommended reading ). Suppose Model A is right 80% of the time. Model B however, is less certain. It places his bets on the top 5 classes that it deems likely with an equal normalised score of 0.2. Averaging the scores results in the same top predicted class as for Model A alone. You could easily check this by calculating the correlations between the predictions of the models with the ensembled predictions.
