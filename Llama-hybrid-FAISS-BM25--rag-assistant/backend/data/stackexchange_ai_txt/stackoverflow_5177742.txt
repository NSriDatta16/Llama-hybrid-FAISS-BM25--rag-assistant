Combining the streams:Web application

This question deals mainly with streams in web application in .net. In my webapplication I will display as follows: bottle.doc sheet.xls presentation.ppt stackof.jpg Button I will keep checkbox for each one to select. Suppose a user selected the four files and clicked the button,which I kept under. Then I instantiate clasees for each type of file to convert into pdf, which I wrote already and converted them into pdf and return them. My problem is the clases is able to read the data form URL and convert them into pdf. But I don't know how to return the streams and merge them. string url = @"url"; //Prepare the web page we will be asking for HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); request.Method = "GET"; request.ContentType = "application/mspowerpoint"; request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+5.01;+Windows+NT+5.0"; //Execute the request HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); //We will read data via the response stream Stream resStream = response.GetResponseStream(); //Write content into the MemoryStream BinaryReader resReader = new BinaryReader(resStream); MemoryStream PresentaionStream = new MemoryStream(resReader.ReadBytes((int)response.ContentLength)); //convert the presention stream into pdf and save it to local disk. But I would like to return the stream again. How can I achieve this any Ideas are welcome.
