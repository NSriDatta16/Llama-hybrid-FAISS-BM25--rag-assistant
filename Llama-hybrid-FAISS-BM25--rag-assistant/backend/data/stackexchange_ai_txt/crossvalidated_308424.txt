How does batch size affect Adam Optimizer?

What impact does mini-batch size have on Adam Optimizer? Is there a recommended mini-batch size when training a (covolutional) neural network with Adam Optimizer? From what I understood (I might be wrong), for small mini-batch sizes the results tend to be noisy, but the results are also innacurrate for big batches (let's say the whole training set in one pass).
