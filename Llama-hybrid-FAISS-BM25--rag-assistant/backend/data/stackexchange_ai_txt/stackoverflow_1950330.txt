According to the Wikipedia article about BTree+ , this kind of data structure is frequently used for indexing block-oriented storage. Apparently, BTree+ stored keys (and not values) are stored in the intermediate nodes. This would mean that you would need fewer intermediate node blocks and would increase the likelihood of a cache hit. Real world examples include various file systems; see the linked article.
