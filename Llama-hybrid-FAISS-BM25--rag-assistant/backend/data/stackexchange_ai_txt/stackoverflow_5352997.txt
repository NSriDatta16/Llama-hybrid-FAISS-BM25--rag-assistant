Programming Scheme(Racket) with VIM - How to get started

recently, I started programming Racket (formerly Scheme) in DrRacket. I quite fast I began to miss all the features of VIM in DrRacket, so I would like to use VIM for my scheme(racket) programming. I know that Emacs might be the best choice for intense lisp programming, but all I want is write a scheme(racket) file check syntax and then run it. Unfortunately, I could not figure out, how to invoke "racket" in the commandline on a file to get it doing the same as DrRacket. I am running Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, VIM 7.3 and I downloaded and installed Racket from the official website. Help to get started would be very appreciated.
