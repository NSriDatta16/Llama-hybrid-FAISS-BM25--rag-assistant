Depends on how you want to use it. The easiest is to get the amalgamation version - this version " contains all preprocessed C code combined into a single source file ", meaning you have a single .h and .c file to add to your project. This is the officially recommended practice. If you want to build a "proper" library or link against SQLite dynamically, you have a bit more work ahead, since there's no VS project/solution files included with SQLite. You'll have to set up your own library project, add the correct files from the sqlite-source-x.y.z.zip file, and set this project as a dependency on your main project. Doing this is actually officially discouraged. EDIT: Forgot to mention that the above solution is assuming C/C++, as OP didn't specify language.
