In a Bayesian framework, you can obtain posterior samples for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, and divide them to get posterior samples for their fraction. Then get a Bayesian credibility interval from those samples. You can use pymc3 in Python or stan in R to obtain these samples, and Poisson models are easy and straightforward to sample for.
