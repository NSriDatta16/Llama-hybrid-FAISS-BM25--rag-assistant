From the API: http://api13.cakephp.org/class/dbo-source#method-DboSourcecalculate "Returns an SQL calculation, i.e. COUNT() or MAX()" A quick search in ~/cake finds 20 matches in 8 files. One of those is the definition in dbo_source.php The other seven are: dbo_source.test.php code_coverage_manager.test.php code_coverage_manager.php dbo_db2.php model.php tree.php containable.php Without delving too deeply into this, I suspect your problem lies in Model::save You'll probably have to define a calculate method to suit the structure of your custom datasource because Cake won't know how to do that.
