This is not a behavior specific to C# or .NET. With most databases, any fields that are omitted from an INSERT statement are assigned the default values, or if nullable are stored as NULL. This is standard, and expected behavior. As for whether this is good or bad - it depends . Personally, I prefer to specify the values of all fields in any table I am inserting into so that future maintainers realize that I chose to insert the values by intent . However, in some cases, there are calculations or trigger-based columns which the application cannot set - in which case I allow the database to handle this. If you really want to be thorough and clear - you can perform all of your INSERTs through stored procedures - this way the knowledge is captured in the database layer and can be leveraged by any applications that interact with the database.
