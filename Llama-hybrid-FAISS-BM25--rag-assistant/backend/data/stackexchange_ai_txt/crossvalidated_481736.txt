Can we directly use the likelihood function for Bayesian inference?

I'm new to statistics, so this might be obvious. When doing full Bayesian inference, we first compute the parameter posterior $P(\theta | \text{data})$ using Bayes' rule. Then, to make a prediction, we compute the predictive posterior by averaging different prediction distributions at different values of $\theta$ . So what happens if we just use the likelihood function $L(\theta)$ in place of $P(\theta | \text{data})$ ? My hand-wavy motivation is we can average over the likelihoods of different $\theta$ s. (For the sake of argument, let's say we can scale $L(\theta)$ to integrate to 1.)
