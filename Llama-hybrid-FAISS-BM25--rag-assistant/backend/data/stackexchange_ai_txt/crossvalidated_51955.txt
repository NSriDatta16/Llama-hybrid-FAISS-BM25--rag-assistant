The biggest problem is that an averaged shifted histogram has positive dependence in adjacent bins, so a test derived on an independence assumption (aside the negative dependence induced by the total count being conditioned on, which is adjusted for) won't have the right distribution for its test statistic. It's possible to adapt a test for such dependence, but the vanilla version of the test will be wrong. [If you want to test for normality, doing it from a histogram isn't a particularly good way to do it. A Shapiro-Wilk or Shapiro-Francia test, an Anderson-Darling test, or perhaps a Smooth test of the kind discussed in Rayner and Best's book Smooth Tests of Goodness of Fit would be better. The nice thing about a Shapiro-Francia test is it's just based on the correlation in a normal scores plot (Q-Q plot for normality), which gives a visual assessment of the non-normality] -- Edit - looking at your QQ plot - the data are very far from normal. No reasonable test would fail to reject normality at that sample size. A Lilliefors test or an Anderson-Darling or a Shapiro-Wlik or a smooth test with a standard number of terms ($k=4$ or $k=6$) will all reject easily... you don't even need to test that.
