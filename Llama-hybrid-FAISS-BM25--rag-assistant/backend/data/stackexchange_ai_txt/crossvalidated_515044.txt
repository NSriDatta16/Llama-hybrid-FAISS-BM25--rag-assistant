How does one compute the posterior in a two-stage Bayesian model?

Given a random variable $X$ depending on a parameter $\theta$ which itself depends on a parameter $\psi$ , how do I compute $p(\theta|X,\psi)$ ? A website I have found $^1$ claims that $p(\theta|X,\psi)=\frac{p(\theta|\psi)\cdot p(X|\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}p(\theta| \psi)\cdot p(X| \theta)d\theta}$ but I haven't been able to derive this so far. The only way of doing something remotely useful with the LHS that I have found is to simply plug in the definition of conditional probability. I would also guess that the integral is a result of applying the law of total probability but I'm not sure how exactly to continue from this. $^1$ : https://people.stat.sc.edu/hitchcock/stat535slidesday24.pdf
