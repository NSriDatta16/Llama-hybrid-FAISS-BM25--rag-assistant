The really relevant consideration is how often does this 99.9% of info change, is it every access, every second, minute, hour? Anything above an access, depending on the amount of requests per time unit you have and the caching scheme you choose, might make sense. As long as the average time of retrieval diminishes, cache. You have to measure this and decide . Some cache validation techniques are to check validity upon access or to store a timestamp and expiry with the cache. Check validity upon each access is more expensive, and timestamp+expiry might serve stale content in some cases.
