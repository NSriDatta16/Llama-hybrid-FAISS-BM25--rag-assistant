No. This one can be faster, as it leverages the paralellism to the SQL, but in the end the SQL has to make a lock for the table (page), as it makes an insert. therefore each paralell request is executed after another again. If you want to make a bulk insert, than make a SP accepting all entries (e.g. a table with SQL 2008.) or do it with Linq2SQL. that would be the correct design solution.
