It depends on the reason for the logic. If the logic is choosing an alternate presentation based on some property passed to it by the controller, it is probably ok. This allows you some view reuse. Instead of having to recreate (and repeat) an entire view for each custom privilege, you can pass in some data that allows the view to be customized based on this privilege. I think of this as a pragmatic balance between an idealized MVC and strict enforcement of DRY (don't repeat yourself). In some situations it is wiser to violate one or the other if you can't attain both easily. In the case where clearly the model and the basic view is the same, putting a little logic in the view to keep your views DRY is reasonable.
