Simple JAVA: Password Verifier problem

I have a simple problem that says: A password for xyz corporation is supposed to be 6 characters long and made up of a combination of letters and digits. Write a program fragment to read in a string and print out a message as to whether or not the string entered would be considered a valid password. I need help on completing this code. I have this pseudocode that I can't workout into Java code: print "enter new password" input newPassword digitCounter =0 letterCounter = 0 for I = 0 to newPassword.length() by 1 c = newPassword.charAt(i) if c is a digit increment digitCounter else if c is a letter increment letterCounter endif endFor if newPassword.length() >= 6 and digitCounter > 0 and letterCounter > 0 print "the password is valid" else print " password rejected, must be at least 6 characters long and be a mix of letters and digits " endif +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So far all I have is this for the Java code: import java.util.Scanner; public class Password { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); String thePassword; int len, i, letterCounter = 0, digitCounter = 0; char c; Len = thePassword.length(); System.out.print("Enter the password: "); thePassword = in.nextLine(); for (i = 0,i = len, ) { c = in.charAt(1); if () } } }
