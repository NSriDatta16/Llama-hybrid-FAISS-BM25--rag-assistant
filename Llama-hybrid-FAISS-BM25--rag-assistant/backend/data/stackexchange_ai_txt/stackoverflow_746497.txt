thanks Eddie for Googling hint. When I asked this question I was biased to Web Application Development. Now I found this can't be answered in single question. So I guess its better to have one page categorizing the Java Frameworks (DI, Web, ORM) with links in each category pointing to other questions in stackoverflow. however this may end with something similar to java-source.net but categorized. so I will use your hint Eddie in my answer below: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) frameworks: Hibernate, iBatis, Java EE or other Java ORM tool What Java ORM do you prefer, and why?
