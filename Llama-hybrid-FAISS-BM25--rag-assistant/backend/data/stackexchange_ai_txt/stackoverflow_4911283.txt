How does your program get out of the for (; n > 0;) loop? Won't counter simply increase until you get a bus error? ED: Respectfully, I think the claim that "i've got the logic figured out" is a little optimistic. :^) Doubtless someone will post the way it should have been done by the time I'm done writing this, but it's probably worth drawing attention to what went wrong (aside from the memory allocation problems noted elsewhere): Your first loop, "for (; n > 0;)", is strange because you're printing the entire number n into the buffer at counter. So why would you need to do this more than once? If you were selecting individual digits you might, but you're not, and obviously you know how to do this because you already used "sprintf(charIt, "%d", giveStr);". [Aside: giveStr isn't a great name for an unsigned integer variable!] Your second loop also has strange conditions: you set counter to 0, set the condition that counter > 0, and then decrease counter inside. This obviously isn't going to loop over the characters in the way you want. Assuming you thought the first loop was character-by-character, then maybe you were thinking to loop down from counter-1 to 0?
