What are the limitations of non-negative matrix factorisation when reducing the dimensions of a data set?

From what I understand NFM (non-negative matrix factorisation) is constrained by the factor that it only supports data sets with non-negative values when reducing the dimensions of a data set. Specifically, are there any only limitations that NFM has when carrying this out? in comparison to say PCA (Principle Component Analysis).
