Upload files to the cloud from web application

I need to upload files from an HTML 5 application (used in desktop/mobile/tablet device)(there's no server side) to an online storage. Any storage would be fine, still, using a free service would be preferred at this point. The needed workflow is: upload file to a storage -> get file's public URL -> share the public URL in facebook with facebook's API. The facebook part I've got it covered but I need somewhere to put my files in. I tried using box.net API but I get error due to the cross-site request being made: ( http://developers.box.net/w/page/12923936/ApiFunction_get_ticket ) function get_ticket(api_key){ $.ajax({ url: 'https://www.box.net/api/1.0/rest?action=get_ticket&api_key=' + api_key, success: function(response){ console.log(response); } }); } yields in the chrome console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://www.box.net/api/1.0/rest?action=get_ticket&api_key=(my_key). Origin http://localhost:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. GET https://www.box.net/api/1.0/rest?action=get_ticket&api_key=ynu54ytflrz9fzpdzy5raf1hc1rmed9i undefined (undefined) Any workaround on this issue will be most welcomed.
