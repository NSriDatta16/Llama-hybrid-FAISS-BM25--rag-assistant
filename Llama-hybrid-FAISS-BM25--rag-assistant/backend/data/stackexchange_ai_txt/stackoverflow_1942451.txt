I think there might be a more "correct" way to do this, but what I would do (without knowledge of a better way) is have a hidden form element something like And then have a function called onsubmit that sets this value and returns true to tell the form to continue (with jQuery) function onSubmitFunc(){ $('#hidden_count').val(count); return true; } I'm sure there's a more elegant solution, but that should work for what you need.
