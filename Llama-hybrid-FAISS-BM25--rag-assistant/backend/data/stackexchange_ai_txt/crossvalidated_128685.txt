I have often used a scheme (Intervention Detection) even though it is not time series data to determine the presence of "an intercept change" or a change in the mean value. An intercept change is essentially a mean change or in other words a level shift. Please post your data and I will try and help you. Both plots suggest to me a possible intercept change after some anomalies (one time pulses) have been accounted for. In the first course in statistics we are often given the fact that n1 values are in Group 1 and n2 values in Group 2. In actual practice we are often given 1 column of readings possibly a time series and the goal is to determine how many groups there are. This is in effect a form of one dimensional discriminant analysis.
