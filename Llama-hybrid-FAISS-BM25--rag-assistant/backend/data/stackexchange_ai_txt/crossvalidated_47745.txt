It is true that the median is more robust (subject to outliers) than the mean. My understanding is that the reason statistics tends to use the mean (and squared errors for that matter) is that in the long run, on average, assuming symmetrical distributions, they get closer to the true answer than medians and absolute deviations. However, if you are not interested in being correct on average over the long run and are more interested in being close to right on any given point estimate, the median is probably a reasonable statistic for you to select. It is unclear from your question what exactly you want to do with your "error estimate". Do you want to use it to do a statistical test? If all you need is another summary statistic to describe the central tendency of dispersion around your observed measure of central tendency AND you want to continue to leverage whatever 'advantage' the median is giving you... then I would recommend calculating the median absolute deviation. That is the median of |X-Mdn|.
