You can use Optunity for that purpose. This is a library of optimization algorithms for automated hyperparameter search. You can find an example of using Optunity to optimize an SVM in e1707 here , mapping this to kernlab should be straightforward. All you need to do is specify box constraints (a lower and upper bound) on $C$ and $\gamma$ and a budget of function evaluation (i.e., how many ($C$, $\gamma$)-pairs can be tested.
