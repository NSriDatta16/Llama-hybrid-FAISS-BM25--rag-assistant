To test something while controlling for a covariate, we typically use some type of regression model. Since your response data are binomial, you should use logistic regression. Your situation is straightforward, and the model and test are fairly easy to do. Here is an analysis of your data done in R : d = read.table(text="GENDER SMOKER SURVIVED DIED male yes 341 23 male no 231 11 female yes 378 19 female no 476 15", header=T) summary(glm(cbind(DIED, SURVIVED)~SMOKER+GENDER, d, family=binomial)) # Call: # glm(formula = cbind(DIED, SURVIVED) ~ SMOKER + GENDER, family = binomial, # data = d) # # Deviance Residuals: # 1 2 3 4 # -0.09533 0.13919 0.10545 -0.11564 # # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) -3.4272 0.2240 -15.300 Controlling for gender, the Wald p-value for smoking is 0.11 .
