how xsd can represent different xml file?

if I have this XML data Main.xml 11 1 Annotated Bibliography on Data Design. 45 77 Anthony I. Wasserman Karen Botnich Architecture of Future Data Base Systems. 30 44 Lawrence A. Rowe Michael Stonebraker Database Directions III Workshop Review. 8 8 Tom Cook Errors in 'Process Synchronization in Database Systems'. 9 29 Philip A. Bernstein Marco A. Casanova Nathan Goodman and this schema Main.xsd it becomes 2 fragments like this Frag1.xml: 11 1 Annotated Bibliography on Data Design. 45 77 Architecture of Future Data Base Systems. 30 44 Database Directions III Workshop Review. 8 8 Errors in 'Process Synchronization in Database Systems'. 9 29 Frag2.xml: Anthony I. Wasserman Karen Botnich Lawrence A. Rowe Michael Stonebraker Tom Cook Philip A. Bernstein Marco A. Casanova Nathan Goodman how can I use one schema that can represent both of Fragments with keeping the original structure of the first XML. In other words, is there any way to make Main.xsd represent Frag1.xsd+frag2.xsd I do not want 2 schema only one!!? Thanks in advance
