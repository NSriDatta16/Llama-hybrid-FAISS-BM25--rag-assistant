best way to access a parent object from a child object

I am creating a population genetics simulation system in JRuby. I have created classes such as Allele, Gene, Organism, Population. A Population object contains multiple Organism objects (in an array), each Organism object contains multiple Genes, and so on. Currently, it is very easy to know, for example, what Gene objects a certain Organism object has. However, if all I have is a Gene object, I do no know what Organism it belongs to. One solution I have thought of is: attr_accessor :name, :parent def initialize(name, parent) @name = name @parent = parent #parent will be the parent object end If I do this, will @parent merely be a reference to the parent object in memory, or will it be a whole new object? Is this the best way to do this? Is there another 'better' way of doing this? Thanks!
