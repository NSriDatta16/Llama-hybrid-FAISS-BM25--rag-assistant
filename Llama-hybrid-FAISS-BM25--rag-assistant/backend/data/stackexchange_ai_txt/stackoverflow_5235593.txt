Its more than likely one of the controls you are searching for is not being found. Try the following, the error will tell you which one is not being found correctly. Dim button As Button = CType(e.Row.FindControl("button1"), Button) if(button == null) throw new ApplicationException("button1 was not found"); Dim id As Label = CType(e.Row.FindControl("id"), Label) if(id== null) throw new ApplicationException("id was not found"); NB* All the information you need to find where the error is occurring is contained inside the exception details. Look at the stack trace for the line number. If there is one skill every programmer needs is the ability to read exceptions correctly and pay attention to them.
