VS2008 Load Testing - Page Response Time

I am running a load test from VS 2008 on my asp.net web application. The thing I notice is that for some of my pages Average Page Time is around 20. Does this mean it takes 20 seconds for the server to render the page before it sends the request? Or is it simply 20 seconds until the whole page is fully loaded on the client's browser? Does this statistic take Network Type into an account; so say that I change from 52kbps to 1.5mbps, is this statistic supposed to change? Another thing is - my Average Response Time is 0.21, whilst some pages have Average Page Time at 20. Why is it so different? What does each mean? Thank you.
