Getting undefined value from an array

Talk is cheap; I'd rather show the code: //global var var siblings = []; var rand = new Date().getTime(); siblings.push('uin_' + rand); alert(siblings['uin_' + rand]); // undefined Why undefined? What I basically want to achieve is to have a global object that would be a storage where info about other objects get saved. But get back to my problem. I pushed the value then I want to alert it but get undefined... why undefined?
