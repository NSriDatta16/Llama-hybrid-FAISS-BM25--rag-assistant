The most common reason to use bitwise operations is because they are fast and allow for compact storage of information in integers. That said, this script appears to be using them as flags on each square in the grid. Take a look at the following code: /* Define the bit masks */ var Constants = { WALL_ABOVE : 1, WALL_BELOW : 2, WALL_LEFT : 4, WALL_RIGHT : 8, QUEUED : 16, IN_MAZE : 32 } Each of these constants occupies one bit in an integer. To check if the flag is set, all you need to do is determine if its bit location is set to 1 (typically by ANDing with that number and comparing to 0). To set a flag, you simply set that bit value (typically by ORing with the number). This is what the bitwise operators are doing.
