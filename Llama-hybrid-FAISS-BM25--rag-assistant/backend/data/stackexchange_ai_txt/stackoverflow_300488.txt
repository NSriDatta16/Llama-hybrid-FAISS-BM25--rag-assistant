Does evidence based scheduling work right with heterogenous estimations?

Observing one year of estimations during a project I found out some strange things that make me wonder if evidence based scheduling would work right here? individual programmers seem to have favorite numbers (e.g. 2,4,8,16,30 hours) the big tasks seem to be underestimated by a fix value (about 2) but the standard deviation is low here the small tasks (1 or 2 hours) are absolutely wide distributed. In average they have the same average underestimation factor of 2, but the standard deviation is high: some 5 minute spelling issues are estimated with 1 hour other bugfixes are estimated with 1 hour too, but take a day So, is it really a good idea to let the programmers break down the 30 hours task down to 4 or 2 hours steps during estimations? Won't this raise the standard deviation? (Ok, let them break it down - but perhaps after the estimations?!)
