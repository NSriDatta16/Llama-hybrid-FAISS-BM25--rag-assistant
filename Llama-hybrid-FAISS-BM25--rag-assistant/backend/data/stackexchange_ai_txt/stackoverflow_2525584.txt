OutOfMemoryError means you exceeded the VM's RAM budget, which is 16MB or 24MB depending on what device you're on. It has nothing to do with file sizes. The 1MB limit you're probably referring to is the maximum size of a compressed asset in an APK file. Files in your app-private data area or on external storage can be as large as the filesystem will allow them to be. (I've heard the FAT32 implementation Android uses for SD cards has a 2GB limit for individual files, but don't remember the resolution of that thread.) Available disk space will likely be a larger concern. Going back to your original problem, check the logcat output (via adb logcat or DDMS) to see if there are any messages from the garbage collector right before the OOM fired.
