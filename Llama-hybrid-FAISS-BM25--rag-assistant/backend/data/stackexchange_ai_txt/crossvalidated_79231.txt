Large data analysis - learning resources

My question is very simple: which learning resources (books, courses, online courses, and so on) about "large data analysis" would you suggest to a graduate with a strong background in Machine Learning and Computer Science? Edit: I am looking for something similar to section 17 of this very well known online course: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml (you can click on preview lectures to check it out) but in very much detail and many other different methods/algorithms.
