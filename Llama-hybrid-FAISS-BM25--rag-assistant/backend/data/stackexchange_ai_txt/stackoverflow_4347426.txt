This article discusses a couple of approaches to this problem and gives you some sample code. The one I've used in the past is to have a couple of private fields in the Page code-behind: one for the count and one for the sum. You can then increment these in the GridView's RowDataBound event when the row in question is a data row. When it is a footer row, you compute the average and display it in the right cell.
