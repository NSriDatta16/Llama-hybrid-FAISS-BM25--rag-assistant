In my opinion it's quite good platform, and I see a good progress on it. Many of the drwabacks that 2005 version had and that the community complained about, have been corrected on 2008. From my point of view, the best thing is that you can extend and complement it with SQL or .NET code in an organized way as much as you want. For instance, you can decide if in your solution you want 80% of c# code and 20% of ETL componenets or 5% of c# code and 95% of ETL components.
