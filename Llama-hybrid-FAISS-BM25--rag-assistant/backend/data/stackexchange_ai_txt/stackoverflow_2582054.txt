The Fatal module was added to the Perl core in version 5.05 (1998). The Fatal module has some significant shortcomings and inconsistencies in its API which couldn't be fixed in a backwards compatible way (ie: fixing the API would break existing code which used Fatal). The newer autodie module was written to provide a more consistent API and to allow the effect of the pragma to be lexically scoped rather than global (which can have unexpected side effects). If you have a choice, you should definitely prefer autodie. It will be included as a core module in the upcoming 5.12 release of Perl. The autodie module requires Perl 5.8. About the only reason you'd use Fatal is if you were stuck with a really old version of Perl (eg: 5.6), but 5.8 has been out since 2002 so hopefully that won't be the case for you.
