How to create a simple Autoencoder to select features from high dimensional dataset

I am trying to create a simple Autoencoder to select features based on a high dimensional dataset. I can understand, how AE works and how AE will reduce the dimensionality but I am looking for a sample or tutorial for the AE feature selection which is implemented based on the Keras DL tool. I would really appreciate your help on this.
