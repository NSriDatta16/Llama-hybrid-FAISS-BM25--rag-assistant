Which statistical test should I use to see difference between averages of two different samples?

I'm diabetic and the Dr. prescribed me new medicine. So I recorded glucose samples before I started the medicine (PRE) and after I started the medicine (POST). Now that I have decent amount of data accumulated I'm wondering which test to use to see if there is a significant change in the glucose levels. Do you know which statistical test I should use to see if there was a significant improvement? PRE_POST | Marker | Avg glucose | Sample Size | min glucose | max glucose -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POST | Fasting | 167.90 |11 | 120 | 210 POST | Not Fasting | 134.68 |22 | 93 | 202 PRE | Fasting | 190.75 |24 | 145 | 294 PRE | Not Fasting | 169.62 |24 | 100 | 358
