It is not clear from your post what you are trying to achieve exactly: (a) Are you looking to model the abundance this way: $$abundance[Y_n]=f(environmentvars[Y_{n}])$$ e.g the abundance of 1989 is based on the P(mm), T(oC), and Sal of 1989 (and the 1988 abundance on the environmental vars of 1988 , etc...)? (b) Or are you looking to model the effects of the abundance this way: $$abundance[Y_n]=f(environmentvars[Y_{n-1}])$$ e.g the abundance of 1989 is based on the P(mm), T(oC), and Sal of 1988 (and the 1988 abundance on the environmental vars of 1987 , etc...)? If it is (a) you are after, then I would first try a regression model which outputs the abundance of each year based on the environmental variables of that same year, without any time series component. Then I would try a Nowcasting approach. Nowcasting refers to using forecasting techniques that are normally used to predict future values to predict present values - "Now" variables - instead. This is useful when a variable has a value now in the present, but measuring that variable is complicated and takes along time (e.g. economic variables such as unemployment or household income, etc...). So we treat the present value as an unknown that can be predicted using a time series model that includes external regressors. You can definitely use ARIMAX for this, it would look something like this (I'm omitting the MA terms for clarity, but please assume they are there as well): $$abundance[Y_n]=f(environmentvars[Y_{n}])+\phi_{n-1}abundance[Y_{n-1}]+\phi_{n-2}abundance[Y_{n-2}]+...$$ You need to be careful though, auto.arima() doesn't implement ARIMAX, it uses regression with ARMA errors, which is a different type of model, and I don't know if regression with ARMA errors can be used for Nowcasting or not (it might be, I'm just not sure). You might want to look at the Python package Statsmodels, which implements ARIMAX in the SARIMAX module . Better still, ditch the ARIMA family and try using BSTS or STS , which are also good for Nowcasting. If it is (b) you are after, meaning you want to forecast future abundance using current environmental variables, then ARIMAX, or any time series model which includes external regressors is not a suitable choice, because for those approaches to work, you need to have good future estimates of the environmental variables (you might have good estimates for those over the next few days, but AFAIK you can't have reliable future forecasts for those for the next year). So your only option is to use a VAR model , which will give you something along the lines of (using VAR(1) for clarity, but this applicable to any VAR(n) model): $$abundance[Y_n]= \phi_1abundance[Y_{n-1}]+\psi_1P(mm)[Y_{n-1}]+\theta_1T(oC)[Y_{n-1}]+\eta_1Sal[Y_{n-1}]$$ You might be able to use other vector time series models, like Vector Exponential Smoothing, or Multivariate LSTM, but try VAR first. To summarize: auto.arima is unlikely to work in your use case. If you are trying to achieve (a), then use SARIMAX or BSTS to implement a Nowcasting model. If you are trying to achieve (b), then you should use a vector time series model like VAR. Please note that if the only data you have is the data displayed in the OP, then none of these methods will work well, because they are all data hungry, and a sample size of 8 won't cut it, you should look for a simpler approach.
