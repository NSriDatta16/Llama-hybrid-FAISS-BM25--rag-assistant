You can use predicted values of anything for any analysis. Take for example, how students' eyes light up when you tell them that they can e.g. regress plasma retinol concentrations on patient age, and then use the residual, $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ as a variable representing retinol adjusted for age, i.e., the effect of age is removed from retinol. You can do anything you want with the new values of retinol with age removed: use in classification analysis, use in clustering, use in PCA, use in logistic and Cox regression, etc. For gene expression analysis, I regress expression of thousands of genes (almost normally-distributed, i.e., log expression) simultaneously via multivariate linear regression (multiple $y_i$ per record) on age to remove age from expression. Using the thousands of new residuals (variables), I now have age removed from the problem, since I may not want to deal with age in other analyses.
