wanted: simple HTML file that does disclosure triangle hide/reveal

I have a program that produces a text report. I want it to make an HTML report with multiple disclosure triangles, so that when you click a triangle more of the report shows or hides. I am okay with embedding JavaScript inside the file, but I really want it all in a single file, with no additional files. Is there an easy way to do this with modern browsers?
