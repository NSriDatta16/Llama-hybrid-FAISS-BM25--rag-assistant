Entity Framework 4 has come a long way. They now support a POCO model which eases a lot of the pain that was associated with Entity Framework 1. Julie Lehrman's 2nd edition book covers these issues nicely. That said, NHibernate 3 with their linq provider is a great solution too. And their SysCache implementation which comes with it and is very powerful for helping performance. EF does not have as good a story with 2nd level cache. AppFabric is different and more effort to setup. ORMs are powerful. You will find some people telling you to stay away, but it's pretty time-consuming to write a data layer that does as much to parameterize all queries, cache objects, encourage transactions, and simplify validation. Personally, I prefer NHibernate, but both are great tools.
