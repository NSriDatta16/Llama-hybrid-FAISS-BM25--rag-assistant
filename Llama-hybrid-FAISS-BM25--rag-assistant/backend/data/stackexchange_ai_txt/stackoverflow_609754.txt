While I am not sure about the innerHTML = "" you left out one possibly fast appoach using DocumentFragments for inserting into the DOM: As John Resig shows . As Ã“lafur Waage already mentioned, even though innerHTML is faster in a lot of situations since it's not part of any W3C standard, quirks are far more likely to be introduced then if they were. Not to say innerHTML is not a defacto standard within modern browsers. This blog post seems to indicate that Firefox spends a lot of time cleaning up after itself when using innerHTML to remove elements. In some browsers (most notably, Firefox), although innerHTML is generally much faster than DOM methods, it spends a disproportionate amount of time clearing out existing elements vs. creating new ones. Knowing this, we can combine the speed of destroying elements by removing their parent using the standard DOM methods with creating new elements using innerHTML.
