My interest in machine learning started with weka, but very soon after I switched to R, because it's more hands-on than using the explorer in weka. In regard to classification trees, this is a huge subject, and as such there is no "best" algorithm that works straight out of the box. You will have to play with different models, understand theoretically what are the pros and cons, and how they overcome deficiencies in simpler models. Having said that, if you can get a simple model to work, it would be better to have than a more complex model. One of the basic algorithms for classification trees is CART and one of the more advanced models is Random Forest. This latter model has a feature to select a subset of your attributes. A good place to start would be link . It's is written for R user, but the same models exist in weka if u prefer.
