TextView/EditText operates on fairly rich text described by the various style span objects here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/style/package-summary.html For example you can use this to build text containing those various style spans: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpannableStringBuilder.html SpannableStringBuilder is-a CharSequence, so it can be set as the text in a TextView. Though more often you probably just want to use TextView.getEditableText() to return the Editable interface to the text inside of the text view which allows you to modify its contents including style spans. TextView supports most of what you are asking for through style spans, though justification is applied per-paragraph and not per-line. (Per-line is weird... I don't think even Word does such a thing?)
