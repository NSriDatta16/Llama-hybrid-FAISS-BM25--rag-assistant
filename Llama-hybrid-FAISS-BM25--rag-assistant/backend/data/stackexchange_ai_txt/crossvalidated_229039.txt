The rational for using WOE in logistic regression is to generate what is sometimes called the Semi-Naive Bayesian Classifier (SNBC). The beginning of this blog post explains things pretty well: http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/08/13/weight-of-evidence/ The beta parameters in the model are the linear bias of each naive effect (a.k.a. weight-of-evidence) due to the presence of other predictors and they can be interpreted as the linear change in log odds of the particular predictors due to the presence of other predictors.
