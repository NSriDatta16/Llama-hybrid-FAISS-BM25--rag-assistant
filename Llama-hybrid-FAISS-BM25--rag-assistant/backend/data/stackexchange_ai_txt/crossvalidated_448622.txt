The first case was answered in detail in this question . One example of the second case is shown here , where the authors apply a normal approximation to the binomial distribution used in calculations of the first case. The third case is given by Hahn and Meeker in their handbook Statistical Intervals (2nd ed., Wiley 2017): A two-sided $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $x_q$ , the $q$ quantile of the normal distribution, is $$ \left[\bar{x}-t_{(1-\alpha/2;\,n-1,\,\delta)}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\;\bar{x}-t_{(\alpha/2;\,n-1,\,\delta)}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right] $$ where $t_{(\gamma;\,n-1,\,\delta)}$ is the $\gamma$ quantile of a noncentral $t$ -distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter $\delta = -\sqrt{n}z_{(q)}=\sqrt{n}z_{(1-p)}$ . Here, $z_{(q)}$ denotes $\Phi^{-1}(q)$ , the $q$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. For example, let's assume we drew $n=20$ samples from a normal distribution with unknown mean and standard deviation. The sample mean was $\bar{x}=10.5$ and the sample standard deviation was $s=3.19$ . Then, the two-sided $95\%$ confidence interval for the $q=0.25$ quantile $x_{0.25}$ would be given by $(6.42; 9.76)$ . Here is some R code and a small simulation to check the coverage. By changing the parameters, you can run your own simulations: normquantCI trueq, 1, 0) }) sum(res)/length(res) [1] 0.95043
