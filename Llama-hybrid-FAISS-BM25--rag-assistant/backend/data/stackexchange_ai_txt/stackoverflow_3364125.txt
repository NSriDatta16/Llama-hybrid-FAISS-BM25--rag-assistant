What is needed to add emailing capabilities to web application?

I have java web application to which I'd like to add emailing capabilities, however, I'm unsure what is needed to accomplish this. Specifically I want my app to be able to: Send emails confirming sign-up Allow users to send emails to one another, using my app's domain i.e. dan@my-app.com From my research it seems I'll need a mail transfer agent (MTA) like Postfix and possibly a IMAP server like Courier; but I don't understand the need for the IMAP server. Thanks.
