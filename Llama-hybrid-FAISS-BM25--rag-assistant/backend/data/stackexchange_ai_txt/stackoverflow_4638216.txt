Huge AS 3.0 Export Frame

I am creating a very simple flash animation with no code or complex effects, just text and simple tweens (Flash CS5) But I have problems reducing the size of my swf. From the generated size report, it looks like it has to do with fonts and/or exported actionscript classes. The frame with AS 3.0 Classes is over 100K, and even though I am only using one fonts, the same characters are embedded/exported multiple times My questions are: Do embedding of mixed TLF/Classic text (or mixing other text properties, spacing/kerning etc) require the same characters to be embedded twice? Do text transformations on TLF text (rotation and different transformations not available in classic text) require embedding of ("internal") AS3 classes that will increase the size of the .swf? (even though none of these classes are explicitly used by me, there are no scripts in the fla project) I have tried removing all the text instances one by one, and at one point, the swf is reduced to only 5-6K, but I am not able to pinpoint exactly what causes the ballooning of the swf
