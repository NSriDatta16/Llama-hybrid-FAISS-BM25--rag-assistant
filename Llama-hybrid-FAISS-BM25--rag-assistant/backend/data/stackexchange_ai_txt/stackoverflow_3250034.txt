Android WebView - Intercept clicks

I have written a simple helloworld app with a WebView which has a link to CNN on a simple.html page in my asset folder. cnn.com How can I capture the click on this on my Activity, stop the WebView from navigating, and then inform the Activity that " http://CNN.com " was clicked?
