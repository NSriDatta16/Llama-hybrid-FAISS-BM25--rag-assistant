Demand forecasting for new gas stations

First, let me say that I just started my job one month ago with less experience in data science (I graduated from electrical engineering field). Now, I'm doing the project about demand forecasting for new gas station by using station properties (e.g. type of station, location, area) and geographic properties (e.g. number of banks/residents,shop... around the station, road, competitor, route, traffic) as features to properly locate new station to make it most profitable. My senior said that former data scientist in my company also used to do this project. However, there are some problems when users choose rural zone (e.g. forest) as a new location. Let say that model's output (demand) is 100K. It seems like there is nothing with the output. But, model's output when users choose urban location is also 100K too. The problem are How to track difference between urban zone and country zone to get the sensible result? (Normally gas station in city should be more profitable than outside the city) Any good features? Are there any research about these problems? I already searched for them but not yet see the good one.
