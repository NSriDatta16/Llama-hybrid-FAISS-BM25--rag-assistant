RandomForestClassifier OOB scoring method

Does the random forest implementation in scikit-learn use mean accuracy as its scoring method to estimate generalization error with out-of-bag samples? This is not mentioned in the documentation, but the score() method reports the mean accuracy. I have a highly unbalanced dataset, and I am using AUC of ROC as my scoring metric in the grid search. Is there a way to tell the classifier to use the same scoring method on the OOB samples as well?
