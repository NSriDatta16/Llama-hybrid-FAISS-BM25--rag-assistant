Best practices for serializing objects to a custom string format for use in an output file

I was just about to implement an override of ToString() on a particular business class in order to produce an Excel-friendly format to write to an output file, which will be picked up later and processed. Here's what the data is supposed to look like: 5555555 "LASTN SR, FIRSTN" 5555555555 13956 STREET RD TOWNSVILLE MI 48890 25.88 01-003-06-0934 It's no big deal for me to just make a format string and override ToString() , but that will change the behavior of ToString() for any objects I decide to serialize this way, making the implementation of ToString() all ragged across the library. Now, I've been reading up on IFormatProvider , and a class implementing it sounds like a good idea, but I'm still a little confused about where all this logic should reside and how to build the formatter class. What do you guys do when you need to make a CSV, tab-delimited or some other non-XML arbitrary string out of an object?
