Prove $X_t =$ $\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j * Y_{t-j} = \psi (B) * Y_t$ is stationary?

I was going through my time series text and I found a curious identity that the book just says is true without actually going in depth to prove it. I am unable to figure out how this works, so I would appreciate pointers. The theorem states: "Let {$Y_t$} be a stationary process w/ mean 0 and a covariance function $\gamma_Y$. If $\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty |\psi_Y| $X_t =$ $\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j * Y_{t-j} = \psi (B) * Y_t$ is stationary with mean 0 and autocovariance $\gamma_X (h)$ = $\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j*\psi_k*\gamma_y (h+k-j)$" I presume $B$ is the backshift operator. I'm having trouble mentally parsing what $X_t$ even means; specifically the meaning of $\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty |\psi_Y|
