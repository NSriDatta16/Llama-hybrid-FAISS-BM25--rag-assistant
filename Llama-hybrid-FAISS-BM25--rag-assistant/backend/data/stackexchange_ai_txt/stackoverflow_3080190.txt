How does google mail implement the new upload functionality with html5?

I noticed while using Firefox and Chrome that in gmail I can now simply drag & drop multiple files in a new mail. Then suddenly a bar grows and I can drop the files there and they get uploaded. I think this is html5 functionality. Does anyone have information about how to implement this? What is needed from html5 and how to handle it server side (.NET).
