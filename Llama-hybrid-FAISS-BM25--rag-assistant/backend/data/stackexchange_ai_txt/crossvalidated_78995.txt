Poisson and Exponential Distribution- Is the following question correct?

Accidents occur with a Poisson distribution at an average of 4 per week. i.e., $\lambda= 4$. Calculate the probability of more than 5 accidents in any one week. What is the probability that at least two weeks will elapse between accident? Query: Is is necessary to be clear that Part 2 is based on exponential distribution or time is exponentially distributed or something like this? Note: The question is based on integrating knowledge of the Poisson and exponential distributions.
