I'll put this as an answer to get more space. And, I feel your pain of getting non-optimal data from others. So, I'm not statistician so I'm not gonna categorically say there is nothing to be done, but personally, I wouldn't try to to run any kind of regression with 16 participants. Maybe a non-parametric correlation if you had two numeric variables, or a comparison of means if you could assume a very large effect size. But not a regression with several independents. I think data visualization without any testing is recommended in this kind of situation. However, maybe post a new question focusing on the sample size issue, I think you will get insightful answers from statisticians :) Bayesian modelling can handle small sample sizes better than frequentist, so you may want to look into that. Re: if the data was larger: I think a multilevel multinomial logistic regression would work fine and I think a random intercept model (with a random intercept of participant and then all your independents as fixed effects) would be a good choice. Maybe even a random slope model with random slopes for some of your independents if enough of your participants had at least 3 observations. For instance in R, the package mlogit can handle those. Good luck and sorry I couldn't help more! Edited for grammar
