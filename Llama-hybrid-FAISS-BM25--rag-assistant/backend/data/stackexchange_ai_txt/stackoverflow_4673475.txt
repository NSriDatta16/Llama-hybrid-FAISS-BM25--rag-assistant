GWT Code Splitting and Fragments

In my larg GWT app i tried to split initial download and it happened but I confused in Leftover and exclusive fragments. Because for example when I use of GWT.runAsync --> onSuccess --> "Window.alert("blob blob");" in onModuleLoad it caused to download a fragment with 1MB size! I think it is other initial fragment, isn't ? In general my question is how to change leftover or initial fragments to exclusive fragments? RGDS Navid
