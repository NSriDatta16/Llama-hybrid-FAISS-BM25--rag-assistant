Even though Web Inspector is tightly integrated into the codebase of the WebKit project, the engine does not expose any way to invoke it from the JavaScript context (nor it should). This kind of thing would only be possible with a vendor-specific JS API exposing this functionality, but it isn't the case. The Web Inspector is a client-side thing, so I don't think it would make any sense, especially that it'd encourage web developers to write code specific only to browsers shipping WebKit and Web Inspector.
