Make classification and prediction at the same time

I am working on the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures and I was thinking about something : would it be possible to apply classification and prediction at the same time. I mean, having seen some data points of EEG, it would be possible to predict the (few) next values of the time series while saying "it's part of a seizure" (or at the opposite, "nothing happens, remain quiet") at the same time ? If yes, would it be possible to do both using the same neural net ? Thanks for any help
