Java priority queue

Java's priority queue is a data structure with O(log n) complexity for put (insertion) and O(log n) for poll (retrieval and removal of the min element). C++ STL's multimap has the same functionality but O(1) complexity for retrieval and removal of the min element (begin and erase). Is there an equivalent in Java ?
