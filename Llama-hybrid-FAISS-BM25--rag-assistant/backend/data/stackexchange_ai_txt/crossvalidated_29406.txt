Could logistic regression be used to detect large errors in least squares regression?

I have the following linear model: $$w^*=\text{arg min}_w\sum_{i=1}^N \bigg(Y_i-\sum_{j=1}^M X_{i,j}\times w_j\bigg)^2$$ Let $T \in N^*$ and $e_i=|Y_i-\sum_{j=1}^M X_{i,j}\times w_j|$. It's possible using logistic regression to predict which errors will be less than $T$ (i.e., $e_i Here is more information to make the question clearer: $N$ represent the number of observations. My data has the following property: the histogram of errors using multiple linear regression has a Laplace distribution. My data come from digital images represented on 8 bits. The $Y_i$ are current pixels and $X_{ij}$ are neighborhoods pixels. I want to predict which pixels produce errors less than $T$. I want to know what R functions can I use to make a test? $T$ is not very large, it has the values between 1 and 15 in general.
