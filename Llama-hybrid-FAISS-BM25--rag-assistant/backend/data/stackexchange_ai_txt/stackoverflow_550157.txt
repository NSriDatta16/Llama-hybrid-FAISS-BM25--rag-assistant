Assuming you are trying to get just the POST data into a FieldStorage object: # env is the environment handed to you by the WSGI server. # I am removing the query string from the env before passing it to the # FieldStorage so we only have POST data in there. post_env = env.copy() post_env['QUERY_STRING'] = '' post = cgi.FieldStorage( fp=env['wsgi.input'], environ=post_env, keep_blank_values=True )
