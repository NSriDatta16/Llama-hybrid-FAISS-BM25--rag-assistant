I can provide a textual answer to what you can do, but it will require much work to be a cross-browser implementation, and I don't know enough of the details to provide workable code. First you select the character that you're after (I assume a range object will be needed, or some text searching of the contents of the paragraph): Lore m ipsum dolor sit amet. Then you surround it with a span: Lore m ipsum dolor sit amet Then you select the span and check it's offset: var spanOffset = $('span').offset(); of course, you're going to probably want to add a class to the span, and make sure that it has the most neutral styles possible.
