Predicting class probabilities in regression based on area under the curve

Logistic regression models the log odds. That is for rv $Y$ which is binary logit$(Y=1)=X\beta$. Then with this model, you can estimate the class probabilities and hence prediction or classification is immediate. Ordinal regression does a similar thing with cumulative logits with which the class probabilities can then be calculated. Now looking at $AUC$ regression where Dodd and Peppe(2003) modeled the $AUC$, by $AUC$=$P(Y
