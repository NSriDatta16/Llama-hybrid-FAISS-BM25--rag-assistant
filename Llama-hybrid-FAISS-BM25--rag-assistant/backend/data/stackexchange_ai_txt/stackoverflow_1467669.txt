Compile an ASP.Net in a WinForms application

I'm trying to develop an agent/client that will listen to HTTP requests on a given port, and serve a simple ASP.Net page. To that end, I'm using the HttpListener and ApplicationHost classes. I've added a simple page to my project (mypage.aspx). When it contained all the code in the single file, all worked well (tested it by adding to the HTML in the page, and observing the timestamp in the browser). I then proceeded to add a single button to it, add a code-behind file (mypage.aspx.cs) and created a designer file (mypage.aspx.designer.cs) manually. I've added to the .aspx file and verified all compiles well. When trying to access the web page from the browser, I get the following error: Description : An error occurred during the parsing of a resource required to service this request. Please review the following specific parse error details and modify your source file appropriately. Parser Error Message : Could not load type 'MyNameSpace.MyPage'. Source Error : Line 1: I found out that this means my code-behind has not been compiled, or that that application cannot find the assembly. All my "bin" directory contains is the .exe and .pdb of my original application - no .dll for the .aspx. I tried the solution offered in this question and verified my .aspx and .cs files were marked for "compile" build action - to no avail. My question is: how do I cause an .aspx file to compile in a regular WinForm application? Can I do it, or will I have to resort to adding a web application to my solution?
