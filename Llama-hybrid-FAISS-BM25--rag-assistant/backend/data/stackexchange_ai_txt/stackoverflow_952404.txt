My suggestion would be to look over the graduation requirements and see what kinds of topics are covered in various first year courses and see how well you know those topics. If you believe you know enough to skip a course this may be worth exploring. For example, at the University of Waterloo, it is possible to change what first year Computer Science course one gets depending on previous experience. It is handy for letting those who already know some programming concepts to skip what may be a very boring course to get to the more interesting things. Another thought here is what first year courses outside of CS would you have and are you prepared for those courses? Could you map out what second, third and fourth year courses seem to give you a "I gotta take that!" feeling so that you could be prepared for it. Do you know much about the campus, student organizations that may be of help like a CS Club or other technical folks that may gather over a common interest. Do you know how you learn best? If someone asked you to learn about some gobbledgook subject, do you know how you'd approach it and get it done? I think many here have covered various technical suggestions, so I'll not repeat those here.
