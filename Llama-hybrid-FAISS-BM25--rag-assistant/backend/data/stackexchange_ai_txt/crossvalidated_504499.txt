Positive correlation Correlations or regression coefficients may not need to be causal relationships. There are multiple reasons why you could observe a positive correlation while you would (theoretically) expect a negative relationship 'College' can correlate with other latent (non observed) variables (or variables that are wrongly implemented into the model, e.g maybe they should not be linear). For instance it might relate to a younger age or it might relate to large cities (both these variables can be causes for poverty). 'College' might correlate positively with other variables ( multicollinearity ) and end up with a negative coefficient (even from a causal perspective). Multiple factors together can relate to the same concept, like parents socio-economic status, IQ, etc. With this it can be that you have some interaction that is negative and this get's coded by the main effect. In your case, it can be that %high school and %college are very much correlated and relate both positively to the wealth of the region. But the negative coefficient for %college can relate to the ratio %college/%high school or difference %college-%high school. A related aspect is Simpson's paradox . Positive causal effect In addition it might be that you indeed have a positive correlation due to a causal effect. It is unclear what your poverty variable means. Is it the number of people with high debts, the average income, etc.. ? For some definitions I would not be surprised that people with a college degree are more poor. For instance, you could be looking at the percentage of people with a low income (college people might not have an income but live of their parents) or the percentage of people with no or negative wealth (people with a college degree have high debts, either from tuition or from investments). It is possible that you find more "poor" people among the college-group than among other groups. Thanks to the surgeons and lawyers the people with a college degree have a high average income, but those that do not have jobs are very poor. The variance is large.
