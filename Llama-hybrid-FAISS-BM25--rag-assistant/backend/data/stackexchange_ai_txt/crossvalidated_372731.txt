You should start out with visualization, for instance plotting the zero/one variable (y-axis) against year of graduation. Use jittering to avoid overplotting, and add a simple smooth to easier see any trend. Lowess could be used for smoothing, but there are many possibilities. A more formal variant is logistic regression of course indicator against year of graduation. For correlation coefficients, see for instance discussion in Correlations between continuous and categorical (nominal) variables . But with your low sample size of $n=85$ , do not expect much, and look upon results as descriptive.
