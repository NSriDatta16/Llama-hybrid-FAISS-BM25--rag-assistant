Is DotNetNuke documentation really largely void or is it only available in the commercial editions?

I have a difficulty with a statement on the DotNetNuke pages about the documentation only being available when you pay $2000 or more for a professional or higher license. The forums are flooded with questions, many duplicated, many unanswered , despite the hard work of the DNN community to keep up with demand. I've tried the books, but they didn't provide the answers I looked for either and while the enthusiasm of the writers is clear, the verbose printing of large boiler plate examples and the lack of information or coverage of newly introduced keywords did not give me the deeper understanding that I longed for as a module developer. On one hand I'm feeling about DotNetNuke as a great place to be in, but on the other hand, every time I need that one-liner of information on a method, I end up looking for it for ages, and stepping through the code and reverse engineering is then my best friend. I'm curious, why is a product that's been around for so long, so poorly documented on the count of the API? After all, there's a rather large commercial company behind it and it thrives by the product's expandability. Am I correct in understanding that you only get this documentation if you pay dearly? Or do module development companies have special access?
