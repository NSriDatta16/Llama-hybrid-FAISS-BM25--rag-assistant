You should consider it: Using a collaborative filtering model will implicitly learn the users similarity. If you extract the lower dimension representation of users this will give you what can be considered as user embeddings. If you perform clustering on this you can get user clusters. The issue is that unless you perform collaborative filtering with side information, these clusters will only take into account the user feedback. If you choose to use a model with side information you will see that it's harder to train. So using collaborative filtering + cluster of users can help you augment your recommender model: i.e on top of the recommendation returned, you can also add the most popular products for a given cluster of users this may help mitigate the recommendations of new users with popular items. the only hard no here is do not train multiple recommender models. This will make your life harder (each model will learn from less data). Tastes are ambiguous and a single model can learn nuances between customer groups.
