Uneven Sample Sizes - Post-Hoc in R

I have a database in which I'm comparing the habituation rates of crabs across a period of time. I have created a database containing the regression slope values for each individual. I have run an Anova comparing my slopes. However i am unsure of which post-hoc test to run (i believe a tukey-kramer), and how to code for that, as my sample sizes are uneven. My database looks similar to this, but with much more datapoints: Crab ID |Habitat |Slope ---- |---- |---- 4 |Bare |0.003148946 7 |Bare |0.004166906 11 |Bare |0.019524323 13 |Bare |0.02184341 3 |Complex |0.128679071 6 |Complex |0.066077077 9 |Complex |0.02622547 12 |Complex |0.012996901 15 |Complex |0.021417606 18 |Complex |0.028369676 21 |Complex |0.03748329 24 |Complex |0.053252884 5 |Simple |0.016888439 8 |Simple |0.002195244 17 |Simple |0.007269998 23 |Simple |0.029555186 35 |Simple |0.004795072 38 |Simple |0.034794577 41 |Simple |0.029953562 regano
