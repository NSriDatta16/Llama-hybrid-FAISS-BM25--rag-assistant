If you train your network using a large enough dataset and the design of your model is good for your data, the prediction accuracy can get very high. But like all machine learning algorithms, even deep learning algorithms have the limitation of being able to only predict the outcomes of your use case. Deterministic solutions are not possible due to the inherent design properties of ANNs. You can use a tanH activation function to get outputs in the [-1,+1] range. After a lot of training it is possible that your network will predict correct results in almost all the cases but it again depends on what threshold you set for your outputs.
