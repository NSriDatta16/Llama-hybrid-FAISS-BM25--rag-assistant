Many machine learning tasks attempt to discover the relationship between two vectors, X and Y from data containing paired examples of each. In your case you seem to be saying the X is a vector of current doses and Y is a vector of better doses if you happen to be on X already. So you need to ask yourself some questions: Do I have a reliable set of data pairing examples of current doses to recommended better ones? Is it reasonable to assume that the second set of doses are dependent to some extent on the first? Perhaps something like "If drug a is at 0.2 and b is at 0.4, then a can be increased to 0.3". If you answer yes to those questions, you may find ML can help. You sound like you are at the beginning of your learning journey in this field, so find some help or do some reading before you embark on the project in earnest. ML is not a magic solution machine. You need to know what you are doing.
