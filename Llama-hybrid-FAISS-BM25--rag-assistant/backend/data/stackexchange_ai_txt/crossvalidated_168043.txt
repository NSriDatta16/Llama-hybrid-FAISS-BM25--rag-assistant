Dangers of averaging between model approaches

I am working with some ridership data that is broken down by route, year and month. I have built and tested a whole bunch of models ranging from GLM, GEE, GENLIM, and Panel and ARIMA data models. I believe some aspects of each of these model are correct when I predict on another dataset. However, I am not sure that I agree with how fast some model approaches increase and the limit to which they increase to. Is it a valid statistical approach to average say each of the best models estimations predictions together? What sorts of issues would I be dealing with if I did? Thanks for the insights!
