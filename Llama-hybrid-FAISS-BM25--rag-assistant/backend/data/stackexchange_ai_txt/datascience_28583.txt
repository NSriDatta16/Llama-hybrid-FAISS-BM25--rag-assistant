Words as features of a neural networks

I'm new in Machine learning and I'm working on a problem related to text. I know that in ML we can use features as numerical values as input to neural network, but I don't know how to use features as words. In some papers I read that we take features to be n words with some property. I really don't understand how is that possible. Please, if it is not a problem, just to tell me some good papers or textbooks or links where it is explained how to do that.
