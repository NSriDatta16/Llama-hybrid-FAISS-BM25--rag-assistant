Try using the last Azure SDK edition v1.4. With the previous versions of the SDK there were some performance problems when running a service locally. Regarding the two opened windows problem, this might happen because the compute and the storage emulator were started manually on the local machine and not by the Visual Studio. At least in my case this was the problem. After shutting down the app., the compute and the storage emulator and running again the app.(F5) everything should be fine.
