You managed to find the first part, that is the unbiased estimator for $\theta$, by noting: $$E[X] = \theta + \frac{1}{2} \implies \hat{\theta} = \bar{X} - \frac{1}{2}$$ Now you want a confidence interval at the $\beta$ level. This means that you want $$P_{\bar{X}}[a\leq\bar{X}-\frac{1}{2} \leq b] = 1-\beta$$ So what you really need is to find the distribution of $\bar{X}$. Now you can find that $$t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})}$$ Where $t$ follows a $t-distribution$ with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Where $s$ is your sample standard deviation (coming from your second moment). Generally when you find a confidence interval you want it to be of minimum measure/cardinality/length, however in this case the distribution is symmetric, so you don't need to struggle to find the range as it is symmetric around your estimator. I encourage you to find out why the above t distribution is true! Hope this helps. ______EDIT_____ As noted by jbowman in the comments, we already know the standard deviation, in which case we can use : $$ z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$ Where $\sigma$ is the "known" standard deviation and $z$ follows a standard normal distribution
