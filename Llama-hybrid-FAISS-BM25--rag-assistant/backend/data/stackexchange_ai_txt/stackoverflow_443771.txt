See http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/InternalDummyConnection . When the Apache HTTP Server manages its child processes, it needs a way to wake up processes that are listening for new connections. To do this, it sends a simple HTTP request back to itself. You can filter them using mod_rewrite, SetEnvIf or a regular expression on the User-Agent (look for "internal dummy connection").
