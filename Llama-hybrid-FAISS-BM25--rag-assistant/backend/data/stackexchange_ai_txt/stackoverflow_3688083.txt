how to divide a big php program (20kb)

I downloaded a php blog program and I want to divide this one-file php files into several php files. The purpose is to organize this messy program. (e.g. for example, each php file handles one feature. edit.php edits posts and topics.) Can anyone give me an idea? here is the file(I did some work already): http://upit.cc/files/2cdea5ee.zip The file that I am going to divide is index.php.
