(If youâ€™re afraid to evaluate your model on representative data, that should say a lot.) By oversampling the minority class, you are telling the model to expect members is that category much more often than they truly appear. Consequently, if you go to representative data (natural class ratio), I suspect that you will find the model a bit trigger-happy to classify as being in the minority class, leading to more false positives than you might expect. Then if you do not care about false positives, save yourself the trouble of doing all this difficult machine learning work that risks melting your computer; just classify everything as being in that category. If this is unacceptable, then it would seem that you have some sense of the cost you incur from misclassifications, and you might be interested in a more nuanced assessment that uses the continuous outputs of your model.
