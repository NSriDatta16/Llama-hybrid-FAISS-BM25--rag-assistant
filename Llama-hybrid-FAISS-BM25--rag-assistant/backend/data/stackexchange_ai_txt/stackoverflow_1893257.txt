How to create a sensible Hilbert Spectrum plot with R (computing environment)

I am using the EMD package for R. This package has a spectrogram function for displaying a Hilbert Spectrum (calculated with hilbertspec). The output however, is really vague and black-white. This function does not seem to have an option for outputting color images. How can I get the spectrum displayed clearly and if possible in color.
