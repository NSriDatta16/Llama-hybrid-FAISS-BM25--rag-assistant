IP Don't fragment bit on Mac OS

I am writing a file transferring program over TCP. I want to set the don't fragment flag on IP On a socket this is what I want to do: int val = 1; setsockopt(sd, IPPROTO_IP, IP_DONTFRAG, &val, sizeof(val)); However IP_DONTFRAG does not seem available on Mac OS. Am I missing something? or did I forget to include it correctly? Thanks in advance if anyone knows --Sam
