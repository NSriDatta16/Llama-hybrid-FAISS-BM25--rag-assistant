I suppose you already have infrastructure to create tokens from a given sentence. You can create a lucene document with one field for each word in the sentence. You can name the fields as field1, field2, and so on. Since, lucene doesn't have a schema like DB, you can define as many fields, on the fly, as you wish. You can add an additional identifier field if you want to identify which sentences matched a query. While searching, your typical lucene query will be +field1:John +field4:school Since you are not bothered about the speed of retrieval, you can write a custom Collector which will ignore scores. (That will return results significantly faster as well.) Since you don't plan to retrive back the matching sentences or words, you should only index these fields and not store. That should push performance up by a notch.
