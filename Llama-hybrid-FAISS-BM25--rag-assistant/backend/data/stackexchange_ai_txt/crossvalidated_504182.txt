Consider a (reduced-form) VARX( $p$ ) model, i.e. a vector autoregression of order $p$ . Let $y_t$ be a $k$ -dimensional vector representing the current (time $t$ ) values of the $k$ -variate time series of endogenous variables. Let $x_t$ be an $\ell$ -dimensional vector representing the current (time $t$ ) values of the $\ell$ -variate time series of exogenous variables. Let $\varepsilon_t$ be a $k$ -dimensional vector representing the current (time $t$ ) values of the $k$ -variate time series of (reduced-form) innovations. In matrix notation the model reads: $$ y_t=A_0+A_1 y_{t-1}+\dots+A_p y_{t-p}+Bx_t+\varepsilon_t $$ where $A_0$ is a $k$ -dimensional vector of intercepts, $A_1$ to $A_p$ are $k\times k$ square matrices of coefficients, and $B$ is an $\ell\times k$ matrix of coefficients. (The time index for $x$ could be different depending on whether you are including contemporaneous or lagged values.) In non-matrix notation , the simplest case of a bivariate VARX(1) with a univariate $x$ would be \begin{aligned} y_{1,t} &= a_{0,1} + a_{1,1,1}y_{1,t-1} + a_{1,1,2}y_{2,t-1} + b_{1}x_{t} + \varepsilon_{1,t}, \\ y_{2,t} &= a_{0,2} + a_{1,2,1}y_{1,t-1} + a_{1,2,2}y_{2,t-1} + b_{2}x_{t} + \varepsilon_{2,t}. \\\end{aligned} where all coefficients are scalars. In your particular case , $k=2$ and $\ell=1$ . You would use V1 in place of $y_1$ , V2 in place of $y_2$ and EX in place of $x$ .
