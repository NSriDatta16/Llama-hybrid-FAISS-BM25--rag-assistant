Hashtable and ConcurrentHashMap do not allow null keys or null values. Collections.synchronizedMap(Map) synchronizes all operations ( get , put , size , etc). ConcurrentHashMap supports full concurrency of retrievals, and adjustable expected concurrency for updates. As usual, there are concurrency--overhead--speed tradeoffs involved. You really need to consider the detailed concurrency requirements of your application to make a decision, and then test your code to see if it's good enough.
