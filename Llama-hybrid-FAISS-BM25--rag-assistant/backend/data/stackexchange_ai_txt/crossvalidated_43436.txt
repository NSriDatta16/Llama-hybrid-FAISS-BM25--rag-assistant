What's the advantages of bayesian version of linear regression, logistic regression etc

For many regression/classification algorithms, we have the bayesian version of it. Like bayesian linear regression, bayesian logistic regression, bayesian neuron network. I do not fully understand the math in them, but what are its advantages compared with the original algorithm? Is is of great practical use?
