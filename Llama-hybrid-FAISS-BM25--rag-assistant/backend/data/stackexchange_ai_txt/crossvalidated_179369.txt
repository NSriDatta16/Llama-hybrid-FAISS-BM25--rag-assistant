" Likely " by what assumptions on your data? I don't see how you could arrive at a meaningful probability here, I would avoid using probabilistic terminology here. Also note that it makes a huge difference whether you are optimizing the shortest-link, average-link, complete-link or that ratio that you gave. Optimizing for one obviously does not guarantee monotonicity for another. In these terms, your question is not well specified, because you do not say what Linkage you use.
