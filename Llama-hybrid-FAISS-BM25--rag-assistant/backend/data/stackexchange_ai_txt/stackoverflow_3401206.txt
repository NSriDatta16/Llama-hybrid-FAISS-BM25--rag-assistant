Dori, Hope this is in time to help. For this to work you need to set a reference to Word - in the VBA editor choose Tools>References and scroll down to Microsoft Word ##, where ## is 12.0 for Excel '07, 11.0 for Excel '03, etc. Also, the sheet shouldn't be filtered when you run this, and although you don't need to sort by heading 1, I assumed that you have. The code assumes that your list starts with header in cell A1. IF that's not true you should make it so. It also assumes that your last column in D. You can adjust that in the line towards the end that starts with ".Copy". Sub CopyExcelDataToWord() Dim wsSource As Excel.Worksheet Dim cell As Excel.Range Dim collUniqueHeadings As Collection Dim lngLastRow As Long Dim i As Long Dim appWord As Word.Application Dim docWordTarget As Word.Document Set wsSource = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1) With wsSource lngLastRow = .Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row Set collUniqueHeadings = New Collection For Each cell In .Range("A2:A" & lngLastRow) On Error Resume Next collUniqueHeadings.Add Item:=cell.Value, Key:=cell.Value On Error GoTo 0 Next cell End With Set appWord = CreateObject("Word.Application") With appWord .Visible = True Set docWordTarget = .Documents.Add .ActiveDocument.Select End With For i = 1 To collUniqueHeadings.Count With wsSource .Range("A1").AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:=collUniqueHeadings(i) .Range("A1:D" & lngLastRow).Copy End With With appWord.Selection .PasteExcelTable linkedtoexcel:=False, wordformatting:=True, RTF:=False .TypeParagraph End With Next i For i = 1 To collUniqueHeadings.Count collUniqueHeadings.Remove 1 Next i Set docWordTarget = Nothing Set appWord = Nothing End Sub
