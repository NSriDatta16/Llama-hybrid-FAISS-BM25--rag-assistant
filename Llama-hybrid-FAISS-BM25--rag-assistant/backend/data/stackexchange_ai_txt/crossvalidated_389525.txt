Null hypothesis for individual coefficient's p-value in multivariate logistic regression

When calculating $p$ -values for individual coefficient $a_i$ (for variable $X_i$ ) in a multivariate logistic regression, is the null hypothesis that all $a$ 's are zero? that $a_i$ is zero and others are not constrained?
