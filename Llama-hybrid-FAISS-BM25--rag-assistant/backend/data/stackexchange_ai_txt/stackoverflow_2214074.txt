The session is serialized and written to disk by default, so depending on the size and the amount of users things can become slow. However both things can be changed (read the session manual under http://php.net/session for all details) like using memcache for in-memory storage of the data. Best thing is to try it out under an environment as similar as possible tothe live system and check the resulting load and throughput.
