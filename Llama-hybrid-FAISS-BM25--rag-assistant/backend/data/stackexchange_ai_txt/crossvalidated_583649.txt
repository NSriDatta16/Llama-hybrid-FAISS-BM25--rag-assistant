Perhaps a Tukey End Count might help in your assessment and visualization. You have multiple treatments comparisons so a typical minimum end count of 7 for 95% confidence should be increased to say 9. I have a formula somewhere if you need it. For example the Disease index 0 with 6 samples is completely separated (no-overlap) with the other treatments so an end count of 12 (6+6). Imagine 6 red and 6 green marbles drawn randomly (blind) from a well mixed bag. There are 924 possible combinations (12 choose 6), but only 2 ways for complete separation (drawing the first six of one color) so p chance = 2/924 = 0.0022 (99.78% Conf). So one can be ~99.78% confident that this did not happen by chance. Since the response is bounded and is an ordered response, Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) is a likely candidate. Here is a similar question with some good information: Which model should I use to fit my data ? ordinal and non-ordinal, not normal and not homoscedastic . Perhaps a Multi-Vari Chart may be another way to show the data. Instead of jitter in a dot plot, using the cumulative % (~ Median Rank using (rank(i)-0.3)/(n+0.4) would allow one to see the transitions between Disease Index Steps. This also illustrates the differences between runs (average 3 in run1 vs. 2.4 ref. Green Line). Here is an example I did using Minitab with the assumption that there are 6 samples in each treatment group. I see R has a function as well (mvPlot) https://rdrr.io/cran/qualityTools/man/mvPlot.html If you do Ordinal Logistic Regression on this dataset, you will run into a couple of issues: 1) complete separation of pphage B1 (disease index 0) will result in a model with ever increasing coefficients because the likelihood never peaks. 2) There are no data with Disease Index 1. One could run an OLR with pphageB1 excluded for a Disease Index range of 2 to 5. Below is an OLR model for the response with and without Treatment-Run Interaction. The differences in runs is largely due to pphageB1+pph. The model with the Treatment Run Interaction fits the data better. The estimate for the Run effect probability ~p 0.002. With the Treatment Run interaction the main effect of Run increases p~0.285 (no longer significant on its own), but driven by the pphageB1+pph * Run interaction p~0.018. Ref OLR Model without Interaction: Run effect probability ~p 0.002 Ref OLR Model With Treatment-Run Interaction: Run increases p~0.285 (no longer significant on its own), but driven by the pphageB1+pph * Run interaction p~0.018 Another Graphical view that I have found helpful in OLR is a Latent Variable PDF and CDF plot of the model (here I am using Excel, but r has some nice graphs I have seen with CDF). You can see pphageB1+Pph shifting from Run1 to Run 2, and visualize the probabilities of being in Disease Group. The Threshold Lines represent the cut points between groups (left of -7.1 Disease Index 2 (or lower), right of -7.1 Disease Index 3 or higher. For more info on Tukey End Count: Tukey handled ties as 0.5 in his original paper, it would be more conservative to not count ties. Andy Sleeper has a brief overview here in "Pocket Stats": https://www.processexcellencenetwork.com/lean-six-sigma-business-performance/columns/pocket-stats-quick-significance-tests-you-can-rem The Tukey End Count test (aka Tukey's Quick Test) is a non-parametric (distribution free) test John Tukey developed, after Duckworth (an Engineer) asked if something easier than a t-test could be developed. Tukey published it in the first edition of Technometrics (1959) "A Quick, Compact, Two-Sample Test to Duckworthâ€™s Specifications".
