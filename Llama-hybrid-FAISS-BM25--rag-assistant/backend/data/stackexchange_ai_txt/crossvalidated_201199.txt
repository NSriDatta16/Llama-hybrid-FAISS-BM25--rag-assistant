The only reasons I continue to use $P$-values are More software is available for frequentist methods than Bayesian methods. Currently, some Bayesian analyses take a long time to run. Bayesian methods require more thinking and more time investment. I don't mind the thinking part but time is often short so we take shortcuts. The bootstrap is a highly flexible and useful everyday technique that is more connected to the frequentist world than to the Bayesian. $P$-values, analogous to highly problematic sensitivity and specificity as accuracy measures, are highly deficient in my humble opinion. The problem with all three of these measures is that they reverse the flow of time and information. When you turn a question from "what is the probability of getting evidence like this if the defendant is innocent" to "what is the probability of guilt of the defendant based on the evidence", things become more coherent and less arbitrary. Reasoning in reverse time makes you have to consider "how did we get here?" as opposed to "what is the evidence now?". $P$-values require consideration of what could have happened instead of what did happen . What could have happened makes one have to do arbitrary multiplicity adjustments, even adjusting for data looks that might have made an impact but actually didn't. When $P$-values are coupled with highly arbitrary decision thresholds, things get worse. Thresholds almost always invite gaming. Except for Gaussian linear models and the exponential distribution, almost everything we do with frequentist inference is approximate (a good example is the binary logistic model which causes problems because its log likelihood function is very non-quadratic). With Bayesian inference, everything is exact to within simulation error (and you can always do more simulations to get posterior probabilities/credible intervals). I've written a more detailed accounting of my thinking and evoluation at http://www.fharrell.com/2017/02/my-journey-from-frequentist-to-bayesian.html
