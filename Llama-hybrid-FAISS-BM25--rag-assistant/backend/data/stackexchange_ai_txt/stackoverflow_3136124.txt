How to turn contentEditable into a structured markup editor?

There's LyX and such editors that attempt to ensure you write text that has a distinct structure. I want same behavior from a html5 contentEditable field except I don't know how. My requirements: No DIV -tags are created. Text is not allowed outside a text container. (paragraphs, headings, pre -blocks and inline -elements) I also need to figure out how to traverse the content and push it to the server in that restricted form. (I'll also love a good documentation on things I can do for a contenteditable -field)
