Have you considered augmenting your accelerometer data by applying rotations so that the trained classifier is robust against changes in sensor orientation? This approach has been successfully tried in similar tasks, e.g. here One factor that can introduce label-invariant variability of wearable sensor data are differences in sensor placement between participants. For example, an upside-down placement of the sensor can invert the sign of the sensor readings without changing the labels. Therefore, augmentation by applying arbitrary rotations (Rot) to the existing data can be used as a way of simulating different sensor placements. (...) The best performance among the single data augmentation methods is achieved by rotation or here In the gravity rotation step, we used the fact that the measured gravitational acceleration could be slightly different for each trial, even for the same activity. Therefore, ag was slightly rotated about the forward component of qh to generate new data. In internal test, rotation ranges within $[âˆ’10^\circ, 10^\circ]$ generally improved the inference performance of the neural network. Otherwise, note that the orientation of the (accelerometer) sensor has a continuous spectrum (unless you're only accounting for the basic 90-degree rotations) which would require you to construct a rotation matrix out of your gyroscope readings to preprocess your accelerometer readings.
