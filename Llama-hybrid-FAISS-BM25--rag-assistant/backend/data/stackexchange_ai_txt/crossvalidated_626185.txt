A few points (even a decade later). First, as others have pointed out, you would want logistic regression, not linear. Second, while you can do this with logistic reg., when you have that many variables you need a lot of data. Third, I have some issues with your variables. E.g you say "age" but I think you mean "age difference". And that should not be treated as a pure difference. The difference between 18 and 28 is much bigger than the difference between 58 and 68. The direction of the difference might also matter; if this site is only for heterosexual dating, you might want to treat older male-younger female differently than the other way round. For another example: Car (yes/no) is going to be interesting. The other person having a car is much more important if you don't have one. And the degree of importance varies by location. Speaking of location, how are you measuring that? And so on. Pretty much every variable you list is tricky. Finally, I think this might be a good spot for classification trees or one of their offshoots. There will be lots of interesting interactions among the variables. Another possibility is multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS).
