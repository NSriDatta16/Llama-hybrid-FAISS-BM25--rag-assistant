Adhoc stored procs on silverlight app

I have a simple requirement to be implemented on a silverlight app. I want to list down all the stored procs in a drop down and view its output on a grid. I am currently having a linq to sql class where I have drag dropped all the stored procs I want to view and generated the classes on a .dbml file. This works for me at the moment. However, if I have a new stored proc, I am forced to generate the class and update the service again. Is there a way to view the results of the stored proc without updating the service everytime? I was thinking of using DataContext.ExecuteCommand Method but not sure if there is a much better way to do this.
