Magento list of related(recommended) products in checkout cart

i'm tring to put a list of recommended items in checkout cart page, i was trying to use the related products block that is in layaout/catalog.xml, but it works for a single product in product view page, and in the checkout cart page can be more than one product, so, how can i make something like this, if it can be done??
