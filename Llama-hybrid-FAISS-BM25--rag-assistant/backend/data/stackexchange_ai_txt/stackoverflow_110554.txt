Anyone familiar with a good "sticky windows" library for Winforms?

I want to recreate the stickiness and snapping of windows, like it is implemented in Winamp. The basic premise is, when you drag a window and it comes close to another one, it will snap to it and will stick. When you move it the two will move together. I need it for a MDI application.
