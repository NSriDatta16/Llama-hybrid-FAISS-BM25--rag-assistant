IE needs 2 textboxes to submit a button?

I've got this weird problem, and I'm not sure whether ASP.NET or IE 7 is to blame... The idea is this: When I have just one textbox and one (submit) button on my form, then pressing ENTER while inside the textbox will just POST the textbox'es value. The button does not get submitted and does not trigger the Click even server-side. When I have two textboxes, then hitting ENTER in any of them will also send the button and trigger the Click event. WTF? Added: Seems to be an IE-related issue. Here's a simple example to demonstrate. Pay attention to the address bar and hit ENTER when in the first textbox, and then when in some of the last two.
