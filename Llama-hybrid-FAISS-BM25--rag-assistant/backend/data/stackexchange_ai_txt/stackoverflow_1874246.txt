All agreed that @interface, @implementation etc are all pre-processor directives rather than keywords Then all were mistaken. #import and #pragma are preprocessor directives. @interface, @implementation, @protocol and so forth are keywords of Objective-C, and they are compiler directives. They haven't been preprocessor directives since NeXT extended GCC to compile Objective-C without a Stepstone's original Objective-C pre-processor implementation.
