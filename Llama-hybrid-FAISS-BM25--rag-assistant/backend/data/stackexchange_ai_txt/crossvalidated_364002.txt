Averaging slopes from multiple linear regressions

So I am interested in a potential study that involves measuring a change in two variables (one independent and one dependent) over time. For a single participant and a given time interval, one can measure the change in each variable. This gives a data point on the plot of change in dependent variable vs change in the independent variable. Repeating this for each time interval gives a collection of data points that one can perform a linear regression on. Thus, for each participant, we get a scatter plot and a line of best fit. The study separates the participants into two groups. The group determines the way in which the dependent variable is modulated. I expect that for one of the groups, the lines of best fit will on average have larger slopes. How can I compare the slopes between the two different groups? I considered averaging the slopes for each group and directly comparing the averages but this seems quite naive. Is there a general way of comparing the slopes of the two groups (perhaps by obtaining two distributions of slopes)? Or would it be more accurate to analyse the data in a completely different way?
