I can only suggest to use EXPLAIN PLAN a lot to figure out what the query optimizer is doing to reorganize the query. An alternative approach may be to talk to the business and figure out what they truly want and look in the system if there is no information available which is closer to the problem domain. I once had a situation like that regarding "On time deliveries" where the definition of "On Time Delivery" was butchered beyind recognition by the business middle management, eager to present a "good news show" and was bloated to the extreme because of special case handling. Pushing back, going to the Management Handbook, implementing the definition which was there, and using a handy aggregates table create by Oracle EBS, reduced the runtime from 25mins to 2 secs.
