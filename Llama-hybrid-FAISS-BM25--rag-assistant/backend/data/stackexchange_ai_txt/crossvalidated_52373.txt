Which test(s) for analyzing yes-no answers for control vs treated conditions

To keep it simple, I have sets of data in which I have a control and a treated sample. The data I obtain is "yes" or "no" (0 or 1) for a particular behaviour. I have 150 data points for each condition (150 for control, 150 treated), obtained across 3 experimental runs, which I intend to pool. They are not paired in any way. Which test would you recommend? I am currently thinking that binary logistic regression is the best choice, but I'm not sure. I am a biologist and not a mathematician, so please keep that in mind :)
