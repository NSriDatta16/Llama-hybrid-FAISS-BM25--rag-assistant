working code for Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment 2ed preferably on Ubuntu/gcc4

i was learning Linux system programming and i am going through the APUE 2ed book by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago. The code given on http://www.apuebook.com/ does not work. Undefined definitions, un-implemented functions (given in appendix) Can anyone point me to getting-compiled code for APUE 2ed, preferably on Ubuntu/gcc4.
