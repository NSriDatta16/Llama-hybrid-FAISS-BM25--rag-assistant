Though what you do is technically possible, I would not strip out ambiguous songs like that. The problem is that by doing so, you lose information that would tell you something, even if being ambiguous for some stations. An example would be: one song is played equally by station A-Y, but not station Z. So, hearing this song would decrease the probability of station Z being the currently heard station, and would slightly increase it for all other stations. Instead, you might want to incorporate all of this information in your model. You could e.g. try Bayesian approaches: they would enable you to a) get a proper probability per individual song for each station, and b) would allow you to increase/decrease those probabilities for each station over time, as more songs are played by the same station (which, as in the example above, would influence probability, even is they might be ambiguous for some stations).
