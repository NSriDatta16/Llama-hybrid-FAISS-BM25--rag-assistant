How to format a number with commas as thousands separators?

I am trying to print an integer in JavaScript with commas as thousands separators. For example, I want to show the number 1234567 as "1,234,567". How would I go about doing this? Here is how I am doing it: function numberWithCommas(x) { x = x.toString(); var pattern = /(-?\d+)(\d{3})/; while (pattern.test(x)) x = x.replace(pattern, "$1,$2"); return x; } console.log(numberWithCommas(1000)) Is there a simpler or more elegant way to do it? It would be nice if it works with floats also, but that is not necessary. It does not need to be locale-specific to decide between periods and commas.
