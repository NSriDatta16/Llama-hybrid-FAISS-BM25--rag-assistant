The shortest and most direct way I can answer your question is to say that there will be a performance impact if the two tables you are linking don't have sequential primary keys. As you stated/quoted, the index for the link table will either become fragmented, or the DBMS will work harder to insert records if the link table does not have its own sequential primary key. This is the reason most people put a sequentially incrementing primary key on link tables.
