Asking one DB to act as an operational and warehouse system at the same time is still a bit of a tall order. I would consider using SQL server or Oracle for operational system and having a separate DW for reporting and analytic, probably keeping the system you have. Expect some table re-design and normalization to happen on the operational side to fit one-row per page limitations of row-based storage. If you need to have fast updates of the DW, you may consider EP for ETL approach, as opposed to standard (scheduled) ETL. Considering that you are in the early stage of this, take a look at Microsoft project Madison , which is auto-scalable DW appliance up to 100s TB. They have already shipped some installations.
