Measuring 'synchrony' with time series correlations

Question from a stats novice and StackExchange newb, an anthropologist with a computer science background. I'm looking for an appropriate statistical measure for 'synchrony' as in the following situation: I have a panoramic video of several people sitting in chairs around the camera having a conversation for an hour. I split the video up by person and generated time series data for each individual, measuring how much they move, gesture, etc. over time (i.e. number of pixels different between successive video frames). So I have a graph of how still or animated a person is at each moment over an hour (using moving average to smooth things out). I want to measure the 'synchrony' of the group at each moment, i.e. generate another time series that shows how 'synched up' their movements are at any given moment. What kind of statistical measure would be appropriate for this? Simpler/intuitive the better. Some assumptions: If only one person is moving, synchrony should be near zero. If everyone is moving, synchrony should be near max. Note that this will be used primarily for visual inspection and analysis, to highlight those parts of the video where people are synchronous. -Daniel
