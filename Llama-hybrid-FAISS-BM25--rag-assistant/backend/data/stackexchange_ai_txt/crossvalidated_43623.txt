Comparing pre-retrofit utility bill time series data to post retrofit data

I have hourly utility bills for two years. The first year's data are from before a retrofit was performed on a home and the second year is after the retrofit was performed. How do I compare the two time series statistically to make claims of demand savings during a specific time period of the day. Can this be done in R, if so how?
