It's hard to make a definite statement about this situation, but I would investigate the storage layer. Short reads like the error message indicates usually "can't happen" on local, normally attached storage. So if you have a SAN, NAS, NFS, some nontrivial RAID configuration, or something else of interest, check the logs or error counters there. If the files are there, then that means that it's not a corruption inside PostgreSQL. One thing that would have been interesting to try, but it's probably too late now, is to try to read the files manually and see what happens. The fact that VACUUM FULL fixed it was probably just because that rewrites the table completely into new files, so whatever was causing hickups with the old files is gone.
