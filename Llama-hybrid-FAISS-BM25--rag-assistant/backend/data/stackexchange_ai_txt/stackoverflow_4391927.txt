There are a couple of other events you can use than focus and blur Most interesting to this issue should be drop , dragenter and dragleave Please note: in MSIE it looks like the focus-event fires immediatly after drop, so you need a kind of flag to set on drop (and remove this flag a moment later), to handle a invocation of focus forced by drop. Also note: unfortunately opera doesn't support those dragdrop-events
