At first you have to decide how to let the user move and resize your image in a user-friendly manner. If your image were rectangular, you could decide for resizing when the user drags on one of the edges and for moving when he drags from a point inside the rectangle. You might do the same with your star shape, but I doubt that it will be intuitive enough for the users. Then you can implement moving and dragging by overriding touchesMoved , checking whether the first touch is inside your shape (or on the edge), and move (or resize) to the last touch. You will find that the calculations are not so easy, but that is the only way [I know] to do it.
