File writing problem on Windows 7 Professional in c#

I have an application in C# which I write some data to file. I am facing the problem on windows 7 professional that when I write data to C:\ProgramData , Access denied acception is thrown. If I login from an administrator account this issue vanishes, and if I login from some other account who have administrative previlages this issue comes up. This issue is only produces on windows 7 professional, it is working fine on all other flavors of windows 7 as well as windows vista. try { XmlTextWriter myXmlTextWriter = new XmlTextWriter("Configuration.xml", null); myXmlTextWriter.Formatting = Formatting.Indented; myXmlTextWriter.WriteStartDocument(true); myXmlTextWriter.WriteDocType("ApplicationConfigurations", null, null, null); ////myXmlTextWriter.WriteComment("This file represents another fragment of a book store inventory database"); myXmlTextWriter.WriteStartElement("Configuration"); myXmlTextWriter.WriteElementString("firstElement", pe.ToString()); myXmlTextWriter.WriteEndElement(); myXmlTextWriter.WriteEndDocument(); myXmlTextWriter.Flush(); myXmlTextWriter.Close(); }catch(Exception e) { //Exception is thrown in Win7 professional }
