Flex + Drupal Sharing Data

I've looked around a bit and I can't seem to find the answer to this problem: in fact, this may be a stupid question and there isn't an answer. So anyway; here's my problem. I have a website that runs off of Drupal. So, I've also started to mess around with Adobe Flex to create a few fancy drag/drop webapps that I'd like to embed into my Drupal site. Now the question is this... I want the application to know what you're logged in as. So for example, I have an application that does college football voting and you only get one vote per week. However, I want to avoid having the user have to type in their username and password... Is there a way that I can get the application to get the current user_id out of the site, so I can put that behind the scenes and prevent users stuffing the ballot box or voting as someone else? Any help would be great...
