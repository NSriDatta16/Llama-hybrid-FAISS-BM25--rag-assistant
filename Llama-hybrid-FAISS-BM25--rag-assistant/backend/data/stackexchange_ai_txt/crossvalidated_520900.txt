Out of sample is definitely necessary when looking across models because some models will fit much closer to the samples than others. But these same models can perform much worse for your forecasting problem. There are some in-sample measures such as AICC/BIC which are appropriate for certain models but doesn't apply to everything. At the end of the day you want to forecast so you should judge based on the forecast. In terms of other models to try: fbprophet is a nice plug and play model A Mean/Median is a good baseline to have and can be best a lot Likewise a seasonal naive AKA just repeat your last year of data can be good LSTMs are ok but less plug and play I have some old code you could play around with https://github.com/tblume1992/LazyProphet Time series literature has a ton more and the hyndman book is a good place to start although it is in r: https://otexts.com/fpp2/
