Accessing an instance in a dynamically added MC

I've added a movie clip dynamically using the following code: var apie=new cPie() apie.x=100 apie.y=100 stage.addChild(apie) I now have a pie on my stage. Yum. Assuming this works like a movie clip placed on the stage by dragging and dropping, I added this in to change an instance in the pie. var apie=new cPie() apie.x=100 apie.y=100 apie.cherry.gotoAndStop(2) stage.addChild(apie) cherry is an instance in the cPie movie clip which is another movie clip consisting of 3 frames. I want it to go to the second frame. Usually, doing it this way would work, but when trying with a movie clip added through ActionScript I'm faced with the following runtime error: TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference. at pies_fla::MainTimeline/frame1() As always, the error returned doesn't help me solve this problem at all. It's about as obscure as the "implicit coercion" thing, which makes no sense to me not being an English major. What I do know is that I'm doing something wrong and as a result I get this error. The correct way to go about this would be very appreciated. P.S. I plan to use this in a loop. Please take that into consideration.
