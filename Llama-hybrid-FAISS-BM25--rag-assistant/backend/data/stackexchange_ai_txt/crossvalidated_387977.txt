There are 2 billion people, everyone goes to a hotel (out of 200,000 hotels and average 100 people capacity/hotel) 1 day in 100, examine hotel records for 2000 days: look for people who, on 3 different days, were both at the same hotel, the number of pairs of people is C(2x109, 2) ≈ 2 X 1018, the number of two people meet of 3 same days is C(2000, 3) ≈ 1.3 X 109 so the number of pairs of people who look like evil-doers is 2 X 1018 X 1.3 X 109 X (0.012 / 200,000)2 ≈ 0.325
