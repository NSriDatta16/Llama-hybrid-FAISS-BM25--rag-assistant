Silverlight RESTful Azure Table Access

I am developing a Windows Phone 7 application. One part of it is to create a webrole on the laptop for creating tables on the Windows Azure cloud which I have already finished. I am developing a Silverlight application on Windows Phone 7 which needs to access the cloud for querying the tables and updating them. I have found at lot of places in the internet that this can be done by making RESTful calls to the Windows TAble Storage. But nowhere I could find any sample code. Can anybody post some sample code how RESTful calls to Windows Table Storage is done, so that I can query and update the tables from the Client(Silverlight Application - Windows Phone 7). Any links and references are also welcome.
