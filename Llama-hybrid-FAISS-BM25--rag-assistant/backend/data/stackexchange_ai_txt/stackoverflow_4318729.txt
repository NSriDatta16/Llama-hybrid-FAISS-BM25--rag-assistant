Write a private access file to another app's files directory

The two apps have the same sharedUserId. When I use this code in app1 context.openFileOutput("/data/data/org.me.app2/files/shared-data.dat", MODE_PRIVATE) I get an exception telling me that the file contains a path separator. I am trying to write a file from app1 into app2's storage. (I do of course need to make sure that app2's files directory exists first) Ideally, I would write to a user specific directory instead of an app specific directory, but I do not know if that can be done
