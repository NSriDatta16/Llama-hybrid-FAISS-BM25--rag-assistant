Bayesian Homework: Uniform Prior

Suppose posterior density of parameter $\theta$ is $$\pi(\theta|\mathbf x)=\frac{\Gamma(5)}{\Gamma(3)\Gamma(2)}\theta^{3-1}(1-\theta)^{2-1}.$$ Now I have to find which of the two hypotheses $H_1:\theta\le0.5$ and $H_2:\theta>0.5,$ has greater posterior probability under the uniform prior? I have the solution of the question too, but I didn't understand. It said: $P(H_1 \text{is true}|\mathbf x)=\int_{0}^{0.5}\frac{\Gamma(5)}{\Gamma(3)\Gamma(2)}\theta^{3-1}(1-\theta)^{2-1}d\theta$ What is uniform prior? Why didn't they incorporate the information of uniform prior in the above integration?
