R: Need some help on generalized linear mixed models with binomial data

I would like to find out how the probability of tree-microhabitat occurrence is related to the age of a tree and how is this relationship influenced by KKT and Tree species. Here is an example of my dataset: aSite KKT Tree Tspecies Age Concavity Deadwood Epiphyte Exudate A858500211 SL 407 KU 124 1 0 1 0 A858500211 SL 408 KU 102 1 0 0 0 A858500211 SL 409 KU 96 1 0 0 1 A50574003711 SL 467 KU 39 0 0 1 0 A50574003711 SL 468 KU 45 0 0 0 0 A50574003711 SL 469 KU 34 0 0 0 1 A50574003711 SL 470 HB 39 0 1 1 0 A50574003711 SL 471 HB 38 0 0 0 0 A50574003711 SL 473 HB 43 0 0 1 0 A72467300278 AN 572 HB 26 0 0 0 0 A72467300278 AN 573 HB 25 0 0 0 0 A72467300278 AN 574 KU 23 0 0 0 0 A72467300278 AN 575 KU 74 0 0 0 0 A72467300278 AN 576 KU 19 0 0 0 0 A72467300278 AN 577 HB 25 0 0 0 0 A77170148111 SL 82 HB 52 0 0 1 0 A77170148111 SL 83 HB 64 0 0 1 0 A78237748311 SL 265 KU 74 0 0 0 0 As far as I understand (for reading and researching the topic for a week and a half and from my earlier studies), I need to create a generalized linear mixed model for every tree-microhabitat. Since I have about three trees per species in every site, "aSite" should be as a random effect in the model. And since I have binomial data, I have to use logistic regression (with mixed effects). So, would this be a correct way to start: model I know I have to test the assumptions (I don't know or remember what they are yet) and whether all added factors are relevant or not, but I would appreciate if you would send me the code for plotting the results. I also would appreciate if you'd send me a link for a relevant tutorial-like webpage, from where I could find more help on the topic. In any case, I tried this: fit and got a really weird result. What I know is definitely wrong there, is the fact that I need different plots for different Species and for different KKT-s. The points seem accurate but the lines are definitely not the way they supposed to be (I'd like to see one line, I guess).
