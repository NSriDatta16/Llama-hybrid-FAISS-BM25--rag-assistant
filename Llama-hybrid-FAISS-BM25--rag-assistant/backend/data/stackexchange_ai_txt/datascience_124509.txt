It looks like your problem is more suitable for optimization (operational research) techniques than machine learning algorithms. If I understood it right, you could build a model that can decide how many cars should be allocated on each truck load and model the dynamics of how each truck composes the cars that will get to which clients, etc, optimizing some objective function that makes sense for the problem and use a solver framework to find an optimal solution. If you can share more details like some description or print of tables and more about the problem dynamics it would help people help you.
