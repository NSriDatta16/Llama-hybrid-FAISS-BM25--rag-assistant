If your data is aggregated up to the country level, then your options are limited. I recommend organizing your data into a panel structure as you have repeated observations on countries over time. Given the staggered adoption periods, you could estimate the following two-way fixed effects equation: $$ \text{Rate}_{it} = \sum_i \text{Country}_i + \sum_t \text{Year}_t + \delta \text{Policy}_{it} + u_{it} $$ where the summations denote a full series of indicators (i.e., fixed effects) for all countries $i$ and years $t$ , respectively. If treatment is binary, then $\text{Policy}_{it}$ is equal to 1 if a country is a treated country and in a post-treatment time period, 0 otherwise. Since all countries eventually become exposed to the policy, then it should index all years where the policy 'turns on' (i.e., switches from 0 to 1) in the respective country. Here, $\delta$ is your causal estimand, but note that the equation is identified only off the variation in the timing of policy adoption across countries . The foregoing equation is a generalization of the canonical "difference-in-differences" estimator. It accommodates designs where units may implement their policies at different times. Note, $\text{Policy}_{it}$ is not an indicator of 'group' status (i.e., treatment group versus control group). Rather, it is a policy dummy 'turning on' (i.e., switching from 0 to 1) for adopter countries and only during the years when the policy is in effect. Even though all countries become exposed, we still have variation in treatment timing . This is the extra layer of variation we can exploit in the absence of a viable control group. In spite of the staggered variation present in your setting, I would highly recommend acquiring data on countries never espousing the policy. As it pertains to the coding of $\text{Policy}_{it}$ , all non-adopter countries should be coded 0 in all years. They serve as your baseline history of never receiving a treatment. In practice, I recognize the difficultly of identifying a control group post-hoc. If you cannot acquire a suitable counterfactual, then identification of a "program effect" must rely on the relative time differences across countries reflecting the observed onset of the policy. I must caution you that in order to use this approach, you must defend two positions. First, you must ensure that no other concurrent reforms were in effect which might confound the effects of the vaccination policy. Second, you should observe little evidence of pre-trends . Note that early-adopter countries serve as counterfactuals for late-adopter countries. Heterogeneous effects might offset parallel trends in subsequent policy adoption periods. Once a country is exposed to the policy, it must only experience a sharp jump in its average outcome; this level shift should be immediate—and persistent—however it should not set a country on a completely differently growth trajectory. In other words, we still assume a stable time evolution after the introduction of the policy. Other possibilities include exploiting differences in vaccination 'dosage' across countries. Even though the policy affects all countries, some may have experienced it with greater intensity. In this sense, it is permissible to dichotomize jurisdictions into 'low/high' intensity groups. The subset of countries comprising your 'low' intensity treatment group would serve as your reference. I hope you find these suggestions useful.
