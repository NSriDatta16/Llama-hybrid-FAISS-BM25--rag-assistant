OpenCV has some functions for pattern recognition in images. You might want to look at this : http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/pattern_recognition.html . (broken link: closest thing in the new doc is http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/ml__machine_learning.html , although it is no longer what I'd call helpful documentation for a beginner - see other answers) However, I also recommend starting with Matlab because openCV is not intuitive to use.
