Like you, I add Prefix property (a string) to my ViewModels which I append before my model bound input names. (YAGNI preventing the below) A more elegant solution might be a base view model that has this property and some HtmlHelpers that check if the view model derives from this base and if so append the prefix to the input name. Hope that helps, Dan
