Cartesian product data frame

I have three or more independent variables represented as R vectors, like so: A and I want to take the Cartesian product of all of them and put the result into a data frame, like this: A B C 1 x 0.1 1 x 0.5 1 y 0.1 1 y 0.5 2 x 0.1 2 x 0.5 2 y 0.1 2 y 0.5 3 x 0.1 3 x 0.5 3 y 0.1 3 y 0.5 I can do this by manually writing out calls to rep : d but there must be a more elegant way to do it, yes? product in itertools does part of the job, but I can't find any way to absorb the output of an iterator and put it into a data frame. Any suggestions? p.s. The next step in this calculation looks like d$D so if you know a way to do both steps at once, that would also be helpful.
