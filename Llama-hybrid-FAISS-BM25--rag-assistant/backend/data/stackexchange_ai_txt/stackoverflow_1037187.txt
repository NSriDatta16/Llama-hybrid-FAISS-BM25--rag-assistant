That's exactly what multiple layers in the TCP/IP stack and in ISO/OSI model are for. TCP/UDP are transport protocols and they shouldn't care of fragmentation - it's not their problem. The IP level deals with the network and it deals with fragmentation since size of fragment depends on the network properties. The layer that has best conditions for solving the problem does solve it.
