Silverlight Toolkit DragDrop on WPF

Do Microsoft actually provide a build of Rx / Silverlight Toolkit DragDrop that "just works" on WPF? From what I can tell the Rx DragDrop stuff is only available in the SL Toolkit (not WPF). The SL Toolkit seems to imply you can use it in WPF (various #defines) but gives no further info on how to do it. If I just want the DragDrop stuff is it easy to port it to WPF, or does 100M lines of SL Toolkit come along for the ride?
