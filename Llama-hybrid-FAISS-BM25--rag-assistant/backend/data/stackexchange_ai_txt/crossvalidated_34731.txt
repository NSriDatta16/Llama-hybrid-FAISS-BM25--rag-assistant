Often with surveys there is a scoring function. You score the seven responses, sum them and compare the sums between the groups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test can then be used to look for differences between these sums (or averages). If the scores could be assumed to be approximately normally distributed a two sample student t test could be applied instead.
