Can I use variance inflation factor (VIF) for logistic regression?

I have generated a glm model with 20 or so predictors. I have carried out stepwise regression(forward and backwards selection) to identify the important predictor variables. My final model has 7 predictor variables. The results are below: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.888112 0.859847 -9.174 I want to see if multi-colinearity exists, so I have used the VIF function from the car package. My understanding is that VIF is used for linear models, so I was wondering whether it can be used in glm (logistic) models? However, I am unsure whether VIF can be applied to a logistic model? I have the results below for VIF: vif(model_logistic) age bmi surgery1 surgery2 1.046694 1.008971 6.256793 3.658226 surgery_3 cvd rt_1 4.660840 1.038339 1.144582
