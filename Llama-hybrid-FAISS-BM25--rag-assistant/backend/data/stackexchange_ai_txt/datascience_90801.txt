Compare the MAE Vs R^2 output for Machine learning 10-fold CV

I am comparing two 10-fold cv machine learning outputs. I got: For model 1: MAE= 0.252 R^2= 0.447 RMSE= 0.37 For Model 2: MAE= 0.434 R^2= 0.768 RMSE= 1.164 My question is: Is it possible to get higher $R^2$ for higher MAE? What does this mean?
