I don't claim to be able to predict the future; however, the with the limited html and css support currently available to HTML based emails as well as the huge crack down on scripts due to early macro viruses, I don't know if JavaScript will be added anytime soon. I'd recommend to try and keep email messages to just basic messages and leave the behavior aspects of such to the web page version of such. If email clients began to implement such, the actual JavaScript object model would have to be limited so that a person couldn't really do window.open() nor attempt to send other emails out like they used to back in the day. With a limited scripting set, it wouldn't really be worth the different implementations.
