Android Download Zip to SD card?

I have a 100 meg zip file that I need to download when the app first starts. It needs to unzip to the SD card (400 meg). I'd rather not have to have it touch the phone's storage as many phones won't have 400 meg free on the phone's storage. Can this be done (any one have an example?) Thanks, ian
