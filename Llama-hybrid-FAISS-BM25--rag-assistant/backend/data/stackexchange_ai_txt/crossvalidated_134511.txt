Yes, more data as a general rule is usually better and given that you have just one answer per condition, then the move to get 2 data points per condition for each participant is a good idea. Its not just 1 more data point, but also double the amount of data on which to model a response per person. You could take the average of the participant's answers. A strict answer to that depends on the variability between the answers. BUT, why bother, just add another factor for each participant 'question number' with two levels '1' and '2'. If there is no difference between the answer order, then the whole model will be the same as taking the mean. On the other hand, if the there is a systematic difference between the answers (for some reason), you can find out about that as well, essentially for free. 'Need' is a tricky word here, but yes, this could potentially decrease the amount of participants you need. Asking more questions increases your N, having them be within subject comparisons is even better (usually). So by asking more questions per person you should be reducing your variance, and thus increasing the likelihood of finding a significant model.
