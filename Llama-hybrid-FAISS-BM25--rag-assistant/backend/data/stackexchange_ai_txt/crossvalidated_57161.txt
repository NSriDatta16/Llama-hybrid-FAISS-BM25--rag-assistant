A better bayesian way of modelling autoregressive mixtures

I have a JAGS hierarchical model which includes a temporal sub-model for the primary vote share between four party groups (LNP, Labor, Green, and Other). For each day in the temporal model, the vote shares sum to one. The temporal model is an auto-regressive random walk: the vote shares for the four party groups today are much the same as they were yesterday. #### -- temporal model (a daily walk where today is much like yesterday) for(day in 2:PERIOD) { # rows for (party in 1:PARTIES) { # columns tmp[day, party] ~ dnorm(walk[day-1, party], walkPrecision[party]) } } ## -- impose a sum-to-one constraint ... total of all parties sums to one every day for(day in 1:PERIOD) { # rows walk[day, 1:PARTIES] My question - is there a better way of modelling this than I have above.
