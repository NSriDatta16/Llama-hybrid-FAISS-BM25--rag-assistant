"Key concept" is not a well-defined term in linguistics, but this may be a starting point: parse the sentence, find the subject in the parse tree or dependency structure that you get. (This doesn't always work; for example, the subject of "Is it raining?" is "it", while the key concept is likely "rain". Also, what's the key concept in "Are spaghetti and lasagna the same thing?") This kind of problem (NLP + search) is more properly dealt with by methods such as LSA , but that's quite an advanced topic.
