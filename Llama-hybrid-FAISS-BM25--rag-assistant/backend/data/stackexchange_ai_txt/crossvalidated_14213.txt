Calculating confidence intervals via bootstrap on dependent observations

The bootstrap, in its standard form, can be used to calculate confidence intervals of estimated statistics provided that observations are iid. I. Visser et al. in " Confidence Intervals for Hidden Markov Model Parameters ," used a parametric bootstrap to calculate CIs for HMM parameters. However, when we fit an HMM on an observation sequence, we have already assumed the observations are dependent (in contrast to mixture models). I have two questions: What does the iid assumption do with the bootstrap? Can we ignore the iid requirement in a parametric bootstrap? Visser et al. method is briefly as follows: Assume we have an observation sequence $Y=o_1,o_2,...,o_n$ resulted from sampling an HMM with real but unknown set of parameters $\theta=\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_l$. The parameters can be estimated using the EM algorithm: $\hat{\theta}=\hat{\theta}_1,\hat{\theta}_2,...,\hat{\theta}_l$ Use the estimated HMM to generate a bootstrap sample of size $n$: $Y^*=o^*_1,o^*_2,...,o^*_n$ Estimate parameters of the HMM according to the bootstrap sample: $\hat{\theta}^*=\hat{\theta}^*_1,\hat{\theta}^*_2,...,\hat{\theta}^*_l$ Repeat the steps 3 and 4 for $B$ times (e.g. $B$=1000) resulting in $B$ bootstrap estimations: $\hat{\theta}^*(1),\hat{\theta}^*(2),...,\hat{\theta}^*(B)$ Calculate the CI of each estimated parameter $\hat{\theta}_i$ using the distribution of $\hat{\theta}^*_i$ in bootstrap estimations. Notes (my findings): The percentiles method should be used to calculate CIs in order to have correct coverage (normality is a bad assumption). Bias of the bootstrap distribution should be corrected. Meaning that the distribution mean of $\hat{\theta}^*_i$ should be shifted to $\hat{\theta}_i$
