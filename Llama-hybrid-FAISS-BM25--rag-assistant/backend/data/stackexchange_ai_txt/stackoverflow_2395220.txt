What I would do is reorganize stuff like so: /svn /Sub-Project1 /branches /tags /trunk /Sub-Project2 /branches /tags /trunk ... You can do all this with simple svn moves. If your current branches Idea1 and Idea2 are of the current Ã¼ber-trunk then I might move those into a top-level /oldtrunk/branches . Or just delete them if they're inactive! It's svn, they'll still be there. :) Next, you mention wanting to "combine the sub-projects" where each "has a unique goal". If you want to continue to maintain them as fully encapsulated sub-projects, I would suggest getting them to build individually and combining them as libraries rather than combining the source. In Java I would use a dependency management tool like Ivy to handle this but I'm not sure what the best solution would be for Google Code + Visual Studio. You can use Ivy for non-Java stuff but it's not as intuitive.
