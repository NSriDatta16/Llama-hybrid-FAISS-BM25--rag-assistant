Evidently, each control that's going to display the drag image needs to have the csDisplayDragImage control style set. You can add that flag to a control and all its chilren with a simple function: void AddDisplayDragImageStyle(TControl* ctl) { ctl->ControlStyle (ctl); if (win) for (int i = 0; i ControlCount; ++i) AddDisplayDragImageStyle(win->Controls[i]); } Have the form call that on itself: AddDisplayDragImageStyle(this) .
