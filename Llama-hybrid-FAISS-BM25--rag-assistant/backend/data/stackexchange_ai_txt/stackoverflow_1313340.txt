Any relational database should be good for storing the raw data like lists of songs, list of users, users' song preferences.. I think that you'll find that a relational databases (and SQL) are not that great for storing the various data structures that your recommender will be constructing. Your recommendation engine will probably creating data that doesn't really need to be in tables and manipulating it for storage in a relational database may just be wasted work. Just be aware of what you are doing and don't spend time putting stuff into a SQL database if it feels wrong. Maybe look into using a document oriented database like MongoDB . The recommender that I recently wrote is actually a Java server process that reads in the raw data from MySQL, does all of its work in-memory, and provides recommendation data to my application via an HTTP API. I didn't even bother storing the recommendation data permanently since it can be regenerated.
