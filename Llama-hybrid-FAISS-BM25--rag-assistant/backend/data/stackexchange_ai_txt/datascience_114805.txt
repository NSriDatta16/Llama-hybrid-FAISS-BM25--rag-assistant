working principle of Support Vector Machine

I have a dataset consisting of numerical features and categorical features. I want train the training set using SVM. SVM is a quadratic optimization algorithm. I would like to know the how SVM works on categorical data. Can anyone share any references, links to research papers, or weblink to describe the process? I am also looking forward to know the theory behind handling categorical data using SVM.
