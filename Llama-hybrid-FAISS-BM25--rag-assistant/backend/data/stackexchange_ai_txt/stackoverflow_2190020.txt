What will be the benefits of NHibernate in a data retrieval only scenario?

We have been suggested to use NHibernate for our project. But the point is our application will only be retrieving the data from the database so are there any benefits of using NHibernate in this scenario? One more thing, what is the query execution plan in NHIbernate does it support something like prepared statements or the so called pre complied statements.?
