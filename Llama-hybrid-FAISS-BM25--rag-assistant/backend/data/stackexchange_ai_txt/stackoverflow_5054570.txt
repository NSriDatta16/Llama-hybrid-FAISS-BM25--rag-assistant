I don't see why you couldn't accomplish these things within EE. EE has some good image gallery setups, and custom programming (as of EE 2.0) relies on CodeIgniter . http://www.packtpub.com/article/expressionengine-creating-a-photo-gallery Be willing to learn the "EE" (now "CodeIgniter") way of doing it. But sure, you could easily build your own system on top of EE. http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/codeigniter-from-scratch-file-uploading-and-image-manipulation/ A bonus is that the EE community is very friendly and active. Plus there are some great developers, such as Leevi Graham: http://leevigraham.com/ http://ee-garage.com/ And some more specific examples: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/file_uploading.html http://jefim.eu/blog/2009/10/image-file-upload-with-codeigniter/ http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/80610/ Some more good information: http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/30-awesome-codeigniter-tutorials-for-all-skill-levels/
