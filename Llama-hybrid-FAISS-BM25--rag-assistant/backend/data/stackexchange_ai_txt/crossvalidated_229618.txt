Typically, when using the EM algorithm you would consider missing observations as hidden variables that would be estimated. Instead of setting missing observations to 0, you would have to estimate them in the M-step. However, for the case of HMM, given the current state, each observation is independent. Because of this, it turns out that we do not need to estimate missing observations, as long as we estimate all the hidden states. The update equations for the M-step turn out to be what you've guessed! This is explained in detail in the below paper: Roberta Paroli and Luigi Spezia, "Parameter estimation of Gaussian hidden Markov models when missing observations occur", Metron-International Journal of Statistics, 2002 ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5182349_Parameter_estimation_of_Gaussian_hidden_Markov_models_when_missing_observations_occur )
