If you are re-using the same colour over and over you could store the brush as a class-level member, however this would mean that the owning class should be IDisposable too, and dispose the brush member in it's dispose method. This would increase the memory storage (by the size of one brush), but might reduce the amount of code (no using statements but an additional Dispose override).
