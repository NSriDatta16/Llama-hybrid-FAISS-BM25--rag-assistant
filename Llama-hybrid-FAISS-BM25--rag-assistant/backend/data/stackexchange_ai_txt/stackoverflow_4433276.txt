A plain # is actually not allowed in the fragment component : fragment = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) Where pchar is equivalent to this expansion: pchar = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG / "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" / ":" / "@" No plain # there. So Safariâ€™s behavior would be the expected behavior. But maybe the other browsers are just displaying the %23 as # for readability.
