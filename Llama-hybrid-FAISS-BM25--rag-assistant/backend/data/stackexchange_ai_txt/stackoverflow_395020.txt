I prefer to pass in any custom data or parameters to the Form by its constructor. It is the least "WinForms"-specific way and in fact is no different to constructing mostly any other object really. In other cases I like to set properties on the Form. This seems to be a WinForms convention as well. It is better than using Tag or "pulling" data from the Owner. As both of these require explicit casting and therefore aren't particularly elegant.
