Stock Prediction Problem With LSTM

Lately I was working on a LSTM code to predict future stock prices. I did not get a good result from that. Also I saw a lot of articles talking about stock market data is a random walk and cant be predicted by machine learning. I also know overfitting is the biggest problem in prediction but a technical analyst uses some stock indicators. I also feed them to my LSTM but still did not get good result. I don't understand how can we predict based on technical analysis but we can't do it with machine learning and NN.
