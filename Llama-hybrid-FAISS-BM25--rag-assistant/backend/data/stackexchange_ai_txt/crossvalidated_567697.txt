Equation RandomForest

I am currently working on machine learning models and in particular on the RandomForest model. For the moment, I managed to get the model on a particular dataset. However, later on, I will have to use several datasets. In order to save time, is it possible to get an equation that will allow me to go directly to this model? I know that a similar question was already asked 7 years ago. However, in the meantime, machine learning has evolved a lot. Do you have a solution to my problem? Thanks in advance for your answer.
