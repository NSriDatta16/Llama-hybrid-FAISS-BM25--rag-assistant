WPF DoDragDrop causes control animation to halt

Here's the scenario (simplified): I have a control (let's say, a Rectangle) on the Window. I hooked the MouseMove event to make it initiate a drag&drop. Then in the MouseDown event I let it animate, moving 50 pixels to the right. However, when I hold my mouse down on the Rectangle, the control moves about one pixel, and then pauses. Only when I move my mouse will the animation continue. Does anyone know why and how to solve this? Thanks a lot!! Here's the source code to reproduce this problem: public partial class Window1 : Window { public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void rectangle1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this, new DataObject(), DragDropEffects.Copy); } } private void rectangle1_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { ThicknessAnimation animation = new ThicknessAnimation(); Thickness t = rectangle1.Margin; t.Left += 50; animation.To = t; animation.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.25)); rectangle1.BeginAnimation(Rectangle.MarginProperty, animation); } } In case you want Window1.xaml:
