I wouldn't do them global, instead create the three objects in your main and pass them to wherever they are needed. It is easier to follow for some other programmer because he sees when/where they are used. It gives you also better control when to create and destroy them than if you declare them global. EDIT: to clarify normally programs get more and more complex as time goes by code being added by various developers with different ideas about design etc. In general (IMHO) once you start introducing globals in a program it encourages other programmers to do the same. That is why I prefer to have data passed to wherever it is used, in a procedural language as an argument or in an OOP language passed in via the ctor. It is then easier to see the dependencies.
