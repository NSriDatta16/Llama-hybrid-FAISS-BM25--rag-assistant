If I understand this correctly, you can use an offset term in your model specification. That is a term used in R, if other systems use different terminology I do not know, but they should have an option. An offset is a term used in a linear predictor with a known coefficient of 1. In a traditional linear model, this concept is unnecessary, since you could just subtract that term from $Y$ , but in logistic regression and other glm's (generalized linear models), estimation is iterative, and the linear predictor does not predict the outcome directly, but through the link function, so this is not possible. So: make a new variable xx by multiplying x with $\hat{\beta}_0$ A is a factor variable, in R A In R you can use glm(Y ~ A + offset(xx), family=binomial, data=your_df)
