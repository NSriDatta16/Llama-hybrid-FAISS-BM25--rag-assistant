Hmmmm, I have done some more work on this and its not actually .Net which is taking its time, its the servicecontroller interface :-O. To work around this issue a wrote a 'Controller' application (using .Net 2), and the holdup is in the call to 'sc.start' - This was called immediately after the first log entry, but I got an exception ~ 30 seconds later 02 Feb 2010 07:15:26:752,CarwashClient is Stopped 02 Feb 2010 07:15:57:556,StartService(): Exception: Cannot start service CarwashClient on computer '.'. 02 Feb 2010 07:15:57:586,StartService(): Exception: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion Now - as the controller app uses .Net, then most of the required libraries would have already been loaded. My service never saw the OnStart event - as it also logs and nothing appeared in the log. My service also has no dependencies defined - it just doesn't get the OnStart event :-O. I have now rewritten my controller to retry 3 times in the event that it gets a timeout exception. Will try again later when I can get back onto the box.... There is obviously some major load delay going on with the servicecontroller library I guess :-O. To answer the other points raised, its only a 300MHz processor in an embedded PC :-). Even so - it shouldn't be this slow. Good point about the defragger though but its so far happened on two out of two boxes :-O. Thanks Graham
