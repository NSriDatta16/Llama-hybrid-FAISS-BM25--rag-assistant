Is the Law of Large Numbers Related to the Occurrence of Rare Events Over Many Trials?

I recently watched an episode of "The Big Bang Theory" where Sheldon makes a comment about the Law of Large Numbers. In the episode, Sheldon realizes he needs eggs, and almost immediately afterwards, Penny knocks on the door and offers to go shopping. Sheldon mentions that "this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence." This got me thinking: Does the Law of Large Numbers imply that if you run something many times, even rare events are bound to happen? From what I understand, the Law of Large Numbers is about the average of sample outcomes approaching the expected value or population mean as the number of trials increases. However, Sheldon's comment suggests that it also deals with the inevitability of rare events occurring given enough trials. Is Sheldon's interpretation of the Law of Large Numbers accurate in a statistical sense? Or is this more akin to the "Gambler's Fallacy" or some other concept?
