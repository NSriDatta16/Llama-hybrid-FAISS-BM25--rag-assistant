Assuming that the strings are not insanely long, a "Trie" approach as Michael suggest would be good. The node in the Trie can store the character and the "count" of the strings that end with that character. This should drastically reduce the storage requirements (again assuming the strings are uniformly distributed and overlapping) Assuming that the counts are not to be persisted across invocations, while using a HashMap, let the Map be from Integer => Integer - where the "key" is the hashcode of the string and value the count. This should be a efficient solution - with fast lookup and reduced memory foot print.
