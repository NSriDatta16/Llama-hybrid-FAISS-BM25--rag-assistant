Event Identification in Series

I've just posted this question on Data Science SE which asks about machine learning methods to identify "events" in series (time-series or otherwise). I'm wondering if I should consider regressions too? The problem: I have series data, one variable is the continuous variable and the other is the measured variable. I want to identify any events that occur in the series. Example: The input data can be shown as a graph The output should be used highlight any events in the series as such My question here is, should I consider statistical methods (such as regressions) to solve this problem, or stick with machine learning? The method should be unsupervised, so I didn't consider regressions, but maybe I should? For some example data, please see the question on Data Science. Lastly, I don't think this post constitutes as cross-posting, as I am exploring a different route to the problem in the other question, but if you think am, please let me know.
