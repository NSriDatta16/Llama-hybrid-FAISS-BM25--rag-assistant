Eclipse uses 100 % CPU randomly

My eclipse sometimes starts using 100 % of my CPU very spontaneously. I can't figure out why it needs that much CPU usage. There is no background task like "building workspace" running. After some time the CPU load drops to 0 and everything is normal. I can't find any information related to the problem in workspace/.metadata/.log file. Has anybody some tip how I can figure out which part of eclipse is using the CPU so heavily? Is there a way to get a thread dump of eclipse? The kill -3 on the eclipse process doesn't do anything. Eclipse Version: Galileo JavaEE Operating System: Linux 2.6.31
