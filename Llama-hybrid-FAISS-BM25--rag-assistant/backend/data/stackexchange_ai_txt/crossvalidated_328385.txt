"Mixed effect" ANOVA in R with JAGS/BUGS

I would like to be able to code the following linear mixed model into a bayesian framework. In the traditional/frequentist view, the model would be coded like this: # Generation of simulated data set.seed(123) varY where varY is a continuous response variable, facX is a categorical predictor with 4 levels and block is a random effect. This is similar to a one-way ANOVA with a fixed effect and a random block effect. I can work out the code for the fixed effect one-way ANOVA: # Data reshaping matY However, I don't know how to integrate the random block effect into this model. My question is: how would I integrate this block effect into the model to get a similar analysis as the frequentist one?
