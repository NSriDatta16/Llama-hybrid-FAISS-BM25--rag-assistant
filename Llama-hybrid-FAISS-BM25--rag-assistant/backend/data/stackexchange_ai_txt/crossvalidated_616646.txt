Overall Average greater than Individual Category averages

I am calculating Gender Pay gap using gross salaries for employees. I'm doing two things to be specific: Calculate Overall Gender pay gap for all the employees. (Taking all male/female employees to calculate average salaries) Calculate Gender Pay gap at each level/grade (Employees divided by Seniority) I had a question about the numbers that I'm getting. Q. The Pay Gap for all individual grades is Negative (Women are paid more) except for one. (A total of 5 grades). But the overall Pay Gap I'm getting is quite Positive. Can anyone help explain what is happening here? Formula I'm using for Pay Gap: (Avg_Male_monthly_gross - Avg_Female_monthly_gross) / Avg_Male_monthly_gross Thank you.
