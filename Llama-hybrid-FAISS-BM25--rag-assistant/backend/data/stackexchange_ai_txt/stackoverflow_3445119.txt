Stuff that makes sense in the context is good, stuff that doesn't make sense is bad. If this site filtered for HTML, then we couldn't give HTML examples. Instead it processes the HTML so that they are output escaped, rather than as HTML. Beware of over-validating. and especially &. Likewise, while Robert '); DROP TABLE Students;-- isn't someone you want signing up at your school, if your preventing that means that O'Brien, O'Tierney, O'Donovan and O'Flanagan can't sign up, by the time O'Donnell is refused he's going to think it's anti-Irish racism and sue you! (More realistically, I do know people here in Ireland who go off to find a competitor when a SQL-injection prevention script blocks or mangles their surname - though more often they've just found yet another site that isn't preventing injection, as either will fail on their name in some way). Validation , as opposed to security-checking is about making sure something plausibly reflects reality. In reality personal names have ' in them and company and town names have & in them all the time, and "validation" that blocks that has turned valid data into invalid. In reality, credit card numbers are 16digits long (some debit cards 19digits) and pass a luhn check, email addresses have a user info part, an @ and a host name with an MX record. People's names are never zero-characters long. That's validation. Only reject (rather than escape) if it genuinely is invalid.
