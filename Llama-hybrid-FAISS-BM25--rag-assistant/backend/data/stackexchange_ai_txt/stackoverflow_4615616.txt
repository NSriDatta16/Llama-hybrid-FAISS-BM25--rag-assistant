How do I activate foreign keys in C, using sqlite?

I need to use foreign keys at my program, but I donÂ´t know how to activate this PRAGMA using C Language. (I wanna use CASCADE modes.) With sqlite binary, I just write PRAGMA foreign_keys = on; and it works. My question is: How I can do this in C?
