If you're simply seeking to erase disks securely, you really don't have to worry that much about the randomness of the data you write. The important thing is to write to everything you possibly can - maybe a couple of times. Anything much more than that is overkill unless your 'opponent' is a large government organization with the resources to spare to indulge in the data recovery (and it is not clear cut that they can read it even so - not these days with the disk densities now used). I've used the GNU 'shred' program - but I'm only casually concerned about it. When I did that, I formatted a disk system onto the disk drive, then filled it with a single file containing quasi-random data, then shredded that. I think it was mostly overkill. Maybe you should read Schneier's ' Cryptography Engineering ' book?
