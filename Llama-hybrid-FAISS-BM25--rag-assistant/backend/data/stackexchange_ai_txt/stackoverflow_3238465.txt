In my opinion no. Java and C# are simpler and safer and therefore faster to write. Of course if a C++ programmer has a certain level of skill, it is possible that there is no difference. But I think that's one of the reasons Java and C# can offer better productivity overall. You don't have to be a especially skilled programmer to be productive. And there are a lot more average programmers around than skilled ones.
