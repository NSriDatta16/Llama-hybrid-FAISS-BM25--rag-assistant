You could put an UIView over your UIWebView , and overide the touchesDidBegin etc, then send them to your webview. Ex: User touches your UIView , which provokes a - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Execute your code then send a touchesBegan to your webview like so: [webView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; return; } your UIView has to be over the webview.
