Need to iterate through SQL table rows, one at a time (table too big to use adapter.Fill)

It's easy enough for me to read through a small SQL Server 2005 table like this: string cmdText = "select * from myTable"; SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(cmdText, connection); DataTable table = new DataTable(); adapter.Fill(table); Unfortunately, this method appears to load the entire table into memory, which simply isn't going to work with the gigantic tables I'm working with. I would like to be able to iterate through the table one row at a time, such that only one row needs to be in memory at once. Something along the lines of: foreach (DataRow row in rowIteratorObject) { // do something using the row // current row goes out of scope and is no longer in memory } Kind of similar to the way you can use StreamReader to deal with a text file one line at a time, instead of reading it all in at once. Does anyone know of a way to do this with table rows (or, if I'm barking up the wrong tree, an alternative solution)?
