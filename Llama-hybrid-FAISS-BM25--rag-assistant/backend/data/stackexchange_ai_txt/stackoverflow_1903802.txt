What is my error with my Feed in Wordpress

My feed url is ( http://www.robertstikmanz.com/feed/rss/ ) yet it's showing a very weird layout. What exactly am i doing wrong, or what do I need to set in my server/installation to make this work correctly? Fixed: It looks like this ( http://screencast.com/t/Yjc2YmRmNW ) in Chrome on Mac yet not on every other Browser. This is why I was confused :)
