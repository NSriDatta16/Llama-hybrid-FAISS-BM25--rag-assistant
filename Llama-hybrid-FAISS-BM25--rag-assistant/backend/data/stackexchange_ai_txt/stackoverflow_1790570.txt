If I have a table with a field which is declared as accepting varchar(100) and then I actually insert the word "hello" how much real storage will be used on the mysql server? Mysql will store 5 bytes plus one byte for the length. If the varchar is greater than 255, then it will store 2 bytes for the length. Note that this is dependent on the charset of the column. If the charset is utf8, mysql will require up to 3 bytes per character. Some storage engines (i.e. memory) will always require the maximum byte length per character for the character set. Also will an insert of NULL result in no storage being used even though varchar(100) is declared? Making a column nullable means that mysql will have to set aside an extra byte per up to 8 nullable columns per row. This is called the "null mask". What ever the answer is, is it consistent accross different database implementations? It's not even consistent between storage engines within mysql!
