LINQ to SQL, Stored Procedures and the Methods Pane (more like Methods PAIN!)

I'm new to LINQ and am having a small issue. I created a DBML file and dragged all of my tables to the design surface. Now, when I try to drag a stored procedure to the methods pane, Visual Studio thinks a second and then doesn't do anything. My method does not show up in the methods pane. Is some error occurring behind the scenes? If so, how can I troubleshoot it?
