you can query products from specific category like this: Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection()->addFieldToFilter('category_id', '319'); and add filters by date (date is a pseudo field name here find the exact field name from product information) if needed like this: ->addFieldToFilter('date',array('from'=>'10-10-2010','to'=>'11-10-2010')) and to improve your understandings how collections are handled I suggest you to read: Great read about collections in Magento is written by Alan Storm
