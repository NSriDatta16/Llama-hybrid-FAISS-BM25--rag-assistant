You can use Java Machine Learning Library. They have a K-Means implementation. One of the constructors accepts three arguments K Value. An object of that is an instance of the DistanceMeasure Class. Number of iterations. One can easily extend the DistanceMeasure class to achieve the desired result. The idea is to return values from a custom distance matrix in the measure(Instance x, Instance y) method of this class. K-Means is guarnateed to converge assuming certain properties of the distance metric. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance or other standard metrics satisfy these assumptions. Since a custom distance metric may not satisfy these assumptions, the constructor has a third parameter specifying the number of iterations to run for building the clusterer.
