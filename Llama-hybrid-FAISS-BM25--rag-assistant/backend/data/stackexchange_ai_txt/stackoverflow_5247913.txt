You can select all the columns by dragging the mouse over the relevant column names (ctrl-A and the top left grey square will not work) and then choose Format->Column Width->Best Fit or enter a value. This is not quite satisfactory, because it will only be "best fit" for currently displayed rows, in other words, if there is a very wide cell further down the page, it still will not display fully, however, it should suit quite well for column (field) names.
