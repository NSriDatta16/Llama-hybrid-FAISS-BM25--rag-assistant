If your outvects don't all point in the correct directino, you might have to check your triangles' winding - are they all oriented the same way? Additionally, it might be helpful to draw a line for each outvec (Use the average of the three vertices of your triangle as origin, and draw a line of a few units' length (depending on your scene's scale) into the direction of the outvect. This way, you can be sure that all your vectors are oriented correctly. How do you calculate your outvects?
