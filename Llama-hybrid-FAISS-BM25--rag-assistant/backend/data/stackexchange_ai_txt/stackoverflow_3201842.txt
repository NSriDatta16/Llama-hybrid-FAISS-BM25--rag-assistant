Wrong reading order in Narrator

I've got a problem with Microsoft Narrator. I've got a WPF fragment like this: I want to pay 0 % more The text is displayed correctly; however the Narrator reads it this way: "I want to pay percent more, zero" instead of the expected "I want to pay 0 percent more". Am I doing something wrong? The Narrator could have read the whole text just consequently. Is there a way to work around the problem without the need to change the actual text?
