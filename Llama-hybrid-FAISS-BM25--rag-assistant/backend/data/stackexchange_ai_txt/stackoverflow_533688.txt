How to unit test my application manually on multiple browsers?

My project requires support on multiple browsers, like Firefox 2.0, firefox 3.0, IE 6, IE 7, etc. My problem is I cannot test the application on lower versions of the browsers. I have to move to other system or other machines for the testing. Is there any way to solve this? I cannot even use Virtual Box, since my company won't encourage other softwares to be installed. Thanks in advance.
