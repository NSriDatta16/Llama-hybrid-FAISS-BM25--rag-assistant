Neuralnet in R not giving me what I want to see

I am currently working on some research and we are trying to do some Time-Series prediction using neural networks. To get started, I was using the paper published by G. Peter Zhang ( Time Series forcasting using a hybrid ARIMA and NN model ) since I am no expert in either R or statistics, I could really do with some help. I got R and the neuralnet lib setup and then took the Lynx dataset, then created a data-frame with the data long with the lags to set as input. My data now looks something like this (this is only for t, t-1, and t-2 lags) x x1 x2 1 269 NA NA 2 321 269 NA 3 585 321 269 Now I want to train a NN with input x1 and x2 and get output at x. I do the training with the following code nn This does train the model, but the error is really high, and when I use it to do any computation the results of the second layer neuron is alway 1. I was discussing with some freinds and they said that its because I am maybe using the wrong activation function. I looked in the help for the act.fct and tried with both logistic and tanh but the results remain the same. I have been stuck on this for a few days now, so could really use some help. May I am doing something wrong? Or missing something? Thanks
