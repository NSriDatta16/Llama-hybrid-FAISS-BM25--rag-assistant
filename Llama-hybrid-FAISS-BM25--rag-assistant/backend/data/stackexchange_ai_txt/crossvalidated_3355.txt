The only similarity in the two models is the general type of models they belong to, otherwise they are not similar in general as pointed out by M. Tibbits. Both these models belong the class of hierarchical models with varying slope (cf Gelman and Hill 2006 for detailed treatment) The answer for "why not" are many and one of them is pointed out by M. Tibbits. A few more are: In the model 2 the slope on an average is 6/3, where as it is 0 for model 1.(This description can be made much better if we had data but it is "almost" accurate given the limited description) You would expect the data in model 1 to be distributed randomly along a approximately horizontal line where as in model 2 you would expect data to be randomly distributed along a line of slope approx. beta_0 and zero intercept. These answers can be best varified if you similated the data based on your hierarchical setting and look at the results of the analysis. Thanks, S.
