Tractability is related to closed-formness of an expression . Problems are said to be tractable if they can be solved in terms of a closed-form expression. In mathematics, a closed-form expression is a mathematical expression that can be evaluated in a finite number of operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain "well-known" operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit. The set of operations and functions admitted in a closed-form expression may vary with author and context. So intractability means that there is some kind of limit/infinity involved (like infinite summation in integrals) which can not be evaluated in a finite number of operations and thus approximation techniques (like MCMC) must be used. The Wikipedia article points to Cobham's thesis which tries to formalize this "amount of operations", and thus tractability.
