It sounds like you are interested in the pairwise differences of randomly observed values in a particular sequence, as in the case of modeling growth or trend. There are a number of ways to do so in time series analyses. A very basic approach is just a simple linear model regressing the sequence values upon their index values. In the first case, your linear model would give you a singular regression coefficient of 1 (predictive $R^2 = 1$). In the later case, this would be a coefficient of 1.51 and an $R^2$ of 0.78.
