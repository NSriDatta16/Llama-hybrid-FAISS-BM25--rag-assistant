Create a new report On the New Report window (assuming Design View is selected in the pick-list), select the relevant table table. Click OK Open the Field List window Drag-n-drop the relevant field onto the report. You can also do the same thing with Queries. If the report already exists, you can change the report's record source to the table (or a query) in the properties window, and then drag-n-drop fields on the report the same way.
