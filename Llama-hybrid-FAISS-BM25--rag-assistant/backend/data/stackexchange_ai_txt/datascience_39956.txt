Deep Learning ROC and Average Precision Curve Results

I used Vgg16 to create a deep learning model and the dataset is imbalanced so, I used class_weight argument in fit_generator method. The model result as the following: accuracy= 98.9% and loss= 0.1731 And I got the following ROC and Average Precision curves: Why I got these results? Is there any problem in ROC and average precision?
