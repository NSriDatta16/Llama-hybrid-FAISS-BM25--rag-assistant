Normalize estimated probabilities from two logistic regression models

I have built two logistic regression models predicting the probability of purchase of two products. (Product A and Product B) For every customers, I want to choose the product that has the higher probability of purchase. The overall purchase rate for these two products across all customers are different ( product A is a popular product and bought by more customers than Product B). The predicted probabilities are higher for Product A compared to Product B What is the best way to normalize the predicted probabilities so that I can compare and select the best.
