A good book on general machine learning is 1 . But it is quite light on BN. I haven't read [2] but I have read [3] by him which is good (so, [2] is likely to be good as recommended by dwf). I would not recommend Pearl's book at all unless you are doing your Ph.D.! However, I actually would recommend the online tutorial " A Brief Introduction to Graphical Models and Bayesian Networks " by Kevin Murphy [4]. The best way to learn BN is to read this, download his Matlab toolbox [5] and build your own BN in ten minutes.
