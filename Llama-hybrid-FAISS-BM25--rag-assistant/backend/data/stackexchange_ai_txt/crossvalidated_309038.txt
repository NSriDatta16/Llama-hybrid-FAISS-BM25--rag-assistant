The term comes from electronics engineering. Just think who would call 1 "hot"? Only those who work with electricity, where "hot" or "live" means there's electrical potential on the wire . "One hot" refers to the circuit design where discrete electrical signal level on one wire would be decoded into hot/cold on a set of wires. I suppose some machine learning folks with EE background found the analogy compelling. In econometrics and statistics you may encounter dummy or indicator variables, which are quite similar because these are used to represent distinct categories with their distinct indicators. There's a subtle difference though. For instance, you make K-1 dummies for K categories, because the base category corresponds to all dummies set to 0. In contrast, I think that in one hot encoding you have K wires, where the base category will have its own wire (variable).
