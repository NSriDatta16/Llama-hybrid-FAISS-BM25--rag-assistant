How to solve this AB test question?

Assume you were tasked with improving the listing conversion rate on xx.com. You build an A/B test with 2 variants. Control: Listings page has a button that reads “Reserve a Room” Test: Listings page has a button that reads “Book Now” You find the average conversion rate for your control variant as 20% and the average conversion of the test variant as 22% with a confidence interval as (19.2,24.5). This is with a statical significance of level 95% and power of 80%. Would you consider the test successful and go with the test variant? If not, why?
