I think that the idea of Google Wave is that operational transformation is done and resolved on the server. So your gadget can only post delta's and get notified on updates, but could by definition not participate in conflict resolution and the like. Interesting sideline could be how you could influence the way conflict resolution works be choosing a different form of storage from your gadget (dictionary with keys, arrays, strings). Some will behave differently in conflict situations, I'd expect.
