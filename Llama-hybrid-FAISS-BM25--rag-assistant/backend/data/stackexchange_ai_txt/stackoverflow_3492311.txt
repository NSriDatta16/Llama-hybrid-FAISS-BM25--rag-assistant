I have some similar issues. Most of them could be resolved by calling UpdateLayout on the datagrid. I too have a datagrid in a dockpanel. When I scroll down and select the bottom record and then reload my datagrid the horizontal scrollbar seems to cover the last record. And the vertical scrollbar appears to be as far down as possible and cannot be dragged down further. If i use the scrollwheel on the mouse the last record can be brought into view. This only occurs when i show my application in a maximized window. Have you gotten anywhere with this?
