Multiple execs in a row is just fine. We've run nightly jobs that way for many years. Instead of the Windows Task Scheduler, consider scheduling our jobs in SQL Agent. SQL Agent is a part of SQL Server, and it's where most DBA's would expect to find SQL jobs. SQL Agent comes with the ability to send error mails when something goes wrong, and has a built-in error logging system. But a scheduled batch file will work fine too.
