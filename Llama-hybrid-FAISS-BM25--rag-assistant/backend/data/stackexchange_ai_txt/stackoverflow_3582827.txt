Don't do this in mySQL. Do it on the presentation end, where you output the data. You can then also take into account possible internationalization settings made by the user (english users getting 1,000 , european users getting 1.000 etc...) Re your comment : There seems to be no native mySQL function to do this. FORMAT() can't change the decimal and thousands separators. A replace like this should work: SELECT REPLACE(CAST(numericfield AS CHAR), ".", ",") AS numericfield_formatted if anybody has a more elegant solution ... fire away.
