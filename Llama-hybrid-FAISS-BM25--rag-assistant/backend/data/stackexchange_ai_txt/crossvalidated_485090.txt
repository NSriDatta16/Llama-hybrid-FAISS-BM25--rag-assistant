Simulate multinomial logistic regression data DV with 4 levels

I referred to Simulating Multinomial Logit Data with R post and have a working code that generates a categorical DV variable with 3 levels, but I wish to have 4 levels and also specify the proportion of each level, how should I modify the code? set.seed(888) # covariate matrix mX
