You are looking to test for a "difference between differences," as James Jaccard would say. "Does the gender difference come out differently depending on whether the field is IT or Engineering?" (I would't pursue the question by looking at ratios per se.) Such questions are typically addressed by testing for statistical interactions in a regression or anova model. In this case you have a binary outcome--enrolled or didn't enroll--so logistic regression would be the natural choice. With that said, it's hard to imagine too many people caring whether the gender-by-field interaction is statistically significant when it looks so insignificant in practical terms.
