If everything is compliant with the specs, you shouldn't need to do anything special. HTTP already has mechanisms to handle this. The browser should send an If-Modified-Since header with the retrieval date or If-None-Match header with the ETag of the cached copy. The server will check the modification time (or the ETag, which should include the modification time in the calculation) of the file on the server and, if the mod time is less than that given by the browser, or the ETag matches, return a 304 Not Modified response. The browser should use its cached copy only when it receives a 304 response. The one wrinkle in this is caching proxies that either ignore any server-provided Expires header or assume it to be well in the future when not given, in which case you can send a Cache-Control header with the "must-revalidate" directive. Of course, browsers or proxies may not be compliant, in which case the other answers show you how to force a browser to re-fetch a resource.
