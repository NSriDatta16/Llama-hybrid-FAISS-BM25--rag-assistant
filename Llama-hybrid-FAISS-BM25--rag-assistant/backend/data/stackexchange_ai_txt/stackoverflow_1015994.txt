Because I've had to fight with Linq2Sql and Serialization before I'd recommend using a View object to handle this scenario rather than a Linq2Sql Entity. Its a much easier solution: return db.Employees .Select( e => new EmployeeView() { EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID, FirstName = e.FirstName, LastName = e.LastName }).ToList(); The other alternative is to drag a new copy of your Employee table into the DBML designer, name it something different like SimpleEmployee, delete all the relationships and remove all the columns you don't need.
