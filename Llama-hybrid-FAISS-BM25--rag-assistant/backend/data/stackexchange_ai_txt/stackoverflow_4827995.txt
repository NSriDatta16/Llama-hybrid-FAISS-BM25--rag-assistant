Different users in SQL Server can help in performance

We have one table having continuous inserts from 3 windows services in SQL Server 2008 with same SQL user. This makes table heavily loaded and retrieval operation and IO becomes slow. We have decided to split this table in to two i.e. one for latest data and another for history data. I have one question here is, whether I gain performance benefit if I create one separate user for each windows service, so total 3 user in our case, for insert operation. I think there will be 3 session here i.e. separate session for each user and that might improve performance. Am I right?
