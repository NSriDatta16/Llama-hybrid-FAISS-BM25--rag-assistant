This is a good question. The answer is that in the usual conceptual approach, the regression coefficients are not assumed to be random variables, but fixed . So you can think of an underlying process on the population level with constant parameters, and it is only your estimates of $\beta$ based on finite samples that have distributions due to, for example, sampling variability. Note that the underlying process $f(Y|X=x)$ described by the linear model is nevertheless not deterministic. This is due to the error term. On the population level, you can think of the process for example as a machine that takes an input and has a fixed protocol to produce an output, but still produces outputs with some variability. This is not because the inputs or the protocol are stochastic, but a single realization of the protocol is stochastic. So, for $n \rightarrow \infty$ , you will have $\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}) \rightarrow 0$ , $\text{Var}(\hat{Y}|X=x) \rightarrow 0$ ( $\hat{Y}$ being the predicted conditional mean) and also $\text{Var}(\hat{\sigma}^2) \rightarrow 0$ , but the width of your prediction intervals will still always be $>0$ (assuming $\sigma^2>0$ ). Edit: My answer is more from a frequentist perspective dealing with sampling distributions. In a Bayesian approach, you indeed obtain probability distributions ober $\beta$ . It is crucial to interpret this as your subjective belief about the location of $\beta$ , however, not the true distribution of $\beta$ itself. Of course, having more data will make your beliefs converge stronger to a certain value.
