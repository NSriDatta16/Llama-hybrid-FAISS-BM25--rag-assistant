Okay, so, after discovering that embedding an NSDatePickerCell in the NSTableColumn in a nib is not allowed, I went on to see if it was possible to do this programmatically. Sample project is at: http://www.markdouma.com/developer/TableViewDatePicker.zip As the test app shows, it is possible to do this programmatically: You'd use code like the following: NSDatePickerCell *cell = [[[NSDatePickerCell alloc] init] autorelease]; [dateOfHireColumn setDataCell:cell]; However, as you can see, the initial result isn't really what one would like. The date picker cell doesn't reverse the text color it draws with when it's selected, and also, it doesn't really allow you to change the date via its controls. While I haven't looked into trying to do this extensively (in other words, perhaps with a bit of tweaking and/or subclassing you could get it to work better), the lower table view shows an example of how it could be implemented. Basically, you simply use a regular text field in the table column, along with an NSDateFormatter to have the date show properly. When you select the date, you can use the NSDatePicker below the table to edit the value.
