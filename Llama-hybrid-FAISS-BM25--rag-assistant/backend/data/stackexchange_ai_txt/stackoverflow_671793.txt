To be a properly normalised table, each row should only have a single identifiable key. Many tables will already have natural keys, such a unique invoice number. I agree, especially with storage being so cheap, there is little overhead in having an autonumber/identity key on all tables, but in this instance which is the real key. Another area where I personally don't use this approach if for reference data, where typically we have a Description and a Value Code, Description 'L', 'Live' 'O', 'Old' 'P', 'Pending' In this situation making code a primary key ensures no duplicates, and is more human readable.
