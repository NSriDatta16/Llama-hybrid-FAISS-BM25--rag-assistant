Please help me understand white noise and MA(q)

I am reading the section about moving average models in Hyndman & Athanasopoulos Forecasting: principles and practice . I am trying to understand the MA(q) model in words. What is white noise? Is this a differenced series which is normally distributed with mean zero? Is it the difference between an observation and the mean of all observations? I do not know what the book is talking about when it says "white noise". I can understand what a differenced series is. I can understand what sum of square error means. But what is this "white noise" and where did it come from? What is an error term? What does it mean? Who made this up? Can I see an actual example that I can work out in Excel? When forecasting with an MA(q) model, do you add the moving average series to the mean to get a forecast? How does it actually work? An Excel document or an example involving actual numbers would really help. I am having a lot of difficulty understanding what is actually going on in the formula (reproduced below). Some examples with actual numbers would be great. $$ y_t=c+e_t+θ_1e_{t−1}+θ_2e_{t−2}+⋯+θ_qe_{t−q} $$
