There are quite a few packages in R implementing a wavelet transform. For example you could try the wavelets packages or you could see the cran time series task list for more possibilities. However there are simpler options if you are just look for periodic patterns. For example you could use the spectrum function (which uses a Fourier transform) that comes with R or you could look at autocorrelations or partial autocorrelations at various lags using acf and pcf respectively.
