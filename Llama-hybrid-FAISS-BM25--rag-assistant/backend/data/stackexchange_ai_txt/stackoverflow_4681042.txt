For a single item, infragistics was kind enough to add a bindable DependencyProperty called 'ActiveDataItem', which is "the" selected item, if any. It even works two-way, i.e. you can reset the selection from within your ViewModel. Unfortunately, AFAIK there is no similar thing for multi-selection. You will have to implement this on your own, iterating over the selected records, check if they are datarecords, get the record and dataitem etc...
