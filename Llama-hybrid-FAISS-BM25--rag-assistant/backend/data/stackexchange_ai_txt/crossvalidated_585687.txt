Multivariate Logistic Regression with time series as predictors

I need some advice here. My dependent variable is binary (snows or not) and my independent variables are temperature, pressure, and some wind index. I have daily data for 30 years. The data are correlated (since they are daily) so I am afraid to use logistic regression. Any idea of a model that I could use?
