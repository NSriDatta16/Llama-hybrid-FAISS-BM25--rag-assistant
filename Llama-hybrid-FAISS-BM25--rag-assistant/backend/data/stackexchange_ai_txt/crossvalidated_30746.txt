Let $Y_i$ be $1$ if patient $i$ is positive and $0$ otherwise and let $X_{i1}, ..., X_{ip}$ be the $p$ predictor variables for patient $i$. A standard tool for determining whether variables are related to an individual's probability that $Y_i = 1$ is the logistic regression model: $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y_i = 1 | X_i) }{P(Y_i = 0| X_i)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + ... + \beta_p X_{ip} $$ That is, we fit a regression model to the log-odds that $Y_i = 1$, conditional on the predictors. The coefficients indicate whether or not increases in the predictor increase or decrease the probability that $Y_i = 1$ and, in particular, the exponentiated coefficients can be interpreted as odds ratios . You can then frame your research questions as tests of hypotheses about the regression coefficients. The predictors here can be continuous or categorical, although if they are categorical with more than two categories, you will need to set up dummy variables to look at the effect of the different levels. You can account for the repeated measurements by doing one of two things, which each have slightly different interpretations: using including random effects that model the correlations between repeated measurements on individuals - in this case the regression coefficients are interpreted as the change in an individual's log-odds that $Y_i = 1$ for a one unit change in the predictor. I'd recommend this approach if the correlations at the individual level are of interest to you. This model can be fit using the lme4 package in R . using GEE which provides robust standard errors for your regression coefficients. This provides unbiased inference despite the fact that there is correlation in the data. The coefficients here are interpreted as the change in the population average log-odds that $Y_i$ for a one unit change in the predictor. I'd recommend this approach if the correlations at the individual level are a nuisance (i.e. not of interest) and you're looking to make inference about the population. This model can be fit using the gee package in R . For more discussion on the difference between random effects models and GEE, see this answer Edit in response to OP's edit: Good question! This is a subtle issue when you're first learning about it. Based on your comment "we would want to be able to say when testing new patients in the future that given they are positive for test X, they are Z times more likely to become positive for outcome Y" it seems that you want to be able to make statements about the change in an individual's odds of a positive test, rather than the population average effect. Therefore, it appears you are more interested in effects at the individual level, not the average effect in the population, so I'd recommend fitting the random effects model. Regarding your second question, it still could be appropriate to use the logistic model but, from what you've said, centre is an important categorical predictor that should potentially interact with your predictor(s).
