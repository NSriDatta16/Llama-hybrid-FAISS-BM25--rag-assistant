typedef s are not like macros. They are not just text substitution. A Typedef creates a new typename. Now when you say unsigned int , the unsigned isn't a modifier which is tacked onto the int . unsigned int is the complete typename; it just happens to have a space in it. So, when you say typedef int INT; then INT is the complete typename. It can't be modified. static (like const ) is a storage class specifier. It's not actually part of the type name.
