features' range in logistic regression

I use logistic regression. We know that it is a supervised method and needs calculated feature values both in training and test data. There are six features. Although the functions produce these features’ values are different and their maximum value can be 1, there are four features (both in training and test data) that have very low values. e.g. they range between 0 and 0.1 and are never 1, even more than 0.1!!!. Thus these features’ values are very close to each other. Other features are distributed normally (they range between 0 and 0.9). So the difference between these two kinds of features is high, I think this causes trouble in learning process for logistic regression. Am I right?! Does it need any transforming/normalizing these features? Any help would be highly appreciated.
