Clearcase hudson issue

I have configured ClearCase plugin in Hudson . I created a project , by giving new hudson_view_name as view name for the Hudson project and provided config spec. I identified in my view storage directory it is creating multiple folders related to the view. like , hudson_view_name.vws hudson_view_name.1.vws hudson_view_name.2.vws , but when I see my " cleartool lsview " command only hudson_view_name.vws is visible not the hudson_view_name.x.vws . When I do the following command: cleartool rmview -force -tag hudson_view_name hudson_view_name.2.vws is being removed but hudson_view_name.vws and hudson_view_name.1.vws remains , How can I remove those two as well. Another question is why Hudson created many view storage locations like viewname.x.vws ?
