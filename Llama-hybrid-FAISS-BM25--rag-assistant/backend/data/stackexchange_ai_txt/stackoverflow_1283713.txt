You can get some examples that don't require server side scripting from ie6nomore.com . They use the conditional comments feature of IE, like this: Your browser is outdated! But the examples on the site actually offer links to other browsers. Of course, you can roll your own version that suits your layout better. Of course, you can do this server side if you prefer, since you're using PHP anyway. The other examples here using $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] should get you started. Using get_browser may be overkill, as it requires a fairly large data file to function. If you're only interested in detecting old IE versions server side, this should do: preg_match('/; MSIE (\d+.\d+)/', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], $matches); if (count($matches) > 1 && $matches[1]
