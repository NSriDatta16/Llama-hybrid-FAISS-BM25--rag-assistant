Statistical test for comparing usability of two different systems

I conducted a usability test of two password systems ps1 and ps2. Same users participated in the usability of both system. Analysis of average login attempts and average login time clearly indicates that ps1 is more usable than ps2. However, I would like to know which statistical tests are more relevant for comparing the usability of ps1 vs ps2. Or are mean login attempts and login time sufficient indicators? Also I read about t-test which is used to compare two different samples. However in my study I have used the same sample (users) to determine the usability of ps1 and ps2.
