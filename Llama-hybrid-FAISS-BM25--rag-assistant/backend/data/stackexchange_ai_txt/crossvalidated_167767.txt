I think you can refer to residuals.merMod() . The default one for glmer() , deviance, makes more sense. More examples are shown in this related question: What do the residuals in a logistic regression mean? The default residual type varies between lmerMod and glmerMod objects: they try to mimic residuals.lm and residuals.glm respectively. In particular, the default type is "response", i.e. (observed-fitted) for lmerMod objects vs. " deviance " for glmerMod objects. type="partial" is not yet implemented for either type.
