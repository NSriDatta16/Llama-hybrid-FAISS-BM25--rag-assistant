Others have answered 1-6 adequately. (7) Apple recommends you use the instance variable directly in both your init and dealloc. Primarily this is because the object (especially if it is subclassed) is only partially set up during both of these methods, and so calling setters/getters may result in incorrect behavior if they have anything other than trivial actions. Generally you can safely access the ivar directly (rather than via the getter) in your object, and it will be marginally more effecient to do so (only relevent on the iPhone). Generally you should use the setter in all cases, especially if your object may be subclassed or if others may be observing the property. (8) You never, ever, call dealloc (except [super dealloc] from within the dealloc method). If you have an ownership on another object, then you should relinquish that ownership (by calling release or autorelease). The system will then call dealloc on the object if appropriate. But you never call dealloc yourself. Read the memory management rules (its only 9 paragraphs and is vital to understand).
