Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA?

Principal component analysis (PCA) is usually explained via an eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix. However, it can also be performed via singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix $\mathbf X$. How does it work? What is the connection between these two approaches? What is the relationship between SVD and PCA? Or in other words, how to use SVD of the data matrix to perform dimensionality reduction?
