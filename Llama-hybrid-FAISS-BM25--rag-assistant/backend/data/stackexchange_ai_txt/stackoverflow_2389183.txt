Flash: Closest point to MovieClip

I need to constrain a point inside a DisplayObject given to me by the artist. I got it working but only for the occations where the cursor is still inside bounds . The limited object is called limited . function onSqMouseMove(event:MouseEvent) { if(bounds.hitTestPoint(event.stageX, event.stageY, true)) { limited.x = event.stageX; limited.y = event.stageY; } else { /* Find closest point in the Sprite */ } } limited.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, function(event:MouseEvent) { stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, onSqMouseMove); }); limited.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, function(event:MouseEvent) { stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, onSqMouseMove); }); How do I go about implementing the other half of the function? I am aware Sprite's startDrag accepts arguments, where the second one is the constraint rectangle, but in my case, bounds are an arbitrary shape. When the object is dragged outside the bounds, I want to calculate the closest point from the cursor to bounds ' polygon. Just to note that bounds can have 'holes'. Edit: To be clear, I don't want to find if a point is inside the MovieClip or not, I want the closest point from a point outside the MovieClip ( note that hitTestPoint fails ! ) to the bounds of it.
