How many rounds to visit every place on a Monopoly style game board

I see some kids playing on a circular gameboard trying to visit every field and I wonder how long it will take before they finish. I can simulate it like below, but is there possibly an elegant solution that can compute or approximate this? Rolling with a single 6 sided dice and moving on a Monopoly style board (36 fields) it takes on average about 12.55 rounds around the board with a variance of 13.8 The distribution seems to be approximately a Gumbel distribution (as this relates to the Coupon collectors problem which is also approximately Gumbel distributed ). But there are some irregularities in the histogram which might have to deal with the moving around the board. We could use a model scheme like here but with an additional irregularity. simulate = function(n = 4*9, d = 6) { fields = rep(0,n) position = 0 counts = 0 while(counts
