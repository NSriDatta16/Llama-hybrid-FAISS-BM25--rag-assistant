What method can be used to find key phrases in sentiment analysis?

I've just completed a fastai NLP processing sentiment analysis, that is, a binary classification problem using text data. It turned out very well, but I'm wondering if there is a way to find the key phrases that are associated with a positive outcome. I don't think that it's possible in fastai, so I'm wondering if there is another package that is capable of doing this, either in R or Python. Note I'm not looking for a single word "word cloud", rather, small phrases.
