var img=new Image(); This is the old way of creating images, which has been deprecated. Prefer document.createElement('IMG') or create one through strings and innerHTML. Now, images are replaced elements , which means they load whenever they arrive, but space is reserved for them in the layout flow if their dimensions are specified. (If not, an icon-sized space is reserved and the screen is redrawn when the image arrives with its dimensions in the header; this can be a disconcerting user experience, so you are encouraged to have image dimensions ready while the page is being rendered the first time.)
