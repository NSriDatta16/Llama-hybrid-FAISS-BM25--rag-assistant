writing an api for python that can be installed using setup.py method

I am new at writing APIs in python, in any language for that matter. I was hoping to get pointers on how i can create an API that can be installed using setup.py method and used in other python projects. Something similar to the twitterapi. I have already created and coded all the methods i want to include in the API. I just need to know how to implement the installation so other can use my code to leverage ideas they may have. Or if i need to format the code a certain way to facilitate installation. I learn best with examples or tutorials. Thanks so much.
