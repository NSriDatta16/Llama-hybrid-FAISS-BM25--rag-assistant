How does resizing work for edit-in-place JQuery UI textarea editable?

I have problems getting a JQuery Edit-In-Place textarea to be a fixed size. Basically I have one HTML file, part of which has a paragraph named editable-large : About Me Ansel Easton Adams (February 20, 1902 â€“ April 22, 1984) was an American photographer and environmentalist, best known for his black-and-white photographs of the American West, especially in Yosemite National Park. And I have a JQuery JS file associated with that paragraph that allows it to be edited in place. So whenever someone clicks on the paragraph, it turns into a textarea. $(".editable-large").editable( { submit: "Save", cancel: "Cancel", type: "textarea", options: {"cols": 80, "rows": 10}, }).css({"cols": 80,"rows": 10}); I want the textarea to have a certain width and height (80 & 10), but no matter what values I put in, it's always the same size and looks like this . I'd greatly appreciate any help in making that textarea a fixed size.
