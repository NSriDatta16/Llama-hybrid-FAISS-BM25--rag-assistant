How well does Valgrind handle threads and machine-level synchronization instructions?

I have a highly parallel Windows program that uses lots of threads, hand-coded machine synchronization instructions, and home-rolled parallel-safe storage allocators. Alas, the storage management has a hole (not a synchonization hole in the allocators, I'm pretty sure) and I'd like to find it. Valgrind has been suggested as a good tool for finding storage management errors. Any experience here with Valgrind used under these circumstances?
