In your distributionManagement section, try using "scpexe://" in your url instead of "scp://". This calls the standard scp program (assuming it is on your path), instead of using the Java implementation of scp that is built into Maven. Standard scp uses ssh-agent (which, in Ubuntu, starts automatically when you log in through GDM) for public-key auth.
