In Flex 4 with PHP, we can use MySQL operations easily with simple drag and drop, on the badend flex auto generates the code for php and we can modify it. Question is, my requirement is to connect SQL server 2000 with Flex 4 in PHP, i have tried to modify the class made by flex, i changed mysql_connect to mssql_connect, same case with all functions, but the problem occured, the returning speed is very slow, and i dont get data correctly, page takes a lot of time to load and when it is loaded, data is in scattered form. Please let me know, is there anyway to connect flex php and sql server 2000. Regards Atif
