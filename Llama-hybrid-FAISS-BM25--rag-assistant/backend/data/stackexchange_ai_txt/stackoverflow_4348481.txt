You are setting yourself up to be in a continual state of pain. You simply can not design against exact resolutions; there is too much variation in devices for that, and by doing so you are going to be slapped in the face continually as you encounter new devices. Android has a lot of facilities for dealing with this screen variety, such as 9-patches, its density management, layout managers, etc. If you take advantage of those, you will be happy; if you don't, you will be swearing all the time. But if you want to swear, I can't stop you. Just please don't take to the net complaining about Android fragmentation. :) As far as your image being scaled due to the status bar -- yes the status bar takes a chunk out of the screen. How much is not defined, so it could well vary slightly between devices. The window background, as set by Activity.getWindow().setBackgroundDrawable(), will extend behind the status bar (and IME or other variable system decoration), so at least using that will reduce the variation. That said, the actual display space could be carved out for other reasons from the physical screen size; it intentionally isn't defined exactly what part of the screen an app gets to play in.
