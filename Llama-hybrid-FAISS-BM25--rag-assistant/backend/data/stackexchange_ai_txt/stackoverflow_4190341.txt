Get modified column ordering for Extjs GridPanel

As part of gridpanel functionality after rendering the gridpanel I can modify the columns ordering by click drag. For example present column ordering is First Name | Last Name. But I can click drag first name and put it after Last Name i.e now it will be like Last Name | First Name. Now my requirement is something like I want to save the modified order of the column. i.e i want to save the format change which I have made. So does Extjs functionality provide me with modified ordering of the column. By tejas, visit mobedio ,The only public opinion platform for political domain.
