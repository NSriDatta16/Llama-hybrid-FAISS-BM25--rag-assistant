WPF ControlTemplate with foreach?

I currently try to create classes for a paint-like WPF application. I have to base classes LineMovement (line from StartPoint to EndPoint) and PathMovement (line going through all points specified in a property Points of type PointCollection). These classes inherit from Control and get their looks through a ControlTemplate. Now I want to add (what I call) PointMovers to the ControlTemplate. These should be little visual elements residing on each of the points in either of the Movement classes. They should become a kind of grip mechanism to drag the underlying point around. The problem is of course that I don't know a way to create a variable number of elements in a ControlTemplate. It would be cool if I could do something like this: Is this possible? Do you have another approach in mind that could work? Thanks in advance!
