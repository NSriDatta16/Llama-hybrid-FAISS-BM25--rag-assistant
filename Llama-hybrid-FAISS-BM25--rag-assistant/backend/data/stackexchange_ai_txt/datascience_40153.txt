I need to force my random forest model to learn one crucial relationship between features. How can I achieve that?

Say, given 10 independent features as input to my RF model, when feature 1 and feature 3 are 100 (or less), my model output must be 5 despite the values of the other features. How can I teach that relationship to my RF model - so it will always obey that? I have tried adding repeated artificial data points to the training set where features 1 and 3 are less or equal to 100 and the output is always zero, but the RF model does not seem to understand/learn that relation just based on that. I also tried to play with (1) number of trees (2) number of nodes and (3) max nodes without any success. I am using the mlr library in R to create my RF model. Thanks.
