A nice introduction deep reinforcement learning by Lex Fridman (2019-01): https://youtu.be/zR11FLZ-O9M 2 complimentary, easy-to-read blog posts to get started on deep reinforcement learning: the first one focuses on policy gradients, the second one focuses on deep Q-learning. Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels ( mirror ) by Andrej Karpathy (May 31, 2016). Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning ( mirror ) by Tambet Matiise on Nervana (December 21, 2015) Then, two more in-depth resources: 10 videos, ~90 minutes each: Advanced Topics 2015 (COMPM050/COMPGI13) ( mirror ) on Reinforcement Learning by David Silver (2015) 455-page free book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (2016) To start coding: Learning Reinforcement Learning (with Code, Exercises and Solutions) ( mirror ) by Denny Britz (October 2, 2016) Minimal and Clean Reinforcement Learning Examples (2017) Using Keras and Deep Q-Network to Play FlappyBird ( mirror , code ) by Ben Lau (July 10, 2016) (the code is straightforward to run on Ubuntu) Using Keras and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient to play TORCS ( mirror , code ) by Ben Lau (October 11, 2016) (note: installing the gym_torcs requirement to have the code run may take some time, and instructions are only given for Linux).
