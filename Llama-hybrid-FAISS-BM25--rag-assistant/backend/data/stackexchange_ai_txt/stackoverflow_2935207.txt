A nice little game, and well executed. Small disclaimer: I'm not a huge fan of the tower defense clones personally. I played the original a lot, then the ants version, and then my attention turned to other games. So please don't read too much into my small enthusiasm. Clear strengths: as others have said, the graphics are crisp, action is swift, reasonable selection of enemies and defenses, decent music. Minor weaknesses: In addition to what Brian and Mikera have said, my only real (small) issue with the game was being able to see how much money I had left to spend. I found it by running out. Nice effect, incidentally, having the amount get larger when I run out, in case I hadn't noticed (I hadn't). Also, a tooltip over the Resistant/Weak section would answer questions like Brian's above. I already knew, because I'd read the help and strategy, but lots of people will just jump into the game. Well done. If this is your first attempt, I expect great things.
