Outlier Removal in Non-Normal Data

I am currently working on a project in which I have to eliminate outliers from non-normally distributed data sets. The data sets are subsets of a fairly large database (order of millions of observations) segmented into groups ranging from 30-200+ observations based on the type of product being looked at. The data is pricing data which could be abnormal in the data set due to the possibility of rush orders and other types of abnormal circumstances under which purchases are made which can drive prices above or below a typical range). The difficulty in trying to identify these outlier values is that not every group of observations follows a normal distribution so tests for outliers based on normality are not accurate in testing for outliers in this type of data. My current approach to this problem is to measure the standard deviation from the mean to flag all values less than three deviations from the mean of the group, this is used to flag the observations for administrative review later. then I measure skewness using the Pearson's coefficient of skewness. If the value of this statistic is beyond a certain threshold Â±.4 then I get rid of the 1st percentile (if skew is lower than -.4) or I remove the 99th percentile of data (if the skew is greater than .4). This measurement of skew is repeated with a new measurement of skew each iteration with the same type of observation removal based on the parameter listed in the previous paragraph. The removed values are then given over to administrative review to determine whether they are true outliers with special attention being paid to any values within 3 standard deviations. is this a good approach to removal of outliers in this case? I don't have much experience with outlier detection in data not belonging to a normal distribution. so the steps listed explicitly are Calculate deviation from mean for each observation Calculate skewness of the pool of observation if skew>.4 remove 99th percentile observations if skew values removed are then put under review to determine outlier status with special attention paid to values falling within 3 standard deviations of mean.
