It is possible but you would need lot of training data to reach a good result, because there is a wide variety of family and company names. Fortunatelly, there could be an efficient solution to make a good classification. My advice is to focus on human names recognition on one side, company name recognition on the other side, and then apply ML. For human names, there are plenty of datasets available to recognize family names and first names that you can filter in the fields (ex: Gupta is recognized in "guptamols" => Name). For company names, you can use dictionaries in english or any other language to detect lot of names (ex: textile is recognized in AgraTextile). Once you do this safe classification, you would have lot of valuable labelled data, by which a NLP model (like Bert - I would recommend a byte per byte embedding as there could be special characters in companies) could learn patterns in order to classify the rest of the unknown data easily. Note: Such models give a probability chance for each case that could be useful to limit the risk of wrong classification.
