Suggestions for replication of data from MS Sql 2005 and MySql

My company currently has a transactional db running on Sql Server 2005. We are going to add a MySql (running on linux) reporting db. We'll need to get replication running from the MS-Sql db to the MySql db. It doesn't have to be real time but should be within a few minutes. I've got pretty good MSSql Dev skills and so-so dba skills but no MySql background. The MySql guy on our team has no MSSql experience. I was wondering if anybody has setup anything similar and might have some suggestions. I've seen some things on migrating data between the two but not much for on-going replication. Right now my best guess is to set something up in SSIS and run it under the Sql Agent. I'm going to work on the SSIS idea for now but welcome any suggestions.
