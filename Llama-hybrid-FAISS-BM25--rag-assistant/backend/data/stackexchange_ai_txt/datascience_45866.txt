What you need to look for is called "Named Entity recognition". From Wikipedia Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. As it is mentioned in the comments section, Stanford has a great NER Tagger and you could use that together with Python (even if the StanfordNLP is implemented in Java) Download the jar file from the official url . It has this format stanford-ner-xxxx-xx-xx.zip You need to put the following two files in the same application folder as your Python script ner-tagger.jar ner-model-english.ser.gz (choose another one if you don't want English) import nltk from nltk.tag.stanford import StanfordNERTagger yourText = this_is_your_text words = nltk.word_tokenize(yourText) jar = './stanford-ner.jar' model = './ner-model-english.ser.gz' tagger = StanfordNERTagger(model, jar, encoding='utf8') print(ner_tagger.tag(words)) Then you can grab from the above, anything that is tagged as DATE
