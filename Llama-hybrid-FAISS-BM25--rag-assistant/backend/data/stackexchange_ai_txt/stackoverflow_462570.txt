There's not a simpler way with the general JDBC API (at least not that I know of, or can find...I've got exactly the same code in my home-grown toolset.) Your code isn't complete: ResultSetMetaData meta = crs.getMetaData(); int numCol = meta.getColumnCount(); for (int i = 1; i That being said, if you use proprietary, database-specific API's and/or SQL queries, I'm sure you can find more elegant ways of doing the same thing. Bbut you'd have to write custom code for each database you need to deal with. I'd stick with the JDBC APIs, if I were you. Is there something about your proposed solution that makes you think it's incorrect? It seems simple enough to me.
