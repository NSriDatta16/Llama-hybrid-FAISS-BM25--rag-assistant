Develop a plugin editor for eclipse

I have a question for you. My teacher proposed a couple of thesis to me. Basically to develop a plugin for eclipse. There are 2 options: 1)An editor for A-SPL language with syntax highlighting, auto completation of the cose, errors detection and so on........to help people that need to use S-APL 2)An editor to help people to design GUI in S-APL......something like a framework where you can drag widgets and there is a kind of automatic completation of the code.... The thesis should last 4 months......i should not implement everything but make a kind of prototype that maybe in the future someone will finish and make properly work. I never did something like this so i would like to know if it is difficult, which skills are needed, which languages i should know to create eclipse plugins (for example i know java and python) and so on......to figure out if it is something i can do.
