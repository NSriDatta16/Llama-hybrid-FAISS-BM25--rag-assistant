Bayesian t-test assumptions

I know that the traditional independent t-test assumes homoscedasticity (i.e., equal variances across groups) and normality of the residuals. They are usually checked by using levene's test for homogeneity of variances, and the shapiro-wilk test and qqplots for the normality assumption. Which statistical assumptions do I have to check with the bayesian independent t test? How may I check them in R with coda and rjags or winbugs?
