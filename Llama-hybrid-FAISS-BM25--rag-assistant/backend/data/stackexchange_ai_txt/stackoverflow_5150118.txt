Spring JMS DefaultMessageListener - onMessage() not getting invoked

I am trying to implement a point-to-point messaging system using TIBCO EMS and Spring framework. I am able to write a message to the queue, but the problem I am facing is in consuming the message. I have written a Java class that implements the Spring DefaultMesssageListener class and used that within the applicationContext.xml file which is as shown below: For consuming the message I have written a Java class which reads the above applicationContext.xml file. But, when I start the program I am not getting any error but at the same time message is not getting consumed. Thank you, Raghu
