If you don't have a UINavigationController, you can drag a UIToolbar in from the library. I usually set its frame in the nib using the snap to guides feature. Then you can set the items with the method that @Can Berk GÃ¼der gives. Using UIBarButtonSystemItemFlexibleSpace and/or UIBarButtonSystemItemFixedSpace you can get a pretty good arrangement of buttons. If you're doing it this way, just declare a UIToolbar* toolbar and set @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIToolbar* toolbar in the interface of your view controller. In the implementation just @synthesize toolbar; . You can set the items in viewDidLoad and link the toolbar to your nib file by adding a new referencing outlet to 'toolbar' in File's Owner.
