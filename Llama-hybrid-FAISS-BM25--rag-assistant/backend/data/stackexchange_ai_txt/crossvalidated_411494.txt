I don't see any particular reason for not estimating $\sigma$ as in any Gaussian process, with sample standard deviation given a sample of outputs from the neural network for some fixed $x, \omega$ But make sure $\sigma$ is indeed independent from those! And yes, $\sigma$ is a parameter in its own right!
