Don't be too surprised that there is not much movement when it comes to RFC development - the RFC technology is sta b le (not stale :-)) so that the libraries usually don't need to change much. I don't know SAPRFC personally, but that's rather because I'm not much into PHP. I'm not sure whether Java would be an option... IMHO, using RFC is an excellent idea because it's a proven and fast technology and the BAPIS are documented and supported. Note that no matter which technology you choose, you'll need someone with advanced FI and SD knowledge (both general and customer-specifics) because otherwise you won't even be able to fill the input parameters correctly. And you'll need access to a 'live' and customized system - it's next to impossible to mock up a system you don't have any experience with. I'd begin by looking for BAPIs in that area - I'm neither into financials nor SD, so I can't help you there. If you know which BAPIs are present, you might get a better idea of what is or is not possible. A tight coupling (with the SAP system being called multiple times during the course of the transaction) is usually harder to achieve because BAPIs are usually transactional - one call to create the sales order, one call to commit, that's it. If you don't find a way for a tight coupling between Magento and the SAP system, maybe you could generate the Magento config and catalog data from the SAP data periodically (personally, I'd write an ABAP program to export the data - mainly because of the performance and because SAP has an excellent scheduling system) and only transfer the orders back (I'm reasonably sure there's a BAPI for that).
