Understanding How Many Components to Include for PCA

I've conducted a PCA on survey data and I'm confused about the concept of 'choosing how many principal components to include'. When interpreting PC1, I found that it successfully captures the concept I'm interested in. It also accounts for a large proportion of the variation - 67%. Interpreting the remaining components, I found they were interesting concepts, but they weren't concepts I had wanted to capture. I often come across the concept of deciding how many components to 'include' in what I assume is a bid to capture as much variation in responses as possible. Given that I've interpreted these other components to be capturing different concepts than the desired one (as capture by PC1), why would I include these other components? Ultimately, what I'm asking is: Even if my PC1 captured only 20% of the variation, if the other components capture a different concept then why would I combine the two components to produce scores for individual respondents? If one can successfully interpret the other components, even if they account for low variation, would it be feasible to use the component on its own to produce unit scores relating to that concept?
