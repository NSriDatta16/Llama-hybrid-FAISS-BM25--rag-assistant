httpcache problem

I have a repository that pulls from both db, and sometimes a cache. To implement this, I created an interface ICacheWrapper that lets the repo use HttpRuntime.Cache, AppFabric, whatever. Concrete classes of the ICacheWrapper usually take the cache in their constructor like so: new HttpCacheWrapper(HttpRuntime.Cache) The repo's constructor takes a reference to a cache wrapper like so: myRepo = new Repo(new HttpCacheWrapper(HttpRuntime.Cache)); If I create 2 repos, does the cache get deep copied? I would think not, but our performance problems indicate otherwise. Have I missed something here? Thanks for any help!
