I successfully implemented using EC's solution as a starting point. The only other thing I'd add is that you really have to pay attention to keeping only one request going at a time. In our implementation the authentication process would get confused between multiple asynchronous requests running concurrently. Using NSOperation to throttle the queue seemed to work great for me.
