Rating My Professor Using Bayesian Statistics

In our lecture, our professor was telling us that "almost any question you might have can be answered using Bayesian Statistics". Our prof gave the following example: Suppose you have to take a math course next year with some professor, and you would like to know how nice or mean this professor is. You ask 5 students who have taken courses with this professor to rate their experience. Student 1 gives the professor 6/10 Student 2 gives the professor 0/10 Student 3 gives the professor 7/10 Student 4 gives the professor 10/10 Student 5 gives the professor 1/10 Now suppose you gather some more information on the background of each student: Student 1 seems to be a rational and fair student - although we don't know a lot about Student 1 Student 2 is very critical of everything and always blames everyone except himself. Student 2 had never taken a math class before. Student 3 is a hard working student who tends to get along with everyone Student 4 is a very talented student at mathematics and has won many math awards in the past Student 5 is also a very talented student at mathematics and has also won many awards in the past To wrap up the example, the professor mentioned: In the Frequentist example, you would take the average ratings from all such students and conclude that this professor is roughly 5/10 In the Bayesian example, you would also take the average ratings from all students - but you would try to incorporate "beliefs and credibility" about the opinions from these students, and try to "pool them together" to estimate the rating of this professor. Our professor then proceeded to make a joke and said that "he is 10/10 no matter what estimation method you use" to which everyone laughed. But I was wondering - what kind of Bayesian Priors can be used for this example and how would you convert the student opinions into a Prior? The ratings themselves are proportions and thus follow a Binomial Distribution - and in the case of the Binomial Distribution, the Beta Distribution forms a "convenient Prior" (i.e. conjugate). But in this case, how would we decide values of "alpha" and "beta" in this example? Can someone please comment on this? Thanks!
