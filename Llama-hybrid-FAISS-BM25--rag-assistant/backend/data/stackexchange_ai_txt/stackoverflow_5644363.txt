ASP.NET session corresponds to browser session - it is independent of whether user is authenticated (logged in) or not. So you should not have any issue with regards to guest/member sessions. I would advise you to expose the current shopping cart via static accessor property - for example Class ShoppingCart { public static ShoppingCart Current { get { var cart = HttpContext.Current.Session["Cart"] as ShoppingCart; if (null == cart) { cart = new ShoppingCart(); HttpContext.Current.Session["Cart"] = cart; } return cart; } } ... // rest of the code } Few things to consider here: Whenever web application or web server recycles/restarts, your in-process sessions would lost. It means you need persist your session in database at appropriate point. You may use out of process session storage (database or different server) - you have to mark your shopping cart class as serializable in such case. There is performance cost to out-of-process sessions. As such, you are already storing session in database, so IMO, you should use in-proc sessions making sure to write dirty sessions into the database as soon as possible.
