Using your own API to build your site

I'm looking to create a new site and in order to encourage myself to create a powerful API for others to use, I'm tempted to write the API and use it myself to build the the actual site. The idea being, if it is capable of running the primary site, then it will give other users plenty of options to put their own spin on things. It will also encourage me to keep the API up to date. What I'd like to know is whether this idea is worth going with, or whether its just plain nuts. Is this common practice? Will it likely result in over complicated code? Will it cause performance issues if (by some chance) the site was to take off? Thanks in advance.
