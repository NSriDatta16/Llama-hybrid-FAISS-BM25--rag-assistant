Django Zip upload permission problem

I have few uploads in this app, uploading csv files is working fine. I have a model that has zip upload in it. Zip file is uploaded, can be viewed, but having issues extracting it. class Message(models.Model): uploadFile = models.FileField(_('images file (.zip)'), upload_to='message/', storage=FileSystemStorage(), help_text=_('')) The error is IOError at /backend/media/new (13, 'Permission denied')
