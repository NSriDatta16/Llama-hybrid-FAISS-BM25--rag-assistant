How do I edit a product attribute using PHP during a cart checkout in Magento?

I have a two part question about customizing my Magento store. When someone buys a downloadable product, I want to generate a licence code and include it in the invoice. I have added a product attribute called ‘license_code’ to my product’s default attribute set and I want to set its value with php when a customer checks out. What is the event to observe that will let me access the products in the cart just after they are purchased but before the invoice is created? I also need to know what script to use to set a product’s attribute value during that event. Thank you for your help!
