How to combine the grades of different pairs of markers?

I found myself at a difficult situation in deciding how to combine the grades of different pairs of markers such that I can rank the candidates fairly. I have around 500 candidates and around 30 markers marking 40 candidates selected at random, such that each candidate is evaluated by at least 2 markers since the marking criteria are not fully objective. Those are the general characteristics of each marker: the minimum, average, and maximum grades they have given and their standard deviation. Given this, what is the most "fair" way of combining the grades of different (2 or 3) markers? For each student: Simply average the grades of different markers. Add the Z-Scores of both markers (and ignore the third one, if exists). Add the Min-Max Normalized Scores of both markers (and ignore the third one again, if exists). ?
