Creating an index based on a set of measurements without a target for purpose of rank ordering

The problem I'm trying to solve here is very simple but the available data is very limited. That makes it a hard problem to solve. The available data are as follows: I have 100 patients and I need to rank order them in terms of how healthy they are. I only have 5 measurements for each patient. Each of the five readings is coded as a numeric value, and the rule is that the bigger the reading the healthier is the patient. Should I have some sort of doctor's "expert judgement based ranking" I could use that as the target variable and fit some sort of an ordinal logistic regression model trying to predict doctor's assessment. However, I don't have that. The only thing I have is (1) and (2). How would you come up with a simple "scoring" algorithm which would combine those five measurements into a single score which would be good enough (not perfect) in rank ordering patients?
