By default , Font-Squirrel does this in order to increase support with user-agents that do not follow specification (those that ignore font-weight and font-style ). If you do not care about those outdated user-agents, you may enable the "Style Linking" option which is available in the expert section of the @font-face kit generator. Note that IE8 and below ignores numbered font-weight values and only support normal and bold (and corresponding 400 , 700 weight values).
