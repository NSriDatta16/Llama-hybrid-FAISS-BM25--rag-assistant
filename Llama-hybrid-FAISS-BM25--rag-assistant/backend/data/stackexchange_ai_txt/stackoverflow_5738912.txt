CSS cover existing element

I'm using jQuery to create an element that exactly overlays any existing one. That's the intention, at least. The context is similar to what goes on here: A List Apart: Making Compact Forms More Accessible The idea is that you have an element, such as an , and under certain conditions you display another element (in this case a ) absolutely positioned on top of it as a hint. Though the general principle is useful in other scenarios as well. There are several existing libraries that do this sort of thing, but they all seem to break down along the same lines. The naive approach: Create the cover element with display:block and position:absolute . Set the left and top of your cover element to match your covered element Problem: The cover's position no longer matches whenever the page layout changes, such as hiding a paragraph or resizing the display. A slightly improved approach: Create the cover element with display:block and position:absolute Add the cover element immediately before the covered element in the DOM Set the bottom and right margin of the cover to the negative height and width of the cover This approach solves the problem with fluid layouts, but it adds a problem such that if the covered element is within an inline block, the cover will create a linebreak when it shows up (because of insertion of a block element). Presumably this is a problem that has been solved already somewhere by someone.
