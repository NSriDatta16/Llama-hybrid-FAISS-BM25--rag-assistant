How to test for significant differences between growth curves in repeated measures mixed-models?

I am comparing growth of fish in different habitats and since length and age data is derived from repeated measurements (back-calculations) I am using a mixed model (R, nlme). I have data from ~50 fish per habitat. My interest is a) parameters of the growth function(s) in the different habitats and b) whether those are significantly different. From literature I adopted the following approach: Run a global model (Model 1, all data) with a single fixed effect for the parameters of the growth function and specifify the parameters as random effects on an Individual level. Also I use an AR1 autocorrelation structure. Then I run the model with fixed effects for each habitat (Model 2, could do it for each parameter but for now I test all of them at once) and compare the two models by anova. Questions: Do you think this approach is sound? Do I even need to specify an autocorrelation function when using mixed effects (phi is usually quite high (>0.9))? If I select a model by information theoretic approaches, how to deal with the different levels of the model (e.g. I select a model, like Bertalanffy, Gompertz etc., based on the global model (all data) but comparing models for each of the different habitats actually reveals that different models are supported - and by quite a notable margin (tested this with nlme and gnls)? Am I overthinking this? Thanks for your help! The code is (fge=habitat and ID=individual): #model 1: VBGF.base.corr
