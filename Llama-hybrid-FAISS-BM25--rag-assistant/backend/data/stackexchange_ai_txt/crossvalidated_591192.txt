Statistical comparison of clustered variables

I have a data set consisting of 50 measurements of cytokine concentrations in 70 patients, resulting in a (70, 50) data frame. In addition, I have a data set containing covariables related to the samples (e.g. demographic data for this particular patient population). We grouped the cytokine measurements into biologically meaningful signatures (clusters). As such, there is already variance around the signature values for each individual patient. We calculate the signature value as the average of cytokine concentrations. One signature consists of multiple cytokines and they are non-overlapping. My question is, how can I compare the difference in terms of the signatures between two groups of patients (say, male vs female), considering the distributions I want to compare consist of averages with a standard deviation. Which statistical test would be appropriate here? Is there such a thing as a nested t-test or should I look for alternative strategies such as nested ANOVA or mixed models?
