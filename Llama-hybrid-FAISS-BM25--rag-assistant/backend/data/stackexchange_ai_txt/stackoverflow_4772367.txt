In your application delegate, you'd want to implement applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile: - (BOOL)applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile:(NSApplication *)sender { NSURL *lastURL=[[[NSDocumentController sharedDocumentController] recentDocumentURLs] objectAtIndex:0]; if (lastURL!=nil) { [[NSDocumentController sharedDocumentController] openDocumentWithContentsOfURL:lastURL display:YES error:nil]; return NO; } return YES; } Apparently, the default NSDocument-based cocoa app in XCode doesn't come with an AppDelegate. Weird. To add one: Add a new class to your Project, call it MyAppDelegate, or whatever you want. In the interface for MyAppDelegate, add the protocol NSApplicationDelegate, it should look something like this: @interface MyAppDelegate : NSObject { } Open up MainMenu.xib Drag an Object instance to the xib's window, the Object instance looks like a blue box. Select the Object instance and in the inspector, go to the Identity tab (the blue i) Set the Class to MyAppDelegate Select the "Application" in the xib In the inspector, click on the Connections tab (the blue arrow icon) and drag from "delegate" to the application delegate you just set up. You are good to go now.
