Go with Wikipedia. Better yet, go with these MCMC researchers: Tierney (1994), "Markov Chains for Exploring Posterior Distributions" ; Geyer (2011), "Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo" ; Robert and Casella (2011), "A Short History of Markov Chain Monte Carlo" . The Gibbs sampler is an example of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Indeed, it is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Any algorithm that generates random draws from a distribution $\pi(\theta)$ by simulating a Markov chain that has $\pi(\theta)$ as its stationary distribution is a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and that's exactly what the Gibbs sampler does.
