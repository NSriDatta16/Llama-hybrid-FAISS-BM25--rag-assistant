Joe Ibrahim and co-authors had a number of good papers about ten years ago about missing covariates in generalized linear models (see the technical paper and an overview ). In the former, they propose is a hybrid of the frequentist EM algorithm and Bayesian Gibbs sampling producing a Monte Carlo EM. In the latter, they compare it to other methods such as fully Bayesian, multiple imputation, etc. (Ibrahim is one of the leaders on computational Bayesian techniques who published a book on this; he expresses his thoughts very clearly, although the technical content is dense). Alternatively, survey statisticians have been developing what they call small area estimation models specifically for the situations when the sample size in any given cell is small or zero. SAE models combine direct estimates from the data with model predictions based on some sort of (generalized linear) mixed model formulation with cells as random effects. With sufficient sample sizes, SAE models automatically lean towards the direct estimates; with small cell sizes, SAE models automatically lean towards the model-based estimates. In the latter case, SAE models admit that there may be biases due to model specification, so they incorporate the expected squared bias into the MSE estimates. Arguably, these methods may have to be combined with the measurement error literature, as you are using predictors measured with error. Luckily, you can quantify the variance of that error, and that simplifies things quite a bit.
