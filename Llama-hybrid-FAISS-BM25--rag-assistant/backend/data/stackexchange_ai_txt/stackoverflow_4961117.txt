get an array of all a products attributes in magento

I cannot figure this out! I am trying to get a list of a products attributes into an array on the list.phtml page. I have tried everything. I have seen a lot of solutions that use $attributes = $product->getAttributes(); but I cannot get this to work, it just brings up a blank page. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I have spent hours and hours on this so far... I am using Magento version 1.4.2.0 UPDATE: Here is exactly what I am trying to do: $neededAttributes = Mage::helper('mymodule')->getNeededAttributes(); $attributes = $product->getAttributes(); foreach ($attributes as $attribute) { if(in_array($attribute->getAttributeCode(), $neededAttributes)) { $attributename = $attribute->getAttributeCode(); echo $attributename; } } this is in the file gallery.phtml in design/adminhtml/default/default/catalog/product/helper/ For some reason, I cannot get the getAttributeCode function to return anything.
