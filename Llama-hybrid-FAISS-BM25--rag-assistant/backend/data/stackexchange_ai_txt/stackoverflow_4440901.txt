You could use strstr to search for 'mailto:' and then strchr to search for '@' and take the characters in between. I never use strtok but I don't see what's wrong with what you've done. Here's an example where email should point to "agent007" in your case. Error handling is missing here. This is destructive, meaning that it modifies the input string, but so does strtok . char *mailto = strstr( str, "mailto:" ); char *at = strchr( mailto, '@' ); char *email = mailto + strlen("mailto:"); *at = '\0';
