Avoid uppercase input with jQuery Validate

I'm making a classifieds ads website where users submit ads through a form (like Craigslist). Many users write the title or description of their ads in UPPERCASE to get more attention, but I dont want to affect the overall appearance of the website. I would like to stop this, but still allow the use of acronyms of less than three uppercase letters in a row (for example allow 'Located in the USA' but not 'LOOK, GREAT OFFER') I'm a complete newbie with Validate and RegEx (just one weekend) so I need your help experts. I'm using this method: $.validator.addMethod("noCaps", function(value, element) { return this.optional(element) || /[A-Z]{4}/.test(value); }, "You are not permitted to input more than three uppercase letters in a row!"); But I'm getting the complete opposite result. How could I negate this RegEx to achieve the desired rule? If somebody has a better idea of how to do it, is also welcome! Thanks!!! See/Edit Example Code
