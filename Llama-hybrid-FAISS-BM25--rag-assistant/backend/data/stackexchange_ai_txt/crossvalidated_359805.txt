Probability of correct classification

I am studying this article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.0478.pdf , in which the authors propose a method to predict the graph structure of a graphical model. In the "Simulations" paragraph, they plot what they call "Probability of correct graph recovery vs. rescaled sample size. [...] Curves are based on average performance over 500 trials." Now, how is this "probability" defined? If I try to compute it simply as the ratio of correctly (with no error at all) recovered graphs over the number of all trials, I don't get results as good as shown in the pictures. Plus, this way of measuring the performance of a classifier seems quite pessimistic to me, as it would not distinguish 90% accuracy from 10% accuracy, but only 100% from Is there something that I'm missing?
