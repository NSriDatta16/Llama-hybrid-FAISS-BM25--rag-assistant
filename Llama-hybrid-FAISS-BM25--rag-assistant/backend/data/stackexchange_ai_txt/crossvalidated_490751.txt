Hm. Unfortunately, ?fabletools::reconcile gives a very rudimentary help page. I am not privy to the internals, but what I can tell you may already be helpful. I strongly suspect that min_trace implements an optimal reconciliation approach which, yes, typically performs better than bottom-up, top-down and middle-out. It looks like FPP3 does not have the relevant chapter yet, so I would recommend Chapter 10 in FPP2 , especially section 10.7 . Specifically, the flavor that min_trace gives is probably optimal reconciliation through trace minimization ( Wickramasurya, Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2019, JASA - yes, the latter two are the authors of FPP). That paper also references a number of earlier papers on optimal reconciliation, e.g., the original one by Athanasopoulos et al. (2009, IJF ) , with a corrigendum by Athanasopoulos et al. (2015, IJF ) , and the one by Hyndman et al., (2011, CS&DA ) . These papers and the FPP2 section should give you a very good foundation to understand what is happening, even in the absence of thorough documentation. Alternatively, you could work with the older hts package for hierarchical time series, which implements almost the same functionalities (for now).
