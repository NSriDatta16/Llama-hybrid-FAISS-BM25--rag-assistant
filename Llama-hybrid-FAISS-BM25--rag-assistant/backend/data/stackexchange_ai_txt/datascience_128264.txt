Combining datasets with different featues but, have similar names but, not exactly I can do name = name

I want to join datasets of data I have scrapped data from open critic, vgchartz, and steam. All of these datasets have different fields but, I want to be able to join the 3 datasets to make one dataset with all of the fields so I can try running it through a machine learning model to predict game sales for my Ap research Project. I know I can join datasets to single column https://datagy.io/pandas-merge-concat/ but, what if I want to join not same name but, similar names as the way the name is done is different across the sites and I don't know how to standardize the names. Not sure how to add files here but Sample open critic {"OpenCritic_Rating": "Mighty", "TopCritic_Average": 96, "Critics_Recommend": 96, "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "publisher": "Nintendo", "platform": ["Wii U", "Nintendo Switch"], "date": "2017-03-03", "reviews": {"Eurogamer": "Essential", "IGN": "10 / 10", "GamesRadar+": "5 / 5", "Metro GameCentral": "10 / 10", "Easy Allies": "4.5 / 5", "Game Informer": "10 / 10", "Polygon": "10 / 10", "GameSpot": "10 / 10"}}, {"OpenCritic_Rating": "Mighty", "TopCritic_Average": 96, "Critics_Recommend": 99, "title": "Baldur's Gate 3", "publisher": "Larian Studios", "platform": ["PC", "PlayStation 5"], "date": "2023-08-03", "reviews": {"Eurogamer": "4 / 5", "IGN": "10 / 10", "PC Gamer": "97 / 100", "Metro GameCentral": "9 / 10", "GamesRadar+": "5 / 5", "Game Informer": "9.5 / 10", "GameSpot": "10 / 10"}}, Sample vgchartz [ {"img": "/games/boxart/full_5741036AmericaFrontccc.jpg", "title": "God of War ", "console": "Series", "publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment ", "developer": "SIE Santa Monica Studio ", "vg_score": "N/A ", "critic_score": "N/A ", "user_score": "N/A ", "total_shipped": "76.55m", "total_sales": "N/A", "na_sales": "N/A", "pal_sales": "N/A", "jp_sales": "N/A", "other_sales": "N/A", "release_date": "22nd Mar 05 ", "last_update": "04th Mar 20", "genre": "Action"}, {"img": "/games/boxart/full_3351915AmericaFrontccc.jpg", "title": "Warriors ", "console": "Series", "publisher": "KOEI ", "developer": "Omega Force ", "vg_score": "N/A ", "critic_score": "N/A ", "user_score": "N/A ", "total_shipped": "49.95m", "total_sales": "N/A", "na_sales": "N/A", "pal_sales": "N/A", "jp_sales": "N/A", "other_sales": "N/A", "release_date": "30th Jun 97 ", "last_update": "24th Mar 20", "genre": "Action"}] Sample steam [ {"name": "Palworld", "date": "2024-01-18", "price": 29.99, "total_positive": 74323, "total_negative": 3428, "total_reviews": 77751, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive"}, {"name": "Apex Legendsâ„¢", "date": "2020-11-04", "price": 0, "total_positive": 808, "total_negative": 131, "total_reviews": 939, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"} ] all have name attributes but, not all of them share same names or even if same game some same spelling but, others slightly different spacing or extra words to describe I can clean spaces or special characters but, not the extra words So how do I join datasets if they have similar not same name values
