This is a simple question with a big answer. Strictly speaking, the PDF of the outcome (buy/don't buy) is a Bernouilli. You have one of two outcomes (buy - don't buy), and probability $p$ that a purchase is made. The fun begins when you want to model $p$ with information about the vehicles and the quotes. A popular starting point would be a logistic regression model. Another option would be a CART tree (or the related random forest, if you have lots of data). You could also do a probit regression, if you believe that a purchase is a thresshold event: people buy when a purchase scores high with respect to a number of criteria. There are many approaches. You need to try some models on your data, and then test how they perform on additional purchase profiles. I realize this is a rather general answer, but the question is rather general as well.
