RNN/LSTM with multiple targets and varying sequence

I have a dataset containing readings from different sensors. Each sensor can provide distance and signal strength but those data is not always available. At each time interval only three sensors can be read. For example there are 5 sensors in total. At time 0 I have readings from sensor 1,2,3 and at time 1 it could be sensor 2,3,4. The readings are equally time-spaced. So the input dimension would be (3,2) at each time instance. The output would be a corrected distance based on both distance and signal strength for each sensor, thus in this case a (3,1) vector. However I am having difficulty structuring my data and the network since the sequence varies and discontinues from time to time. What are the approaches of organising data like this as inputs? Any insights would be appreciated.
