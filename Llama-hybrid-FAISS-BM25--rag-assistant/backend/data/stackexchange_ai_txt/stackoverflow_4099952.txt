What are your opinions on methods of function storage and execution in PHP?

So far in my career as PHP programmer, I have stored my functions statically in class separated PHP files by topic (such as "database", "htmlfunctions" etc). I recently had the idea of storing all my PHP functions in separate files and executing them by calling the include function in the appropriate spot, or including them on a need-to-use basis. That would have the advantage of ridding me of the need to include a bunch of references and keeping track of which functions are in which files. In addition, I would be able to call functions from the address bar. Parameters would be redundant since (from what I know) the include function copy/pastes file content directly and un-compiled into it's place. The included files would then be able to use local and global variables. What are your thoughts and comments on this, experts?
