Don't think Bayesian - asking for p-values is frewquentist statistics. In your case, it is as simple as a binomial test, wether prob=0.993 fits to your data or not. A one sides test ist asked for in the hint: > binom.test(x=9942, n=10000, p=.993, alternative="greater") Exact binomial test data: 9942 and 10000 number of successes = 9942, number of trials = 10000, p-value = 0.08086 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.993 95 percent confidence interval: 0.9927874 1.0000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.9942 So with a p-value of 0.081 the first answer is the only one that fits.
