The SO post you reference contains the clue to answering this - in the last paragraph, starting "In practice you wouldn't even bother with the matrix multiplication". While the mapping matrix is $V\times D$ in size, as each one-hot encoded vector has 1 value set to 1 and all the other positions set to 0, there is no need to do the full matrix multiplication. Instead, each training example only uses $N\times D$ elements in the matrix. As the computational complexity is given per training example, the first term is $N\times D$ .
