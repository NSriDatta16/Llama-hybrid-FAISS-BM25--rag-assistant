Logistic regression intercept adjusting average fitted probabilities

Studying logistic regression I have come across this table / passage: I have seen a few questions answered on stack exchange addressing the interpretation of a specific intercept from a specific logistic regression, but I have not seen any answers that could clarify the meaning of this text for me. How does the intercept adjust the average fitted probabilities to the proportion of ones in the data?
