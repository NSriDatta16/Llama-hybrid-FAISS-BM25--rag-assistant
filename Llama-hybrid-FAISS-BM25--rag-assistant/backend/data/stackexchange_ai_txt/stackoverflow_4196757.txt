jQuery Validation Plugin: Atleast 1 out of 30 elements is required

I am using the jQuery Validation plug-in for a rather large form (the size of the form is large by client request and non-negotiable). I have been able to implement all of the sometimes complex validation dependencies with relative ease. But now I am stuck at a relative simple validation that somehow doesn't seem to fit in the validations plug-in concept: Atleast one of the over 30 form input fields has to be filled. That's it. The problems that I am facing: 1) Since we are talking about 30 fields I do not want to highlight all fields, only show the error ( errors are shown in a special area over the form). 2) An elegant solution would be preferred. Adding 30 " #input_id: required " rules is not elegant. Is my only option to circumvent the validation plugin? Thank you, Alexis
