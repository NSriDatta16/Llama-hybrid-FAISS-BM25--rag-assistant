How to express mixed logistic regression in formal notation?

I'm working with glmer in the lme4 package in R to estimate a binary outcome variable from two categorical predictors (with 3 levels each) as well as two random effects parameters. The data I'm trying to predict are binary outcome data generated by an experimental design in which multiple participants ( Subject ) completed multiple test items ( Item ). I allow only intercepts to vary randomly by Subject , and allow slopes for X1 , (but not X2 ) and intercepts to vary by Item . I also include an interaction term for the two three-level categorical predictors. In other words, my glmer formula is: ~ X1 * X2 + (1 + X1|Item) + (1 | Subject) My question is: how do I correctly represent this model formula as an equation? I have read @BenBolker's recommendations on model specification, here . The closest model specification to mine given there is this: ∼ X + (1 + X∣Subject) + (1∣Item) ...and the recommended equation to represent it is given as: $(\beta_0+b_{S,0s}+b_{I,0i})+(\beta_1+b_{S,1s})X_i + e_{si}$ where $b_{S,0s}$ represents random intercepts for Subject , $b_{I,0i}$ represents random intercepts for Item and $b_{S,1s}$ the random slope increment for $\beta_1$ . Based on this formula, I've tried to express my model as follows: $ log(p_{si}/(1-p_{si})) = \\ (\beta_0 + b_{S,0s} + b_{I,0i}) + \\ (\beta_{1} + bl1_{I,1i})X1lev1_s + \\ (\beta_{2} + bl2_{I,1i})X1lev2_s + \\ \beta_{3}X2lev1_s +\\ \beta_{4}X2lev2_s+\\ \beta_{5}X1lev1:X2lev1_{s}+\\ \beta_{6}X1lev1:X2lev2_{s}+\\ \beta_{7}X1lev2:X2lev1_{s}+\\ \beta_{8}X1lev2:X2lev2_{s} $ Where $_s$ and $_i$ index Subject and Item , respectively, and random intercepts for these terms are represented by $b_{S,0s}$ and $b_{I,0i}$ . The random slopes for each level of X1 are represented by $bl1_{I,1i}$ and $bl2_{I,1i}$ , i.e. $l$ stands for each level. Finally, I include fixed effects for X2 with no random slope component, as well as the 2x2 interaction terms between each of the levels of X1 and X2 . My question is, is this correct? If not I'm hoping someone could please explain why as well as provide the correct equation.
