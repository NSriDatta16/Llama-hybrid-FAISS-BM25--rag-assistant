Do we have to use GUIDs in LinqToSql application to uniquely identify objects

I have inherited a LinqToSql application which is making use of GUID keys for objects. I'd rather use conventional identity fields - much easier for people to use, understand and communicate. However there is some business logic that requires the application to identify unique objects before they're persisted to the DB which is why GUIDs where used in the first place. Another issue we're having is with fragmented indexes - AFAIK we can't create sequential GUIDs in .Net code. As this is my first exercise in LinqToSql I'd like to know how others have addressed this issue. BTW there is no need for the data between multiple servers to be combined - the main (only) reason that I've used GUID keys in the past.
