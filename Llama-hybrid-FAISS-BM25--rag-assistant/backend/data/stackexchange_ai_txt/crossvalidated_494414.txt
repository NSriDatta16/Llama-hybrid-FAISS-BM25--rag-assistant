Modern applications of Bayesian Model Selection

I'm trying to understand the merits of this field so I'll try to break down my question. Research: Is Bayesian model selection considered a popular topic of research these days? Variable selection: My understanding is that its main area of application is (generalized) linear models. But since we have regularization, PCA, VIF, and so many other techniques for variable and model selection in linear models, how is Bayesian model selection supposed to be any better? Machine learning : On the other hand, we have advanced ensemble learning models as well as Deep Learning. Can Bayesian model selection be applied to a highly non-linear model such as a neural net (maybe in the context of generative models) or to a non-analytical model such as a decision tree? If not, can it be somehow matched up against them? Causal inference : There's maybe something that I'm completely missing, for example the use of Bayesian model selection to obtain more interpretable models better adapted to causal inference rather than prediction (I heard that about BIC somewhere).
