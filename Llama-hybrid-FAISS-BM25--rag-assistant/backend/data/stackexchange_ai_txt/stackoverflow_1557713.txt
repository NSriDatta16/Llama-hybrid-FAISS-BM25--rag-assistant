Uncaught exception in iPhone Obj C method causing crash. How to resolve / handle?

I have a crash, and I can't see why it's occurring. I'd like to get more info on it. The method that this is crashing in is: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event when I execute this line of code during debug step through: [self.nextResponder manageTouches:touches]; this is displayed in the file history list: asm__TERMINATING_DUE_TO_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION__ 0x01c1c000:1 The manageTouches method is in the parent object (a view controller). Any tips for how to resolve are appreciated // :)
