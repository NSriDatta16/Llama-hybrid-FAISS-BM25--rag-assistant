OpenCV unresolved external errors with objdetect.hpp functions (C++)

I'm trying to compile a simple face detection program in C++ in VS2010 and have come across two LNK 2019 errors: Error 2 error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _cvReleaseHaarClassifierCascade referenced in function _main Error 3 error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _cvHaarDetectObjects referenced in function "void __cdecl detectFaces(struct _IplImage *)" (?detectFaces@@YAXPAU_IplImage@@@Z) Relevant code lines: cvReleaseHaarClassifierCascade( &cascade ); ... CvSeq *faces = cvHaarDetectObjects( img, cascade, storage, 1.1, 3, 0, /*CV_HAAR_DO_CANNY_PRUNNING*/ cvSize( 40, 40 ) ); I couldn't really find many references to this particular issue and I believe all the relevant libraries/directories are as they should be for the solution. When I go to the function definitions it finds them in objdetect.hpp but what I don't understand is why I'm getting these LNK errors?
