A flat-file database in my view is any database that does not require a server. None of the free versions of SQL database management systems require a server. All of them can be installed on your desktop or laptop. Expect them to run a background service that "listens" for you to try to make a connection to their databases, though. I've heard of some people doing lightweight storage using XML. I don't know how much grief it is for Silverlight apps. I'd expect Silverlight to play more politely with some version of Microsoft's SQL Server. If you're using Microsoft technology for educational purposes, you might already have a site license that includes Microsoft Access. (This observation thrown in for completeness.) As far as I know, all these are free of cost, regardless of their use. In the olden days, some high-end SQL dbms had free versions that could be used for evaluation and development, but couldn't legally be used for commercial purposes. As far as I know, none of these have that restriction nowadays. So, unless I've missed something, they're all free for educational purposes. Some of them limit database size, some limit the number of processors, etc. Anyway, in no particular order . . .
