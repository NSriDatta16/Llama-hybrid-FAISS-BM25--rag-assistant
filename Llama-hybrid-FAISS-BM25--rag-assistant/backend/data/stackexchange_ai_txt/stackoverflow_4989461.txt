You are embedding a Flash container, but you are not linking to a Flash file - this cannot work. In order to play videos in a Flash video player, you need to link to an actual Flash video player SWF, like FlowPlayer (there is a free version), which then connects to the web server to play the video (you can use mp4s, but not ogv). In order to use video in HTML5, you can use the tag. But HTML5 video is not yet supported by all browsers, and neither is Flash (at least not on iOS devices).To make sure anyone can play your video, use a combined solution (HTML5 video with Flash fallback). There are free libraries which do this, like Kaltura and VideoJS (site currently seems to have some problems, but it's there).
