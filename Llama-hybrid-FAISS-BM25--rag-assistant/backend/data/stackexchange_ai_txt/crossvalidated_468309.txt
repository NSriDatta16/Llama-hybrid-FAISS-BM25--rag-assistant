Reference request - time series analysis book with numerical algorithms

I am working on some applications of time series, and I wanted to find a book that has the numerical algorithms or pseudocode for computing things like AR models, and ARIMA models, using nonlinear least squares, method of moments, the differencing operations, as well as State-space model like Kalman filters, etc. I can use all of the existing packages in python or R, etc., but I would rather write the code myself so that I understand it. I have copies of Shumway and Stoffer and all of the other books, but they just show the mathematics without showing estimation algorithms. Even the videos I have found on line don't really give much in the way of estimation. Ideally the book or reference would show how to generate a fake time-series of data, then show how to difference the data and estimate the coefficients. I can figure out most of this myself, but just seems like there should be a better reference for stuff like this. Thanks.
