Very rarely will column width affect query performance. Certainly if you're using larger objects (BLOBs, LONGBLOBs, TEXTs, LONGTEXTs), there is the potential for a lot of data to get pulled. That could possibly affect performance, but it won't necessarily. That really only affects storage. If you care about storage size by data type, you can reference http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html to see the details. And to reiterate: storage size of data does not necessarily impact the speed of queries. There are many other design considerations that will impact query speed. Design of the tables and relationships, key structure, indexes, query and join architecture, etc.
