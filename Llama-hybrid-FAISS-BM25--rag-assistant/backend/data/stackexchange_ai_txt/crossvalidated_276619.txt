time series -mathematical expression for the model

Hi can anyone help me on this? I am trying to understand how can I give a mathematical expression for the following Minitab output. Sales=7.2 + 0.42Timesq + 27 Q1 + 56.2Q2 + 18.8Q3 I am confused with the fact that I have Time square. I know that if we have a quadratic trend we should use: $y_{t=}\beta_0+\beta_1X_t+\beta_2X_t^2+\beta_3X_{s1,t+}\beta_4X_{s2,t}+\beta_5X_{s3,t}$ However, the Minitab output only shows timeSq. Should I use: $y_{t=}\beta_0+\beta_1X_t^2+\beta_2X_{s1,t+}\beta_3X_{s2,t}+\beta_4X_{s3,t}$ insteade? Thanks
