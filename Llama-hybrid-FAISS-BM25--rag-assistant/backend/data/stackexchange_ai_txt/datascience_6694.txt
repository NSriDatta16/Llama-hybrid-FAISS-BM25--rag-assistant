Books on Reinforcement Learning

I have been trying to understand reinforcement learning for quite sometime, but somehow I am not able to visualize how to write a program for reinforcement learning to solve a grid world problem. Can you suggest me some text books which would help me build a clear conception of Reinforcement Learning?
