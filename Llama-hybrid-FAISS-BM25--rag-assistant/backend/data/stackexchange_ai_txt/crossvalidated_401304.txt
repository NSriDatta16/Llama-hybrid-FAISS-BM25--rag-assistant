How does this transformation from 2d to 3d work mathmatically?

This is the 2d->3d projection for svm. They used the kernel trick to change the dimension of the vector for easier classification. I want to understand the detail math behind this projection which part of math tutorial should I see to understand this projection? why did they use $x_{1}^{2},\sqrt{2}x_{1}x_{2}, x_{2}^{2}$ for transaction?
