Is it worth doing (single-armed) meta analysis if the studies' heterogeneity is very large?

I'm currently trying to perform a single-armed meta analysis of immunotherapy on breast cancer, which I believe this meta analysis will be the first among its intervention and cancer subtype. The problem is, when I test the heterogeneity using Cochran Q and I-squared statistics, it showed a masive heterogeneity. The I-squared value ranges from 82-90%. Is it worth doing meta analysis with these informations, especially seeing large heterogeneity between studies? Moreover, when I perform subgroup analysis, 1 parameter showed 0% I-squared value, when the other respectively showed 78.56%, 78.88%, and 90.2%. Is meta analysis still worth doing? Lastly, if meta analysis is still worth doing: 1. Will the heterogeneity be a problem? 2. Will the review make sense to encourage/discourage the usage of the proposed therapy? 3. Is there any argument(s) that can answer if someone consider the large heterogeneity? Thank you very much
