Concatenate two tensors of different shape

I have two tensors: a.shape = (1, 30, 1220) # represents text embedding vector (30 spans, each with embedding size of 1220) b.shape = (1, 128, 256) # represents image features obtained from a pretrained CNN How do I concatenate everything in b to each one of the 30 spans of a ? How to concatenate the whole b to the whole a ?
