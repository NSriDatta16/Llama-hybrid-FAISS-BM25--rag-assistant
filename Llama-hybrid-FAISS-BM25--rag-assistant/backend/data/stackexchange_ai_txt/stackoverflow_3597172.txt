PHP inline tags actually tend to encourage a bad practice - namely, mixing your control logic (PHP code) with your templates (html). Most Python frameworks tend to steer away from such a mix and instead encourage separation between the two - typically using some kind of templating system . Many frameworks have their own template systems (for instance, the Django templating system is fairly popular). Others don't and let you choose a separate template engine (like Cheetah ).
