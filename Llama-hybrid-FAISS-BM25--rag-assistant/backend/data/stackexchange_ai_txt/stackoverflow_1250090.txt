Graph layout optimization in C#

I've got a list of objects that I need to organize as an aesthetic graph. My current approach involves IronPython and a genetic algorithm, but this takes way too long. I've been reading up on Graphviz, QuickGraph and Graph#, but I don't need the visualization part - I already have an app that will display the nodes given the x/y coordinates. I've been told that both the Sugiyama algorithm and the force-based family of algorithms tend to output pleasing graphs, but I can't seem to find a .NET library that will output the coordinates instead of the image without some pretty severe sourcecode hacking. Can anyone recommend libraries, algorithms or the like?
