Try EntityORM: http://entityorm.uuuq.com EntityORM is a fully typed Object Relational Mapping library for .NET 2.0. The main strength of EntityORM is the ease of use. Most ORM libraries still require a lot of type casting and other plumbing to be written, EntityORM is designed to relieve the programmer from these tedious and error-prone tasks, making it very intuitive to use. The main features are: * DataBase independent * Ease for build new drivers that are independent from the EntityORM core framework (for now there is Sql Server, Sql CE, MySql, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Access drivers) * Automatic mark changed for changes entities (optional) * Automatic lazy loading (optional) * Automatic transactions (optional manual transaction for instance for two-phase commit) * Ease to map for an existing database with minimal effort * All relational types are supported (One-To-One, One-To-Many, Many-To-One, Many-To-Many) * Flexible event framework * Conditions para load filter data into entities * Capability to map to different table names or field names * Default values * Rules validation * Autonumber * Guid * Generic list to managed multiple entities hidden deleted entities * Typed entities are lazy loading with caching reducing significantly the needed for reflection * Entity views to faster load read-only data from one ore more tables into a single flat entity * Join conditions to join several tables in to a sigle entity view * Generic list to managed multiple entity views * Distinct, automatic group and aggregate functions (count, sum, largest, average, smallest) supported in entity views
