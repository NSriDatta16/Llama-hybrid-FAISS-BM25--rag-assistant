Why do I get warning C4081 on this #pragma?

I am in the habit of removing all warning reported in my code. I just like a clean build if possible. I used #pragma comment(lib,"some.lib"); I get this warning: warning c4081: expected 'newline'; found ';' I am uncertain why that would create a warning. Could I get help on removing it?
