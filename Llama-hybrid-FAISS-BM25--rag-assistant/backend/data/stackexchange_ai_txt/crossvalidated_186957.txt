Is there a reliable nonparametric confidence interval for the mean of a skewed distribution?

Very skewed distributions such as the log-normal do not result in accurate bootstrap confidence intervals. Here is an example showing that the left and right tail areas are far from the ideal 0.025 no matter which bootstrap method you try in R: require(boot) n mu) count[w, 'upper'] The result is below: lower upper basic 0.000 0.329 perc 0.003 0.257 norm 0.000 0.287 bca 0.015 0.185 stud 0.005 0.129 For $n=400$ single bootstraps still do not provide adequately accurate coverage: lower upper basic 0.001 0.114 perc 0.005 0.093 norm 0.002 0.102 bca 0.017 0.067 stud 0.011 0.058 Empirical likelihood also fails to provide accurate confidence intervals when sampling from the lognormal distribution. Is there a general-purpose approach out there that does not depend on knowing the distribution in advance? Has anyone tried to get confidence intervals for the mean by fitting the data to the Tukey generalized $\lambda$ distribution (this distribution is highly flexible)? What about using Kolmogorov-Smirnov confidence bands for the CDF? Would computing the mean on the upper and lower bounds on the CDF be horribly conservative? I would settle for some conservatism if a method has wide applicability. To restate the goals, I'm seeking a generally applicable approach for getting a confidence interval for a population mean such that the interval is asymmetric if the raw data distribution is asymmetric the interval has correct coverage in both tails (e.g., 0.025 error probability in both) the procedure does not require the analyst to specify anything about the underlying distribution or the transformation needed to make the distribution symmetric Note that the central limit theorem is irrelevant here; I have a fixed small sample size and the confidence interval must be asymmetric to be accurate in both tails. The parametric $t$-based confidence interval under a lognormal model with $\mu=0, \sigma=1.65$ and $n=20000$ still has bad coverage (left tail error 0.012, right 0.047 when both should be 0.025). In continuing to think about this there are two broad ways of conceptualizing the problem that I'd like to discuss. The mean is not a quantity that lends itself to nonparametric inference, at least when exactness of inference is required. The sample median is meaningful for any continuous distribution and we have a simple exact confidence interval for the median. In a sample of size $n=20$ from a normal distribution the confidence interval for the median is $1.28 \times$ longer than the exact $t$-based confidence interval for the mean (see code below). Perhaps this factor of 1.28 is a reasonable price to pay for robustness and complete distributional freedom. Even though no single bootstrap will give adequately accurate confidence limits for samples from extremely skewed distributions, the double bootstrap can significantly improve the confidence coverage in both tails. Nankervis has some nice results and provides an excellent computational algorithm. But no software I could find implements this.
