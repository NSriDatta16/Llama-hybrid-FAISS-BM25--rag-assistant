Is there any macro to differentiate between WinCE emulator and WinCE device?

I need to perform some file operations on WinCE platform. The paths of file differ in Device compared to Emulator. So i need to choose file according to the environment, like below. #if defined(WINCE_EMULATOR) //This macro is just for illustration #define path ".\Storage Card\\1.txt" //Emulator configuration #else #define path "\\My Documents\Storage Card\\1.txt" //Device configuration #endif Is there any macro to differentiate between WinCE emulator and WinCE device ?
