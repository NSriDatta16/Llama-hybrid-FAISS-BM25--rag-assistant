it is required some new data to be stored into a matrix Yes, for models like xgboost and others you have to put the time features into a matrix/dataframe. If the goal is for forecasting something like a time series, then the features must be time related. One way to do this is to have columns for things like Year Month Week of Year Hour Minute Etc, to whatever granularity you require. In order to predict on new data, your new observations need to be in the same format as your training data. When your features are time based, this is pretty easy. For instance, if today you are predicting for tomorrow you already know tomorrows day, month, year, etc etc. As Hicham Moad Safhi points out, whatever you use to train your model needs to be available at prediction time. So, if you use the weather to predict something, you're going to need to know the weather for tomorrow today . Not so bad, we have weather forecasts and the like, but that isn't true of all data.
