(answering own question) An estimator is a function that takes some data and produces a number (or range of numbers). An estimator, by itself, isn't really 'Bayesian' or 'frequentist' - you can think of it as a black box where numbers go in and numbers come out. You can present the same estimator to a frequentist and to a Bayesian and they will have different things to say about the estimator. (I'm not happy with my simplistic distinction between frequentist and Bayesian - there are other issues to consider. But for simplicity, let's pretend that are just two well-defined philosophical camps.) You cannot tell whether a researcher is frequentist of Bayesian just by which estimator they choose. The important thing is to listen to what analyses they do on the estimator and what reasons they give for choosing that estimator. Imagine you create a piece of software that finds that value of $\theta$ which maximizes $\mathrm{P}(\mathbf{x}|\theta)$. You present this software to a frequentist and ask them to make a presentation about it. They will probably proceed by analyzing the sampling distribution and testing whether the estimator is biased . And maybe they'll check if it is consistent . They will either approve of, or disapprove of, the estimator based on properties such as this. These are the types of properties that a frequentist is interested in. When the same software is presented to a Bayesian, the Bayesian might well be happy with much of the frequentist's analysis. Yes, all other things being equal, bias isn't good and consistency is good. But the Bayesian will be more interested in other things. The Bayesian will want to see if the estimator takes the shape of some function of posterior distribution; and if so, what prior was used? If the estimator is based on a posterior, the Bayesian will wonder whether the prior is good one. If they are happy with the prior, and if the estimator is reporting the mode of the posterior (as opposed to, say, the mean of the posterior) then they are happy to apply this interpretation to the estimate: "This estimate is the point estimate which has the best chance of being correct." I often hear is said that frequentists and Bayesian "interpret" things differently, even when the numbers involved are the same. This can be a little confusing, and I don't think it's really true. Their interpretations don't conflict with each other; they simply make statements about different aspects of the system. Let's put aside point estimates for the moment and consider intervals instead. In particular, there are frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals . They will usually give different answers. But in certain models, with certain priors, the two types of interval will give the same numerical answer. When the intervals are the same, how can we interpret them differently? A frequentist will say of an interval estimator: Before I see the data or the corresponding interval, I can say there is at least a 95% probability that the true parameter will be contained within the interval. whereas a Bayesian will say of an interval estimator: After I see the data or the corresponding interval, I can say there is at least a 95% probability that the true parameter is contained within the interval. These two statements are identical, apart from the words 'Before' and 'After'. The Bayesian will understand and agree with the former statement and also will acknowledge that its truth is independent of any prior, thereby making it 'stronger'. But speaking as a Bayesian myself, I would worry that the former statement mightn't be very useful . The frequentist won't like the latter statement, but I don't understand it well enough to give a fair description of the frequentist's objections. After seeing the data, will the frequentist still be optimistic that the true value is contained within the interval? Maybe not. This is a bit counterintuitive but it is important for truly understanding confidence intervals and other concepts based on the sampling distribution. You might presume that the frequentist would still say "Given the data, I still think there is a 95% probability that the true value is in this interval". A frequentist would not only question whether that statement is true, they would also question whether it is meaningful to attribute probabilities in this way. If you have more questions on this, don't ask me, this issue is too much for me! The Bayesian is happy to make that statement: "Conditioning on the data I have just seen, the probability is 95% that the true value is in this range." I must admit I'm a little confused on one final point. I understand, and agree with, the statement made by the frequentist before the data is seen. I understand, and agree with, with the statement made by the Bayesian after the data is seen. However, I'm not so sure what the frequentist will say after the data is seen; will their beliefs about the world have changed? I'm not in a position to understand the frequentist philosophy here.
