You won't go very far with this typical textbook interpretation of probability, because it is circular: if the probability of an event is a real number that is likely to be close to the fraction of occurrences of the event in a very long series of repetitions of some experiment, how can we possibly interpret what likely means without resorting to some previous definition of probability ? You have two ways to explore this question: 1) Look for interpretations of probability based on concepts such as algorithmic complexity; in this case, be prepared to deal with very subtle problems in the Foundations of Mathematics; you probably can't enter this field of research without a solid background in Mathematical Logic; 2) Do it the Bayesian way, either with a construction like the one in DeGroot's Optimal Statistical Decision , or with a Dutch Book argument, as described in Schervish's Theory of Statistics . This other question may be helpful.
