you forgot the "__": printf(" Request = %s ", htmlspecialchars($client->__getLastRequest())); your soap client thinks "getLastRequest" is a method of a soap service this way, not a soap client method. also you should tell us what soap client you are using. i assume you use php built-in soap client... use __soapCall method to be sure, you are making a request to the service: try { $result = $client->__soapCall('PersonalDetails_Update', array('personaldetails' => $params)); } catch (SoapFault $exception) { echo 'soap fault occured: '.$exception->getMessage().' '; } you should check if the returned value is a soap fault.. see the manual
