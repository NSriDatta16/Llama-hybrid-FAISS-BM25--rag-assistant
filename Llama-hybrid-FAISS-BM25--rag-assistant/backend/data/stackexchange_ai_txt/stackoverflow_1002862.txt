What happened to Html.ActionLink in ASP.NET MVC?

I'm reading all of these blogs about using the Html.ActionLink method with lambda expressions. I even saw a ScottGu presentation about it here: http://www.hanselman.com/silverlight/ScottGuAtAltNetConf/ Here's a blog: http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/aspnet-mvc-preview-using-the-mvc-ui-helpers/ Here's a ScottGu blog about it: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/03/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-2-url-routing.aspx "Can also be written as: s.Results("Beverages", 2)) %> " With this being such a powerful way to write URL routes - ESPECIALLY since it automatically supports refactoring tools - why is this either apparently missing or so hard to find? I looked at System.Web.Mvc.Html.LinkExtensions in Reflector and I see plenty of ActionLink(this HtmlHelper...) extension methods, but none that are generic. Anyone have help? Thanks!!
