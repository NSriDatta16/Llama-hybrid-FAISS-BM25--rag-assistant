Convert List > into List in C#

I have a List > . I would like to convert it into a List where each int is unique. I was wondering if anyone had an elegant solution to this using LINQ. I would like to be able to use the Union method but it creates a new List<> everytime. So I'd like to avoid doing something like this: List allInts = new List (); foreach(List list in listOfLists) allInts = new List (allInts.Union(list)); Any suggestions? Thanks!
