I wonder why you would want to do that. Maybe you are sick of misused, excessive URL parameter orgies, and you like the clean RESTful URL style and the elegant way it can be implemented using the new ASP.NET Routing feature. However, in this case, this is exactly what URL parameters are intended for. It's not bad practice or bad style at all. And there is absolutely no reason to apply SEO witchery to your login page. So why should you make this process less reliable for the user by requiring the session state directly (or indirectly via TempData ), or any other workaround?
