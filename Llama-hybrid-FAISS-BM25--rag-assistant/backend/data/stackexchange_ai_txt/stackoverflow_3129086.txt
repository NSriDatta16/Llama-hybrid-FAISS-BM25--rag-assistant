In C/C++ you would normally read your array dimentions from right to left to get a good idea of how the compiler will see it. In this case, you need to store strings of 4 characters each which requires storage for 5 chars (to include the trailing \0) therefore [5] will be the array size. Next you are storing groups of 5 items, therefore the middle value will be [5] and finally, you are storing a total of 3 groups of these items, therefore [3]. The final result of all of this is char currencies[3][5][5] = . . .; Of course, as replied elsewhere, you need to use the double quotes for string values.
