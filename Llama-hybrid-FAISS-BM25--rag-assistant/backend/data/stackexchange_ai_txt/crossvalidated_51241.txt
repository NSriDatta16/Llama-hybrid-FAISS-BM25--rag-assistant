How do i interpret Johansen's test? (Matlab)

I found several similar questions with no answer. But I'm gonna give it a shot anyway. I'm trying to find assets (stocks) which are co-integrated, since Engle-Granger's test may give cause to spurious regression it's suggested by several articles that you use Johansen's test as well to ensure a long-term co-integration. Even though I've not taken any course in time series analysis yet the Engle-Granger's test was not to difficult to understand. Johansen's test was on the other hand slightly more challenging, so I'm trying to understand how the interpret the results you're given in matlab. So when I run the test for a nx2 vector in Matlab I get a 1x2 matrix as result with the inputs true or false. So the question is when I can reject/not reject the hypothesis. ************************ Results Summary (Test 1) Data: Effective sample size: 13 Model: H1 Lags: 0 Statistic: trace Significance level: 0.05 r h stat cValue pValue eigVal 0 1 23.6646 15.4948 0.0031 0.7486 1 1 5.7169 3.8415 0.0170 0.3558 h = r0 r1 t1 true true pValue = r0 r1 t1 0.0031234 0.016977 stat = r0 r1 t1 23.665 5.7169 cValue = r0 r1 t1 15.495 3.8415 mles = r0 r1 t1 [1x1 struct] [1x1 struct]
