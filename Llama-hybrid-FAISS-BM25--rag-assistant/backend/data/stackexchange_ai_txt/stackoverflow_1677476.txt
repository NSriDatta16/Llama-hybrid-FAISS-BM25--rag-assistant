You can find documentation for the test REST methods in the Rails docs The object is not passed to the controller, it is created by the controller. MenuItem.any_instance.stubs(:valid?).return(true) assures that any instance of MenuItem that's created in the context of your specs will return true for the valid? method. The main purpose for stubbing out methods is to isolate what you're testing. If you pass your params to the controller instead of stubbing out only the methods that you need to get your controller tested, you're now testing your controller and your model. Since you probably have your models spec'd out elsewhere, the duplication only serves to make your specs more complicated and fragile. Stubbing the valid? method to return true is the lower maintenance option when compared to passing all the params necessary to have your model return true on its own.
