Call ASP.NET PageMethod/WebMethod with jQuery - returns whole page

jQuery 1.3.2, ASP.NET 2.0. Making an AJAX call to a PageMethod (WebMethod) returns the full/whole page instead of just the response. A breakpoint on the page method shows it's never getting hit. I have the [WebMethod] attribute on my method, and it is public static, returns string and accepts no params. I even tried adding [ScriptService] at the top of my class to see if it helped, but it did not. I have seen this post Jquery AJAX with ASP.NET WebMethod Returning Entire Page which had my same symptoms, but I am still having a problem. I read http://encosia.com/2008/05/29/using-jquery-to-directly-call-aspnet-ajax-page-methods/ and I feel like I'm following this to the T, but still no luck. The jQuery call I'm making is: jQuery.ajax({ type: 'POST', contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', data: '{}', dataType: 'json', url: 'MyPage.aspx/SomePageMethod', success: function(result){ alert(result); } }); The request/response headers, as per Firebug in FF3, are as follows Response Headers Server ASP.NET Development Server/8.0.0.0 Date Tue, 24 Feb 2009 18:58:27 GMT X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 Cache-Control private Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length 108558 Connection Close Request Headers Host localhost:2624 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 Accept application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8 X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest Referer http://localhost:2624/MyApp/MyPage.aspx Content-Length 2 Cookie ASP.NET_SessionId=g1idhx55b5awyi55fvorj055; I've added a ScriptManager to my page just for kicks to see if it helped, but no luck there. Any suggestions?
