Simple HTML DOM is a great open-source parser: simplehtmldom.sourceforge It treats DOM elements in an object-oriented way, and the new iteration has a lot of coverage for non-compliant code. There are also some great functions like you'd see in JavaScript, such as the "find" function, which will return all instances of elements of that tag name. I've used this in a number of tools, testing it on many different types of web pages, and I think it works great.
