Your code will return 'B' every time, because you call getAlphabet() , which returns a new IEnumerable each time. Based on what you're trying to do, I'd probably suggest using index-based iteration instead of an enumerator. If you used MoveNext to get the next element, you'd mess up your loop, so using an index-based retrieval would work more cleanly with much less overhead.
