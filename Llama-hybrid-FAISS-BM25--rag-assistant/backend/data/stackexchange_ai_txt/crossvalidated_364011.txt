Is there any prediction model that takes into account the regression towards the mean?

I am studying performance of football and basketball teams. The regression towards the mean is quite common in sports. One really great performance is usually followed by a less perfect one. So are there any prediction models that they take this phenomenon into account? For example I have data for points scored by a basketball player. The average points scored in the last 100 games tells us about the quality of the player. The average points scored in the last 3 games tells us about the quality of the player as well, but in interaction the long term average it can tell us if the player has over/under achieved and will likely regress towards the mean in the future. What model could notice this interaction? I will manually build a predictor which predicts points scored based on the long term average and the fact that somebody has over/under achieved in the short term.
