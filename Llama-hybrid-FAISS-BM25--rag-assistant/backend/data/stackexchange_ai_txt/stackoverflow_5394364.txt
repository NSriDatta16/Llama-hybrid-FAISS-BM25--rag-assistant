Creating labels along with drawlines

I have asked a question regarding custom widget but confused to whether I need it and how should proceed. I have currently this class public class GUIEdge { public Node node1; public Node node2; public int weight; public Color color; public GUIEdge(Node node1, Node node2 , int cost) { this.node1 = node1; this.node2 = node2; this.weight = cost; this.color = Color.darkGray; } public void draw(Graphics g) { Point p1 = node1.getLocation(); Point p2 = node2.getLocation(); g.setColor(this.color); ((Graphics2D) g).setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON); g.drawLine(p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y); } } Currently this draws an edge between two points but now I want that a label for the cost also gets created along with it. I have already added handling for dragging of node and edges so what is the best way to create the label Do I need to make a custom widget for that ? Could anyone explain that suppose making a component by extending from JComponent then I'll call it by g.mixed() where mixed is that new widget...?
