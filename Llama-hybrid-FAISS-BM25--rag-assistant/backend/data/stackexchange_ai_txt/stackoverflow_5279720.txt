The first part of your question is a simple pathing issue, as noted by the above post. I find it nice to build a file structure for all your dynamically loaded assets (xml, images, sounds) etc. Keeps your bin directory clean and tidy. The bigger question is about embedding vs loading assets at runtime. I've, more than once, come to the completion of a project, to find that my single swf (with all assets embedded) has grown pretty large, and now requires a long up-front load. This may make life for you, as a developer easier, but its not very nice for the end user. My favored practice these days is to embed only the content needed for the initial launch of the app and then hide the load of the rest of the assets as much as possible. Don't make your users wait to see your amazing work! I actually use the flash ide to package sets of assets that I publish as swfs (though you could accomplish the same thing via FD embeds). I target these swfs at runtime and extract classes from the application domain. I predominately build microsites, and I tend to break sections of content ("pages") into loadable swfs. Once the target swf has loaded, the page becomes available for navigation. An alternative route is to use something like BulkLoader, or, better yet, Greensock's LoaderMax (has some excellent queue features) for loading individual assets. Hope that helps. Cheers!
