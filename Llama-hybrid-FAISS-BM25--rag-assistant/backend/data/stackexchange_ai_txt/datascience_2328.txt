Which packages or functions can I use in R to plot 3D data like this?

There're many data points, each of which is associated with two coordinates and a numeral value, or three coordinates. And I wish it is coloured. I checked packages "scatterplot3d" and "plot3D" but I couldn't find one like the example I give. It is like it has a fitting surface. My data is basically like the following. In this way I think this kind of plot is gonna be perfectly suitble for this data: ki,kt,Top10AverageF1Score 360,41,0.09371256716549396 324,41,0.09539634212851525 360,123,0.09473510831594467 36,164,0.09773486852645874 ... But I also may have one more additional variable, which makes it like: NeighborhoodSize,ki,kt,Top10AverageF1Score 10,360,41,0.09371256716549396 15,324,41,0.09539634212851525 15,360,123,0.09473510831594467 20,36,164,0.09773486852645874 ... Do you also have any good idea for visualizing the second case? What kind of plot and which packages and functions, etc.
