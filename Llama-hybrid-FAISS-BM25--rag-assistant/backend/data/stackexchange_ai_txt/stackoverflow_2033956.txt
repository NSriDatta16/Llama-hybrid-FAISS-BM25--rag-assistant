Assuming XHTML, just introduce a new namespace for your own metadata. That way you can have your attributes in their own namespace with arbitrary names and they won't conflict with any validation. Basically all you need is to add xmlns:myns="http://www.example.com/URI/to/myNamespaceDeclaration" to the root node and then you can have nodes such as I'm a paragraph. anywhere under that root. That's essentially the whole purpose of namespaces, to allow the developer to add arbitrary data as layers to the whole model. Edit: Also a quick note, class attribute is nowadays used a lot by microformats for metadata tagging purposes. You may want to take a look at the link above to see if someone has already invented the wheel you're trying to come up with :)
