Alternatives to captchas are going to be to consider the problem from other angles. The reason for this is because captchas are built around the idea that a human and computer actor can be distinguished. As Artificial intelligence progresses, this will always become an increasingly difficult problem as the gap between computer and human users shrinks. The technique used here on slashdot is for other users of the site to act as gatekeepers, marking abuse and removing offending posts before they become noticeable to a wide audience. Another technique is to detect spam-like posts directly, using the same technology used to filter spam from email. Obviously it isn't 100% effective for email, and wont be for other uses, either, but if you can filter out 75% of the spam with very few false positives being filtered, then other techniques will only have to deal with the remaining 25%. Keep a log of spam-related activity, so that you can track trends about offending ip addresses, content of posts, claimed user agent, and so forth, so that you can block abusive users at a routing level. In nearly all cases, your users would rather put up with the slight inconvenience of abuse prevention, than the huge inconvenience of a major spam problem. Ultimately, the arms race between you and spammers is one of cost-benefit. Initially, it will cost spammers close to nothing to spam your site, but you can change that to make it very difficult. Even if they continue to spam your site, the benefit they recieve will never grow beyond a few innocent users falling for their schemes. Once the cost of spamming rises sharply above the benefit, the spammers will go away. Another way to benefit from that is to allow advertising on your site. Make it inexpensive (but not free, of course) and easy for legitimate advertisers to post responsible marketing material for your users to see. Would be spammers may find that it is a better deal to just pay you a few dollars and get their offering seen than to pursue clandestine methods. Obviously most spammers won't fit in this category, since that is often more about getting your users to fall victim to malware exploits. You can do your part for that by encouring users to use modern, up to date browsers or plugins so that they become less vulnerable to those same exploits.
