If you're going to join and compress all the files at a later stage - I would most certainly split them into multiple files and organise them accordingly. Check out how jQuery UI organise their CSS files, they have about 7 CSS files, and 1 main file which imports all 7 using the @import statement. This might be useful to you so you don't have to have 7 references. Also make sure you order them accordingly so that any overrides are always at the bottom. Good luck Marko
