Silverlight: animate and/or pan an image

I have a client requesting an animated/panned image be added to their website. Basically, it's a standard-size image, he wants to put it in a slightly narrower frame and have the image pan from left to right as a visual element on his website. There's no clicking and dragging required; it's just basically an animated pan from left to right, then re-start with another picture. This is a .NET page, and I've got a stack of Silverlight books sitting here with the idea that I'm going to learn it. I figure now's as good a time as any, since now I actually have a real-live use for it. For the record, I'm an experience .NET developer but have not played much with Silverlight beyond reading the first couple chapters of a few books. So... first question, I'm assuming this is possible to do with Silverlight, am I wrong on that? Second question, if I can do it, can someone point me in the right direction as far as what feature/control/technology is needed to do this? I'm reading up on deep zoom, but that doesn't seem to be quite what I want. I just need to take a standard size jpeg/gif/whatever file and have it slowly pan from left to right. What Silverlight features do I need to study/spend some time learning in order to do this?
