What is the trace in a Bayesian Model?

I am studying a python library that uses Bayesian inference to identify the coefficient of a linear regression. I have two questions, one very broad and one more vertical on MCMC and numpyro . What is the sampling trace of a Bayesian Model? From my understanding It seems to be the mean of the distribution once I reached the convergence, but I am not sure about that. In the library specifically here the trace is defined as self.trace = mcmc.get_samples() And this for me is slightly confusing from my first interpretation of "Trace", which makes me think I am wrong. This because the mcmc.get_samples() from Numpyro Documentation here it seems a way to draw samples (I am not understanding how many, but this is another question off-topic) If my question format doesn't respect Stack Exchange best practices, please just let me know. I also read this very complete answer , but I am still struggling understanding the example with Pebbles and Trace ps I am sorry but I don't have enough reputation to add as new tags numpyro and lightweightmmm
