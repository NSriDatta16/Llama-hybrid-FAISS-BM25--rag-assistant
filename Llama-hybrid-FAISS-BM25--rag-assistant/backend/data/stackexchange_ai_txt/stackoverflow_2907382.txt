UIScrollView without paging but with touchesmoved

I have a UIScrollView that I use to display PDF pages in. I don't want to use paging (yet). I want to display content based on touchesmoved event (so after horizontal swipe). This works (sort of), but instead of catching a single swipe and showing 1 page, the swipe seems to gets broken into 100s of pieces and 1 swipe acts as if you're moving a slider! I have no clue what am I doing wrong. Here's the experimental "display next page" code which works on single taps: - (void)nacrtajNovuStranicu:(CGContextRef)myContext { CGContextTranslateCTM(myContext, 0.0, self.bounds.size.height); CGContextScaleCTM(myContext, 1.0, -1.0); CGContextSetRGBFillColor(myContext, 255, 255, 255, 1); CGContextFillRect(myContext, CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 412)); size_t brojStranica = CGPDFDocumentGetNumberOfPages(pdfFajl); if(pageNumber Here's the swiping code: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; CGFloat deltaX = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.x - currentPosition.x); CGFloat deltaY = fabsf(gestureStartPoint.y - currentPosition.y); if (deltaX >= kMinimumGestureLength && deltaY The code sits in UIView which displays the PDF content, perhaps I should place it into UIScrollView or is the "display next page" code wrong?
