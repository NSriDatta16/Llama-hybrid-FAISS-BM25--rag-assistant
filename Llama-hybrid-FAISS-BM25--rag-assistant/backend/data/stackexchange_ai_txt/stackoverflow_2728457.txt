Copying paragraph content

In my DocBook document I have several sections, which follow this pattern: the section name the short description the long description I'd like to create an index of these sections. But I need it to be a table, which is formatted the following way: | link_with_section_name | short_description | | the section name 1 | the short description 1 | | the section name 2 | the short description 2 | I don't like the idea of duplicating the short description. I would like to create some kind of reference in the second column, so that the short description would be taken directly from the referenced section. I could probably create an xterm reference, with the endterm attribute, but I don't want to create a link at the second column. I just want to copy the content from the paragraph which contains the short description. Is there any way to do it in DocBook?
