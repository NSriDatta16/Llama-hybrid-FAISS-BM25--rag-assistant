How to work with Entity Framework and ASP.NET membership tables?

I'm creating an entity model for a Silverlight application which is currently in constant flux. My general workflow is to add and remove bits as required then generate the DB from the entity model as I work. I'm trying to incorporate the ASP.NET user/membership tables into the entity model but I'm running into some annoying problems. I'm trying to relate a table of my own, Courses, with the aspnet_Users table in a many-to-many relationship. This shouldn't require modifying the aspnet_Users table at all, just a foreign key on Courses. However when I try to build the DB from the model I get errors from EF because it's trying to drop aspnet_Users and recreate it, which fails because of foreign key relationships from other aspnet_* tables. Am I going about this in totally the wrong way? Should I perhaps be using some kind of membership provider model to hook into ASP.NET membership/roles etc? Is there some way I can do what I need to do but still leverage all of the work the ASP.NET team did and save myself the hassle of creating my own role/membership/profile system?
