If we fit two Bayesian models to the same data with the same parameter, if there a way to compare model fit based on posterior interval widths?

Suppose that we have a dataset with a parameter of interest. If I were to fit two Bayesian models on the same data, and then generate the MCMC draws, I can come up with the posterior interval on the parameter of interest (the credible interval). Suppose one model results in a interval that is wider than another. Does this suggest anything about model fit? What can we glean from this?
