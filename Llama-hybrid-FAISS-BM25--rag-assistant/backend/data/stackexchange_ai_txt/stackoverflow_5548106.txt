Drag and drop widgets in Java 2D

Is there any material/tutorials available that can shed some light on creating drap and drop widgets with Java 2D? I am not talking about drag and drop data transfer like here . What I want to do is have a visual pane in my application, where users can create widgets, connect them to each other etc. Something like a creating a graph, but with widgets that have properties. Thanks.
