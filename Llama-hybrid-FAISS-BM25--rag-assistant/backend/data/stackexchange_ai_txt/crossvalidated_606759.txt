Why is posterior consistency research focuses only high-dimensionality?

I have notice that most literature (especially recently) about posterior consistency as $n\rightarrow \infty$ only focuses on areas of high dimensionality i.e. on $p_n\rightarrow \infty$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ or $p_n=o(n)$ such that $p$ increases with $n$ . Why is this? Why not focuses on cases where $p$ remains fixed or small when $n\rightarrow \infty$ ? Is there a special reason for this?
