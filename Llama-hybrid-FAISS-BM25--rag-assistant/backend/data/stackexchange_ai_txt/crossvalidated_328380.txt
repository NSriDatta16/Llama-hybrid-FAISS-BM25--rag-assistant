You may be interested in learning about contrasts . In R, the default is contr.treatment which says: contr.treatment contrasts each level with the baseline level (specified by base): the baseline level is omitted. Note that this does not produce ‘contrasts’ as defined in the standard theory for linear models as they are not orthogonal to the intercept. Which seems to accurately define the source of your confusion here. Contrast (no pun intended) this with the help file for contr.helmert : contr.helmert returns Helmert contrasts, which contrast the second level with the first, the third with the average of the first two, and so on. contr.poly returns contrasts based on orthogonal polynomials. contr.sum uses ‘sum to zero contrasts’. This is very close to what you describe later as what you want. We only conduct two inferences here. First compare Lev and Obs alone. If you don't observe any difference between Lev and Obs , pool them and compare against Lev+5FU . See here: contrasts(colon$rx) gives: Call: coxph(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ rx, data = colon) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p rx1 -0.0104 0.9896 0.0384 -0.27 0.79 rx2 -0.1435 0.8663 0.0250 -5.75 9.2e-09 Likelihood ratio test=35.2 on 2 df, p=2.23e-08 n= 1858, number of events= 920 Which quantitatively describes exactly what you observed: Lev shows no difference from Obs (p=0.79). But the combined Lev , Obs cohort show significant differences in survival HR=exp(-0.44), p . Because of the coding the coefficients are off by a factor of 2 from the contr.treatment . Note the identical z and p values. You can reproduce very similar output by running: coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ I(rx == "Lev"), data=colon, subset= rx != "Lev+5FU") coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ I(rx == "Lev+5FU"), data=colon) The differences arise because modeling subsets gives rise to a different baseline hazard function, and because there are ties in these data. The helmert contrast is probably a better bet.
