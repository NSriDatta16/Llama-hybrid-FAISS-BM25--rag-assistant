Alternatives to logistic regression when dataset can't meet 10 events per predictor variable

I have a dataset with a binary outcome I'd like to model, but have many more parameters than events, probably ~100 categorical parameters to test, in a dataset with 20 events in ~600 observations. As this dataset doesn't meet the 10 Events per Predictor Variable requirement for performing logistic regression can anyone suggest some alternatives?
