how to group records into bucket based on the timestamp?

i have a list of entries from the logs: 15:38:52.363 1031 15:41:06.347 1259 15:41:06.597 1171 15:48:44.115 1588 15:48:44.125 1366 15:48:44.125 1132 15:53:14.525 1348 15:53:15.121 1553 15:53:15.181 1286 15:53:15.187 1293 the first one is the timestamp, the second one is the value. now i'm trying to group them up by an interval of, say, 20 sec. i want to either sum the values, or get their average. i wonder what's the easiest way to do this? preferrably i can do this thru some simple shell script, so i can pipe my grep statement into and get a divided list. thanks!
