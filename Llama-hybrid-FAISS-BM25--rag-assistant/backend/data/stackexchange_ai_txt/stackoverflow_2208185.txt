Several people have mentioned calling dispose once done with the images. However, this is not enough and something the .net framework will do for you as memory usage increases. Since you've added each picture to a linked list the .NET framework can't dispose of it, as you implicitly keep a reference. This means that all data stored within the picture class is kept during the foreach loop. From the code fragment I can't see what it is, it may include a compressed or even an uncompressed version of the images which could explain your memory explosion. [Edit] removed part of anwer which others have pointed out to be irrelevant; I assumed picture class to be the XNA picture class.
