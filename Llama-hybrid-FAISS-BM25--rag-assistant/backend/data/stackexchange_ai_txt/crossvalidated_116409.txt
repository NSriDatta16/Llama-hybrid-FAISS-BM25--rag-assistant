What's the best algorithm type for low-dimensional grouping

I'm looking for some advice on directions to head into a project I'm working on. I want to identify general groups (of varying size) in a 2-D grid of points belonging to one of three categories: red, blue or empty. I'm not completely new to machine learning, but not familiar enough with the variety of methods to know which is best. My first thought was to use a clustering algorithm since it seems like I'm looking for clusters of the types, but I was concerned with the low dimensionality and concerned since I already know that they have in common, I need to find the groups efficiently. I need to be able to identify whether is a group that needs to be further analysed or if it is a point or just a couple of points grouped. The problem size is small, 81-361 coordinates per analysis, but will have to be run after each update to the grid, most likely on the order of hundreds of times per run, but could extend to thousands. I'd like some input on this and appreciate any advice someone could impart on the topic.
