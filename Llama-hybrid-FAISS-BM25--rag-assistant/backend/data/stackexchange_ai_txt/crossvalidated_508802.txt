If I'm interpreting the excerpt you included correctly, $A$ is a Markov matrix. The wiki article for this calls it a Stochastic matrix: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix Each entry $A_{ij}$ contains the probability of transitioning (clicking) from state (page) $i$ to state $j$ . Because you must transition to some state (this includes remaining in the same state), the values in each column of $A$ must sum to 1, since each column represents a probability distribution. Yes, if $x$ is a one-hot encoding of a web page you start on, then $Ax$ will extract the corresponding column of $A$ , and that will represent the probability distribution of where you'll be after randomly clicking once. Then $A(Ax)$ after randomly clicking again, and so on. In most cases, $A^nx$ will converge to $x^*$ , the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $A$ . But this doesn't sound quite right "After normalizing ∗ , such that ||∗|| = 1, we can interpret the entries as probabilities" The vector $\left[\sqrt2/2, \sqrt2/2\right]^T$ has length 1 but does not represent a probability distribution. Maybe they meant that the vector should be normalized in the sense of dividing the entries by the total. But if $x$ has this property, then so will $Ax$ , so there wouldn't be a need if you started out with a valid probability distribution. "A web page is an eigenvector means that the matrix A has as many eigenvectors as the web pages existing in the world?" If $A$ is diagonalizable, which AFAIK it usually will be, then there will be as many eigenvectors as web pages. However, I don't know of an interpretation associating to each web page a particular eigenvector one-to-one. It's more like, there will be as many stationary distributions as there are web pages. But if the multiplicity of the top eigenvalue is 1, which should be typical, then only one unique stationary distribution will be stable. So you take that dominant eigenvector that represents the dominant stationary distribution, and choose to interpret the probability of each page as a ranking of importance. If I randomly click between pages for a long time, then the page I visit most often in the long run (the page I'm most probably currently on at any one given time) is the highest ranked. this Gilbert Strang lecture largely covers all this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGGDIGizcQ0&pbjreload=101
