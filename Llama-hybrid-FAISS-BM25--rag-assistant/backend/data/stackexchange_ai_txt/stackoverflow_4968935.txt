Browseable attribute and Infragistics WinGrid

I'm struggling with the databind behaviour of the Infragistics WinGrid. It's possible to manually define a data schema (which I'm doing) and it's also possible to tell the grid when binding that I don't want for the grid to display additional bands or columns, even if my data source has them. DisplayLayout.NewBandLoadStyle = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.NewBandLoadStyle.Hide; DisplayLayout.NewColumnLoadStyle = Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.NewColumnLoadStyle.Hide; The problem is that the grid ALWAYS tries to get the value of the property even if it's not in the columns layout. It's possible however use the browseable attribute in the domain object: [Browsable(false)] and the grid will ignore the property (it won't try to use the property getter). But I believe this is a lame workaround. Does anyone know an efficient way to instruct the grid only to get the value for the items defined in the layout. Many thanks
