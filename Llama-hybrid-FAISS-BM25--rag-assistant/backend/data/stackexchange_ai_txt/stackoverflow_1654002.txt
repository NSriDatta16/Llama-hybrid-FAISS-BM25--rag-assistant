if you are asking for a visual input, NetBeans provides a very easy way to manage visual components, as easy as drag-and-drop how to do it: Create a JFrame by right-click on your package > New > JFrame form you can see a "source" tab and a "design" tab on top of the frame. drag and drop your visual components (like Text Field from the Swing Control on the right menu) after placing your component(s) on the Frame, right-click > Events > (then choose the type of event you want to handle for each component) it may look difficult and scary for first-timers, but once you start playing with it, few minutes and you will enjoy your experiments ;)
