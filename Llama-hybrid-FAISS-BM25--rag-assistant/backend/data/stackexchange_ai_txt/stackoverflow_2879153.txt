The DBD::SQlite distribution should have everything you need for SQLite. It comes with the Perl interface and all the SQLite stuff you need. You'll also need the basic DBI package too. However, I encourage you to set up whatever application you have to install as a Perl distribution with dependencies, etc. Then you just install your application as a Perl module with the normal Perl tools. You specify whatever you need in the tool configuration at installation time. That way you aren't creating some new system that you have to explain to other Perl programmers, create new tools for, or maintain in some odd way. You can even set up your own internal mini-CPAN with just the modules you need so you can control it within your network. See, for instance, my DPAN stuff .
