Yes, a macro-average measure is the standard choice in this context: a macro-average score is simply the mean of the individual score for every class, thus it treats every class equally. With an strongly imbalanced dataset, this means that a small class which has only a few instances instances in the data is given as much weight as the majority class. Since the former is generally harder for a classifier to correctly identify, the macro-average performance value is usually lower than a micro-average one (this is normal of course).
