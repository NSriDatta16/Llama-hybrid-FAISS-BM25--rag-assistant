What is the target variable in the feed forward neural network within the Transformer model architecture?

In the paper 'Attention is all you need' the model architecture of The Transformer is described. Both in the encoder as well as in the decoder, there is a feed forward network. If I understant it correctly, the input to this feed forward network is the embedding/ continuous representation with similar dimensions. However, who can tell me what the target variable is on which the neural network is trained?
