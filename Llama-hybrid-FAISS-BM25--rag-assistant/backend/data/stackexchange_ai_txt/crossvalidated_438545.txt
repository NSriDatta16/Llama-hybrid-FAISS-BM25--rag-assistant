Barring exotic cases, NNs operate on floats. Period. Big floats, small floats, 16/32/64 bit floats - but floats all the same. So yes, you do have to encode your data somehow to floats - how you do that will depend on what you're trying to do. Now, for time, you may have two use-cases I can think of. First is that you're trying to account for the time of day itself, but don't care for higher-level trends (day on day, week on week, etc., you're assuming they stay the same). In this case, you can actually get a perfectly continuous encoding just by encoding to some periodic function, like a sine where you set 0.5 as noon, or whatever. Second is that you're doing time series. In this case you want to have a sliding window over all time periods, which is exactly what 1D Convolutions give you if the D in question is time.
