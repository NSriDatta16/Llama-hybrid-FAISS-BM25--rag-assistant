What is your development checklist for Java low-latency application?

I would like to create comprehensive checklist for Java low latency application. Can you add your checklist here? Here is my list 1. Make your objects immutable 2. Try to reduce synchronized method 3. Locking order should be well documented, and handled carefully 4. Use profiler 5. Use Amdhal's law, and find the sequential execution path 6. Use Java 5 concurrency utilities, and locks 7. Avoid Thread priorities as they are platform dependent 8. JVM warmup can be used 9. Prefer unfair locking strategy 10. Avoid context-switching (many threads lead to counter productive) 11. Avoid boxing, un-boxing 12. Give attention to compiler warnings 13. Number of threads should be equal or lesser than the number of core Low-latency application is tuned for every milli-seconds.
