There was just some study I read in the newspaper here at home in Norway. In a nutshell it said that office types of jobs generally had no benefit from performance pay. The reason being that measuring performance in most office types of jobs was almost impossible. However simpler jobs like e.g. strawberry picking benefited from performance pay because it is really easy to measure performance. Nobody is going to feel bad because a high performer get a higher pay because everybody can clearly see that he or she has picked more berries. In an office it is not always clear that the other person did a better job. And so a lot of people will be demotivated. They tested with performance pay on teachers and found that it gave negative results. People who got higher pay often didn't see why they did better than others and the ones who got lower usually couldn't see why they got lower. What they did find though was that non-monetary rewards usually helped. Getting encouraging words from the boss for well done jobb etc. Read iCon on how Steve Jobs managed to get people to perform. Basically he made people believe that they were part of something big and were going to change the world. That is what makes people put in an effort and perform. I don't think developers will put in a lot of effort for just money. It has to be something they really believe in and/or think is fun or enjoyable.
