Lagrange multiplier test statistic math

I'm trying to understand the how the Lagrange multiplier test statistic written like this: $$LM = \hat{d'}_1 (\hat{\phi}_{11}-\hat{\phi}_{12}\hat{\phi}_{22}^{-1}\hat{\phi}_{21})^{-1}\hat{d}_1 \qquad{(1)}$$ was derived. This LM form appears in, for instance, Breusch and Pagan - see extract here: [1] (The Review of Economic Studies , Jan., 1980, Vol. 47, No. 1, Econometrics Issue (Jan., 1980), pp. 239-253). It comes up in several places in statistics and econometrics. Starting from this: $$LM = \hat{d'} (\hat{\phi})^{-1}\hat{d} \qquad{(2)} $$ ...how is (1) derived from (2)? I can see how limiting $\hat{d}$ to $\hat{d}_1$ makes a difference but I don't understand how the multiple subscripted $\phi$ terms came about as a result. Wondering if someone can help me out. Thanks.
