If training and validation set are both drawn i.i.d from the same population, then machine learning models should not be able to separate both data sets. Would I therefore have to do this test for each numeric variable independently or is there a test/way to do that on the whole data set at once? Univariate analysis (ks-test, chi-squared, etc.) does not take combinations of attributes into account. Even if all variables follow the same distribution in traininig and validation set, you could still have different populations (or data sources)
