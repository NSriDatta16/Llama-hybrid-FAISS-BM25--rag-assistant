It depends on exactly what you're trying to log. I've started to use http://github.com/smtlaissezfaire/enhanced_query_analyzer/tree/master in a beta-production system to log queries. You could certainly do something similar to log page views with a before filter in application.rb If you need or want to use a database, don't want to share your information with google, and are using mysql, I'd suggest looking into the archive storage engine
