miglayout question about columns

I have some controls in columns that I would like to look like this, and there is one row that is an exception: +----+------------------+----+--------------------+ | X1 | Y1 | X5 | Y5 | +----+------------------+----+--------------------+ | X2 | Y2 | X6 | Y6 | +----+------------------+----+--------------------+ | X3 | Y3 | X7 | Y7 | +----+-----+------------+----+--------------------+ | Special1 | Special 2 with long description | +----+-----+------------+----+--------------------+ | X4 | Y4 | X8 | Y8 | +----+------------------+----+--------------------+ and I was wondering how to do it with MigLayout. I am using Swing JavaBuilders with its condensed YAML syntax: X1 Y1 X5 Y5 X2 Y2 X6 Y6 X3 Y3 X7 Y7 Special1 Special2 X4 Y4 X8 Y8 What I basically would like to do is make one row (the Special1/Special2) an exception, but I'm not sure how to do it (the above YAML fragment is not right).
