Anomaly detection based on clustering

I understand that there a lot of different methods for anomaly detection, based on classification, clustering, nearest neighbors, statistical, etc. I'm trying out clustering based approach. So, I'm clustering data and as a result getting some representatives (centroids, medoids) and each cluster has some kind of total (or if you would like, average) distance. This cluster representatives form a model. My question is, what to do next when you have a model? What would be a good anomaly metric? I have some ideas, such as comparing the distance of object being questioned to existing representatives and than comparing that distance with the average distance in the closest cluster. But, I could also use some multiple of that distance. If you consider K-means I basically have a variance for a cluster, so I could extend that to standard deviation and us 3*sigma, as a known value for finding objects that are "not usual". But is that a good approach? I have mentioned my reasoning about K-means, but what happens when you have a medoid? You don't have variance anymore, but you do work with some similarity measure. What to use than? So to concertize my question - how to detect anomalies after performing clustering which produces some representatives such as centroids or medoids?
