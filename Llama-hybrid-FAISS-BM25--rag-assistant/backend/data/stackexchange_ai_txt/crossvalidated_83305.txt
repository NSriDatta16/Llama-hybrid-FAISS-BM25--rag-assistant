It will be hard to even define what you mean by "measurement error of maximum counts". In case of mean it is easy, because mean is a parameter of underlying theoretical distribution that generated your data. This parameter can be estimated along with its uncertainty. Maximum, on the other hand, is not a parameter of the distribution - the distribution has no maximum! So when you speak about maximum, it is always maximum of your sample . This puts Bayesian statistics off because it considers your data as fixed. You will have to use either some direct frequentist approach, which considers model as fixed and your data being actually sample of your model. The inference could be either direct or by using bootstrapping . I am not very strong in deriving complex frequentist maximum likelihood formulas, so I will just give you a bootstrapping example on your data: library(boot) counts You see the results correspond to the real values, but also include a standard error. You can see the bias is quite high. This indicates that the "real" max value lies out of the sampled ones, which is normal for max function and will not happen for mean . You can report the CI too (perhaps there is a better way, but this works): for (i in 1:12) { print(boot.ci(results, type="bca", index=i)) }
