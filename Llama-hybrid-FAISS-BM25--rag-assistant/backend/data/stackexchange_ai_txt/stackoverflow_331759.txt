I don't think you can conclude anything useful whatsoever about performance of real applications from what you're trying to do here. Unless 'not precise' means 'within several orders of magnitude'. You're just way overgeneralised, and you're dismissing caching, etc, as though it's secondary, whereas it may well be totally dominant. If your application is large enough to have trended to some average instructions-per-loc, then it will also be large enough to have I/O or at the very least significant RAM access issues to factor in.
