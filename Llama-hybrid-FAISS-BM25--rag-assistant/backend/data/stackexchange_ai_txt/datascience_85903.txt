Yes, the aim of auto.arima is for fitting ARIMA models automatically. You do not need to decompose your time series before hand. See how the algorithm works here https://otexts.com/fpp3/arima-r.html . You may still want to look at arguments available in the auto.arima function, and you may want to change default maximum values for p , q , and d , etc.
