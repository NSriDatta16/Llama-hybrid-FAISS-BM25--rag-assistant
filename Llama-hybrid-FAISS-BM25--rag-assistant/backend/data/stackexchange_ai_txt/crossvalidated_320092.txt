Question 2. Using Stata, I have to do a regression analysis of this time series In my opinion I don't believe Stata will be of use to you as it lacks broad functionality in time series analysis. Please review http://autobox.com/dave/regvsbox.pdf (which I authored) discusses issues/differences/opportunities/pitfalls when dealing with time series that your possible regression solutions may be ignoring. You might also look at If I am convinced that a series is mostly trend+season, what is it I should check about the residuals? as it discusses the opportunities/complications that arise with time series data. It specifically deals with residuals from a specified model but the specified model could easily be be a simple (standard) regression model. Unknown/untreated factors can often play havoc with model identification such as pulses/level shifts/local time trends , changes in error variance , changes in parameters over time which is why they need to be empirically identified and controlled/adjusted for. The above flow chart might also be of help in providing a framework/script to follow regardless of your software of choice.
