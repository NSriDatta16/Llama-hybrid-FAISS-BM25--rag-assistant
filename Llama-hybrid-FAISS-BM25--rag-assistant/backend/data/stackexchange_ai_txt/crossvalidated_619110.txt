You already addressed the problem you were facing by changing the loss function, but as you can learn from Are XGBoost probabilities well-calibrated? , the probabilities returned by XGBoost are in general not well-calibrated. Overestimates are something to be expected. For further improvements, you would need to calibrate them or pick a model that is well-calibrated (e.g. logistic regression).
