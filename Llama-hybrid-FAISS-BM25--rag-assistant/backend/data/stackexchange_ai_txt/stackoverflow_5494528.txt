No. Because sendRedirect send the web-browser/client a 302 with the new location and according to the following it will usually be a GET, no matter what the original request was. According to HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt : If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, **the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user**, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request. However, ***most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method***. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client. Maybe playing carefully with ajax can get you something. Update: Then again, as user: BalusC pointed out, you can redirect by manually setting the headers, as in: response.setStatus(307); response.setHeader("Location", "http://google.com");
