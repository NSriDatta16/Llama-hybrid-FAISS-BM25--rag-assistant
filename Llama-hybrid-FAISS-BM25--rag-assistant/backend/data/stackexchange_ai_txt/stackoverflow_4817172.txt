If you want to use jQuery anyway, I would recommend to use the draggable-functionality of jQuery UI . It easily enables you to make elements draggable and also allows you to bind a custom function to a drag -event. This function is then called whenever the user moves his mouse while dragging the element, so it could be used to update the "links". Of course, you can also bind the same function to the load-event of the page to create the initial "links".
