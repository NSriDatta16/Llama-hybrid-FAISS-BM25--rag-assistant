Yes, SAS is an older statistical programming language. This is not necessarily a bad thing; a strong data scientist or statistician will be good at their craft whichever language they prefer. Plus the FDA, pharmaceutical industry, and many academic researchers actually prefer SAS. However I would strongly encourage you to learn other languages like Python and maybe R - you'll be more marketable when you graduate. Without comparing their programs, tuition, etc. I couldn't tell you whether you ought to stick with OSU or enroll with one of the other universities. OSU's SAS focus is a concern - they should be offering courses in other languages as well. Perhaps you could take computer science classes in Python on the side at OSU? I've worked in public health and the healthcare industry for many years and am currently employed with Cigna as a statistician. Most of the data scientists use Python at Cigna, plus there are some statisticians like myself who prefer R. A few people still use SAS, including many valued employees. I learned SAS in graduate school 20 years ago myself, but rarely use it now. Cigna is very accommodating to your programming preferences, but we're definitely shifting towards more Python programming. If you have the chance, also learn some basic SQL programming, which we use for extracting and manipulating data in Amazon Redshift or Hive on our Hadoop servers (although we're transitioning away from Hadoop to Apache Spark at the moment). SQL + Python coding skills is a great combination. And familiarize yourself with GitHub and GitLab for sharing code with colleagues - another valuable skill. Hope this helps, good luck!
