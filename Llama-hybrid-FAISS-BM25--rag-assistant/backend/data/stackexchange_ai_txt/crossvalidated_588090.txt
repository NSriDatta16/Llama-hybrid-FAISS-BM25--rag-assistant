compare model fit logistic regression negative two times log likelihood

I'm trying to decide between two logistic regression models. I think I've used the negative two times log likelihood criterion before. My two models are not nested - can I still use that approach? If so, please point me to a resource for how to use -2LogL to make the decision. If not, what do you recommend?
