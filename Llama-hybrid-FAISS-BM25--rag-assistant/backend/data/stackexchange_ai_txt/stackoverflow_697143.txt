Let me answer your questions one at a time: Your repositories should return IQueryable , not ObjectQuery. The reason is that the whole purpose of the repository pattern is to abstract away the specifics of your data store. This allows you to do things like substitute a mock repository when you unit test your controllers. If you make the repository return ObjectQuery, then you are not abstracting away the Entity Framework. Another way of saying this is the users of your repository should not know, as much as possible, that it is the Entity Framework which is doing the O/R mapping. In order to use the greater than and less than symbols in paragraph text in Stack Overflow, you must escape them as you would in HTML, i.e.: &lt; You do not need to do this in a code block; in code blocks, you just type the less than/greater than symbol.
