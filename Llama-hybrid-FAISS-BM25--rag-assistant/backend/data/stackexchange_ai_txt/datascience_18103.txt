Can we generate huge dataset with Generative Adversarial Networks

I'm dealing with a problem where I couldn't find enough dataset(images) to feed into my deep neural network for training. I was so inspired by the paper Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis published by Scott Reed et al. on Generative Adversarial Networks. I was curious to know that, can I use available small dataset as an input to a GAN model and generate a much bigger dataset to deal with deeper network models? Will it be good enough?
