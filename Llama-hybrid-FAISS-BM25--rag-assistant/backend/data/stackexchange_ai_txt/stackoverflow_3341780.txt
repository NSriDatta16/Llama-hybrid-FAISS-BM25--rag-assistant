Image retrieval optimisation with LINQ

I'm working on optimising the image retrieval from the database with LINQ. The approximate image size is 4000 * 1000 pixels which weighs about 400-600KBs. The images are retrieved through a controller which is being called by a webservice. Web service gets called through jQuery. The first image that gets retrieved in about 0.7 - 1.5 seconds, when the consequent images take between 3 to 4 seconds. The code that reads images from the database isn't surrounded in the using { } , I'm struggling to see how to use this clause with methods that simply return a byte array. Is there any ways to improve the performance here? Thank you Edit: I'm going to run the profiling and post the code once I get the results back. Thank you
