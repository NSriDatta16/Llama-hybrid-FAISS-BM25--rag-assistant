What is the better form to use Configuration Management in organization to control documents

I'm thinking sugest to my organization, to implement SVN for all users in my orgazination. What is the best form to implement that? What is the best tool to do this? What is the best process to implement this? I have any ideas to implement that. But I would like to hear some success stories, not to waste time on things that will not work.
