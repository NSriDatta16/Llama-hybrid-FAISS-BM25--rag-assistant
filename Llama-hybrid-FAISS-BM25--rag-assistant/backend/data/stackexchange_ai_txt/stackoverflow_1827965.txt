Is putting a div inside an anchor ever correct?

I've heard that putting a block element inside a inline element is a HTML sin: What we have here is a problem. You see, an anchor element is an inline element, and the div element is a block level element. But what about if you style the outer anchor as display:block in the stylesheet? Is it still wrong? The HTML 4.01 spec on block-level and inline elements seems to think so: Style sheets provide the means to specify the rendering of arbitrary elements, including whether an element is rendered as block or inline. In some cases, such as an inline style for list elements, this may be appropriate, but generally speaking, authors are discouraged from overriding the conventional interpretation of HTML elements in this way. Does anyone have any further tips about this issue?
