I'm not sure what you are trying to implement, but generally as it's been pointed, you need to design what's your comparison of your rectangles. What makes one rectangle ordered before another one in a sequence. One of the simplest variant is to compare on the x-coordinate. More sophisticated option is to sort according to Hilbert value calculated for rectangle. See question Calculate the Hilbert value of a point for use in a Hilbert R-Tree? Perhaps you're working on some sort of spatial index, then learn about R-tree
