I don't see any simple ways to do what you ask, apart from decrypting the numbers first. Taking the average (or the "arithmetic mean") requires adding the numbers. Now if you wanted to multiply the numbers, then you could do that neatly with RSA encryption. If p is the plaintext, c is the ciphertext, and e is the encryption key, then in RSA, c = p^e. If you have 3 separate integers, p1, p2, p3, and the product is pp then pp^e = (p1 * p2 * p3)^e = p1^e * p2^e * p3^3 = c1 * c2 * c3 = cp That is, you can either multiply the three plaintext integers together and then encrypt, or you can just multiply the three ciphertexts together, and get the same answer. This would get you some way towards the "geometric mean", where you multiply all the numbers together, and then take the cube-root (or nth root for n numbers). Unfortunately, calculating a cube root in modular arithmetic is non-trivial.
