Calculate error for monthly exchange rates

I'm working on a project that will convert $USD to other currencies. The system will use average monthly exchange rates instead of daily because of pre-existing limitations. I need to calculate an estimate of the amount of error that will result from using monthly average. My idea is to Download historical daily exchange rates for several years Calculate the monthly average for each month Subtract the monthly average from each daily amount that month Find the standard deviation for the differences I would report the standard deviation as the expected error amount. Is this a valid approach?
