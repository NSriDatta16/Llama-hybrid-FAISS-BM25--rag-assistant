Oddly enough I have seen a null HttpRequest error (many many) times on a production server without ever being able to find out the cause. I know that is of no use to you whatsoever but am just writing out of solidarity :) One potential thing that I half remember was to do with IIS not mapping the root to /Default.aspx but again, this was all long ago so please don't pay too much attention to these potentialy unhelpful ramblings!!!
