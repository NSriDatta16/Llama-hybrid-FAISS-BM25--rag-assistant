It sounds to me like you're looking for pix2pix It is a GAN that is used for paired image translation. Some translations that have been successfully applied to pix2pix are sky view to map, night time to day time, and sketch of edges to real image. Simply trying to minimize the mean squared error between a predicted image output and a target image creates a lot of blur. The authors combined this loss with an adversarial loss (a GAN) to keep the images sharp.
