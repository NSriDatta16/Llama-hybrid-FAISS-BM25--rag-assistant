Contradiction between accuracy obtained from my pretrained conv base network and pretrained conv base network in Deep Learning with Python

I trained a pretrained convnet model on the cats and dogs dataset and the following are the accuracies obtained: Freezed Conv Base ~ 90% Unfreezed Conv Base ~ 96% However this is in contradiction to the accuracies listed in the book: Freezed Conv Base ~ 96% Unfreezed Conv Base ~ 90% The results are exactly opposite. What am I missing or the book's results are incorrect? Btw. I am using Keras 2.2.4.
