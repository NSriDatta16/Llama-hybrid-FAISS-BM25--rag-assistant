how do I make my rails 3 app handle exceptions when accessing remote data

in several places in my current code I do this (or something like it such as check for a file on Amazon S3): def success_flag = open(the_url, "UserAgent" => "Ruby-OpenURI").read ... do something else... return success_flag end if open() or read() fails for ANY reason I want to gracefully return false, not throw an exception. For example, if the app is running locally and there is no internet connection, I don't want the app to throw the "host unavailable" exception I assume I want to use a begin/do/rescue but I'm not sure how to do that, and in particular, I'm not sure if I need to separate the 'open' from the 'read' in order to be able to catch both errors. For example, if I keep open(url).read and the open is what fails, would the begin/do/rescue catch that, or will an exception still be thrown if 'open' fails because the begin/do/rescue applies only to the read?
