Find tracks that match group by length

can someone please come up with a solution to this problem, in programming language of choice (preferably Python, but anything could be fine I guess): I have various track length groups, let's say: 10:03 24:23 ... and source tracks themselves: 1:03 9:00 4:24 ... and I need to find pragmatically which tracks belongs to above length group. As in example first two tracks belong to first group as their sum length is equal to group length Thanks in advance edit: It's not my homework as that time is long gone (I'm over 30) but it's a problem I have, and I'm not a programmer. I'll have a look at itertools, thanks edit2: Thanks for you suggestions. I made Python script and if works fine and fast for me. It's sure not optimized, but here is skeleton: from itertools import combinations tracks = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] group = 7 d_key, valid_tracks, possible_group =0, [], {} for i in sorted(tracks): if i I'm glad I solved this, as tracking this by hand would take me more then my life-time, ha-ha
