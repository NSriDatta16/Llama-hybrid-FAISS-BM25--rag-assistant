how to enable drag of embed video object in browser (ie. YouTube videos)

How can I enable dragging of an object on a webpage (with javascript)? Normally, when I select some text or an image on a webpage, I am able to drag it around, and I want to do the same for the object. Specifically, I want to be able to drag a YouTube video. I'm not concerned about dropping for now, and also I don't want to use jQuery UI if at all possible. The YouTube embed looks like this I'm writing a browser extension (for Chrome), so I have full access to the DOM and the browser.
