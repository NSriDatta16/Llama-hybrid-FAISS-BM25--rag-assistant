Bayesian probability, verifying stupid examples

A wikipedia article on Bayesian inference offers an informal example in which a friend has had a baby, about which I know nothing more, and a (presumably reliable) mutual friend shows me a picture of the newborn. I want to check that I have formalized the problem correctly. (I am a computer scientist who uses statistics, not a statistician.) Many thanks for your patience, either in saying that I understand or in pointing out my misunderstanding. Mutual friend shows me a picture (evidence E) of the newborn boy. My hypothesis H is that the baby is a boy. $$ \Pr\,(H\mid E) = \frac{\Pr\,(E\mid H) \Pr\,(H)}{\Pr\,(E)} = \frac{(1)(.5 - \epsilon)}{.5} = 1 - 2 \epsilon $$ In other words, I may harbour the tiniest suspicion epsilon that mutual friend is wrong or playing a joke, but otherwise, I leave the conversation accepting that the baby is a boy. Mutual friend shows me a picture (evidence E) of the newborn dog. My hypothesis H is that the baby is a dog. $$ \Pr\,(H\mid E) = \frac{\Pr\,(E\mid H) \Pr\,(H)}{\Pr\,(E)} = \frac{(1)(0)}{\epsilon} = 0 $$ In other words, I believe a priori that the hypothesis is clearly false (humans don't give birth to dogs), so the posterior probability of H must be 0. I assign $\Pr\,(E)$ a positive value in part because maybe mutual friend is naive or confused but mostly because I don't want to divide by zero. Perhaps I could motivate that last better.
