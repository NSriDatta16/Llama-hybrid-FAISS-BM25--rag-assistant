C# Not Disposing controls like I told it to

I have a Panel control. And inside the panel users can add combobox's, textbox's labels etc and drag them around and stuff, and there's a Delete button on my form where if they click it, it will delete all controls inside that panel. BUT this code: foreach( Control control in panel.Controls ) { control.Dispose(); } ... Does not work properly. It doesn't always Dispose of ALL the controls inside the panel. Sometimes it gets rid of most of them, sometimes it only gets rid of one or two. Sometimes all but 1 are Disposed. WTF? EDIT: Here is the code I use to add the controls to the Panel: button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { TextBox tbox = new TextBox(); tbox.Multiline = true; tbox.IsAccessible = true; panel.Controls.Add(tbox); }
