Loss function for spam detection like problems

I am working on a deep learning problem where wrong classifications of fake events are not problematic, but where the opposite case is very problematic. I suppose this is similar to how spam detectors work. My question would be: how to choose a suitable penalty function with such problems? In my personal opinion logistic loss or cross entropy would not be optimal solutions here.
