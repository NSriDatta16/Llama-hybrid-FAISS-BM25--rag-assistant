I had a similar situation in an application I'm developing. There are a variety of ways of doing it; but in the end I stopped worrying about what exactly and how to best measure database integrity, and instead focused on 'is my database usable by my application'. So basically I test whether: 1) I can open the SQLite database properly 2) I can perform queries on the database and 3) Whether the result for a pre-defined query returns what is expected. So basically: include a table with a record of known ID that gives a value that you know, then try to read that value. Checking the table count can't hope. That said I'm hoping someone here with a good knowledge of DB systems will explain a) exactly what PRAGMA integrity_check does and b) how reliable it is and how efficient it is compared with manual table checks.
