Does PixelNovel count? PixelNovel is source control for Photoshop, and it looks like it's based on SVN. To be fair, it won't work outside of Photoshop and it seems to be a commercial product, but it has been done by someone, so I guess it's not too outrageous an idea. edit: 27/9/2015 it looks like PixelNovel went out of business
