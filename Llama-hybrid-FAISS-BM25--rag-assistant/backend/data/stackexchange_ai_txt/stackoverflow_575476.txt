Data is stored in order of the clustered key; if you are going to key retrievial of data by one of those fields it would be advantageous to use that assuming values aren't significantly fragmented, which can slow down insert performance. On the other hand, if this table is joined to a lot on the ID, it probably makes more sense to keep the clustered key on the PK.
