If I understand well the need is to reverse engineer sequence and class diagram from existing code which is currently shared by the team on SVN. You can not do reverse programmatically using a method because this is a lot more complex than just a method. You certainly have hundred of methods or more called for a basic reverse engineering option. The step to reverse engineer a Java code into an UML diagram is to: First map your code to a UML model: You can do it but just a drag and drop or by reversing the full project and then creating UML views from your model Once the UML project has been created you can share it directly on SVN with the other users if they use Eclipse, if they don't use Eclipse then you can export image of your sequence diagram using the image export option and copy this image inside your team project for documentation purposes.
