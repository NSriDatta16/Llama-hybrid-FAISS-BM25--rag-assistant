Been working with Infragistics stuff for awhile now. Usually I check out the samples to see what the controls can do, then when I need something specific, if I can't easily find it perusing with the object browser, then I simply ask their support. They are quick to respond and know their stuff like expected. You can also search their forums but I find it lacks content; maybe because most of their users prefer asking the support staff.
