INFORMIX-SE 7.1: Getting closer to a supported version (than 4.10, or 2.10), but still a decade and more out of support. Assume that col5 CHAR(5) will only contain numbers from 00001 to 99999: a CHAR(5) column uses 5 bytes of storage, how many bytes does an INTEGER use? Does a UNIQUE INDEX on an INT column perform faster than a CHAR(5)? Is SELECT MAX() on an INT column faster than MAX() on the col5 CHAR(5)? 4 bytes for INTEGER in the Informix DBMS. Marginally. Whether it is truly measurable is open to debate, but there is slightly less data to compare (one byte less), so there is less to do. Again, there is unlikely to be a measurable difference. If there's an index on the column, both operations simply access the index. If there is no index, then both operations end up reading the table (a table scan) and there is a minuscule penalty for dealing with 5 characters instead of 4 bytes.
