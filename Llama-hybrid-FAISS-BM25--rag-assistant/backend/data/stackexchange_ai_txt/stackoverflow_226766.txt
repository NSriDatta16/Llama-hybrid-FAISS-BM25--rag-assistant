http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision A double only has 64 bits of storage, and some of them are used for the sign and exponent, so there are a limited number of digits (usually 15) for the fractional part. A float has only 32 bits, so 8-9 digits of precision. Also some numbers cannot be represented exactly using a floating point number so you may see some rounding errors in your conversions.
