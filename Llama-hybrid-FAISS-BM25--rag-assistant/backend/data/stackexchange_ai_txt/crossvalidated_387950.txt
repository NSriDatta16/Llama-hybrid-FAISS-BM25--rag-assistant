Two predictor variables are partially related. How do I handle them before performing logistic regression

I have a predictor variable which has three levels (success, failure, nonexistent). For all nonexistent values another predictor variable value is 0 but success and failure could fall within a range of 1-7. eg:- > table(variable1) nonexistent failure success 20674 2752 956 >table(variable2) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 20674 2975 523 148 44 13 4 1 In the above scenario the value nonexistent and 0 provides the same information. When variable1 is nonexistent then variable2 will be 0. My first thought was to remove one variable (both variables have a low p value) however, if I remove one of the columns some information (either variable1(success, failure) or variable2(1:7)) will be lost. What is the best way to handle these two variables before I feed it into my logistic regression model? I am worried if I remove one of them then I lose information and if I keep both then I am flouting the no multicollinearity assumption. Is there a third way to handle the data?
