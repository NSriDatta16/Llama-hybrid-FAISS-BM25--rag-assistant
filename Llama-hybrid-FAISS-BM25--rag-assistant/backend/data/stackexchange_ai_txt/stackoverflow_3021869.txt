drag drop no longer working once application gets installed

I have an application that has drag and drop functionality to import images and video's. While developing, and testing through Visual Studio this has never given any problems. After installing through a set up project, everything in the application works fine, except the drag and drop, which seems to be doing nothing. Are there any security settings that need to be set through an installer, or something of that nature that could be preventing drag and drop after installation ?
