Here's how I was able to pull it off. First, get access to the file in Mutagen: audio = MP3("filename.mp3") Then, get a reference to the tag you're looking for: picturetag = audio.tags['APIC:Folder.jpg'] Then, modify the type attribute: picturetag.type = 3 Then, assign it back into the audio file, just to be sure audio.tags['APIC:Folder.jpg'] = picturetag Finally, save it! audio.save() And you're there! The APIC tag comes with its own class that sports everything you'd need to modify pictures and picture tagging info. Happy music organizing!
