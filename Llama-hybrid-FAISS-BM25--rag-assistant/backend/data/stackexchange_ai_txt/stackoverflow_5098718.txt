Read this tutorial http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html and this post http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/google-android/articles/64048.aspx Have a two dimensional arraylist, the first element containing the contact name and the second containing the image.After you read the images into a bitmap, save the bitmap in your contacts arraylist. Have a custom arrayAdapter which contains a textView and a imageView as its row elements, set the contact name and image in the getView() of the array adapter. Refer this post for custom listViews http://www.androidpeople.com/android-custom-listview-tutorial-example/ This should help you get going.
