Query to count words SQLite 3

Is there a way to count words in a text string? I'm using SQLite 3 and I'm trying to write a query that takes a bunch of long strings of text, and counts the number of words in each one. I also want to ignore html tags (or anything between carets) such as paragraph tags, break tags, etc. So when I run a query selecting text from the appropriate column, I get a large wordy text output with some html tags in it, and I just want to count the words. How can I write a query to do this?
