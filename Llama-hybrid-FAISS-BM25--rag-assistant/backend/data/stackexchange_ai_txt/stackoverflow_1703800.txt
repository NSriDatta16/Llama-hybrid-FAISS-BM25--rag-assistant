You might look into using transactions. In that way, you could create your table inside a transaction, do what you need with it and then roll it back in the end, i.e., avoid the final commit. That would also allow you to avoid ADO, which is required for disconnected recordsets. You would not want to create this table in your front or back end, even inside a transaction that is going to be rolled back, because it can lead to fragmentation and bloat (even though not as much as deleting data pages that have been committed). That is, while the data inside a not-yet-committed transaction is stored in a temp file and not in the destination database, there is surely a certain amount of overhead that is good to avoid. Thus, if I were doing the transaction I'd do it on a temp database so as to not in any way impinge on the production front end or back end.
