In neural networks model, which number of hidden units to select?

In the neural networks model, how many numbers of hidden units need to keep to get an optimal result, as per Cybenko theorem which demonstrates that only one hidden layer is sufficient to solve any regression/classification problem but the selection of the number of units in a hidden layer is very important because it impacts the model performance. Is there a theory to tell us how to choose the optimal number of units for a hidden layer ?
