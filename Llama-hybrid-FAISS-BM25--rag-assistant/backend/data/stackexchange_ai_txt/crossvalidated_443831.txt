Judging by the data that you present, it does not look like an inputation problem, but rather a prediction one. If I am not mistaken, you have a first representative dataset containing your target variable, and a second dataset where you want to insert it. This can be seen as a supervised learning problem (and indeed, LASSO is a supervised learning algorithm). You can use any algorithm for supervised classification, I suggest Random Forests given the balance between performance on structured data and ease of use, but anything you are comfortable with will do it. Also, you mention that you target variable is very "rare", which in a classification setting means you have unbalanced classes. Some algorithm implementations allow to take this into account by setting up a ratio between the classes, other approaches can be oversampling of the minority class or undersampling of the majority one (I don't suggest the last one unless you have a lot of data). Finally, try to score your model using a metric that is more sensitive to unbalanced data, such as pAUC. if you are interested, I suggest this paper on the use of Random Forests for unbalanced data. Reading the beginning can give you an idea of the approaches to deal with the unbalance.
