Here is what I use: echo "`git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null | cut -b 12-`-`git log --pretty=format:\"%h\" -1`" It produces something like: master-6de772e As noted by Aristotle, in actuality the SHA-1 by itself is all that is necessary and sufficient to provide an unambiguous build tag, as well as full information regarding the developmental historical context. Everything else is redundant, in the sense that any information they provide can be figured out or derived from the SHA-1. However, humans might like the supplementary contextual information of the actual branch immediately evident as well (or, at least, this human does), and hence the embedding of the branch name into the label. For this reason also (i.e. immediate human parsing of the information), most of my projects also use a longer build identity 'description' that includes the date and time of the commit that the build was based on in addition to the build identity 'label' given above.
