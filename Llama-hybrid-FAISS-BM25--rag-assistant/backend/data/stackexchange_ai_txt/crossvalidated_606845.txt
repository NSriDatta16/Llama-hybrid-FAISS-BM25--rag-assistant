Time series question from book (ma)

I'm trying to understand this subject and I'm stuck in a question found in a book. I understand white noise characterization, but I'm having some problems with this... maybe it's too much theory? I kind of get lost when I try to prove that also the new variable $Y$ is MA, and don't get me started on solving for the parameters. Maybe some hints on how to proceed or explain the steps I need to follow?
