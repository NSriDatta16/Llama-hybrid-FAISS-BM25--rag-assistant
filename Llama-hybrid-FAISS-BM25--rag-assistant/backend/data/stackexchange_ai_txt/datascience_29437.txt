Anomaly Detection from available sensor data set?

I am working on a live sensor data set and looking for abnormal patterns (leading to a machine fault condition) from the available data set. I am learning and new to the world of data science, but comfortable with Python. I have few questions that I am looking to get suggestions. What kind of algorithms would be best suited for this case? What are the basic steps for doing a predictive analysis in python? Please correct me if my questions are not correctly framed.
