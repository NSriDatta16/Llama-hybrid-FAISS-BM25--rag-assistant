Doing something on time intervals, but only when user is inactive

Possible Duplicate: Detecting idle time in JavaScript elegantly. I have a table with some rows that I want to refresh for example every 10 minutes. Is there a way I can do this, but only if the user isn't currently active on that page? Is there for example anything like an inactivity timer or something in JavaScript?
