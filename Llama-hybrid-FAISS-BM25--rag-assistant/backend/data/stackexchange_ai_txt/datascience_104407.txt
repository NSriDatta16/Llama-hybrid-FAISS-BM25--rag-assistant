Word classification

I have a task to classify the model of a product from its part number using machine learning. Part numbers can be of different lengths and forms and can contain both letters and numbers and also special characters in some cases e.x. 123-456, ABC123, A/B/123. Can anyone give some ideas on techniques for feature extraction? UPDATE To give some more context, this is a typical (synthetic) example data: Part Number : Model MM2 EAB111-444CDE MM2 HPP6KT4ECCBD8IQI HI-PROMANIFOLD 5142814 UFG E315 Cable Gland So in some cases a model is part of the part number, but in other cases the map is not trivial. As another feature I could included the supplier as well.
