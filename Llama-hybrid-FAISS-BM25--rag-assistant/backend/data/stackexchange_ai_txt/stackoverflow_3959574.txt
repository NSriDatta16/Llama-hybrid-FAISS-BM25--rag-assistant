WPF Hierarchial Treeview Multbinding Mixed List Problem

I'm having a tough time solving this simple issue : I am using a treeview with HierarichalDataTemplate to show an hierarchy of two entities : Organization and Unit . The Organization has a many to many relation with itself as it could have sub organizations. And each Organization has one to many relation with Unit, as an organization could contain several units. I am successfully using multibindings with observable collection to populate the tree. The converter is called in initialization, but i cant get it to be called again. So when i add any units or organizations, the list is not updated: Please help... Thanks
