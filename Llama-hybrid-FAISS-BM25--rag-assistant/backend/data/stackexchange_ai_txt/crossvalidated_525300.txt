PCA for dimension reduction on repeated measures

I have a dataset with 1000 individuals who each came in for a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 10 visits during which we measured their arm strength in various directions (forward, back, sideways etc.). I would like to do PCA to combine these various directions (10) into a single variable. My question is should I use the measurements from all the visits or perhaps just the baseline visit when doing the PCA? I am worried that using the measurements from all visits may bias the PCA results in favor of individuals who had more visits.
