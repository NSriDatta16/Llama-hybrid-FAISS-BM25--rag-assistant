Is it possible to include an interaction term in logistic model if the interaction term had no observation in some category?

I tried to do a binary logistic regression. y was a binary outcome x1 was an independent variable by 5 categories x2 was an independent variable by 2 categories I found that x1 and x2 had the interaction with each other. Some category in the interaction term 5x2 that had no observation. For example, I have total 1,767 observation. if x1=0, x2=0 ==> n=1,365 if x1=0, x2=1 ==> n=63 if x1=1, x2=0 ==> n=215 if x1=1, x2=1 ==> n=12 if x1=2, x2=0 ==> n=43 if x1=2, x2=1 ==> n=0 if x1=3, x2=0 ==> n=42 if x1=3, x2=1 ==> n=3 if x1=4, x2=0 ==> n=24 if x1=4, x2=1 ==> n=0 If this interaction term was significant in the model, Should I include this term in the model? I might have a problem to interpret the results if some category in the interaction term did not have odds ratio. Or I could interpret only remaining category and discuss about no observation in some crossover category.
