Android: save file to sdcard?

I am attempting to create a program that saves an mp3 to the Android, which can be accessed by ASTRO. I am attempting to save the file to /sdcard/media/audio. Despite the app going through without a single error on Logcat/DDMS, the file is nowhere to be found. I added the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission (along with Internet, etc.) so it's not that. Are there restrictions for apps saving files to the sdcard? Method called: public void findSong(View view) throws Exception { edittext = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.edittext); searchTerm = edittext.getText().toString(); String address; address = getMusic(searchTerm); ImageManager img = new ImageManager(); //calls ImageManager (below) img.DownloadFromUrl(address, title + ".mp3"); } The downloading method: private final String PATH = "/data/data"; //put the downloaded file here public void DownloadFromUrl(String imageURL, String fileName) { //this is the downloader method try { URL url = new URL(imageURL); //you can write here any link File file = new File(fileName); long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); Log.d("ImageManager", "download begining"); Log.d("ImageManager", "download url:" + url); Log.d("ImageManager", "downloaded file name:" + fileName); /* Open a connection to that URL. */ URLConnection ucon = url.openConnection(); /* Define InputStreams to read from the URLConnection. */ InputStream is = ucon.getInputStream(); BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(is); /* Read bytes to the Buffer until there is nothing more to read(-1). */ ByteArrayBuffer baf = new ByteArrayBuffer(50); int current = 0; while ((current = bis.read()) != -1) { baf.append((byte) current); } /* Convert the Bytes read to a String. */ FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(PATH + file); fos.write(baf.toByteArray()); fos.close(); Log.d("ImageManager", "download ready in" + ((System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime) / 1000) + " sec"); } catch (IOException e) { Log.d("ImageManager", "Error: " + e); } } Any help appreciated.
