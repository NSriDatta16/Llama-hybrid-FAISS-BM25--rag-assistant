Parsing xml and writing to another XML document is best done with JDOM. However, grouping and averaging is gonna be painful with JDOM. You could also use JAXB to create POJOs from the xml, then do your averaging and grouping on the POJO, and marshall it afterwards with JAXB back to XML. If the target XML has a different schema then the source XML, and conversion between the POJOs is required, use dozer .
