you'll notice that the variable $photographer_array is set to a single string (the value of which is everything between the double quotes). The array function in php accepts a list of objects delimited by commas. While there are commas in your $photographer_array variable, they are considered to be characters in the string rather than actual delimiters, so you're really just creating an array with only one value which happens to be a string. What you probably want is the following: $photographer_array = array('Alberto Korda', 'Annie Leibowitz', 'Ansel Adams');
