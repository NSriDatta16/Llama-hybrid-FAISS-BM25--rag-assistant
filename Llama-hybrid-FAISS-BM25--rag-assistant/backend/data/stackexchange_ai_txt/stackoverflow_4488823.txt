Move UIView with relation to touch

i'm trying to move a UIView with relation to the user's touches. Here's what I have at the moment: int oldX, oldY; BOOL dragging; - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(window.frame, touchLocation)) { dragging = YES; oldX = touchLocation.x; oldY = touchLocation.y; } } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(window.frame, touchLocation) && dragging) { CGRect frame; frame.origin.x = (window.frame.origin.x + touchLocation.x - oldX); frame.origin.y = (window.frame.origin.y + touchLocation.y - oldY); window.frame = frame; } } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { dragging = NO; } The view keeps flickering from one location to another, and I don't know what else to do. Any help appreciated.
