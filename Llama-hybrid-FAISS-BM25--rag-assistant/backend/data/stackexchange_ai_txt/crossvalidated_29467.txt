Kaelin Colclasure! Yes, you are right, PCA works in such a way, that if you have more samples of one person, it would more likely produce eigenfaces that would look like that person. However, if you use the same number of samples for every person, you would get eigenfaces for all of them with no prior. And in this case giving more samples would give you much stable eigenfaces and even get components to describe some specific features of the images. So I would advise to take as much samples of one person as you can, but balance the number of samples of every kind. And that applies not only for images of one person, but for man and woman, for example (if you want to deal with images of both men and women, of course).
