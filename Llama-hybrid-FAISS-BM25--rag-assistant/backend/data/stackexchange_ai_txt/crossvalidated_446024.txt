It is common to have to design a "fusion" module between two inputs (say an image, along with some scalar input). The "two-stream then fuse" approach you've suggested is pretty common. I don't know that there's an actual name for your "problem" (typically the concern is not that it's difficult to add one more input to an FC input layer, but rather that you can't easily combine one scalar with an image or with time-series data. Another common approach is an embedding layer (basically an $KxN$ linear layer, where $N$ is the dimension of your one-hot encoding, and $K$ is a much smaller value. Each distinct value of X1 is associated with a single $K$ -dimensional vector. Then simply concatenating on X2 may be much more feasible.
