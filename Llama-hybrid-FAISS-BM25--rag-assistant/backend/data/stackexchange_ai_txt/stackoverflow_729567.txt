Is Word a better document production tool? LaTeX (and TeX) have been around for longer than most of us realise that there were programmes to do that sort of thing and that we were interested in them. LaTeX is almost certainly better than Sphinx (or Word). Is it better for you? Maybe. Is it better for me? Unlikely. Is it better for the average person? Define 'average' then go to point 1.
