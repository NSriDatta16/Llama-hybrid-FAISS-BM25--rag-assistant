Using caret::sbf to apply feature selection where features are selected over different threshold scores

I'm aiming to use caret::sbf to filter a large number of predictors before using different machine learning models to predict a binary outcome. I would like to filter for variables that are identified as significant in at least 70% of LGOCV instances. However, I am unsure how to articulate this in the caretSBF score function. Below is an example of how it might work. svmSBF $summary score 70 data Any help would be greatly appreciated.
