The name should communicate what Business meaning of the data is in the column... "DateTime" is just the Type of the data. Is it when the event happened? when it was recorded? when it was stored in the DB? When the data was last modified? If it efficiently communicates the meaning of what the column contains, the name is fine. "DateTime" is not fine. "EventDateTime" is only very slightly better. If the table holds events, then any datetime field in the table is an EventDateTime (It records some datetime related to the event). Although if there's only one datetime column in an "Events" table, then EventDateTime implies that it's when the event happened, so that's probably ok. Choose or select the name so it communicates the meaning of the value... Given edited question, some suggested names might be: Occurred, or OccurredDateTime, or OccurredUTC, (or OccurredLocal), or, if events in your business model have duration, then perhaps StartedUtc, or BeganUtc, or InitiatedUtc, etc.
