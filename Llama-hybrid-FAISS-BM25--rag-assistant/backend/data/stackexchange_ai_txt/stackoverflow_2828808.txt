VS2010 + Resharper 5 performance issues

I have been using VS2010 with Resharper 5 for several weeks and am having a performance issue. Sometimes when typing, the cursor will lag and the keystrokes won't show instantaneously. Also, scrolling will lag at times. There is a forum thread started and JetBrains has been responding. Several people (including myself) have added their voice and uploaded some performance profiles. If anyone here has has this issue, I would encourage you to visit the thread and let JetBrains know about it. Has anyone had this problem and have a suggestion to restore performance?
