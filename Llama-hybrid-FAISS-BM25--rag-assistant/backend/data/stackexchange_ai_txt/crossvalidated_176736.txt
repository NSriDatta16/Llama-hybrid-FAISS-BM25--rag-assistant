How to include control variables in an Intervention analysis with ARIMA?

I want to conduct an Intervention Analysis using SPSS. Thereby, I want to find out if a specific regulation introduced in 2013 has an effect on leveraged loan volume. Thus, the dependent variable is the time series of leveraged loan volume from 2009 to 2015. However, I would like to control for three exogenous variables which are significantly correlated with leveraged loan volume. Leverage loan volume before and after introduction of the new regulation in May 2013: Then I used Log transformation to make the variance constant and removed the outlier in August 2011 using Winsorization. Afterwards, I just observed the pre intervention phase and used the Box Jenkins methodology fit the Arima model. My differenced and stationary series looks as follows for the pre intervention phase. After Identification, Estimation and Diagnostic check I found that Arima (3,1,0) is the best fit. Now Im ready for the Intervention analysis and as the new guidelines became effective in May 2013 I guess it is a abrupt permanent or abrupt gradual intervention. For the intervention I would use the step function and assign dummy variables 0 before intervention and 1 after intervention.
