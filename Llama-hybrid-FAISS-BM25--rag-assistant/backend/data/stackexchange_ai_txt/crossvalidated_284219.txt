Hints: The question is too vague as stated, in particular the difference between $X$ and $Y$ is not spelled out. There is no $y_i$ in your developed equations. It is unclear why you follow a maximisation path when the question does not mention MAP (maximum a posteriori). A more natural approach would be to seek the posterior mean (provided it is well-defined). Seeking directly the posterior distribution on $\mu$ is actually simpler. This is how the problem is processed in Bayesian textbooks (like ours ). What is the meaning of $-$ in $\Sigma_{\mu}^{-T}$?
