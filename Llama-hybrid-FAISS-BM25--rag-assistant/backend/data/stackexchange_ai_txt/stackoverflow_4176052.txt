IsolatedStorageFile.IncreaseQuotaTo is your friend. Also review the various methods on the IsolatedStorageFile class. See examples here (see " Sample on how to modify the quota? " section) and here . Update In the other hand, maybe try to increase the size of the setting file by setting addresses to external files instead of embedding them in the setting itself, for example, if you have a big xml file, just set the setting to its address and handle the event of the settings file (I assume it's a subclass of ApplicationSettingsBase ).
