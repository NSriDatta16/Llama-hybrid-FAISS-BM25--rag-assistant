Android Fragment Layout Help

I am interested in the way that gmail handles fragments and their transitions. I'm trying to do something somewhat similar and am running into an issue. Could someone give me a high level over view of how to accomplish this? start with ActivityA that has fragmentA that takes up the entire screen when a user clicks on an element in fragmentA I would like to have fragmentB and fragmentC replace A and fragmentC to expand to fill most of the window (basically a weight of 1) This seems like a simple thing, but I'm running into some problems. I don't need any advice on how to do the clicks or other things, but I would like some advice in how to lay it out correctly. Do I only use one activity? Am I hiding fragmentA and then adding fragmentB and fragmentC? Do I use a ViewSwitcher for the two cases and then just do a slide animation? Thanks!
