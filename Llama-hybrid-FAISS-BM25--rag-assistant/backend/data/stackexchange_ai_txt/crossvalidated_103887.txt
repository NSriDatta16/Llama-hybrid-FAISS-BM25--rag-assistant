Margins Margins here refers to the values on the edges (margins!) of the table, that is, the total number of reds, total number of blacks, total number of drawn, and total number of not drawn. The related term marginal distribution refers to the distribution of a single variable obtained from a joint distribution of several variables by averaging over the other variables (etymologically, the term indeed comes from the values written on the margins of tables). Conditioning Conditioning refers to computing conditional distributions , that is, probability distributions given some information. Here, conditioning on the margins means that the margins are fixed, i.e., we assume that there are in total 6680 red balls (and 12160 black balls), as well as 382 drawn balls (and 18458 balls not drawn). So that, for example Drawn Not drawn Total Red 200 6480 6680 Black 182 11978 12160 Total 382 18458 18840 would be a possible realization of our random distribution (the margins are the same). Under the null hypothesis that getting drawn and the color of the ball are independent, conditioning on the margins leads to the hypergeometric distribution. Alternatively, if the experiment were such that one draws balls until 160 reds are obtained, it would not make sense to condition on the margins (as the total number of drawn balls could have turned out something else than 382). In this case, one could obtain realizations like Drawn Not drawn Total Red 160 6520 6680 Black 182 11978 12160 Total 342 18498 18840 which would have different margins.
