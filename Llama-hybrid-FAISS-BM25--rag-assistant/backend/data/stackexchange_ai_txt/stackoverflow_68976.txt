Anyone know of a scratch like program construction UI framework?

I quite like the drag and drop pluggable programming blocks in scratch ( http://scratch.mit.edu/ ) I'd like to be able to get users to create their own mini scripts using the same kind of technique... just wondering if anyone knows of anything similar I could utilise in .NET? ideally in WPF.
