I'm working with a webdav server and had a similar issue. I found a solution within the sample code for apple's AdvancedURLConnection's project. It appears that the secret is to iterate over the protection spaces and then the credentials for each space. It's probably needlessly over complex but it works for me. NSURLCredentialStorage *store = [NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage]; assert(store != nil); for (NSURLProtectionSpace *protectionSpace in [store allCredentials]) { NSDictionary *userToCredentialMap = [[NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage] credentialsForProtectionSpace:protectionSpace]; assert(userToCredentialMap != nil); for (NSString *user in userToCredentialMap) { NSURLCredential *credential = [userToCredentialMap objectForKey:user]; assert(credential != nil); [store removeCredential:credential forProtectionSpace:protectionSpace]; } }
