You should complete your function with return statement since its return type is not void. Also, you should change your return type to int[] since your return an array of ints, not just one int: static int[] ReadInNum(int readIn) { int[] readInn = new int[5]; for (int i = 0; i You should also change your main function in order to get the result of the function ReadInNum. It seems to me that you don't really use the parameter so you can remove it, if you don't have special attention: static void Main() { int j; int[] i = ReadInNum(j); for (int a = 0; a
