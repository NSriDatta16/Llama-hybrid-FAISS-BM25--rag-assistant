I have my doubts that you will be able to find anything of value from this data, because it involves market data, which is very chaotic and involves... people, which all have unknown motivations. However you should still try, you never know. To summarize your question and comments: end companies will need some amount of a certain product brokers predict how much of a product end companies will need before they know it and place an order on their "behalf" (because they get a discount) to companies which produce said product the brokers inevitably make a mistake with their predictions and only order a portion of the initial order (because they can, since it is not a binding contract, or rather you do not want to enforce it) the company which produces the aforementioned product suffers because of this you would like to predict the actual amount that the broker will eventually buy, while taking into account the fact that: the broker might be making bad predictions about how much of a product an end company will need the broker might place a higher than necessary order just to get a bigger discount (or maybe doesn't like the producing company) the end company might not actually need said amount of product the end company might not like this particular broker and obtain the product elsewhere who knows what other shenanigans are happening behind closed doors Whatever the case, in it's simplest form you can try to figure out if there is any pattern in the brokers or end companies behavior. You could try a classification model, by turning your dependent variable into a binary variable (1 for more than half the order, 0 else), or even better you could try modelling the actual numbers (or ratios). If you have your data into a standard format for regression such as Actually Sold Initial Order Broker End Company 100 500 A A 200 400 A B 100 600 B A ... you could try your luck with any of the standard models, such as linear regression, to try and figure out if maybe there is an issue with the brokers, end companies, or both. In this case you would try to predict "Actual" based on the other variables. Of course if you have any other variables which might help in figuring this out you can definitely include them. Alternatively you could try your luck with classification (predicting 1 or 0), if your data is in the format Outcome Initial Order Broker End Company 1 500 A A 0 400 A B 1 600 B A ... and try to predict the probability of 1 or 0 occurring (the probability of a successful transaction or not), for ex. using logistic regression.
