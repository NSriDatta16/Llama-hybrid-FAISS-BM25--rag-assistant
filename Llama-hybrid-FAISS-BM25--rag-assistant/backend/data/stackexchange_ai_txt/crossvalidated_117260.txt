Which kind of mean (harmonic, geometric, arithmetic) is best suited for averaging probability ratios?

There are a bunch of examples around on how harmonic mean is more suitable for averaging rates, e.g. speed (when the distance is fixed). But what about probability ratios (p(A)/p(B), i.e. how much more probable event A is compared to event B)? If it makes any difference: In my model those ratios are always bigger than 1. Most are between 1 and 10, but in some cases the ratio is in the neighborhood of 1E+20.
