This seems a little strange. Why don't you start with that tab selected? I don't think you can do that with stylesheets. You can easily customize first and last but not any tab (AFAIK) http://doc.qt.io/archives/4.6/stylesheet-reference.html On the other hand you can set custom icon to draw attention or use void QTabBar::setTabTextColor ( int index, const QColor & color )
