How to ask UIImageView if MultipleTouchEnabled is "YES"

I have created a few UIImageViews programmatically, but I have a feeling that even though I setMultipleTouchEnabled to YES during the setup, it is not getting set properly and it's leading to multi-touch issues. My question is, within touchesBegan how do I go about asking the UIImageView that was touched if it has MultipleTouchEnabled or not? I am fairly new to this so I'm really stumbling through code and learning as I go (with your help of course). Thank you ahead of time!
