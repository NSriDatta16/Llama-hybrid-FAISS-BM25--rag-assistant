No, you can't do regular repeated Cross Validation in time series data. For time series data you might be looking for time series split such as in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html . BTW, if you have a structural break in your data such as covid, or you can add external data in order to account something like this such as train your data in another crisis event such as subprime one. But overall if your test set is really different from your train set isn't likely that any machine learning algorithm will work.
