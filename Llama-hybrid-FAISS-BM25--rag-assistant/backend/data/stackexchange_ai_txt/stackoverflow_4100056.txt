We have resolved recently a very similar customization with the attendees of my trainings. If you want to add custom sorting option to Magento Admin you need to override Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Product_Collection::addAttributeToSort method for adding your custom sorting option logic. In your case it is joining of category name attribute to product collection select. Then you should override Mage_Catalog_Model_Config::getAttributeUsedForSortByArray method to add your custom sorting option to the dropdown on category view page. But you don't need to do all of these steps if your custom sorting options is just an product attribute. In this case you need set value of used_for_sort_by property in your attribute to 1.
