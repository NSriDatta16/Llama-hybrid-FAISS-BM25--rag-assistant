Each conversion specifier expects its corresponding argument to be of a specific type; if the argument's type does not match the expected type, then the behavior is undefined. If you want to read into a long with scanf() , you need to use the %ld conversion specifier: long i; scanf("%ld", &i); Check the online draft C standard (.pdf file), section 7.19.6.2, paragraph 11 for a complete listing of size modifiers and expected types.
