Command line Update of Provisioning Profiles

I couldn't find anything on this (maybe I'm just using the wrong search terms..): We're trying to build a sensible continuous integration setting for our apps. To have a REALLY sensible implementation, the build server should be able to automatically refresh the used provisioning profiles from apple. Similar to what the X-Code organizer does, but automagically via command line. Any clue if that's possible at all?
