A random variable is a measurable function $\Omega\to X$ where $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes and $X$ is a measurable space. Simply put, a random variable gives a value to each outcome where an outcome might be a temperature reading, a win or loss, or the distance a runner can jump. Example: Consider a coin toss where the possible outcome is heads or tails. We can make a random variable with these outcomes such that heads $= 1$ and tails $= 0$. Assuming the coin is fair the probability of that $\mathbb{P}(X=1)=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\mathbb{P}(X=0)=\frac{1}{2}$. Now what if we have something like temperature readings? In this case we can simply map each outcome (the temperature reading) to be that same value. Therefore if the outcome is 76 degrees Fahrenheit the value of the random variable is 76. In the context of machine learning $X$ can be a random variable where the number of dimensions $k$ equals the number of features. An example of a $k$ dimensional random variable is a $k$ dimensional Gaussian distribution. More concretely when $k=2$ we have a bell "hump" instead of a bell curve, where the height of the hump is the probability of two features having values $(x_1, x_2)$. Relating this back to a real world example $x_1$ might be 76 for temperature and $x_2$ might be $0.8$ for humidity. By the way if you are learning machine learning for the first time I suggest getting a good undergraduate text on probability to supplement your studies. Most machine learning techniques build on classical probability and statistics. Unfortunately I don't have a favorite. If you have studied measure theory I have some suggestions for more advanced texts.
