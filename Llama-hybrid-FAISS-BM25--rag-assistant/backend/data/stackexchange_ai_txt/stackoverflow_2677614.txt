Although you explicitly stated you don't want them in the repository, your reasons are not justified. Here's my suggestion: install these jars in your repostory add them as maven dependencies, with provided . This means that they are provided by your runtime (the application server) and will not be included in your artifacts (war/ear) Check this similar question It is advisable that an organization that's using maven extensively has its own repository. You can see Nexus . Then you can install these jars in your repository and all developers will use them, rather than having the jars in each local repository only. (The "ugliest" option would be not to use maven at all, put put the jars on a relative location and add them to the classpath of the project, submitting the classpath properties file (depending on the IDE))
