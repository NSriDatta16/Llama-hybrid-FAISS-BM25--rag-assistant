The question is not really what goes into what file, but rather how to implement your objects or classes in relation to one another. If several windows share the same structure or share a type of controls, you can definitely create a base class for those windows, same goes for the controls. There's nothing particularly difficult about a component you can drag or about a common set of controls. Gregor Kiddie has a point though, why don't you check some Flex tutorials?
