what are your favorite WPF controls?

So I've been developing in WPF on and off for a little while, and so far labored at making my controls look and behave sleek and intuitively from scratch. The only control suite I've checked out were Infragistics. What are some cool/sleek/useful/time saving WPF controls you've come across of?
