XGBoost with catigorical (nominal) features

I have several numeric features and two catigorical features. The catigorical features have no order (nominal), they are for example colors ; red, blue, yellow, green... and place of birth ; USA, Spain, Germany. The target feature is binary catigorical which can be easily converted to numeric with 1 and 0. How can XGBoost handle those catigorical features? should I switch from catigorical to numeric? If so, how? I mean, can red, blue, yellow.. become 1, 2, 3 ? will that affect the information provided by that feature column in any way?
