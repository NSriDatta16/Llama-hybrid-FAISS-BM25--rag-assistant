I think the average age to attain GM title will continue to decrease due to the ratings inflation (discussed in chessbase.com) and other factors such as the increase in number of players who are awarded the title and perhaps even the Flynn effect . However, I do expect that the mean decrease to bottom out at some point as you aren't just born a GM. It requires some minimum amount of deliberate practice and I will go with the 10,000 hour rule as a guess. The year 1950 was when the GM title was first awarded to 27 players who were regarded as the best in the world at the time and were probably GM strength for decades before they were granted the title. Last I recall the GM title requires a minimum rating of 2500 ELO and requires scoring 3 GM norms by attaining required performance levels in FIDE sanctioned tournaments in games against other GMs. If there are more GMs there are greater opportunities to score such norms. It was much harder in the past to find tournaments in the US to obtain such norms. Other ways to get a GM title are to win certain national events and international events (for youngsters) such as the World Junior Open. Wikipedia has the list of grandmasters as of November 2016. Per the "simple approach" I calculated the mean per year and here is a graph showing average age of GMs by year as well as the number of GM titles awarded that year. For the last 5 years: Year Mean Age ----- --------- 2011: 23.786885 2012: 25.925000 2013: 23.086207 2014: 25.250000 2015: 22.194444
