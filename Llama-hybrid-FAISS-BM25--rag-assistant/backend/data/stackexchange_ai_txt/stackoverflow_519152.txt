This kind of template meta programming works well when you're dealing with primitive data types like int s and float s. If you necessarily need a string object, you can't avoid calling the std::string constructor and there's no way that call can happen at compile time. Also, I don't think you can drag the cast to char to compile time either, which, in all, means that templates cannot help you here.
