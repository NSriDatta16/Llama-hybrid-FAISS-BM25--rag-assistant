I hope someone can give you a div/css based solution. But in order to deal with the varying image widths, I think that you will need one of these four things: inline styles created manually (as you have now) inline styles created in server-side code width of text blocks adjusted with javascript single-row table for each image-and-text block Perhaps it is just a failure of my imagination, but I don't see that this layout can be done without setting specific paragraph widths somehow, or using a single-row table for each block.
