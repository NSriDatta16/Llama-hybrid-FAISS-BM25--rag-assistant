Another option is LXML , which provides useful extensions to the built in ElementTree api. If you're willing to install an external module, it has a nice Element.getparent() function that you could simply call recursively until reaching ElementTree.getroot() . This will probably be the fastest and most elegant solution (as the lxml.etree module introduces pointer attributes for the Elements that point to their parents, so instead of searching the entire tree for the proper parent/child pairs).
