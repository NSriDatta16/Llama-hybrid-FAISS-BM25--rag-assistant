Yes, it is possible to use any arbitrary distribution to get a p-value for any statistic . Theoretically and practically you can calculate (one-sided) p-value by this formula. $$\mathrm{p-value} = P[T > T_{observed} | H_0 \quad \mathrm{holds}]$$ Where $T$ is the test-statistic of interest and $T_{observed}$ is the value that you have calculated for the observed data. If you know the theoretical distribution of $T$ under $H_0$, great! Otherwise, you can use MCMC simulation to generate from the null distribution of $T$ and calculate the Monte Carlo integral to obtain p-value . Numerical integration techniques will also work in case you don't want to use (may be) easier Monte Carlo methods (especially in R; in Mathematica integration may be easier, but I have no experience using it) The only assumption you are making here is -- you know the null distribution of T (which may not be in the standard R random number generator formats). That's it -- as long as you know the null distribution, p-value can be calculated.
