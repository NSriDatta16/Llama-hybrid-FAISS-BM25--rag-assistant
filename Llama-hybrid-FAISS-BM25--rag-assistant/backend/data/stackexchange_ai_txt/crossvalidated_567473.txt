In most time series analysis, there are two frequencies of interest. One is the sampling frequency $f_s.$ This is defined as how often you take a sample: once a year, once a day, one a minute, once every nanosecond, etc. The other frequency of importance is the frequency of whatever the phenomenon is that you're trying to capture. This could be extremely high frequency, on the order of GHz, for radio frequency investigations, or it could be more on the order of Hz for temperature-based phenomena. Let us call this phenomenon frequency $f_p.$ Now the Nyquist criterion says that you must sample at least twice the frequency of your phenomenon: $f_s>2f_p.$ However, in practice, I recommend $10$ times the frequency: $f_s=10f_p.$ You will generally get better results that way - much less likely to get aliasing, for example. In summary: Ask yourself how fast the phenomenon you want to capture is occurring. This is the frequency $f_p.$ Set your sampling frequency equal to $f_s=10f_p.$ In terms of your example, the frequency you need to enter into your R code is undoubtedly $f_s,$ but hopefully this explanation will show you how to come up with that frequency.
