Operator Theoretic Perspectives on Bayesian Inference

On the Wikipedia page for conjugate prior there is a section "Analogy with Eigenfunctions" , which describes a metaphor where observation of data is seen as a "linear operator" on the space of probability distributions, with conjugate priors as an eigenvector. Unfortunately, this section has no inline citations. Does anyone know of any good references on the subject?
