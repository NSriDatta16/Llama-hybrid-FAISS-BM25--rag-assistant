The old ADO.Net (sqlConnection, etc.) is a dinosaur with the advent of LINQ. LINQ requires .Net 3.5, but is backwards compatible with all .Net 2.0+ and Visual Studio 2005, etc. To start with linq is ridiculously easy. Add a new item to your project, a linq-to-sql file, this will be placed in your App_Code folder (for this example, we'll call it example.dbml ) from your server explorer, drag a table from your database into the dbml (the table will be named items in this example) save the dbml file You now have built a few classes. You built the exampleDataContext class, which is your linq initializer, and you built the item class which is a class for objects in the items table. This is all done automatically and you don't need to worry about it. Now say I want to get record with the itemID of 3, this is all I need to do: exampleDataContext db = new exampleDataContext(); // initializes your linq-to-sql item item_I_want = (from i in db.items where i.itemID == 3 select i).First(); // using the 'item' class your dbml made And that's all it takes. Now you have a new item named item_I_want ... now, if you want some information from the item you just call it like this: int intID = item_I_want.itemID; string itemName = item_I_want.name; Linq is very simple to use! And this is just the tip of the iceberg. No need to learn antiquated ADO when you have a more powerful, easier tool at your disposal :)
