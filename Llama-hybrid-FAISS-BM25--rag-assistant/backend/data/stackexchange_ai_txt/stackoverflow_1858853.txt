JavaScript ( not JScript) has no concept of file names. It was developed for Netscape back in the days. Therefore there is no __file__ feature or anything similar. The closest you can come are these two possibilities: What you already mentioned: Harvest all src attributes of all JS files and try to figure out which one is the right. Make it a necessary option, that the path to the images must be set in the embedding HTML file. If not set, use a reasonable and well-documented default: var options = { 'path_to_images': '/static/images/' // defaults to '/js/img/' };
