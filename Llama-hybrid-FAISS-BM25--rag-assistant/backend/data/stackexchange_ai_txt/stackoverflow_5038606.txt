Yes. It is a common practice in Java (at least, the source code I've looked at for big projects has almost always been structured this way). Not as common in C# from what I've seen, but there's nothing keeping you from doing it, and it helps you find the code a lot faster. You'll probably want a deeper namespace hierarchy than just one level though. It is common to preface it with your organization or group name, the project name, the library/program name, then code architectural names (like Model, View, Data, etc). Whatever makes the most sense for whatever scope the source code of your project will live.
