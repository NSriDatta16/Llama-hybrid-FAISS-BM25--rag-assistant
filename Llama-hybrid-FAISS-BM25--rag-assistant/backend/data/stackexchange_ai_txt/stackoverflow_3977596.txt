How to make s in HTML5 draggable for Firefox?

I am playing around with the HTML5 features, and I want div's (and similar containers like articles, sections, etc.) to be draggable. Consider the following code: A Simple Draggable Object Test #1: A Simple Draggable Object This text should be draggable. I tested in OS X the following browsers: In Chrome 7.0 and Safari 5.0.2 I can successfully drag the text around, but in Firefox 3.6 and 4.0b6 I can neither drag the text nor mark it (as if it was usual text). Is this a bug or a feature? How do I achieve that Firefox lets me drag around these tags without using jQuery ?
