Steps: 1) Assume one point from each cluster as a representative object of that cluster. 2) Find distance(Manhattan or Euclidean) of each object from these 2. You have been given these distances so skip this step. 3) select the points with minimum distance for each cluster wrt to selected objects, i.e. create 2 new clusters with objects having least distance to the above 2 points. 4) take the average of the minimum distances for each point wrt to its cluster representative object. 5) Select 2 new objects as representative objects and repeat steps 2-4. 6) calculate swapping cost. subtract old avg from new avg. New-old. 7) If swapping cost is negative then then new mediods are the new objects and go to step 5. 8) if cost is more than 0, discard points and select new points in step 5 keeping original points. 9) repeat until convergence.
