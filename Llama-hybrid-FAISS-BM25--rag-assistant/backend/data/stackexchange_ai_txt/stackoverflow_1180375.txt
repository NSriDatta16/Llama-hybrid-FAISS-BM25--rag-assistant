Use the HTTP_USER_AGENT string to detect the browser, like everyone else has mentioned. Here is an example of what it will look like: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.1 Safari/532.0. Just record the values for various browsers, and then check for keywords like Chrome.
