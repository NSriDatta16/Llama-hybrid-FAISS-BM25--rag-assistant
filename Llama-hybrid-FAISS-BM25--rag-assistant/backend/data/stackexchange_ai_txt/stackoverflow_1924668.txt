So as you can see, I imported the exception classes from the base class into the derived class, then again from the derived class into the program. You did not, and cannot, import exceptions (or anything) from classes and into classes. You import things from modules and (usually) into modules. (usually, because you can put import statements in any scope, but it is not recommended) This seems to work ok, but is not very elegant, and I'm worried about having to make sure and do an import in the derived class module for all the Exception classes. It seems like it would be easy to forget one when creating a new derived class. Then a user of the derived class would get an error if they tried to use it. There is no reason the module of the derived class would need to import all the exceptions from the base classes. If you want to make it easy for client code to know where to import exceptions from, just put all your exception in a separate module named "errors" or "exceptions", that's a common idiom in Python. Also, if you have trouble managing your namespace of exceptions, maybe your are being too fine-grained with your exceptions, and you could do with fewer exception classes.
