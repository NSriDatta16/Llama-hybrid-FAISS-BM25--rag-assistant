I work on PyMongo, the MongoDB Python driver, and haven't heard of any project to provide custom storage for Django using GridFS. This looks like it wouldn't be very hard to write on top of PyMongo: could probably be a direct translation of the GridFS API onto the Django storage API . Maybe could take a look at throwing something together at some point, but this would be a great open-source project for anybody looking to get involved.
