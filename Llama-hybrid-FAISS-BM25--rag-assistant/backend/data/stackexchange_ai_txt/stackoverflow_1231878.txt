Jquery ajax calls in ASP.NET webservice vs page method

I am making an AJAX call in my ASP.NET application via Jquery to a page method. $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "APage.aspx/GetDropDowns", data: "{'AId':'1'}", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json", success: function(msg) { alert(msg.d); }, error: function() { alert('Error '); } [System.Web.Services.WebMethod] public static string GetDropDowns(string Id) { return "Id was: " + Id; } I remember from using ASP.NET AJAX that the use of webservices was encouraged as opposed to page methods. However if I am enforcing JSON as above and doing a post is there A) any security flaw with the above and B) any reason to use a webservice rather than the page method
