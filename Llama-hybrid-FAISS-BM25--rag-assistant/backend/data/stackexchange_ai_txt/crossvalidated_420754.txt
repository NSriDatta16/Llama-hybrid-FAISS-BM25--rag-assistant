Data is Latin for given , that is used in modern times as a shorthand for given set of recorded facts . So in a way referring to fabricated recordings as some sort of given facts would be an open contradiction. However, due to the increasing use of data to refer simply to recordings - regardless of the original presumption of records being of facts - we happily understand each other when talking about recordings that may or may not be truthful - hence real/fake data. I will summarise my experience of ways to address fabricated recordings below. The label used depends whether one is assuming that we are talking of data as fabricated recordings that are intended to look reasonably realistic to enable further analysis, or data as a computational load. In analytics/data science/strategic consultancies circles, people address most frequently a fabricated set of recordings generated under realistic assumptions as synthetic data - and occasionally simulated data . Fabricated recordings created using crude assumptions are referred to as toy dataset . Among software engineers, fake data , dummy data , made-up data and mock-up data are frequent labels that mainly hint to recordings not necessarily meant to have realistic properties, but only share basic properties with the original data (age data is always numerical, email addresses always strings that contain “@“). Academic researchers would refer to a realistic set of fabricated recordings as pseudo-data , or simulated data . In some circles, if the fabricated set of observations is the result of a Monte Carlo simulation, it may be referred to colloquially as Monte Carlo . Semi-realistic recordings are commonly used for illustrative purpose or testing alternate hypotheses, and referred to as toy dataset
