COOLSerdash is right that only the residuals need to be normally distributed. However, When the $Y$ is skewed, the residuals will often be skewed in the same direction. So look at the residual plot before doing any transformations. For right skewed distributions like this one, you can use a $\log_{10}(x), 1/x$, or $\sqrt{x}$ transformation. You probably don't want to use logistic regression, especially if you have covariates as you will not be able to use them.
