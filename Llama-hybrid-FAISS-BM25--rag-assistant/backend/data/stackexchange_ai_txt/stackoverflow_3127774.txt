XML and JSON are actually used primarily to transmit data between processes or systems. I have seen applications that use XML as a database. If you're going to do this, you'll have to break your data down into very distinct, small units that can each be stored in a separate file. Overall, in my opinion and experience, if performance is your primary concern, file-based data storage in XML or JSON will almost never perform remotely close to an actual SQL relational database platform unless your dataset is extremely tiny.
