Available options for compiling a large ASP .NET application

I've started working on an existing, large ASP.NET project and I'd love to get some feedback on better ways to organize the project as a whole. This question was somewhat related but doesn't really have enough specific details to help an ASP.NET newbie like me. The site isn't terribly complicated. There a number of themes that can be applied to give the user different styles & functionality and most of the common elements between themes are placed in UserControls. The problem is that, when the project is compiled, the whole thing gets built into a single, massive DLL. That means that making changes across a number of UserControls and then rolling out those changes a few at time is incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Unfortunately, we have to assume Visual Studio 2003 and .NET 1.1. Like I said, I'm an ASP.NET newbie so be gentle. Is there a way to do things differently so that maybe each UserControl is its own separate DLL? Are there other things I could change to make it easier to push out changes in small batches?
