If a random variable $X$ comes from a population having (say) a normal distribution, that is its pdf (probability density function) is that of normal distribution, with a population average $\mu=3$ and population variance $\sigma^2=4$ (the numbers are hypothetical and are just for your understanding and to simplify comparisons) we can describe it as follows: $X \sim N(3 , 4)$. Now if we have another random variable $Y$ which is also normally distributed and which is $Y \sim N(3, 4)$ then $X$ and $Y$ are identically distributed. Nevertheless, being identically distributed does not necessarily imply independence.
