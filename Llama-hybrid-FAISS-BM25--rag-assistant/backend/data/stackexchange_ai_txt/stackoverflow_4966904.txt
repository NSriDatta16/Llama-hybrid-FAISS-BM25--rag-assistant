Approaches for reversing sprintf/format

I have to heuristically determine the format pattern strings by analyzing the formatted results. For example I have these strings: You have 3 unread messages. You have 10 unread messages. I'm sorry, Dave . I'm afraid I can't do that. I'm sorry, Frank . I'm afraid I can't do that. This statement is false. I want to derive these format strings: You have %s unread messages I'm sorry, %s . I'm afraid I can't do that. This statement is false. Which approaches and/or algorithms could help me here? My first thought was using machine learning stuff, but my guts tell me this could be a rather classic problem. Some additional requirements: The type of the parameter is irrelevant, i.e. I don't need the information if the parameter originally was %s or %d or if it was padded or aligned. There can be more than one parameter (or none at all) Typically the data consists of thousands of formatted strings, but only tens of format patterns.
