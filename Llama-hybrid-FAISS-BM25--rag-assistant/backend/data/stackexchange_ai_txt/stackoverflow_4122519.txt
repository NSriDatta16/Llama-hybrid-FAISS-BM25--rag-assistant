C# Application - Reduce CPU Usage

I have a multithreaded C# application, where the core logic sits in a Timer.Elapsed event handler. The event handler contains 2 for loops which executes a maximum of n * n = 5 * 5 = 25 times . The application performs well on my PC. I ran VS 2010 Profiler against the application and CPU usage averages at 20% . The company tester says that on his PC this jumps to between 50% and 100% on his PC. This is causing a performance issues for him. Is there anything i can do to remedy this? What does high CPU usage really mean? Could this be impacting his PC? Is it possible to tell an application to utilize only X amount of the CPU? Any help would be appreciated.
