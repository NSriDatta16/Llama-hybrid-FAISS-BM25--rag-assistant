Does the pattern where you chain methods in your object by returning a reference to itself have a name?

In most modern OO languages chaining methods together is common, and IMHO elegant, practice. In jquery, for example, you often see code like: $('div').addClass('container').css('color', 'white').length Does writing your objects to allow this have a name?
