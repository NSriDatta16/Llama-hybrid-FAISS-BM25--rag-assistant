You have a tiny sample. With 3 samples your tests would be underpowered even if your data would not be constant. To convince yourself, here's an example that uses a one-sample $t$ -test with $H_1$ that $\mu > 0$ for three samples drawn from Gaussian distribution with $\mu=1$ > mean(replicate(5000, t.test(rnorm(3, 1), alternative="greater")$p.value) As you can see, the test was non-significant (at 0.05 level) in 70% of cases. The test to work needs to have a notion of the variability of your data. It learns it from the data. If your sample is constant, there are two possibilities, either the variance is zero and in such case the answer is trivial, or it can be anything higher than zero, but we have no way of knowing. Unless you would know what the variability is, statistical methods could fail. If you have three samples, honestly the best you can do is a descriptive summary "all the three observations were zeros" and let the readers decide what they take from it. For a statistical solution, you need more data. Finally, if you can come up with a reasonable, informative prior, you could use a Bayesian approach where the prior would drag the estimate for the variance away from zero. But again, you have only three samples, a descriptive summary probably makes more sense. With the Bayesian approach, here the result would tell more about your choice of the prior than the data. (So it boils down to if you know the variance .)
