Confused on the interpretation of regression coefficients

Let's suppose we have the following regression model: $$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1D_i+\beta_2D_iX_i+\epsilon_i$$ where $Y_i$ represents the test score of the i-th student, $D_i$ is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the student's family is an immigrant and 0 otherwise, and $X_i$ is also a dummy variable that takes 1 if the student's father has an above average income. Now if I were to describe what the coefficients $B_0,B_1,B_2$ mean how would I go about doing that? I believe $B_0$ is simply the slope. $B_1$ is the change in the mean test score ($Y_i$) when comparing a family who is an immigrant with a non-immigrant. $B_2$ is a bit more difficult. The answers I have here are that $B_2$ is just the effect of father's income on immigrant students' average test score. I'm a bit confused as to how to correctly interpret these coefficients (especially when there is interaction) and help would be greatly appreciated! $\bf{EDIT}$: Here is an original picture of the question since it appears as though my professor's model is a bit out of the ordinary.
