For the tags: Do you know how they are generated? How many unique tags do you have? If they are self-generated (ie lots of tags that can be subsets of other tags). You might need to do tag consolidation which will also help with dimensionality reduction of the word vectors. If you can provide a bit more information about what your data looks like and where it comes from, I can perhaps provide a more in depth answer. For the text: You might want to try using word embeddings. You can use a pre-trained word2vec model. I am not sure if it makes sense to use two different distance metrics. Your categorical data looks like its integers, is it ordinal, or are those indexes?
