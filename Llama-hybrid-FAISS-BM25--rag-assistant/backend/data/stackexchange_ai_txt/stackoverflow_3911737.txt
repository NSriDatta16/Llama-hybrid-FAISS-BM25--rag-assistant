Calling a SOAP web service with a complex data type using PHP

I'm trying to write PHP to call a web service. Using SoapUI, I construct the following call to the service, which works: myPwd myUsername 1.0 wnp I'm using the following PHP to call the same service: array( 'password' => 'myPwd', 'userName' => 'myUsername', 'version' => '1.0' ), 'applicationName' => 'wnp' ); $login_results = $client->__soapcall('login', $auth_array); ?> When I make the call, I'm getting an error back "Parsing WSDL: Couldn't find ". The provider of the web service has been less than helpful, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!
