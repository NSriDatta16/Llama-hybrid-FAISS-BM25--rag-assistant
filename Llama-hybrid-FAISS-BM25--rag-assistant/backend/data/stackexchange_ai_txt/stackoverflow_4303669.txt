Solved Finally, I find the solution myself. If anyone has the same problem I say that the point is that after the startDrag() method fired all the mouseDraged events goes to dragMouseMoved()(from DragSourceMotionListener) and I make the error to use also the "void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e)" from the MouseMotionListener.
