Yes - you would probably be arrested for your terriable abuse of strcat ! Take a look at getline() it reads the data a line at a time but importantly it can limit the number of characters you read, so you don't overflow the buffer. Strcat is relatively slow because it has to search the entire string for the end on every character insertion. You would normally keep a pointer to the current end of the string storage and pass that to getline as the position to read the next line into.
