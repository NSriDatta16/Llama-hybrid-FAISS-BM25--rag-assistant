The Keep it maximal proposal is not to be taken as a dogma. Be more pragmatic, and try to determine what level of model complexity your data will support (or at least a maximal level that will be supported). Computationally speaking: The IWRLS estimation procedure used might not converge to the optimal parameter values; as a result your inference will be wrong. In addition, a large number of parameters in a model may results in a very flat (conceptually speaking) log-likelihood surface and as a consequence the optimization problem you were previously solving "easily" just become extremely hairy. The reasonable thing to do is to reduce the number of groups you are estimating. Right now you have an over-parametrized LME models; as you assume a model $y\sim N(X\beta,ZDZ^T+\sigma^2I)$ what is written essentially has more variance parameters than data-points. Check for starters something like: y ~ x1*x2*z1*z2+ (1+z1|ID) + (1+z2|ID)) if you feel you should have correlated random slopes and intercepts in your model. This is already quite explicit for a covariance structure anyway. You can modify the model later if it does not fit your modeling assumptions. And to get back to you original final question: No, there is no way to automatically specify the maximal random effects structure of your model; unfortunately there is no $silver$ $bullet$ for that statistical question.
