Bayesian regularized NNs over classical NNs

I have seen a few research articles which claim that the classical neural networks usually lacks satisfactory generalization ability, which usually results in an imprecise predictions, and Bayesian regularized ANNs (BRANNs) are more robust than standard back-propagation nets and can reduce or eliminate the need for lengthy cross-validation. However these articles fall short of giving proper reasoning/justification for this claim. In what ways , or for what particular purposes are BRANNs better than classical NNs? And why?
