Is there a better C# ECMAScript engine than ScriptControlClass?

Implementing the ScriptControlClass was extremely easy, unfortunately the side effects with the language implementation is really starting to worry me. The goal was to have a language that was the same as the browser's JavaScript. However, I am finding a difference in case sensitivity, function declarations and behavior of scoping between JavaScript and JScript. The goal was to not have to train on multiple languages for the IT organizations, but rather standardize on JavaScript... So that aside... What choices are available in C# to implement embedded JavaScript, besides ScriptControlClass?
