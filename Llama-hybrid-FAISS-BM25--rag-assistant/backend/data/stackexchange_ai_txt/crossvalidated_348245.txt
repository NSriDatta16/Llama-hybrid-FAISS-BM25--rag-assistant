Do we have to tune the number of trees in a random forest?

Software implementations of random forest classifiers have a number of parameters to allow users to fine-tune the algorithm's behavior, including the number of trees $T$ in the forest. Is this a parameter that needs to be tuned, in the same way as $m$ , the number of features to try at each split (what Leo Breiman calls mtry )?
