As long as the data in a column is defined as a date/time type in R, it is possible to subtract dates/times and then to extract the time between rows, or the length of time from some fixed time point. One approach that could be tried is called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (R package is markovchain ). Assume: There is a unique row in the data with time and an identification of whether a predator or prey is recorded There are many photos of predators or prey. Observations of predators and prey are made in temporal sequence. Method: Exhaustively count the number of temporal pairs of observations: prey-prey, prey-predator, predator-prey and predator-predator. Then shuffle (randomize) the observations of pred/prey (i.e. maintain the same total number of pred/prey as observed) and count the number of pairs of observations generated by the shuffle: prey-prey, prey-predator, predator-prey and predator-predator. Record. Calculate the difference between number of observations in step (2) and that found by each shuffle. Repeat 1000 times. This should give a sense of how likely the original observation of prey-prey, prey-predator, predator-prey and predator-predator paired sequences are given the observed proportion of pred/prey. This can be tested assuming a chi-square distribution. Using this approach, any particular kind of structure in the data can be tested if there is enough data. For example, does the likelihood of a predator being observed increase with the number of times prey are observed in a row (i.e. is prey-prey-predator more likely than prey-prey-prey)?
