(i) The averaged squared vertical distance is the variance of $y$. The average absolute value is the mean absolute deviation (ii) The least squares estimator of $\beta_0$ is the sample mean, $\overline{y}$, because the sample mean minimizes the function $ f(a) = \sum_i (y_i - a)^2 $ (iii) When you only have an intercept, none of the variance is explained, so $R^2 = 0$.
