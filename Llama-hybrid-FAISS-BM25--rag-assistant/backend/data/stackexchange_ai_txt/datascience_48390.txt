How do I build an image dataset for CNN?

I don't understand how images are actually fed into a CNN. If I have a directory containing a few thousand images, what steps do I need to take in order to feed them to a neural network (for instance resizing, grey scale, labeling, etc)? I don't understand how the labeling of an image works. What would this dataset actually look like? Or can you not look at it at all (something like a table)?
