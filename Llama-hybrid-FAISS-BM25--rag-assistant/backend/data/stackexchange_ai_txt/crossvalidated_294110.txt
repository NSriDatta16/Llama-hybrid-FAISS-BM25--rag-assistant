Handling errors: "fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred", can these be ignored/averaged out in a simulation with many trials?

I have been getting the following errors in R because of trying to fit propensity scores that are well-stratified. I am currently looping over a model simulation 1000 times and in a portion of those I am getting: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred glm.fit: algorithm did not converge I understand that other threads have handled this problem. However, I am seeking input into two strategies I have: Only keep coefficients of those models without the error. Ignore and let the averaging do its work My question is, if I do a simulation 1000 times and observe that, say 50 of those resulted in errors, would it result in biasing if I were to just drop those 50 that resulted in the error? Additionally, if I just average over those estimated coefficients, would it cause any problems? Would either these methods be valid?
