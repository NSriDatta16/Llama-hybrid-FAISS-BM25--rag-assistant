Read a local text file using flash or javascript?

Is there any hook to react to a user drag and dropping a text file onto a browser? If the user drops a text file onto the browser with my page loaded, I'd like to be able to open the contents of the text file using javascript. I don't think this is possible, but just checking. Is something like this possible in flash? As an alternate, the user could specify a file path for me, then I could open the text file and read it. Seems like this is a security risk and probably won't be allowed, but just checking. It looks like this is possible with flash 10? Thanks
