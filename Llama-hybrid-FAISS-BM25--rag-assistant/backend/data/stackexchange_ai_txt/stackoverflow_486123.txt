The thing about FxCop is, it's an excellent tool for the specific use case it was designed for . It was designed to help class library developers. So if you're Developer Express or Infragistics and you're creating a code library to be used by developers worldwide, you need good naming, good globalization, and a host of other things. Thus if you name all your forms things like frmMain, FxCop will complain because that looks ugly in a class library. But if you're just working on an in-house WinForms app, you don't have to care. Likewise, you'll go crazy with all the stuff about IFormatProvider, MessageBox overloads that specify text direction, and so on. But unless you're creating code for a global audience, you can ignore those. The important thing is to understand the intended audience of FxCop. You can ignore certain recommendations based on the ways you differ from that audience.
