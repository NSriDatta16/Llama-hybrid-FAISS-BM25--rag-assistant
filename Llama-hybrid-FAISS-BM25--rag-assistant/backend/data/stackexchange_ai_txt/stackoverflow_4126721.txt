As always, I recommend understanding what the entire layout system is doing to understand what's going on. As to your specific question, $this always refers to the template's Block class. (Every phtml template has a Block class in Magento). Which class this is will depend on what's in your layout XML files. You can always output the class at runtime with something like this var_dump(get_class($this)); The getChildHtml method is defined on the base abstract block class app/code/core/Mage/Core/Block/Abstract.php This method is used by ALL blocks, so be sure you take this into account with your code.
