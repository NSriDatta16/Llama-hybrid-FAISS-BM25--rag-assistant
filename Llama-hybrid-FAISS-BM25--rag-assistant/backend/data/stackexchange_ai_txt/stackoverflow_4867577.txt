Opengl Simple Fragment Shader to overlay semi-transparent Triangle Strip over texture

I have a textured triangle strip that forms a quad. when you click on it i want the surrounding areas to get marked with semi-transparent quads so you can still see the textures underneath. i have the quads getting displayed correctly, but they are not transparent at all and completely cover whatever is underneath. i have a very simple fragment shader that i thought would work with glEnable(GL_BLEND) and glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) : #version 130 out vec4 flatColor; void main(void) { flatColor = vec4(0.0,1.0,0.0,0.5); } If i texture the quads with a simple image it works fine RGBA(0,255,0,128), but i do not want to have to create a texture for every color I want to use and would like todo it through a shader.
