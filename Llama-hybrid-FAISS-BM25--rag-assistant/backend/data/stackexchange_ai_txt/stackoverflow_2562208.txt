if you are willing to sub-class the slider, you can easily solve this by implementing endTrackingWithTouch and doing nothing: - (void) endTrackingWithTouch:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {} the only caveat here is that some specific UIControlEvents will not fire properly. i believe they are the following ones, but i didn't do specific testing to see which ones work and which don't. however touch changed and touch up inside definitely do work without duplicate firing. UIControlEventTouchDragInside = 1
