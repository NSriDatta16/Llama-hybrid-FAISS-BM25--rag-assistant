jQuery UI - Droppable only accept one draggable

I'm making an app, that is using one droppable div and a few draggable div s. How can I make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div ? I Googled, but didn't find any workaround. A workaround came up in mi mind. How can i check is there's dropped element in this droppable div? If it's busy then revert this draggable, which is trying to be dropped
