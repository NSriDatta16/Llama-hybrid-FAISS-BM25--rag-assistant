Finding people to do usability testing

Does anyone have recommendations/experience of how to find people willing to do usability testing of web based apps? I suspect I may need people who might actually be potential users, because mine is a commercial/vertical app which contains some processes and terminology which may not mean much to the average joe/jane. I have a fairly robust prototype of a web app which is designed for people in Sales Management and before I go too much further with it I want to try a couple of key pieces out on some live users. I have a few friendly faces I can turn to (and have already), but I really want strangers who will not feel they need to be nice to me about it. I'm fine designing the usability tests themselves, it is finding the guinea-pigs that is proving difficult.
