How does a web server know what linked to it?

I use photobucket to post images to various user forums. The forums I post to allow the embedding of a direct link to the image. One of the services photobucket provides is a view history which includes not only number of hits but also information on which sites viewed the page. I can't figure out how they do that -- can anyone fill me in on the details? I would like to add that ability to my own server, but isn't this a security hole in the HTTP protocol of sorts?
