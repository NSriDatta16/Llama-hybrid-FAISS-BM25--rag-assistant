Deviance of a larger model is much larger than the deviance of the reduced(nested) model

I am doing a logistic regression with 8 variables but for some reason the model with the second degree of interaction has a much larger deviance than the nested model without interaction. Because of that the likelihood ratio test for nested models gives me a negative Chi-Squared value and i don't quite know how to interpret these results. Anyone knows why this would be possible?
