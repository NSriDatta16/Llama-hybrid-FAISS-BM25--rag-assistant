Its not that it isn't acceptable, but rather that dicts weren't implemented that way. If you look at Django's ORM, it makes extensive use of chaining. Its not discouraged, you could even inherit from dict and only override update to do update and return self , if you really want it. class myDict(dict): def update(self, *args): dict.update(self, *args) return self
