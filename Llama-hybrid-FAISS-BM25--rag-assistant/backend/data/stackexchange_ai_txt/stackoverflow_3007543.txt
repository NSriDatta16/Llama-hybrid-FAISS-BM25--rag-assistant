Change last character of every word in a sentence to a capital using Ruby

I was challenged to write some Ruby code that changes the last character of every word in a sentence into a capital. Such that the string: "script to convert the last letter of every word to a capital" becomes "scripT tO converT thE lasT letteR oF everY worD tO A capitaL" This is what I ended up using: "script to convert the last letter of every word to a capital".split.map{|w|w For those interested as to what is going on here is an explanation. split will split the sentence up into an array, the default delimiter is a space and with Ruby you don't need to use brackets here. map the array from split is passed to map which opens a block and process each word (w) in the array. the block slice! (s) off the last character of the word and converts it to a chr (a character not ASCII code) and then capitalises upcase it. This character is now appended to the word which is missing the sliced last letter. Finally the array of words is now join together with a ' ' to reform the sentence.
