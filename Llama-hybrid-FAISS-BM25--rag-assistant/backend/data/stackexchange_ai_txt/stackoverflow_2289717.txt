Good jQuery advocacy materials (videos) suitable for a manager?

Can anyone recommend any particularly compelling propoganda (papers or even better, video) on jQuery that would be suitable for a manager who knows very little about the technology? My manager seems very reluctant to consider letting us use it, seeming to think it is yet another technology flavor of the month / flash in the pan.
