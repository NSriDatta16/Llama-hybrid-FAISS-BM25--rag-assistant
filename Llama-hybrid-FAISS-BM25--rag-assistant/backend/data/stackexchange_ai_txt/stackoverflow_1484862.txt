I hate to say it, but I think in your case Alex Tingle's right. It's an impossible situation. JacobM and Santi are correct in mentioning unit testing, acceptance testing, and test-driven development. I'd add code coverage and static analysis tools to that list. But while TDD or basic unit testing will generally pay off in decreased testing time, lowered defect rates, and ease of maintenance, they won't help you deliver on time in a deathmarch. This is especially true if you aren't experienced at writing automated tests. Politely phrased, your boss is asking you to incur technical debt. Correctly phrased, he's asking you to disregard professional ethics. Smile, say "yes sir," do the best you can in the time allotted, and update your resume.
