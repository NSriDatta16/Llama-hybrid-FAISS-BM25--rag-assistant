What do you mean by "not working the way I want it"? Is it not prompting the user for input correctly? Is it displaying the incorrect message? Is it throwing an exception? At first glance, I already see a bug. You check for >= AVERAGE_IQ then = and and Also, the done flag is redundant since you're breaking. You might as well just use a while (true) loop if you're going to use breaks. Another thing, you aren't handling negative input correctly. It should also display that out of range error message. Edit: as many other have pointed out, "=!" is not the same thing as "!=".
