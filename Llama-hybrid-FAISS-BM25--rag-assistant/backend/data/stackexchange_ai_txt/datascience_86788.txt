Bag-of-words and Spam classifiers

I implemented a spam classifier using Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Algorithms are trained on the entire Enron spam emails dataset using the Bag-of-words (BoW) approach. Prediction is done on the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset. I have 3 questions: During test time, while creating the term-frequency matrix, what if none of the words from my training BoW are found in some of my test emails/smses. Then, wouldn't the document vectors be zero vectors for those datapoints. How should I tackle this? What if a new word from my test email/sms doesn't exist in BoW? How do I choose my BoW so as to improve my prediction accuracy?
