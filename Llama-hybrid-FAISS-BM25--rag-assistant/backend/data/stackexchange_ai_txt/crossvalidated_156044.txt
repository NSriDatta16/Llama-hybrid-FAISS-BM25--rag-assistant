Classification in SVM

I am not expert in this area so please bare with me. As far as I know the SVM is used for distinguishing or classifying two sets. My questions are: Is it possible to classify more than two sets or the two is the limit? So far I've seen examples where two sets are separated by line, is it possible to separate sets using another curve e.g. quadratic, sine etc.?
