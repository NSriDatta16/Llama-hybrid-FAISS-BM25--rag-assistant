Transformers for sales forecasting, vector output

I'm looking for a multivariable time series architecture that accepts multiple independent variables and produces multiple dependent variables. The context is sales forecasting given item, discount percentage and units sold. So if there were 100 items, a single time-step (row) would have 300 elements: [(item_token_1, item_discount_pct_1, units_sold_1),..., (item_token_100, item_discount_pct_100, units_sold_100)] I believe that a transformer architecture might be applicable as it could infer patterns across items. For example, if shampoo performed well on a given week with a discount percentage of 15% then conditioner might perform similarly on the same week given a similar discount percentage. The output should have 200 elements [(units_sold_item1),...(units_sold_item100)] . Any white papers that are similar to what I'm describing? Are time series models which produce vector outputs, rather than scalars, common?
