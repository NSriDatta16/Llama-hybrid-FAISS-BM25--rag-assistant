java/swing: clipboard paste

I have a DropTargetListener setup to allow me to drag + drop strings into some tables of my Swing application -- on a drop, I parse the string and insert data into the table. I would like to do the same thing with a clipboard paste (Ctrl-V). What literature is there to explain how to handle clipboard pastes? I'm looking at some stuff from Sun's website and it seems bizarre, like this should be simpler.
