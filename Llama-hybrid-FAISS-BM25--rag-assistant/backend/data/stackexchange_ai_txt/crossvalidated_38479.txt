Route to understanding and implementing statistical timing models

The research paper Forecasting NBA Player Performance by Douglas Hwang describes a method for predicting player performance by utilizing a statistical timing model and a 'Weibull-Gamma' distribution. I'm approaching this from a rudimentary understanding of descriptive statistics and Bayesian inference, and would like to get some background to better appreciate, and potentially implement a similar approach to predicting individual performance (outside of the sports arena). What branch of statistics encompasses this sort of analysis? What is the usual route students/practitioners follow in learning how to design and implement these analysis? Any suggestions on books or resources (as applied as possible)? Or open-source libraries that provide implementations of this sort of thing?
