Overview research on ambiguity of words

As far as I know vector representations of word embeddings do not account for ambiguity. A single word can have different meanings f.e. "hot" can mean very good looking or very warm. Another example is "jaguar", that might refer to a car or an animal but the word is still represented by one vector while it has two or more meanings . What methods take ambiguity into account? What approaches have been developed? What are the state of the art practices? A clear overview on this research topic would be appreciated. Thank you.
