Sounds like you have a pretty good handle on the situation. Two things: Don't expect to be able to fully unit test a 5 year old project. Assuming 5 developers working for 5 years, you're in the neighborhood of 50,000 programmer-hours. Assuming that tests take as much time to write as code, you'd be doing pretty good to get 2-3% coverage in a year. So: Test new code, and write tests for modifications of older code. Get time / take time to set up CI of some kind. Gradually, you'll build up a nice battery of tests. Since you're apparently not drowning in bugs, start slow, gain momentum.
