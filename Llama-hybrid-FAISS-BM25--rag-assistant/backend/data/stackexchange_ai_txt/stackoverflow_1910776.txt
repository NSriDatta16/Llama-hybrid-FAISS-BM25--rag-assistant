Why do you want to do this? You really can't completely hide the url of another page, unless you fetch the page and hide it by displaying it on a POSTED form page on your site. You could try overlaying it in a frame, but the url still could be found. If you want something simple, to prevent people from causally not bookmarking the url, setup a POSTED link or form that directs to an framed viewer, (embedding the page within another). If anyone bookmarks or shares the page without POSTED data, it can display page not found or access not permitted.
