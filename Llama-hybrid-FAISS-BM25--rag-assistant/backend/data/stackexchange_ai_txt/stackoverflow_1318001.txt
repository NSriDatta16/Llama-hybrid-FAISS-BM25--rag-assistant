How to do create_or_update in sqlobject?

I'm using SQLobject and so far was not able to find a elegant solution for "update row in the db or create a new one if it doesn't exist. Currently I use following somewhat convoluted code: args = dict(artnr=artnr, name=name, hersteller='?', hersteller_name='?') if cs.datamart.ArtNrNameHersteller.selectBy(artnr=artnr).count(): row = cs.datamart.ArtNrNameHersteller.selectBy(artnr=artnr)[0] row.set(**args) else: cs.datamart.ArtNrNameHersteller(**args) Obviously this is far from bening consise, robust, elegant or fast. What is the correct way (TM) to do this?
