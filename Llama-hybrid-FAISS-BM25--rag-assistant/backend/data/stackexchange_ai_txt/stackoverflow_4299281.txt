Going with Answer A. the Win32 solution. This meets the requirements, and is robust from testing so far. Declare Function MessageBoxTimeout Lib "user32.dll" Alias "MessageBoxTimeoutA" ( _ ByVal hwnd As Long, _ ByVal lpText As String, _ ByVal lpCaption As String, _ ByVal uType As Long, _ ByVal wLanguageID As Long, _ ByVal lngMilliseconds As Long) As Long Private Declare Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" ( _ ByVal lpClassName As String, _ ByVal lpWindowName As String) As Long Public Sub MsgBoxDelay() Const cmsg As String = "Yes or No? leaving this window for 1 min is the same as clicking Yes." Const cTitle As String = "popup window" Dim retval As Long retval = MessageBoxTimeout(FindWindow(vbNullString, Title), cmsg, cTitle, 4, 0, 60000) If retval <> 7 Then Call MethodFoo End If End Sub
