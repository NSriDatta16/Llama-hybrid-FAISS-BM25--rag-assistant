Understanding Newey West corrections and t-values

I am trying to find if the Japanese market is predictable, using different market valuation variables as independent variables. I use OLS regressions on a time series, because this is done so in previous literature. Due to overlapping observations, I am also calculating the adjusted Newey West (1987) t-values. Suprisingly, I found that the adjusted t-values are more significant (t = -4.62) than the non adjusted ones (t = -0.37). The corresponding adjusted R^2 value is -0.002357. So I am wondering how this can be the case and how this should be interpreted?
