iphone NSHTTPCookieStorage avaible on app reopen?

I am working on my app here- and it pretty much comes to this. I have a login box where a users log's in and then it saves the cookie data on return like so: NSArray * all = [NSHTTPCookie cookiesWithResponseHeaderFields:[resp allHeaderFields] forURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://myurl]]; NSHTTPCookieStorage *sharedHTTPCookieStorage = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]; [sharedHTTPCookieStorage setCookies:all forURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://myurl"] mainDocumentURL:nil]; After it safes that cookie i take it to the home view - My problem is - if the users closes the prgoram, the phone restarts and so forth - are the cookies stored locally on the phone its sefl? I am trying to access that cookie again on the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. I have the following code now.. NSHTTPCookieStorage *sharedHTTPCookieStorage = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]; NSArray *cookies = [sharedHTTPCookieStorage cookiesForURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://iphone.wazgood.com"]]; NSLog(@"count: %i", [cookies count]); Every time - it comes up empty on the cookie data - any ideas on if the cookies are cleared every time the user clsoes the program out - or is it bc im testing on the iPhone emulator?
