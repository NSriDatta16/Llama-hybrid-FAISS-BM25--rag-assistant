This is even worse than a straight, single GUID created by using just newid(). Why?? it's still totally random (because of the newid() part) thus causing massive index fragmentation it's twice as large as a single GUID, making all your non-clustered indices more bloated and less efficient (32 bytes vs. 4 bytes for an INT IDENTITY) So I would recommend to either: stick with just a newsequentialid() as the default for your PK, if you really want and need a GUID-style PK use a INT/BIGINT IDENTITY for optimal performance (if replication is not a requirement) That's the best two choices you have. See Kimberly Tripp's excellent articles on why a random GUID is a really really bad choice for a clustering key: GUIDs as PRIMARY KEYs and/or the clustering key The Clustered Index Debate Continues... Ever-increasing clustering key - the Clustered Index Debate..........again!
