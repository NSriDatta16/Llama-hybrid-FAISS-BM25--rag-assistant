Is it possible to map a port using UPnP, with SOAP, to bind to a local port where my http server is listening?

Say, I'm behind a router at 192.168.0.1, which leads to external ip which is 192.168.1.64 (a dsl modem) which leads to a public internet address. Is it possible using uPnP, via SOAP requests to gateway, to map my http server port local to an arbitrary port at that public internet address? Sorry, I'm totally newbie on this matters. I'm testing using Putty on port 80 on gateway, issueing http with xml. POST /upnp/control3 HTTP/1.1 Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: Close Pragma: no-cache Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8" User-Agent: Microsoft-Windows/6.1 UPnP/1.0 SOAPAction: "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1#AddPortMapping" ... .. Thanks.
