Renaming directory gives positive result code, but didn't rename

I know it's only cosmetic but the below code should rename my directory however it doesn't. The difference is just some capitalisation - but afaik Android is fully case sensitive when it comes to filenames. Like Linux normally is too. The rename gives a true result, indicating the operation was successful. However the directory in question is NOT renamed, and it still has two capital D's. I have previously used the same code to rename from /DeadDropDroid to /.DeadDropDroid and that works fine. Every time I run the below code the log says "success". oldBasePath = new File (Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+ "/.DeadDropDroid/"); if (oldBasePath.exists()) { if (oldBasePath.renameTo(new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+ "/.DeaddropDroid/"))) Log.v(TAG, "Rename success."); else Log.v(TAG, "Rename fail."); }
