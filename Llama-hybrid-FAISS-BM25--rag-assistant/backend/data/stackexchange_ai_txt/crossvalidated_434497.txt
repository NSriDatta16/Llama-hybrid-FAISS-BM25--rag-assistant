Dimension reduction (matrix) using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. PCA?

I am stuck with one task where I need to reduce dimensions of the matrix 20000 by 10, compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues and determine how much the dimension can be reduced and transform the data. I have calculated the covariance matrix (10 by 10) but stuck where to move next. I'm working in Matlab but any advice is sincerely appreciated.
