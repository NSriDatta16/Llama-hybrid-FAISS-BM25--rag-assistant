For data similar to audio, how to determine if there are 1 or 2 categories?

I have to compare pairs of audio strems as 1d time series. Looking at the aligned trajectories I need to either cluster them together or assume they arise from independent generators. I remember hearing of Dirichlet processes being applied. Could try to defined a hidden Markov model on the structure, not sure yet how the emission probabilities would work out, but it must be possible. any recommendations? Best EDITS- set of 1D data time series s in {1...N}, another set of trajectories q in {1...N} all over a discrete time domain t=0...t=T under a uniform interval. Task, determine whether under certain assumptions (eg. iid, normality etc), is the generator under these assumptions a valid null hypothesis to have generated the two categories of trajectories s and q? Or is the null hypothesis abandoned for a more complex model? So do we use an autoregressive model? a Gaussian process would be hard to interpret the inverse covariance. Some parametric model would seem to be valid. Don't know... any ideas?
