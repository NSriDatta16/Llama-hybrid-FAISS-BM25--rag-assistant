PRobably already answered here: The biggest reason is to reduce dimensionality - computing logistic regression on 100 features can be cumbersome. PCA will recreate this feature matrix in terms of new variables that capture direction of variance in the data. So You are working with variables that cause the data to move the most. And in general first few components can capture very large proportion of the overall variance, say 90+ %. Then you can only work with those few aritificial new variables instead of original ones. You only need to transform everything to those new variables - nice exercise in linear algebra :)
