I am gonna show it for the case when the time series is a special form of $Y_t=0,1,2, ...,n.$ First assume $n$ is odd. So the $\bar{Y}=n/2$ that will happen at the time $(n+1)/2$. The formula for the sample acf at lag $k$ is $r_k=\dfrac{\sum_{t=k+1}^n(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})(Y_{t-k}-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{t=1}^n(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})^2}$. Now for $k\geq \bar{Y}$, the time index for $(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})$ in the numerator of $r_k$ goes from $\{\dfrac{n+1}{2}+1,...,n\}.$ Therefore, $(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})\geq 0$ for $t\in \{\dfrac{n+1}{2}+1,...,n\}$. On the other hand the time index for the 2nd term in the numerator of $r_k$ i.e. $(Y_{t-k}-\bar{Y})$ goes from $\{1,2,...,n-k\}$. Note that since we assumed $k\geq \bar{Y}$ then $k\geq (n+1)/2$. So $n-k\leq (n-1)/2\leq (n+1)/2.$ Therefore, $(n-k)\leq \bar{Y}$. So $(Y_{t-k}-\bar{Y})\leq 0$ for $t \in \{1,2,...,n-k\}$. Hence the product of $(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})(Y_{t-k}-\bar{Y})$ in the numerator of $r_k$ would be all negative for $t\in \{k+1,...,n\}$. And the summation of all negative numbers is again negative. So $r_k\leq 0$. (We don't care about the denominator coz its always positive). Same argument can be applied for the case when $n$ is even. In your example, we have: $Y=0,1,2...,5.$ So $\bar{y}=2.5.$ Based on above argument when $k\geq 2.5$ , we will have $r_k\leq 0$. Here is another example: > y=0:10 > mean(y) [1] 5 > > acf(y,plot=FALSE) Autocorrelations of series ‘y’, by lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.000 0.727 0.464 0.218 0.000 -0.182 -0.318 -0.400 -0.418 -0.364 -0.227
