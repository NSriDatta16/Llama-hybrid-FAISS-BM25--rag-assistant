You seem to be using unsupervised algorithms like classical clustering and silhouette scores. You did not mention learning algorithms. They are the best tool for automatic and highly accurate classification. You would need to know the correct class of a lot of the examples to use supervised learning, however. I cannot tell from your description. The problem of one-class-contains-another is a different problem that would need to be fixed in advance before using supervised learning. 1800 classes is a lot of classes. I've never heard of that large of a class-space before. If a human can do something, that's a good indication that a supervised learning algorithm can do the same thing. You said "unfortunately I am aware that quite a few are misclassified" which makes me optimistic that supervised learning would work here. Take a class on supervised learning at a MOOC, because that's the fastest way to learn about learning algorithms and get started today. I suggest to start, the Statistical Learning course by Hastie and Tibshirani at lagunita.stanford.edu website. If you like math a lot, Andrew Ng has an equally excellent course Machine Learning at coursera web site.
