Looks to me like you have an honest-to-Spolsky stack overflow! Try compiling your program with gcc's -fstack-check option. If your arrays are too big to allocate on the stack, you'll get a StorageError exception. I think it's a good bet, though, as 5000*500*3 doubles (8 bytes each) comes to around 60 megs - no platform has enough stack for that. You'll have to allocate your big arrays on the heap.
