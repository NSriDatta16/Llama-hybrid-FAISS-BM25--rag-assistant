What are some interesting and well-written applied statistics papers?

What are some good papers describing applications of statistics that would be fun and informative to read? Just to be clear, I'm not really looking for papers describing new statistical methods (e.g., a paper on least angle regression), but rather papers describing how to solve real-world problems. For example, one paper that would fit what I'm looking is the climate paper from the second Cross-Validated Journal Club . I'm kind of looking for more statistics-ish papers, rather than machine learning papers, but I guess it's kind of a fuzzy distinction (I'd classify the Netflix Prize papers as a bit borderline, and a paper on sentiment analysis as something I'm not looking for). I'm asking because most of the applications of statistics I've seen are either the little snippets you seen in textbooks, or things related to my own work, so I'd like to branch out a bit.
