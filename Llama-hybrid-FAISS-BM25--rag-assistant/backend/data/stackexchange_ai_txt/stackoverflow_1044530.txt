The only thing fishy I can spot is this - here in the declaration, you hvae: public ISingleResult spX([Parameter(DbType="VarChar(8000)")] string str) (DbType=VARCHAR(8000)) - which is ANSI (non-Unicode), but then in the column declaration you use NTEXT - first of all, that's UNICODE (2-byte per character), and why NTEXT?? Above you have VARCHAR? [Column(Name="[XML_F52E2B61-18A1-11d1-B105-00805F49916B]", Storage="_XML_F52E2B61_18A1_11d1_B105_00805F49916B", DbType="NText", UpdateCheck=UpdateCheck.Never)] That seems a bit odd....... Can you try to make it the same in both places? E.g. VARCHAR(8000) in both cases?? Marc
