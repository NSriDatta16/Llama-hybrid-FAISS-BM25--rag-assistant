Influence plot for potential outlier detection from logistic regression in R

I am looking into identifying extreme values from their contribution to a binary outcome model. I have an unbalanced set and some extreme values which are part of the smaller set to predict (i.e predit a 1) so I can't really remove them. Ideally you can use the cook's distance, residual and influence from the leverage plot of: For a linear model library(car) plot(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)) I would look at: But does it make sense for a logistic regression of the form: plot(glm(outcome ~ variable, family="binomial")) I guess not because you can't get the residuals... You seem to be able to do a chi square influence plot or also proportional influence plot like in here on Figure 3 (looking like crosses) and shown below. I also find a similar diagnostic analysis in SAS . Anyone knows how to do that in R or if there are other ways that would allow me to do the equivalent analysis from linear regression but for logistic regression ? Would calculating the leverage and Cook's distance make sense? Thanks [add-on] There is a great answer from gung confirming that the lm analysis does not really apply for glm It turns out to be a research topic including also the case of multiple influence..
