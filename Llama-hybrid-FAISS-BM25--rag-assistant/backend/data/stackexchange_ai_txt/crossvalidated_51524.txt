Why would we want to use average cost as response but not total cost?

Assume I have a data set as follows: Total_Cost Average_Cost Quantity 12 6 2 21 7 3 28 7 4 30 6 5 36 6 6 The linear relationship between Total_Cost and Quantity is nearly perfect, while between Average_Cost and Quantity is very poor. However, I saw many researches that basically use average cost as a response but not total cost. My question here is therefore: Are there any particular reasons for us to study the linear relationship between Average_Cost and whatever independent variables? (For instance, the use of Total_Cost as a response is way too straightforward.)
