How to extract text from resonably sane HTML?

My question is sort of like this question but I have more constraints: I know the document's are reasonably sane they are very regular (they all came from the same source I want about 99% of the visible text about 99% of what is viable at all is text (they are more or less RTF converted to HTML) I don't care about formatting or even paragraph breaks. Are there any tools set up to do this or am I better off just breaking out RegexBuddy and C#? I'm open to command line or batch processing tools as well as C/C#/D libraries.
