Can you get full paths from the pasteboard when drag and dropping?

I am supporting a drag-and-drop operation on an IKImageBrowserView. In my drag and drop destination delegate I accept NSFilenamesPboardType drops. The weird part is that the filepath strings I get back all start with "/Users/..." instead of "file://localhost/..." as I get when using an NSOpenPanel. When I convert these to NSURLs for use by the IKImageBrowserView to show images, it gets confused because it only understands full paths starting with "file://localhost/...". I can hack the prefix in, as I've done in the snippet below, but I was wondering if there was a programatic way to get full paths instead? if ([[pasteboard types] containsObject:NSFilenamesPboardType]) { NSData* data = [pasteboard dataForType:NSFilenamesPboardType]; if (data) { NSString* errorDescription; NSArray* filenames = [NSPropertyListSerialization propertyListFromData:data mutabilityOption:kCFPropertyListImmutable format:nil errorDescription:&errorDescription]; for (id filename in filenames) { NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"file://localhost%@", filename]]; NSLog(@"Adding URL: %@", url);
