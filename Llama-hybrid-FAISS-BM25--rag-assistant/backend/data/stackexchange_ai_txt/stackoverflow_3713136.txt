Seeing red: How to NOT clear a div in IE7?

First of all, do you see red?... http://jsfiddle.net/yaBqr/ I do in IE7 and I want to know why. Both paragraphs are floated in opposite directions and there's nothing else that could possibly be clearing the container div. HTML: To the left, two, three, four To the right, two, three, four CSS: div.wrap { background: red; width: 300px; margin: 100px auto 0 auto; } p.left { float: left; width: 100px; } p.right { float: right; width: 100px; } I know what you're thinking... "What's the problem? What's wrong with the container div clearing the paragraphs?". In most cases, yeah, I would normally clear all the floated elements, but I'm trying to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/yaBqr/1/ I only want to clear the left div so the background appears behind the left paragraph only. IE7 is clearing BOTH floated elements. Even when there's no clearer div! So I can't even get off the ground. Any ideas?
