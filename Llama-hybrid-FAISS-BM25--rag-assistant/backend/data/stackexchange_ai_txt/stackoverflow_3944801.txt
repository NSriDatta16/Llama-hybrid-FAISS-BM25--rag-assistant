If you log in using a Web page, the site is probably using cookie-based authentication. (It could technically use HTTP basic auth, by embedding your credentials in the URI, but this would be a dumb thing to do in most cases.) If you get a separate, smallish dialog with a user name and password field ( like this one ), it is using HTTP basic authentication. If you try to log in using HTTP basic auth, and get back the login page, as is happening to you, this is a certain indication that the site is not using HTTP basic auth. Most sites use cookie-based authentication these days. To do this with an HTTP cilent such as urllib2, you will need to do an HTTP POST of the fields in the login form. (You may need to actually request the login form first, as a site could include a cookie that you need to even log in, but usually this is not necessary.) This should return a "successfully logged in" page that you can test for. Save the cookies you get back from this request. When making the next request, include these cookies. Each request you make may respond with cookies, and you need to save those and send them again with the next request. urllib2 has a function called a "cookie jar" which will automatically handle the cookies for you as you send requests and receive Web pages. That's what you want.
