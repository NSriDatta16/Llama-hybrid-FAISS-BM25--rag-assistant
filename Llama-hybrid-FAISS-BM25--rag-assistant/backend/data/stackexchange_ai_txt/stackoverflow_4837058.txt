I implemented an XDebug-CC for a class with invoked methods and it works fine. Though I have to say that I am a bit confused about how this tool defines "executable code", it definitely takes account of methods. You might check the location of your xdebug_start_code_coverage() and xdebug_get_code_coverage(), as those have to be invoked at the very beginning and the very end. Also you might check your XDebug-version, as there has been some accuracy-improvements since the feature has been released. Best Raffael
