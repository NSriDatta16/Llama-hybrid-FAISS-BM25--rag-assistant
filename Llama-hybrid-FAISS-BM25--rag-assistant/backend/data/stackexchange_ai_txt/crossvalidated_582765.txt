How can I compare performance of two logistic regression models after splitting into two the combined datasets relating to hospital mortality?

I have data on patients with candidaemia and have analysed a range of predictor variables associated with 30-day in hospital mortality using binary logistic regression in STATA version 14. I can also use SPSS Version 24. One of the predictor variables is location of this set of patients, i.e. hospital (Hospital A, Hospital B), referring to the hospitals where these patients were first seen and managed up to 30 days. These two hospitals function separately in terms of patients' management but are managed admistratively by one organisation (UK NHS Trust). The analysis I have done is for all patients combined. What I want to see is if the final models would remain the same(in terms of the vector of coefficients/predictabilty) when I split the data into hospital A and Hospital B, according to the difference in likelihood ratio tests performed on the two split samples. Would the patients in Hospital A versus Hospital B behave the same in terms of mortality as defined? I read around nested models and full models, less restrictive and more restrictive models, etc. But I am not sure how they can help me answer my question: As an example, what is the estimated probability of dying at 30-day for a patient aged 70 in Hospital A, and Hospital B? Are the probabilities the same or different according to the final models of the respective Hospitals? Thank you for your help.
