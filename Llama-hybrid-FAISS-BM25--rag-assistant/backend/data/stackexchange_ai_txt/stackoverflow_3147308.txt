Cyclic generic dependenices

Let's say I have two classes. Each class has one parameter. Parameter of first class bounded to a second class and vice versa. But there is an additional requirement. This parameter must also be parametrized by class itself. This is better to be explained by example: public class Class1 > { ... } public class Class2 > { ... } However, this construction doesn't work. Compiler tells Type parameter Class2 is not within its bound . This is perfectly understandable, because compiler unable to resolve this endless recursion. But I'd like to know is there any elegant way to get what want by means of generic?
