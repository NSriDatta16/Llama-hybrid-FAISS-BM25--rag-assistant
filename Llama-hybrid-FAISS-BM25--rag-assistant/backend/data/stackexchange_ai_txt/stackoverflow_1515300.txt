Java: Serializing String[] Array to store in a MySQL Database?

Yes, I know it's bad practice and I should instead normalize my tables. That put aside, is it possible to serialize a String [] array and store it in the database? I am from the lenient and forgiving world of PHP, where invoking the serialize() function and would convert the array into a string. Is there an equivalent of doing such heresy in Java? Apart from normalization, are there more elegant ways of storing String Arrays in the database? In case it's applicable, I am using the jdbc driver for my MySQL connections.
