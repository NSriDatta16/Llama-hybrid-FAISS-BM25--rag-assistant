When can we say random forest is overfitting?

I've divided my data into 3 sets: train, validate and test I've trained my data once on train set and tested it on the test set. After tuning random forest on validate set, I've got the following numbers: I'm using accuracy as the evaluation metric as all classes are balanced Train Acc: 96% Test Acc: 93% RF oob_score_: 91% As there's a 2% gap between my test accuracy and out-of-bag score, is the model overfitting or not? What is the minimum gap at which I can say the model is starting to overfit?
