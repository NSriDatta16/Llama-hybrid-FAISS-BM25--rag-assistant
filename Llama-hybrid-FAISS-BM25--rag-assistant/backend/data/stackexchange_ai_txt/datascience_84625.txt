Generally that is called optimization, finding the best possible solution given constraints. There many flavors of optimization - integer programming and linear programming are popular. Optimization is important for machine learning but is not everything. Machine learning also has to deal with problems that change over time and predicting performance on unseen data. If you frame the problem as optimization, SciPy has many optimization routines . Additionally, PuLP is a Python linear programming API for defining problems and invoking external solvers.
