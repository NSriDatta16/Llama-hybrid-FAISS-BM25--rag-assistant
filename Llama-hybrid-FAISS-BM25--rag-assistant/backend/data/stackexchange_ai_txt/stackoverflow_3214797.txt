CakePHP does a lot of content handling to ensure that you need to do a little work as possible. If you're just attempting to access some simple data, you might just leave it out of CakePHP and keep them as separate scripts. Creating them in CakePHP might be using a sledgehammer for hanging a picture frame (if you get my analogy). Given your explanation in the comments, I would recommend importing them into CakePHP as libraries. You would be able to take your webservice code as a set of PHP files (or however you organized them) and they can be dropped into the appropriate folder in the app/ directory according to which version of Cake is being used. From there, they can included into the rest of CakePHP without you needing to know what your client is actually doing with his code. Read up here for how your code would be imported. Keep in mind that significant changes have been made to this process between version 1.2 and 1.3 so note that in your reading below: Loading Vendor files in CakePHP 1.2 Plugins in CakePHP 1.3 Changes from 1.2 to 1.3 in regards to Vendor files Hope this helps!
