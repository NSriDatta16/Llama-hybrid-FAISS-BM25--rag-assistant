Pointer best practice

I am just starting to learn C and (of course) struggling with pointers :) Given this snippet: int *storage, *storage_p; storage = malloc(sizeof(int[GROW_BY])); storage_p = storage; // do something with storage, using storage_p free(storage); storage = NULL; Is it really necessary to have two variables declared to work with the malloc() 'ed data? Is it good practice to create a storage and storage_p the way I did? If not, what would would be 'the way'?
