What can be done about assumption violations in logistic regression?

I am working on a logistic regression solution, and I'm experiencing some issues with assumptions according to the diagnostic graphs.For linear regression, I am familiar with addressing similar problems with tranforming the response variable (log, sqrt, etc.) however these solutions wouldn't work for factor variables. What can be done in the case of: violation of normality heteroscedasticity non-linearity The model was generated from a training-set with 292 observations. I am considering removing 1 or 2 of the observations considering graph4, however I am not sure what to do for the other issues.
