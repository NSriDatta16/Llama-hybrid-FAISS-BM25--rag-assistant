Logistic or Poisson Regression for Mortality Modelling?

I am attempting to model the probability of death while controlling for a number of other variables. I began to do this with standard logistic regression, but I've come across a number of articles that use Poisson regression to model mortality rates. My independent variable is death (0/1). Is Poisson regression preferred to Logistic Regression when modelling something like death or vice versa? If so why?
