How can I leverage a pairwise scatter plot to help choose a machine learning model/classifier to distinguish the categories of iris flower?

This is a visualization of the Iris data as a pairwise scatter plot. The goal is to learn to distinguish three different kinds of iris flower, called setosa, versicolor and virginica. We can extract following information from the figure above it is easy to distinguish setosas (red circles) from the other two classes by just checking if their petal length or width is below some threshold. However, distinguishing versicolor from virginica is slightly harder Besides this information, is there any other information we can extract to help choose a machine learning model/classifier to distinguish the categories of iris flower?
