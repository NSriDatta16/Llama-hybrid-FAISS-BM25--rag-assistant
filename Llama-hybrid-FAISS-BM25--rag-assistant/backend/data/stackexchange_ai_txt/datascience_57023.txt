xgboost: Is there a way to perform regression on rates/percentages data?

I have a dependent variable, $Y$ , that is made up of rates/percentages data, so each value is between $0$ and $1$ . I was attracted to the xgboost library because it allows focusing in on specific subsets of the data in training itself, but I am stumped as how to perform regression on the data I have. Normal OLS regression will produce outputs that will be over and under the [0,1] range if you do not change the likelihood to be the Beta distribution , or something else bounded in the same range, but will xgboost suffer the same mistake? Any advice on trying to get this to work would be greatly appreciated by me.
