I think a solution to this is provided by Murray (2021) " Log-Linear Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Multinomial Logistic and Count Regression Models " where a zero-inflated negative binomial BART (ZINB-BART) is outlined. The main point is to use a "data augmented" likelihood where we have an indicator function to account for the zero inflation. In any case, I would suggest you monitor the acceptance rate per iteration, too low or too high values might indicate some fishy. Additionally, we should run posterior predictive checks on a hold-out test set to check if our observed data are "close" to our posterior predictive mean. Finally, when it comes to count data modelling, rootograms are our friends so utilise them too.
