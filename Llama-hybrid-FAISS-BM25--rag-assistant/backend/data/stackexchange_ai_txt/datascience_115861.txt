Machine learning feature selection

I have 40 Independent variables in dataframe. Out of these 40 IV's 6 IV's are as follows, X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 Target 1 2 3 4 5 6 21 2 4 1 3 5 4 19 As seen in above table, target variable value is a sum of values of 6 IV's (X1 to X6) i.e., 1+2+3+4+5+6=21 My question is should I consider these IV's for building a regression models along with other features. Will it affect my model performance if i use them even if there is less correlation between these IV's and Target(less than 0.5) ? What should be correct approach?
