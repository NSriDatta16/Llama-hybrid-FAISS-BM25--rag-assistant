There is no real difference between C and C++ in terms of memory allocation. C++ Has more 'hidden' data, such as virtual pointers and so on, if you chose to have virtual methods on your objects. But allocating an array of chars is just as expensive in C as in C++, in fact, they're probably both using malloc to do it. In terms of performance, C++ calls a constructor for each object in the array. Note that this is only done if there is one, the default constructor does nothing and is optimized away. As long as you're preallocating pools of data, to avoid memory fragmentation, you should be good to go. If you have simple POD-structs without virtual methods, and without constructors, there's no difference.
