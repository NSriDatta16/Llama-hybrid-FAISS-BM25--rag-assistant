My collaborator Rafael de Andrade Moral has written a R function that allows to estimate the uncertainty for L50 estimates according to 13 different methods, including the profile-likelihood method. We used this R function in our recently-published paper in Fisheries Research: Monitoring reproduction in fish: Assessing the adequacy of ogives and the predicted uncertainty of their L50 estimates for more reliable biological inferences to evaluate the coverage probability of different approaches, such as the Delta method, non-parametric bootstrapping and Fieller (1944)'s analytical approach. The profile-likehood method did pretty good but the Monte Carlo approach with BCa interval led to the best nominal coverage for the simulated dataset that we have analyzed. The R scripts for the profile-likelihood method (and others) to assess uncertainty in the L50 (or else such as the L95) is available at: https://github.com/rafamoral/L50/blob/main/confint_L.R The supplementary material of our MS contains information on how to use the confint_L() function. Cheers,
