How can we perfrom pre fitted standard scalar inverse transform on y variable in pipeline

I want to create pipeline which will inverse transform the y variable after model prediction I have 3 pickle files: X variable scalar transform pre fitted object :-X sclr Y variable scalar transform pre fitted object :-Y sclr svr model object:- model I imported it to python and now I want create pipeline using this file where input data will get scalar transformed by Xsclr parameter----> then model prediction will happen and then output of model will get inverse transformed using Y sclr object parameter The implementation would look like from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline pipe = Pipeline(steps=[(StandardScaler(), Xsclr), (SVR(), model), (InverseTransformer(), Ysclr)] ) I actually I wants to convert this pipeline to ONNX format... Afterwords.
