My guess would be looking at your expression which looks reasonable, that its a layout issue rather than code. Try setting widths a little wider than they are currently on the textboxes and try lining up the heights/locations (will have to be manual rather than dragging them around) of items on the left and right as the rendering has to use layout structures to position your items. Is it WebForms or WinForms?
