Just had the same issue. I wandered around within the source-code of jQuery and found this (in ui.droppable.js ): drag: function(draggable, event) { //If you have a highly dynamic page, you might try this option. It renders positions every time you move the mouse. if(draggable.options.refreshPositions) $.ui.ddmanager.prepareOffsets(draggable, event); ... So, you'd just have to use $(".cocktails").draggable({ refreshPositions: true, }); Seems not to be documented very much... but it fixed my problem. Makes everything a bit slower of course, I would advise some usage-dependent tweaking (enable it before the changes occur, and disable it once the user has moved his mouse and the changes have occured).
