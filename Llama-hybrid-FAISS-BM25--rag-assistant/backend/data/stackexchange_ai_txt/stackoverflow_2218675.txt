Can JQuery build DevExpress-like UI

I tried to use DevExpress's Controls in one of my projects for its smart and elegant UI interface. When I use normal html or asp controls, one of my page size is around 400KB at the client side. Using devexpress makes the size of that page around 1.2MB, which is almost 4 times the previous version, and I used only 3 round panels and a Date Edit. This project was intended to be used in my country, where people's browsing speed is usually 8-16kbps (kilo BIT per sec., of course :( ). So using devexpress in that page makes it really troublesome for the users to load that page. I heard that using jquery it is possible to build UI that is almost as same as DevExpress's Controls, but it will generate far less client-side code. Is it possible? If it is, then which JQuery plug-in should I use ?
