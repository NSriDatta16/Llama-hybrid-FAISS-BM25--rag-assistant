What is the proof that an MA(1) process is strictly stationary?

Suppose we have the moving average process: $X(t)=U(t)-aU(t-1)$ where $U(t)$ is a strictly stationary process. How can we prove that $X(t)$ is also strict and stationary in this case? For $X(t)$ to be strict sense stationery, all $N$-dimensional joint CDFs are invariant to arbitrary time-shifts $\tau$ : $P(X(t_{1})\le x_{1},...,X(t_{N})\le x_{N})=P(X(t_{1}+\tau)\le x_{1},...,X(t_{N}+\tau)\le x_{N})$
