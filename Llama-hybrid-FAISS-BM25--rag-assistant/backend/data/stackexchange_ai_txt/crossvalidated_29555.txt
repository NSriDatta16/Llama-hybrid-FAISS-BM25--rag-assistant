I guess the easiest way to solve this is: 1-P(no 1)-P(no 2)+P(no 1 or 2) = $1-0.7^8-0.9^8+0.6^8$ We have to add +P(no 1 or 2) because otherwise we would be subtracting it twice. Ie. P(no 1) includes the case where we don't roll 1 or 2 and so does the P(no 2). Another way would be to use Markov chain with states S={no 1 or 2, only 1, only 2, 1 and 2}. Corresponding transition matrix is: $ D = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0.6 & 0.3 & 0.1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.9 & 0 & 0.1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] $ Then calculate $D^8$ etc.
