I am just re-posting the comment of @Phil here because this is clearly the best answer: I would suggest looking into the relaimpo package, and its accompanying paper: jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v017i01/v17i01.pdf I use the "LMG" method frequently. I have been searching the answer to this question for 5 hours now, skim-reading some papers, and indeed relaimpo::lmg seems a great solution. One can also use relaimpo::pmvd , relaimpo::pratt (the latter corresponds to @user128460 's answer, and has the problem of sometimesyielding negative shares), or methods relying on random forest. See these papers for more info: https://doi.org/10.1198/000313007X188252 https://doi.org/10.7275/5FEX-B874 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832015001672 https://www.jstor.org/stable/25652309
