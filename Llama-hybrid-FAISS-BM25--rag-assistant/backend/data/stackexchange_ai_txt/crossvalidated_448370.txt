In Bayesian statistics we usually do not run classical null hypothesis testing, since we cal calculate things like $\Pr(\theta \gt 1 | X)$ directly. By using Bayes theorem, you calculate the posterior probability distribution for the parameter $$ p(\theta|X) \propto p(X|\theta) \, p(\theta) $$ and since you know the distribution, you can calculate the probability directly. You can either calculate it by-hand, if there exist closed form solution for the posterior (when using conjugate priors), or uses MCMC simulation to calculate it. When using MCMC (most common case), $\Pr(\theta \gt 1 | X)$ is just the number of posterior samples for $\theta$ such that $\theta>1$ , divided by the total number of posterior samples that you took.
