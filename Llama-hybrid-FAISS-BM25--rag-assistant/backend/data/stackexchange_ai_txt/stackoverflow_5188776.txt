Generating Sub-Arrays of Overlapping Ranges

my name is Timothy Sassone. I am working on developing some scheduling software of a sort in C#, but have run into some trouble. This last part of the program is intended to take a large list of weekly events (stored as day(s) of the week and a start and end time), and sort them into sub-lists containing events that overlap with one-another (such that no one could possibly have attended two of the events in the sublist). At the moment, it does this by finding the "longest" event in the list ((endTime-startTime)*numDays), and adding it and every course it overlaps with to a sub-list. It then finds all the "conflicts" (events which do not overlap) and resolves them while removing the fewest number of courses possible. This much I have, but with the number of ranges I have to deal with, I end up with a rather high number of sub-lists. Is there any better way to split the list, such that I end up with fewer sub-lists? I have considered a brute-force method, simply trying every possibility and going with the best, but the number of ranges is high enough (anywhere from 100-500 on average) that doing so could be rather slow. Any suggestions or pointers would be most appreciated. Thank you for your time, Timothy Sassone
