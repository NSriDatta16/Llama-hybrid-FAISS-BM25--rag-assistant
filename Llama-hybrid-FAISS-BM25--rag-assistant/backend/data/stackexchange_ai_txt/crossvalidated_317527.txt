Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in Cumulative Link Mixed Models

A simple summary in R of a cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) provides the AIC value - does anyone know how to find the BIC of CLMMs though? There is not a method listed anywhere in the Ordinal package documentation. I'd like to be able to report both.
