Trimming 0x00 in received DatagramPacket

In my Java app I receive DatagramPacket(s) through DatagramSocket. I know the maximum number of bytes which packet could contain, but actually every packet length varies (not exceeding max length). Let's assume that MAX_PACKET_LENGTH = 1024 (bytes). So every time DatagramPacket is received it is 1024 bytes long, but not always all bytes contains information. It may happen that packet has 10 bytes of useful data, and the rest of 1014 bytes is filled with 0x00. I am wondering if there is any elegant way to trim this 0x00 (unused) bytes in order to pass to the other layer only useful data? (maybe some java native methods? going in a loop and analysing what packet contains is not desired solution :)) Thanks for all hints. Piotr
