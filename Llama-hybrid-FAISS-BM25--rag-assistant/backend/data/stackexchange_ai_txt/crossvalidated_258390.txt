Why my prediction is too different from my testing data?

I have a problem with Time Series Analysis . Here is the link to my data. It is monthly data, starting from June 2008 until December 2016. I'm trying to build the ARIMA model on it. First, I split the data into training and testing sets. The testing set contains data from 12 months in 2016. # Spare the last year for testing trainData Create the time series for the trainData # Create time series trainData.ts And here is the plot: Then, I decompose the data. Finally, I build an ARIMA model, make a prediction, plot it together with the testing data. # Build ARIMA model model Here is my model: > model Series: trainData.ts ARIMA(0,1,2) Coefficients: ma1 ma2 -0.7115 -0.1775 s.e. 0.1130 0.1123 sigma^2 estimated as 118.3: log likelihood=-342.23 AIC=690.45 AICc=690.73 BIC=697.95 And the plot of my prediction: From the plot, I can see that my prediction is too different from the test data. I would like to know why. Did I do anything wrong? Or could you suggest me a better way for this? Thank you so much for your help. EDIT 2 I cleaned the data a bit. Then I force the auto.arima() to difference the seasonality by using model It seems the result is better with lower AIC, AICc, BIC. > model Series: trainData.ts ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,1)[12] with drift Coefficients: ar1 sar1 sar2 sma1 drift 0.1844 -0.2707 -0.0719 -0.8335 -0.1849 s.e. 0.1187 0.2253 0.1967 0.3912 0.0409 sigma^2 estimated as 107.5: log likelihood=-304.28 AIC=620.57 AICc=621.73 BIC=634.78
