Does a metric in ABC need be a true metric

I am considering a number of experiments using Approximate Bayesian Computation. In most of the literature I see reference to a metric function to calculate distance between observed and simulated summary statistics. My intuition would tell me that there is no reason that this distance function need be a true metric, i.e satisfying the four properties usually associated with a metric, in particular symmetry and the triangle inequality. Is there any argument or proof either way on this matter?
