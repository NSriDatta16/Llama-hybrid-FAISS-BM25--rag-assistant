The user agent string depends solely on the browser or whatever client you are using to make the request. It has nothing to do with the operating system, though most browsers will include some information about the OS version. For example, on my version of Firefox it is: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7 and on IE6 it is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Here, Windows NT 5.1 represents the OS version.
