For all practical purposes, you can use the usual statistical measures to convey the message of your statistical measures. Linear regression is a great tool to assess relationships between Likert outcomes, and so are proportional odds models with ordinal predictors. Using robust standard errors will protect you from having to make any parametric assumptions about the shape and distribution of the residuals in the model and the validity of the standard errors. The benefit over rank-based statistics, such as Spearman correlation, is that you actually obtain an averaged difference in Likert responses comparing individuals differing by 1 unit in the "independent" response. (e.g. what is the expected difference in proportions of individuals who would elect to hit somebody comparing individuals who found that metal was "excellent" versus "good").
