From my experience, using ASP.NET Forms implies an irrevocable surrender of control over your HTML output. It is better to accept the following: Microsoft form controls will sometimes use depreciated or flat-out wrong HTML. The Viewstate tag will always be there, even when ViewState is disabled at the page or site level. Apparently, there needs to be a ViewState to tell ASP.NET that there isn't a view state. You are not in control of form elements. There will be one form element per page, and it belongs to ASP.NET. JavaScript will be used to perform even rudimentary tasks. The JavaScript will be unreadable, directly embedded in your page, and at least 50% of it will be extraneous. You will not be able to create page fragments, unless you do it through a web service and a lot of kludge. Each .aspx page will have and almost always tags. If you want fine control over your page output, using MVC or another framework is all but mandatory. Even classic ASP will work, but not ASP.NET Forms.
