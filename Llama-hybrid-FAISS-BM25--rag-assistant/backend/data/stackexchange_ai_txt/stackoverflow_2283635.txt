The only persistent object in Vim is a buffer. Windows display buffers, tab pages organize windows. If you want to open NERD Tree in the new tab, then call :NERDTreeToggle . Another option would be to open a new tab, open NERD Tree, and then open the file in your freshly created tab. I wonder, though, why you would want to have a file tree open all the time. It's just a waste of space, most of the time. You can map a key to call :NERDTreeToggle to easily make it visible when you actually need to use it.
