There are a few different approaches that would be fairly straight forward. One option would be to fit using non-linear least squares where the vertex is one of the parameters (e.g. y = a + b*(x-c)^2 ). Then you can use profiling to calculate a confidence interval on the parameter of interest. Another option is to do a Bayesian fit using McMC methods and estimate the x and y coordinates of the vertex from each iteration and use those values to estimate the posterior and credible interval. Or, if the residuals are assumed to be normal (or at least close enough) then the estimated coefficients from the linear model follow a multivariate normal distribution. You can generate many observations from this distribution, compute the x and y coordinates of the vertex from these values and use those to estimate the distribution of the vertex points and compute the confidence interval from that.
