(This is not specific to logistic regression; it is true of any kind of regression model.) Both are presumably accurate. But they give an accurate answer different questions, so it shouldn't be surprising that the answers differ. In general, regression models do not estimate the direct association between a covariate and a response unless the units (e.g., patients) were randomly assigned and the levels of the covariate were independently manipulated (i.e., the data are drawn from a true experiment). If the data are from a true experiment, the coefficient from the treatment variable should be (approximately) the same in both the simple regression model and the multiple regression model. In any model, for any variable that was not independently manipulated and randomly assigned to the study units, the coefficient is an estimate of a marginal association. The only question is which marginal association is being estimated. There are potentially infinite margins to consider. You need to decide which you care about and why. For a clearer sense of the relevant issues, there are a few of my existing answers that may be helpful: For a conceptual overview of 'marginal': Intuition behind the names 'partial' and 'marginal' correlations The most directly relevant for your question: Is there a difference between 'controlling for' and 'ignoring' other variables in multiple regression? For additional visuals that may help to clarify the ideas: Alternatives to three dimensional scatter plot
