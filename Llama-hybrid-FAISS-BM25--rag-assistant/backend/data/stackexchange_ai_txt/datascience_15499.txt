Recommendation System to integrate with an android app

I need to build a recommendation system that takes certain parameters as input, computes a score and order suggestions to users based on this score. Well this is what I need to do loosely speaking. I am new to the scene of data science and haven't come across anything that could help me out. This guy asked a similar question 5 years ago. I basically need something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6828013/recommendation-systems-for-a-mobile-market-and-algorithm-suggestion Apologies for the open-ended and vague question. Just need to be pointed out in the right direction. Edit: I do not intend to place the system on the android device. It will be running back-end
