As far as I know there are no parallel implementations of SVM available directly in R. The benefit of running on RevolutionR is that it will parallelize the matrix computations through the use of the Intel MKL library. Since SVM relies on linear algebra you will achieve probably some performance gain. Another option that you could try and which may lead to better results is using Spark and SparkR which could expose the SVM in MLib that is part of Spark. I have not tried this myself yet but if you are stuck this might help.
