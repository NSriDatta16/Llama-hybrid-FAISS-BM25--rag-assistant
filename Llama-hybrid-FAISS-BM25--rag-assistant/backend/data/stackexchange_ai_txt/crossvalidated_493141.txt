The logit is used here as the link function. The RHS of (1) can range over the real numbers, and this is the reason for the logarithm, to ensure that the LHS also ranges over the realsâ€”without the logarithm it would only range over the non-negative real numbers. Further, this link function is the canonical link function. Other link functions include the probit and complementary log-log functions. See the generalized linear model Wikipedia page. Although the logit has a name, the interpretation of the coefficients are easier in a sense when you take the exponential of each side of (1). Then the LHS is the odds, which, if the regressor variable is continuous can be used to give an odds ratio interpretation of the regressor. There is a section about this on the logistic regression Wikipedia article. Equation (1) can also be rearranged to give a formula for the probability. So the logit on the LHS is used as the link function but once the logistic regression is fitted it is often rearranged to either get the odds or probabilities.
