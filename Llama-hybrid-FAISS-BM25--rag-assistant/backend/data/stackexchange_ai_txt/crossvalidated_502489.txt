With discrete/categorical variables like Gender (M, F), Coin tosses (H, T), Die rolls (1,2,3,4,5,6), etc. you need to use Logistic Regression instead of Linear Regression. There are many examples online which explain Logistic Regression. The core idea in Logistic Regression is to use "discrete" distributions like Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, etc. over observed variables, unlike Linear Regression which uses continuous distributions (Normal, Student-T). Likert scale values are indeed discrete - but they are very different from Gender/Coins in the sense that there is an ordering among values. a. For Coin toss, we can't claim H > T or H T . b. For Likert scale, 7 is better than 3 . Also, the difference between 6 and 7 is not the same as the difference between 8 and 9 . Most humans don't know how different is 55% from 60%, for example. 60% is better, sure - but is it the same as 60% -> 65% subjectively? Maybe not. To model these peculiar Likert scale data, we use something called Ordinal Regression. This lecture from Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking is a great primer on ordinal regression - here . Some examples on ordinal regression. Hope this helps :)
