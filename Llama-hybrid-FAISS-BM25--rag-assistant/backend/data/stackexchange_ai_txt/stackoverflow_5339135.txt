There was an issue with Visual Studio 2008 which is solved by not embedding the default manifest - one of the comments on that article suggests the problem still exists in Visual Studio 2010. In project properties -> Application tab -> Resources -> checkbox Icon and manifest , the setting "Embed manifest with default settings" caused the problem. Setting it to "Create application without a manifest" fixes the problem.
