Is there a correlation coefficent for "smooth" functions?

There is Pearson's, which measures linear relationships. There is also Spearman's, which can detect monotonic relationships. I am wondering if there is a similar coefficient someone has come up with for measuring the "smoothness" of some data. By "smoothness," I don't mean differentiable, but more as the term is used in image processing, where close inputs yield close outputs. My idea for such a metric: Given a reference point $(x_a,y_a)$ and a second data point $(x_b,y_b)$ , let $w_{ab} = distance(x_a,x_b)$ . Then the "smoothness" of the data is the weighted average of $distance(y_a,y_b)$ over all $a, b$ pairs with weights $w_{ab}$ . I'm wondering if a coefficient that measures something similar is already in widespread use. Seems to me it would be commonly used when a dataset is high-dimensional and one cannot simply graph the data to determine if nonlinear regression would be useful. Nothing is turning up in internet searches, but I suspect I am just not familiar with the academic terminology.
