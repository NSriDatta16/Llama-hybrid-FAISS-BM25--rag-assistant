Speaking as an occasional donor, I really don't care what my money gets spent on. My one and only goal when I donate is to encourage the developers to continue working on the project. If that means they all used it for beer money that's fine by me. :) So my advice would be, spend it on whatever you think will encourage you and the rest of the community to continue developing and let everyone know the how&why. For a first contribution a few beers seems like a great idea to me. "In celebration of our first contribution and a lot of hard work by all..." etc.
