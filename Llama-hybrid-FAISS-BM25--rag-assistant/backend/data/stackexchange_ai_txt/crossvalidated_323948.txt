You cannot compare the coeffcients that way because they are for a unit change in the predictor and the predictor variable may, in general, be measured on very different scales. I am afraid your understanding of linear regression is awry. A unit change in the predictor leads to a $\hat\beta$ change in the outcome. The position for logistic regression is outlined elsewhere on this site in answers to the question linked below Unless the text tells you then your guess is as good as mine. Note by the way that the coefficients are on the log scale What is the significance of logistic regression coefficients?
