Regression Interpretation

i have a regression where dependent variable is a share variable that ranges between 0 and 100%. And independent variables are % variables, like let's say % of people in a specific age group. Suppose, the regression equation is like Y=0.5X1,+0.3X2+intercept... I want to know how to interpret. Can i say, for a 1% change in X1 (which is a percentage variable), the Y goes up by 0.3%? (keeping all other variables constant).Likewise, can we say, if i change X2 by 1%, Y goes up by 0.2%? (keeping X1 constant) Also, how to quantify this part - keep all other variables constant. Should i keep the others at average?.Basically, i want to know mathematically, what number should i report for a 1% increase in X1 and 1% increase in X2? Please let me know, thank you
