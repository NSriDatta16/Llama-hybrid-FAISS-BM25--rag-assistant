How easy would It be to adapt Core Data to my app?

I'm a novice iphone developer, and just completed my first iphone app. After provisioning my iphone for development, I noticed that the app used way too much memory, and that several memory leaks that were issuing from the app accessing the sqlite database in the app caused the app to crash often. After running instruments, I have decided that CORE DATA sounds like a better way to go: of course I still need to use the sqlite database that I have. so my question is this: how easy would it be to adapt an already existing app to run on core data? My app basically shows 17,000 different mapView annotations in small amounts by county, though my database is very simple, just one giant spreadsheet basically. in the App delegate, my app opens the Sqlite database, puts some of the data into a locations object with four attributes, and then makes an array of those objects. the first view controller lets the user decide which county ( one of twelve or so) the user wishes to view, and then the last view controller uses a loop to add the selected locations to a mapView. How should I modify my app in the previous paragraph so that it uses CoreData? Can you point me to any resources that I can use to achieve this (preferably not the Dev Center's CoreData tutorial; overly confusing and more complicated than i need right now)? or do I have to make an entirely new project in xcode and start from scratch?
