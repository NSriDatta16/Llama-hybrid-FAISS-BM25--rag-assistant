I'm Abhijit and I would like to nominate myself. My journey on SO began in Dec 2009. While working on a hobby project I was looking for ways to parse HTML. I posted my first question asking how to use regex to parse and extract from HTML :) One of the comments had a link to the all time famous answer of why not to parse HTML using regex . I spent the entire evening reading it and other top Q&A. That day sort of triggered a programming knowledge chain reaction which is going on till today. SO is certainly one of the best things that has happened to programming and programmers. I've been around here for just over a year now. I've learnt a lot of things from this site and it's time to give something back to the community. I think I've made good use of the moderator tools currently available to me. You can see me re-tagging, re-framing, formatting, migrating questions whenever I'm online. My special focus being on new users who are not quite aware of how the site functions. I'll be honored to have the added responsibility of a moderator. Some things about me you'd like to know: I visit the site almost everyday. I know the site inside out. I spend a lot of time reading old posts and improving them if necessary. I'm active across decent number of tags. I've Electorate, Copy Editor, Fanatic, Sportsmanship, Pundit and Generalist badges. Gold badge in C, PHP, C++, Java and Regex and Silver badge in Perl. I visit meta frequently and have read almost all discussions going on there but I've not actively participated in meta Q&A. Available mostly between 0900hrs to 1900hrs IST If you have any question I'll be happy to answer. And I'm sorry for @Pranay Rana whose nomination dropped to #31 with my entry. Wishing him better luck next time.
