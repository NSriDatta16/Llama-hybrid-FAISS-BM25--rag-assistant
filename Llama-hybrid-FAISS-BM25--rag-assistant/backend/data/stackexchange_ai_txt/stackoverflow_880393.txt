Although I have looked at ReSharper I have not used it much. I have used DXCore and I like what they have done. VSX looks promising especially with MEF in VS2010 . If you were going for a more general audience I would say VSX. But since this is internal to your organization I would go with DXCore . More DXCore info here .
