Bayesian updating with conjugate prior (specific example)

This question deals with Bayesian updating with conjugate prior.Suppose we have a prior distribution of N~(5, 3) and then we observe 5 data points (8, 9, 10, 8, 7) (assumed to be taken randomly from a N~(9, 3) distribution). What would be the posterior after these observations in the form of N~(x, y)? I read the Wikipedia article on conjugate priors, but I want to have a more precise understanding of how to solve this specific problem. If there is no way to solve it without assuming some things, can you please explain what needs to be known and solve under very simple assumptions? Thank you in advance.
