Sum of Random Forest prediction intervals?

I'm using a Random Forest model for prediction, where the value I'm interested in is the aggregate of these predictions (that is, the total sum of all predicted values). I want to also derive confidence intervals for this aggregated value. Using the quantregForest package I've managed to derive 95% confidence limits for each of my Random Forest predicted values. From what I've read from posts concerning linear regression (e.g. The "sum" of prediction intervals ), I can't just sum the limits of the confidence interval for each of the predictions to produce an overall estimate. How do I then go about producing an 'overall' confidence interval for my aggregated values? Thanks! Edit: Specifically, I'm using a RF to predict values spatially (e.g. country-wide), where the sum I'm interested in is the value of predictions within a certain area.
