You have positioned all of the content inside the frontwidth divs absolute. Absolute positioning takes elements out of the flow and all other elements are positioned as if they weren't there. The best solution would be not to use position: absolute (which is a "last resort" thing to use usually anyway). Instead float the image left and give the title and text a left margin. Some more advice: Many of your images are lacking alt attributes. Your source code is a big div soup. "Table-less layout" doesn't mean "only use div s". Don't wrap things in div s for the heck of it. For example it's unnecessary to wrap each image in a div. You can apply the style directly to the images. And use meaningfull elements like h1 , h2 , etc. for headlines, p for text paragraphs, ul and li for lists (menues), etc. div s are "last resort" thing, too. Only use them if no other HTML element is suitable.
