You must use some form of storage external to the Apache processes. Basic choices: A database. Shared memory (OS dependent). Another process and use an IPC mechanism (eg. a socket) A file. Which one is appropriate depends on your requirements, and you might combine them. For example, "a database" is actually implemented as another process that makes things persistent in a file and it deals with concurrency issues in a known way. In general, a database is probably the first thing to try and only go to other alternatives if you have specific issues that can be solved by taking a different approach.
