Like you did for taking the average BMI for a group of adults. You first calculate the BMI per individual. After that you take the average of all individual BMI's. And compare the group mean to a chart. (note that you comparison of average is quite rough. you could have an average BMI of 24.8, yet you know that it would be simplistic to classify the group as normal) You don't use the average height and weights $\bar{BMI} \neq \frac{\bar{w}}{\bar{l}^2} $ but instead $\bar{BMI} = \bar{\left( \frac{w}{l^2} \right) }$. A similar logic works for the children: For the group with mixed ages and gender you do something similar. You first calculate the BMI per individual and compare it to the percentiles in a chart (if I am not mistaken these charts exist for >2yrs). After that calculation for each individual you take the mean of the percentiles or use some other measure (Instead of the mean of percentiles you could use the mean of the relative difference from the mean, z-value, amount of people above/below the median, etc. why? for example because a person in the 50th percentile and a person in the 99th percentile, half the group overweight, is not the same as a two persons in the 75th percentile, the entire population normal. This concept is also a problem in the comparison that you make for adult groups.)
