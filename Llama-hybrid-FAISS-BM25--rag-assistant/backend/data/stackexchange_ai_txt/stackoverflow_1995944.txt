A good place to look for information on the downloading part is the libwww-perl cookbook . Here's some rudimentary sample code. It isn't necessarily the best way, but it's one that should work, assuming you have the LWP module (available from CPAN). #!/usr/bin/perl use warnings; use strict; use LWP::Simple; while (my $site = ) { my $doc = get $site; if (defined($doc)) { if ( $doc =~ m/ (.*) /i ) { print "$1\n"; } } } You might want to add more bells and whistles, for unescaping text, handling error conditions, doing requests in parallel with multiple threads, faking user-agent as Mozilla etc :) If you saved this as titlegrab.pl, and you had a list of sites in sites.list (one URL per line), you could use this with $ cat sites.list | perl titlegrab.pl to see all the titles. Or.. redirect to some output file, e.g. $ cat sites.list | perl titlegrab.pl > results.txt
