Lucero's second paragraph is the correct approach. Coach and Manager are not kinds of people, they are roles that people play. Theoretically the same person could be a TeamPlayer, TeamCaptain, Coach, Manager, and WaterBoy! So what you want is composition, not inheritance. For example: SportsClub myClub = new SportsClub(); Person Bill = new Person(); myClub.Manager = new Manager(Bill); myClub.Coach = new Coach(Bill);
