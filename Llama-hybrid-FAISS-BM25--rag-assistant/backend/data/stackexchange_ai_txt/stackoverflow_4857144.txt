Azure tables are not optimized for table scans. Scanning the table might be acceptable for a long-running background job, but I wouldn't do it when a quick response is needed. With a table of any reasonable size you will have to handle continuation tokens as the query reaches a partition boundary or obtains 1k results. The Azure storage team has a great post which explains the scalability targets . The throughput target for a single table partition is 500 entities/sec. The overall target for a storage account is 5,000 transactions/sec.
