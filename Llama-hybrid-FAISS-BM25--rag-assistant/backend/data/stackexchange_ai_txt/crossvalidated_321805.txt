Statistical significance of changing a hyperparameter

Suppose we have a machine learning model (e.g. an SVM) and we've run a search over multiple hyperparameters (e.g. kernel, C) to gauge performance. How would we gauge whether changing one parameter (e.g. C: 1.0 -> 1.5) creates a statistically significant difference in performance? Could we determine aggregate statistical significance over a parameter (e.g. changing C affects model performance more than changing the kernel over all trials)?
