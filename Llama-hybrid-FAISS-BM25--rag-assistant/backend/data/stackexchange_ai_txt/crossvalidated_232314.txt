I believe that the reason why we don't have the option to calculate variable importance on newer data is more a computational/complexity issue rather than actual practicality? This is because when training the Random Forest model we are already looking at decrease in Gini to optimise splits so essentially we are getting variable importance information for free when training the model. Whereas to calculate mean decrease in gini on newer data would require us to go back into the trees and almost repeat the training procedure. Also as mean decrease in accuracy (which is in the same importance function) uses the "Out Of Bag" data which is not possible on new data that isn't used for training - I guess adding the option to calculate importance on a dataset other than the development one wasn't considered.
