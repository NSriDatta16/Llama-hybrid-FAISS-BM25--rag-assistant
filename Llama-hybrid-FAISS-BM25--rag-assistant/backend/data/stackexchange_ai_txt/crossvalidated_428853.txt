Are there better methods than NHST for comparing groups?

This article suggests we take this approach when attempting to conclude significant statistical difference between groups: If this method is valid, is this the best approach when concluding statistical difference between groups? After looking at Bayesian approaches, my understanding is if you can assign a prior distribution with some backing (how would you do this?) then a Bayesian approach provides you with richer information, compared to a NHST.
