How can a Java class have no no-arg constructor?

The Oracle Java tutorial site has this paragraph that is confusing me: All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor. This default constructor calls the class parent's no-argument constructor, or the Object constructor if the class has no other parent. If the parent has no constructor (Object does have one), the compiler will reject the program. If all objects directly or indirectly inherit from Object how is it possible to elicit the compiler rejection spoken of? Does it have to do with the constructor being private?
