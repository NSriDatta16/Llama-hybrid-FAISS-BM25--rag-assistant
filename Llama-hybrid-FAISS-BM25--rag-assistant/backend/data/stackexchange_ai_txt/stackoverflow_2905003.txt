What is the best way to hide these characters or remove the padding? I do not know of a way to do that. Also, is there any variant of Helvetica font, freely available that would have ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK-SPACE character? Considering that Helvetica is very similar to the built-in Droid Sans, I am not sure why you are bothering embedding Helvetica in an application. Also, by definition, there is no "freely available" Helvetica font, as that font is not free. That being said, given a font that lacks the ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK-SPACE glyph, have somebody open your font file and add in the glyph. We did that on one consulting project of mine, and it worked out well. I am under the impression that a graphic artist may know how to do this.
