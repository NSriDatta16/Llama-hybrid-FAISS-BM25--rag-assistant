I think you have almost answered your own question 1. If the measures are about the same latent variables but just in different manifest forms then that is what SMD is designed for but if they are really measuring different latent variables then you will have much difficulty persuading your readers that this was a sensible thing to do. As far as question 2 is concerned I would suggest a meta-regression here is a sensible approach. It would be best if there was more than one instance of any given therapy type as otherwise you may have to have a rag-bag category which is always less convincing. If the moderator variable of therapy type does not seem to affect much you could always report that fact and use the analysis without moderator but I personally would go with the meta-regression even in that case as once you decide to do it you should persist.
