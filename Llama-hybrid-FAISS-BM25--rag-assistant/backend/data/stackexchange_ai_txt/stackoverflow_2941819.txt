Like others said, there is no studies... because nobody is interested. There is no measurable difference. Take almost any book on project management and you'll see no mention of languages barring examples, no relying on specific language features. Most time any money consuming problems over project life cycle are not coding problems, but architectural and organizational. To put things in perspective, if you encounter serious drawback of the language and have to implement some workaround - you lose a few hours. Maintaining person might spent some more hours understanding what and why you did there A work day or two will be lost. Well, if you come to work in a wrong mood, you lose the same day. If you have problems understanding requirement or communicating with colleagues and management, you easily lose weeks and months.
