You need to move certificate from CurrentUser windows certificate storage to LocalMachine storage (eg. using Certificates MMC console), then change parameters of your X509Store constructor from StoreLocation.CurrentUser to StoreLocation.LocalMachine. Another option is to store certificate in PFX file and load it from there, but you need to take care about security of the password used when loading PFX file from disk.
