How can I reorganize my code into classes in C#?

I'm working on a project in C# w/ XNA, and I want to reorganize it and divide parts of it into classes. At present, it's just one game.cs file, but I want to clean it up a bit. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with classes. Perhaps someone can help me figure out how to do this, or direct me to some tutorial of some sort?
