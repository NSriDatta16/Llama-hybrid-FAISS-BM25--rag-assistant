Windows Phone 7 applications - Orientation Change

Hello there fellow developers! I am working on a Windows Phone 7 app and I can't figure out what I believe is a simple problem for the more seasoned ones. Say I have a layout consisting of two elements: a ListBox (filled with an abundance of items) and a TextBlock (providing the user with some basic instructions). I want these to be one above the other when the device is in Portrait orientation and I want these to be next to each other when the device orientation changes to Landscape. For the Portrait orientation I am using a Grid layout manager, as it lets me define the rows' heights like so... row 0 Height="2*" , row 1 Height="*" Listbox sits in row 0, TextBlock in row 1. Now, what would be really neat is to simple change the RowDefinition s into ColumnDefinition s and reassign the listbox/textblock to the grid's columns instead of rows for when the device switches into Landscape. But that's just my idea. I don't know how to get this done elegantly. Maybe there's a better approach to this? Or maybe this is the correct approach and there is some method built for exactly this purpose? Thank you for your suggestions!
