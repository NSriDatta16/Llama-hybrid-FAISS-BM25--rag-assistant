As for the Mercurial side, the recommendation is also to refactor large legacy CVS/SVN repositories into smaller components. Common code should be put into its own libraries, and the application code will then depend on those libraries in a similar way to how it depends on other libraries. Mercurial has the forest extension which allows you to manage a "forest" of "source trees". With that approach you combine several smaller repositories into a larger one. With CVS you do the opposite: you checkout a smaller portion of a large repository. I have not personally used the forest extension and its page says that one should use an updated version compared to the one bundled with Mercurial. However, it is used by a big organization like Sun in its OpenJDK project . There is also currently work underway to add sub-repository report directly to the core of Mercurial, as per the design on nested repositories page in the Mercurial wiki.
