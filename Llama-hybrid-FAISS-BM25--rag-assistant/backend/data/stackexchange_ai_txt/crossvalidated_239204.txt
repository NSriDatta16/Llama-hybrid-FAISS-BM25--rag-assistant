For any single prediction you can't, any more than we can tell if the claim "this coin has a 60% chance of coming up heads" is close to correct from a single toss. However, you can assess his methodology across many predictions -- for a given election he makes lots of predictions, not just of the presidential race overall but many predictions relating to the vote for the president and of many other races (house, senate, gubnertorial and so on), and he also uses broadly similar methodologies over time. There are many ways to do this assessment (some fairly sophisticated), but we can look at some relatively simple ways to get some sense of it. For example you could split the predictions of the probability of a win up into bands of e.g. (50-55%, 55-65% and so on) and then see what proportion of the predictions in that band came up; the proportion of 50-55% predictions that worked should be somewhere between 50-55% depending on where the average was (plus a margin for random variation*). So by that approach (or various other approaches) you can see whether the distribution of outcomes were consistent with predictions across an election, or across several elections (if I remember right, I think his predictions have been more often right than they should have been, which suggests his standard errors have on average been slightly overestimated). * we have to be careful about how to assess that, though because the predictions are not independent.
