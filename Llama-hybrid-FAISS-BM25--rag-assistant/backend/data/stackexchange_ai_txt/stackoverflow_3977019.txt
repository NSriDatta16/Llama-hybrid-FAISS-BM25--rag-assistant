Well, in the first case the number of logical reads is 10+10, in the second 1000+1000, with each department being read on average 100 times. However, writing queries with the ORDERED hitn like this is not normal practice. It's best to leave optimisation to the optimiser most of the time. I'm not sure exactly which documentation you got that quote from, but where I have seen it it is preceded by this very important paragraph that you omitted. I quote it here for the benefit of others who may otherwise think this method of writing queries is standard: Normally optimizer picks the best execution plan, an optimal order of tables to be joined. In case the optimizer is not producing a good execution plan you can control the order of execution using the HINTS feature SQL.
