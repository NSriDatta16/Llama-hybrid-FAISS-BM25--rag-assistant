Can iPhone auto redirect be disabled if user wants to view full site?

I am basically producing a simple, watered down, iPhone specific sites on a sub-domain of the original. I know of various auto redirects, like the htaccess & user agent scripts/rules that take the user straight to the iPhone specific site, but these scripts do not cater for someone who has come from the iPhone specific site that wants to view the full version because they are just redirected again back to the iPhone specific site. Do you see my problem? My favoured form of redirect is htaccess, is there a way to disregard an htaccess rule if the user has come from the sub (iPhone specfic) domain so that they can view the main site without problem? Of course I am open to suggestion if the htaccess rule isn't the way to go. Many thanks
