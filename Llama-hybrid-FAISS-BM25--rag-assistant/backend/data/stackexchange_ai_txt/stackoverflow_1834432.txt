Faster for a single call in isolation, or for a flood of thousands of calls? NetMsmq uses MSMQ message queueing - you're putting your message into a queue handled by MSMQ, and the service will get it from that queue eventually and work on it. You don't get instant feedback, the messages are one-way only. NetTcp on the other hand is like http - only faster. You send a request to the service and get back a response (if all goes well) right away. No message queueing per se involved, your messages are request/reply. So I don't think you can compare the two bindings, really. They serve totally different purposes: if you want to e.g. look up a zip code and get back the longitude/latitude of that location, you definitely want a request/response mechanism --> use netTcp if you want to deposit requests to e.g. print a document, or reorganize a database, or something of that nature - something that needs to be tended to eventually, but you don't expect back a response right away (but you can later check if the message has been handled properly), then use a message queueing system Hope that makes things a bit clearer - I don't think these two really are geared towards the same set of operations, so you most likely won't ever have to choose between those two directly :)
