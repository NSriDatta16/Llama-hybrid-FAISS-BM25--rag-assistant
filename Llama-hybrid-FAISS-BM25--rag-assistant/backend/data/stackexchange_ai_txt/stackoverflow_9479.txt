My experience is that it really depends on what you're trying to do and who/where the users are. While WAP got a lot of bad press, it's strength is where you have low bandwidth high-latency connections. The WML content gets optimised by the carrier's gateway to greatly reduce the amount of data transmitted over the air. If you have iPhones and the like, in areas with solid 3G coverage you can afford to go for richer content, but if you want an app to still perform well in more out of the way areas, WAP has a big advantage. One thing to watch out for with WAP is that the quality of the WAP support in handsets varies a lot (guess you'd also say the same for smartphone web browsers). Most of them display pages ok, but the form handling is truly awful in some browsers. If you vary content based on user-agent, you should also provide an explicit way to access a specific type of content (e.g. seperate uri's) - the automated choice is not always right and you want the client to be able to override it . If you go with WAP development check out WinWAP - a Windows-based WAP browser.
