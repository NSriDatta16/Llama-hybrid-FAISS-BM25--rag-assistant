Variance explained is easily understandable and very usefull, but I have never seen it applied to autoencoders. You can still compare these methods and you should! You can transform the embeddings you created with NMF and PCA back to their original space and then calculate the mean squared error. You can use PCA to get an understanding of the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, and then design the autoencoder after seeing the results.
