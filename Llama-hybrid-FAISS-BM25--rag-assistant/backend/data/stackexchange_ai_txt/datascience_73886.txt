You have tagged the question with reinforcement-learning , but you describe a labeled dataset, suggesting supervised learning. I will try to cover both cases. There are some techniques that are applicable in both supervised learning and reinforcement learning: Sample from the buffer conditioning on the action, to have a balanced dataset regarding action taken. Apply data augmentation techniques on the minority action class. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) algorithm may be an option for that. The problem with data augmentation is that you would need to do it in the RL loop, which can enlarge the needed computation time. Note that to apply them for reinforcement learning, you should use a replay buffer, like they do in the DeepMind Atari paper . If you are in a supervised learning scenario, you can apply class weights, e.g. this example in Keras .
