You have 48 readings per day for a year and a half. We have found that by combining memory effects (ARIMA) and deterministic effects like day-of-the-week , level/trend effects with daily effects as a predictor some reasonable results can be developed while adjusting for anomalous readings and daily trends. The trick is to develop a daily total forecast that also uses the aforementioned structure while optimally incorporating lead and lag effects around holidays , particular days-of-the-month , weekend effects and even weeks within a month , etc . Model identification procedures to reconcile 1/2 hour forecasts and daily forecasts and of course the lead/lag holiday effects are available in commercial products like AUTOBOX ( which I have helped to develop ) and to a much lesser degree in products like SAS and SPSS. In my opinion free software within R is insufficient to deal with the model identification opportunities provide by data that you have available but it is free and may provide a start. I would suggest that you approach serious providers of time series software and deliver your data and ask them for a free demo. Review the proposals and then either make or buy the solution that is best for you.
