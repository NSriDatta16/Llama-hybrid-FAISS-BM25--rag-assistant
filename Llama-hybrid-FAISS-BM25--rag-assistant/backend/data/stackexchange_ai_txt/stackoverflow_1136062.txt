The Aggregate function would come in handy here. var sum = list.Aggregate((acc, cur) => acc + cur); var average = list.Aggregate((acc, cur) => acc + cur) / list.Count; Just insure that you have the / operator defined for types PointD and int , and this should do the job. Note: I'm not quite sure whether you want the sum or average here (your question is somewhat ambiguous about this), but I've included examples for both.
