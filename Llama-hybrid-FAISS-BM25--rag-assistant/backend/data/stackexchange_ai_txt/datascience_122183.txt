Is there an unified pipeline to convert a 4D nifti noisy pet scan image to an averaged, denoised, 3D Nifti image?

What I'm looking is to do at least the step 2 of ADNI pre processing (coregistered, averaged): https://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis-method/pet-analysis/ OASIS-3 dataset provides FDG PET images but they are noise and in 4D, so I suspect they are "raw" images without pre processing. Is there an unified PET processing pipeline to do this pre processing? At least coregister, average, and best scenario all the ADNI pre processing steps.
