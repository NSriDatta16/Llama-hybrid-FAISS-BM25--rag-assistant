Do I need to check for Autocorrelation, Heteroskedasticity and Normality when building a model with data that are not time series?

I want to build a simple regression model with non-time series such as Client ID Number. when testing the validity of this model, do I need to check for autocorrelation, Heteroskedasticity and Normality?
