ASP.NET MVC Routes to Mimic Object Graph Traversal?

I'm new to ASP.NET MVC and all tutorials, samples, and the like I seem to find are very basic. Is it possible (and if yes, a good design) to have routes like so: .../Organization/10/User/5/Edit .../Organization/10/User/List In other words; can the urls mirror your domain model?
