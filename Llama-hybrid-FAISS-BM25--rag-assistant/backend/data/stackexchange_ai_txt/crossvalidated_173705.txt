This is where quasiexperimental designs can be useful. In many situations in practice, experimental designs are not practical because, although you have a treatment, you are not able to perform random assignment to groups or maybe you only have one group. In your education example, you may not have control over who receives the treatment because you intend to perform the intervention to all the kids in one school. However, you maybe able to compare their scores to scores from previous years, or randomize classrooms so that some classes receive the intervention before others, or compare multiple schools including those that did not receive the intervention. It might make sense to do an interrupted time series design where you have just one group, but take measurements constantly, and administer the treatment in the middle of your study duration. This way, you can see if the slope of the dependent variable over time changed right after the treatment, relative to the overall slope across the entire study. The number of measurements can be as low as 3, but more the better. So, my suggestion is to read up on quasiexperimental study designs.
