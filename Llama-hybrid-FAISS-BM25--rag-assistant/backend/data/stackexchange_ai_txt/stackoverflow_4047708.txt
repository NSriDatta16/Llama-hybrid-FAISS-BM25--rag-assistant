What's the best way to do this (iPhone SDK UI question)

Here's what I need to do: I will have a toolbar with multiple objects on it (for this we'll call them A,B,C,D) and I want to be able to have the user click and drag them around and be able to snap them to a grid and connect to each other. Sounds easy, right? Well here's my problem: some objects are different sizes, so A could be a 1x1, B be 1x3, C be 3x4, etc. So how should I do this? I was thinking about just having each element as a separate UIImageView (or UIView, haven't decided yet) that can be dragged around, then take it's location and see what images are next to it. Another thing is I have to be able to export these locations to either xml or json (not sure yet, probably xml)
