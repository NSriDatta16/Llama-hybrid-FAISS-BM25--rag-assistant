There are different "types" of centers of a triangle. Details on: The Centers of a Triangle . A quick method for finding a center of a triangle is to average all your point's coordinates. For example: GLfloat centerX = (tri[0].x + tri[1].x + tri[2].x) / 3; GLfloat centerY = (tri[0].y + tri[1].y + tri[2].y) / 3; When you find the center, you will need to rotate your triangle about the center. To do this, translate so that the center is now at (0, 0). Perform your rotation. Now reverse the translation you performed earlier.
