We want to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i) (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0$, which is the same as $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i ) (x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i (x_i - \bar{x})$. This roughly says that the weighted average of fitted $y$ values equals the weighted average of actual $y$ values, using weights $x_i - \bar{x}$. For this we just need to do some algebra and remember the definitions $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$ and $\hat{\beta}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y}) (x_i - \bar{x}) / \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$. Let's start with the left hand side \begin{align} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i ) (x_i - \bar{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i ) (x_i - \bar{x}) \\ &= \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x}) + \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 . \end{align} We know the first term is zero, and the sum of squares $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ cancels with the denominator of $\hat{\beta}_1$ leaving us with just $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y}) (x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i (x_i - \bar{x})$, which is what we wanted to show.
