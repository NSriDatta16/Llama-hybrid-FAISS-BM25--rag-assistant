Intranet Frameworks like SharePoint makes me think the whole corporate world is one giant ostrich with its head in the sand I'm not only talking about MOSS here, I've worked with some other CORPORATE INTRANET products, and absolutely not one of them are great, but SharePoint (MOSS) is by far the worst. Most of these systems don't easily bridge the gap between Intranet and Internet. So as a remote worker you're forced to VPN in. External customers just don't have the luxury of getting hold of your internal information first hand. Sure this can be fixed at a price $$$. The search capabilities are always pathetic. Lots of time other departments simply don't know about information is out there. Information fragments, people start boycotting workflows or revert to email SharePoint development is the most painful form of development on the planet. Nothing sucks like SharePoint. I've seen a few developers contemplating quitting IT after working for over a year with MOSS. No matter how the developers hate MOSS, no matter how long the most basic of projects take to roll out, no matter how novice the results look, and no matter how unsearchable and fragmented the content is: EVERYONE STILL CONTINUES TO USE AND PURCHASE SHAREPOINT, AND MANAGERS STILL TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND ITS NOT SATANS SPAWN. Microformats Using CSS classes originally designed for visual layout - now being assigned for both visual and contextual data is a hack, loads of ambiguity. Not saying the functionality should not exist, but fix the damn base language. HTML wasn't hacked to produce XML - instead the XML language emerged. Now we have these eager script kiddies hacking HTML and CSS to do something it wasn't designed to do, thats still fine, but I wish they would keep these things to themselves, and no make a standard out of it. Just to some up - butchery!
