Wpf TreeView's ScrollViewer Adjustment

I am using a Wpf TreeView, in which I am adding nodes at runtime. Some times tree goes bigger and ScrollViewer comes into picture(that is part of TreeView's ControlTemplate). But everytime I add a node, I can not see it, cos it is outside the page area, I need to drag the vertical ScrollBar's thumb down in order to see it. so I want the vertical ScrollBar to automatically drag to the point where the node is added so that I can see the node while adding it. Any help please!!
