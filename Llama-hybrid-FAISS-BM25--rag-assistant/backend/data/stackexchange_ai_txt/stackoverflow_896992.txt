Found it. According to the book "Accelerated SQL Server 2008" page 160 - the size of the siganture depends on the size of the private key in certificate. If size is 2048-bit then signature size will be 256-byte. If size is 1024-bit then signature size will be 128-byte. In my case I was creating certificates using CREATE CERTIFICATE TSQL statement and - according to SQL Server Books Online: Private keys generated by SQL Server are 1024 bits long so my max size for sign column is 128 bytes.
