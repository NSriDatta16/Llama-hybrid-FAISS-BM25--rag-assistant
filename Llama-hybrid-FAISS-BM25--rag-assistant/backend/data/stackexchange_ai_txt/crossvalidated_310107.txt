In general, any R operation will become less efficient as $n$ increases. Especially problematic is that we can't immediately assume any convenient representation of these data, like independence, so the covariance matrix must be supplied explicitly in the form of an $n \times n$ matrix. Complicating matters further is that you are basically calling for the evaluation of an $n$-dimensional integral. Inspecting the workhorse code for pmvnorm reveals a bit more insight to the problem. Much work has gone into developing better algorithms. See here from the package author. The approach used here is an adaptation of MCMC integration by using what he calls "quasi" random samples. It is an iterative, sampling based procedure that has an unproven complexity, but some intuition can be gained from Figure 3. To improve computation, pre-process your data. If $\Sigma$ is block diagonal or approximately block diagonal, parse the problem into multiple smaller problems with smaller $n$.
