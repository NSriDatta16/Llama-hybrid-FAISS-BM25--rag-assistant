Is there any value in having the files stored in separate, dated folders as opposed to a large repository? I would recommend using a single directory repository and having a general file handler. Overtime it will prove to be useful. The record ID prepending the file name is a good idea if it's relevant to the file. I've often prepended a timestamp. We've built several file-storage systems using native FTP functions within the language (PHP) and use the timestamp prepend method and it's proven to be very effective.
