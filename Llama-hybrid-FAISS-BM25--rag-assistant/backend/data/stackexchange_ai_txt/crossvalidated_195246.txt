How to handle ordinal categorical variable as independent variable

I am using a logit model. My dependent variable is binary. However I have an independent variable which is categorical and contains the responses: 1.very good, 2.good, 3.average, 4.poor and 5.very poor . So, it is ordinal ("quantitative categorical"). I am not sure how to handle this in the model. I am using gretl . [Note from @ttnphns: Although the question says the model is logit (because the dependent is categorical), the crucial issue - ordinal independent variables - is basically alike, be the dependent categorical or quantitative. Therefore the question is equally relevant to, say, linear regression too - as it is to logistic regression or other logit model.]
