How to compare Observed vs Predicted Outcomes for a Binary Dependent Variable

I have created a binary Logistic Regression model to predict if patients in a particular state, will die based on 10 or so predictors (demographics, income, physiological values, etc.) My dependent variable (death) is binary and I converted my predicted probabilities from continuous to binary by assigning cutt-off values for alive/dead (group associations). The goal is to see if the amount of observed deaths, within a given year, is close to the predicted amount. So far I have validated the performance of the model using other methods (analyzing calibration and discrimination) and am now using it to see if the state had more or less observed deaths than the predicted amount. So for 1999, the model predicted 35 patients to die when in reality, 54 patients had actually died. How do I determine if the 54 patient deaths is, or is not, significantly different from the predicted 35 patients? Side Note: I am just an undergraduate student without advanced training in statistics/SPSS. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
