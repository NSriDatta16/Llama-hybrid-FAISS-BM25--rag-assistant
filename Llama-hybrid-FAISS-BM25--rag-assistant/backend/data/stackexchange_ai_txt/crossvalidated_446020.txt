Time Series Cross Validation tsCV Method

I have a time-series that I am trying to fit an autoregression model to. I am trying to use the tsCV method. From the help page I find this: tsCV computes the forecast errors obtained by applying forecastfunction to subsets of the time series y using a rolling forecast origin. and from the details section I see Let y contain the time series y[1:T] . Then forecastfunction is applied successively to the time series y[1:t] , for t=1,â€¦,T-h , making predictions f[t+h] . In the examples we have far2 meaning that forecast(Arima(x,order=c(2,0,0)),h=h) would be applied successively to the time series lynx using the rolling forecast origin. To make this only slightly more complicated, there is also the window argument which provides a rolling window instead of a rolling origin. My question is: when we apply forecast(Arima(x,order=c(2,0,0)),h=h) repeatedly are we repeatedly training a new ARIMA model on the new window of the time-series data? Or, is there some how and somewhere a persistent ARIMA model that is trained only once and then referenced for the further calls of the forecast method?
