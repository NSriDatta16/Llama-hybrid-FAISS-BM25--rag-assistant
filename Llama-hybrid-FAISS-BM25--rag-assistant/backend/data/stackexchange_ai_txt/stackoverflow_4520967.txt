It looks like you should just be able to specify the argument slotMinutes in the options when you initialize the calendar: $('#calendar').fullCalendar({ header: { left: 'prev,next today', center: 'title', right: 'month,agendaWeek,agendaDay' }, slotMinutes: 5, // .. etc }); However, as shown by this example (click 'day' view and you should see a few events), the day view now has a scale of 5 minutes on the left. Not sure that there's any way around this (i.e., show 30 minute intervals on the scale, but allow the events to be dragged by 5 minute intervals). Hope that helps!
