Yes: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#radio At all times, exactly one of the radio buttons in a set is checked. If none of the elements of a set of radio buttons specifies `CHECKED', then the user agent must check the first radio button of the set initially. The specification uses the term "user agent" for what is commonly known as "browser" . So the specification says that if none is checked, the browser will check the first. UPDATE: note that none of the 4 Browsers i tried actually does this! They dont check the first and none of the radios are given as =on to the server. A good web framework should do the serverside-checking (it should do it anyway because an abrupted or forged POST could cause the same).
