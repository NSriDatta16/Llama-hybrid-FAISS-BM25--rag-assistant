Magento's EAV system is pretty strung out among several files, so you won't find a single function that accomplishes what you want. If you did go looking for it, and changed it, you would also be changing the same save method that mostly every other object in Magento uses, which is probably not what you want. To do what you want, try setting up an observer/listener on the events that catalog products use when saving, namely catalog_product_save_before or catalog_product_save_after . That way, you don't have to hack the framework. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
