The HTML 4.01 specification states: Authors should use "&amp;" (ASCII decimal 38) instead of "&" to avoid confusion with the beginning of a character reference (entity reference open delimiter). Authors should also use "&amp;" in attribute values since character references are allowed within CDATA attribute values. So encoding the & as &amp; is correct behavior since the interpretation of the src attribute value ( CDATA data type ) is described as: CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character set and may include character entities. User agents should interpret attribute values as follows: Replace character entities with characters, Ignore line feeds, Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space. Otherwise src attribute values like /foo?bar&sect=123 would be ambiguous as they can be interpreted either literally as /foo?bar&sect=123 or (replacing the sect entity ) as /foo?barÂ§=123 .
