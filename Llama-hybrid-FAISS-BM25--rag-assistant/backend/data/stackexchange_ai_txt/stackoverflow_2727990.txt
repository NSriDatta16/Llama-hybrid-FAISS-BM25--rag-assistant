New NCover 3.4.2 makes all my MSTest unit tests fail

Yesterday, I decided to install the newest NCover version (3.4.2). However, when I ran it on my existing .ncover configuration file, the NCover output suddenly reported that all my MSTest tests failed. Of course those tests succeed when ran within Visual Studio. Because of this, NCover isn't able to determine any coverage. Somehow the old configuration doesn't seem to work with the new version. Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be or how to solve it? Btw. Here is my ncover configuration. Project settings: Path to application to profile: c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\MSTest.exe Arguments for the application to profile: /testcontainer:D:\dev\MyApp\MyApp.Services.Tests.Unit\bin\Debug\MyApp.Services.Tests.Unit.dll /testcontainer:D:\dev\MyApp\MyApp.WS.Tests.Unit\bin\Debug\MyApp.WS.Tests.Unit.dll Working folder: D:\dev\MyApp
