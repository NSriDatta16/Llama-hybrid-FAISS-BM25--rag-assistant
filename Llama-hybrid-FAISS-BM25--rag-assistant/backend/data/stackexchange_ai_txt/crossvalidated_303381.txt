I suggest two consideration before modelling. Are you or not comparing fecundities of species through their lifetime? Poisson distribution might not be the case here if you do compare in this way, because species might have different lifespan on the same host plant, Poisson however refer to occurrence of events at the same time interval. Non-parametric comparison can be used here but please try to have enough replicates because generally non-parametric methods are more conservative. If hypothesis on Poisson is met here, it will be better to check whether, overall, the average value of response variable equal to their dispersion. You might consider to use "Negative binomial regression" if your data is over-dispersed.
