Are you asking about the data format or how to convert the data? For the latter you're going to have to experiment to find the right way to do this. The general idea is to convert your data into a nominal or ordinal value attribute. Some of these are simple - #4, #6 - some of these are going to be tough - #1-#3. For example, you could represent #1 as three attributes of day, month and year, or just one by converting it to a UNIX like timestamp. The IP is even harder - there's no straightforward way to convert that into a meaningful ordinal value. Using every IP as a nominal attribute might not be useful depending on your problem. Once you figure this out, convert your data, check the LibSVM docs. The general format is followed by : i.e., +1 1:0 2:0 .. etc
