Scheme, When to use Symbols instead of Strings?

I apologize in advance for my primitive english; i will try my best to avoid grammatical errors and such. Two weeks ago i decided to freshen my knowledge of Scheme (and its enlightnings) whilst implementing some math material i got between hands, specifically, Regular Languages from a course on Automata theory and Computation in which i am enrolled. So far, i've been representing alphabets as lists of symbols instead of lists of chars because i want to have letters of variable size. lists of strings because i somewhat feel thats unelegant. I'm inexperienced and would like to know your opinion on this particular choice. Are symbols reserved for some particular kind of task and by this am i misusing them? Any comment on this is very appreciated for i'm seeking guidance. On a further reach, there will be also the time to implement the set of all possible words over an alphabet, which is infinite. I was thinking to limit the set by the maximum size of words permitted. Again, is this a good practice or should i instead go for the streams? I feel that streams would be a better approach but i haven't learned them yet so i don't really know the implications are of using them. Anyhow, any suggestion or commentary is welcomed. I really appreciate the time you took to read my doubts. Have a nice weekend!
