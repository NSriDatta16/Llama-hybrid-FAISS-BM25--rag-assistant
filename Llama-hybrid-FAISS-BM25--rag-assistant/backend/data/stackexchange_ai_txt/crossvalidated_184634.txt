If by "influence" you mean the magnitude of output change for a unit change in the input, then slope is your measure. R^2 gives you a measure of "explained variance" (as Ivo already noted), that is - how well your model describes the output variations against input variations. So, to answer your specific question: "which Y dataset is more influenced by the X dataset?" Y1, because it has a higher average difference in output magnitude for the same levels of change in input magnitude. Y1 accidentally has also a higher R^2 value, but even if it was lower than for Y2, with the same slope, the answer would be the same. Hope I helped.
