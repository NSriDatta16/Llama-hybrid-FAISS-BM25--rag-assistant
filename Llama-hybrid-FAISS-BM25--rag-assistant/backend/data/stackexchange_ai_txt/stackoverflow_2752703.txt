You can figure out whether the characters are from the Arabic, Chinese, or Japanese sections of the Unicode map. If you look at the list on Wikipedia , you'll see that each of those languages has many sections of the map. But you're not doing translation, so you don't need to worry about every last glyph. For example, your Chinese text begins (in hex) 0x8FD9 0x662F 0x4E00 - and those are all in the "CJK Unified Ideographs" section, which is Chinese. Here are a few ranges to get you started: Arabic (0600–06FF) Japanese Hiragana (3040–309F) Katakana (30A0–30FF) Kanbun (3190–319F) Chinese CJK Unified Ideographs (4E00–9FFF) (I got the hex for your Chinese by using a Chinese to Unicode Converter .)
