I run sharepoint on external harrdrive. VPC has 2.5 GB RAM allocated. It runs quite fast (not really lighting fast, but workable). So my advice is to allocate as much memory to VPC as you can afford and run on external HDD. Use fire wire to connect you HDD if you can, it makes huge difference when compared to USB. Other than that defragmentation of both your host machine and Virtual machine can help (but can take ages).
