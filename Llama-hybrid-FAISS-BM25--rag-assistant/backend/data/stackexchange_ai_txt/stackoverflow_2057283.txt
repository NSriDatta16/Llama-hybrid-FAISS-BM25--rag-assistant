I figured this one out: Create a folder in: application/library/PREFIX (where PREFIX is the class prefix for your plugin, and it's root directory) In the application.ini file - add: autoloaderNamespaces[] = "PREFIX" add this line to register the plugin with the Front Controller resources.frontController.plugins.PluginName= "PREFIX_PluginName" If you need/want to organise your plugin folders - use the Zend underscore = directories naming convention - so this: resources.frontController.plugins.PluginName= "PREFIX_Path_To_Folder_PluginName" would refer to a class called: PREFIX_Path_To_Folder_PluginName in a file called: "PluginName.php" in directory: application/library/PREFIX/Path/To/Folder/PluginName.php Hope that helps anyone who needs to ask this question
