What database server are you using? MySQL only allows one auto_increment field per table and I'd imagine this is often the case, but without knowing your setup it's hard to say. Assuming there is only one auto_generated field in your table, your INSERT would have had to be aware of the value going into the second PK field. Robert's code should work for retrieving the generated key value, and the cleanest solution would probably be to perform a SELECT after the fact using this generated key and the value which you had a hold of already.
