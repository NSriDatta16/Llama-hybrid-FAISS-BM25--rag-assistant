How to access the range of time currently selected on a calendar?

I am trying to display a custom UI for entering information on Outlook appointments. I have this for existing appointments. I would like to create new appointments by having the user click and drag to select a time range and then trigger the macro. (This works for the built in New Appointment command in Outlook.) How do I programmatically get the time range selected to create a new appointment via VBA code?
