There is one file one disk that contains database definition but data never goes on disk. Data is lost when server shut down. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html When tables become overly larges you just get errors. However like any other memory usage it can be swapped... and then will use some disk.
