Adding new files to Application Storage Directory with AIR application installer

I have an AIR app that gets bundled with XML files that the app needs. These get put into the APP Storage Directory, of course. Works great. But when I install a new version ( which includes new XML files) , the new files don't get added or overwrite the ones from the previous version. It seems that if that directory is there from a previous install, the installer will ignore the part where it moves included files. Thank you for any help.
