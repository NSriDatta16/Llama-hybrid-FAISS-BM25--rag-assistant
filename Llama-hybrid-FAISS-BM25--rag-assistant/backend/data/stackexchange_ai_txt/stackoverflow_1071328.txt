How to produce same result on different browsers when embedding SVG file in HTML code?

I begin to have a solution for my previous question Overlay SVG diagrams on google map . But I have another (smaller) problem. I am using Firefox 3.5 and Safari 4 (on Mac), and when I am embedding SVG in a XHTML, I do not have at all the same result. I can use the or the elements (but I think the last one is deprecated). I use them like that: And the size and the scale of the SVG is not the same with Firefox and Safari. In my SVG, the width , height and viewBox are defined. Is there a way to have the same result with all the browsers (I don't care about IE that doesn't support SVG..., so "all the browsers" means at least the latest versions of Firefox, Opera and Safari) ?? Maybe something I forgot to define ? EDIT: I also noticed that with , the SVG is transparent with FF, but not transparent with Safari... :( Is there a "standard" way to include a SVG ?? Thank you for your help
