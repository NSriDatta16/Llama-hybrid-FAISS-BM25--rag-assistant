You guys may argue about but i realy believe in it: Usually , You don't have to write comments. Simply as that. The code has to be written in such way that is explain itself , if it doesn't explain itself and you have to write comments , then something is wrong. There are however some exceptional cases: You have to write something that is VERY cryptic to gain performence. So here you may need to write some explanation. You provide a library to some other group/company , It is better you document its API. There are too many novice programemers in your organization.
