Although once asked I knew this was a very subjective question, and I was not looking for specific yes or no, but rather hearing the community's experience, here now I would like the share the following short conclusion for those that might have to make a similar decision. Golden Rule is Majority Voting What I do mean by that is that it is best to be aligned with other team members and the companies's IT support. If majority or all are Windows based, then one should go for that, and vice versa for Linux, otherwise you are on your own and will suck up much of your time to get certain things up and running (printer driver etc.). Minor Differences I have witnessed minor differences actually. I have to admit that I do miss Linux terminal. Windows has been trying so hard to integrate a proper terminal, but so far all solutions like Windows PowerShell or cmd or Ubuntu terminal for Windows or even Anaconda Prompt doesn't give that freedom and experience one have with Linux kernel. The rest is pretty much the same, and there has been no really big issue for me migrating from Mac OSx to Surface Pro 6. Hardware/Software Stability : For long I have been biased that Mac OSx is the most stable OS one could experience, perhaps due to terrible past experience working with Windows (Win 98, XP, 2000 etc.). Although still typical issues remain, which is true to all OSs, I have to say that Windows there days is a super reliable system comparable to Mac OS if not better, you know for daily tasks (I am not bench-marking anything here) and not causing dramas. For the Hardware, honestly if we account for Hardware for Price comparison, Windows wins. It is far more powerful better CPU, RAM, Graphics, Storage for the price you pay. I would get a much lower performing Mac OSx, and nothing is worst that having worried about 250 GM storage you have, while you can get a double or tripple space easily in a Windows equivalent machines. Certainly if price is not a concern, one should not be concerned about this as well. Last but not least, since we are comparing Hardware, I have to mention I am loving my touchable Surface Pro 6 display, and one can detach the screen to turn it to a Tablet which is awesome, and the screen itself is so durable, in contrast to a super sensitive Mac screens. Please note I am not advocating for Windows, just stating facts and sharing personal experience using both. In case over long period of time, these facts change, I will get back to this post and update again my personal high-level experience.
