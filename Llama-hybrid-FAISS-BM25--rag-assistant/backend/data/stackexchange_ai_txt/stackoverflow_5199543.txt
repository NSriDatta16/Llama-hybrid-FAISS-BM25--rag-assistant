I know of three options. As sharma noted, you can use artifact paths in General Settings, which will allow you to describe a mapping of files on the buildAgent to files in the archive. You can use absolute or relative paths here. I don't think I've ever tried using property expansions there. You can also use service messages - by emitting a message with a special format to output, you can issue a number of different commands to TeamCity, including a command to publishArtifacts You can also use a simple file copy in your build to the appropriate directory in the archive. TeamCity sets properties with the names of the folders that you will need - teamcity.buildConfName, teamcity.projectName, teamcity.agent.dotnet.build_id, etc.
