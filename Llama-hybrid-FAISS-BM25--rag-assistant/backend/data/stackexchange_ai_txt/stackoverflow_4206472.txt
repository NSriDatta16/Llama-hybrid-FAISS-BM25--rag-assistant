Understanding the relationship between glutDisplayFunc and glutPostRedisplay

When reading the redbook I found: glutDisplayFunc(void (*func)(void)) is the first and most important event callback function you will see. Whenever GLUT determines that the contents of the window need to be redisplayed, the callback function registered by glutDisplayFunc() is executed. Therefore, you should put all the routines you need to redraw the scene in the display callback function. If your program changes the contents of the window, sometimes you will have to call glutPostRedisplay(), which gives glutMainLoop() a nudge to call the registered display callback at its next opportunity Which are times in which glutPostRedisplay() should be called? From this paragraph, I don't understand why its functionality is needed.
