Google App Engine is a cloud computing technology for hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Google App Engine lets you run your web applications on Google's infrastructure; applications are easy to build, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs grow: Zero to sixty : Scale your app automatically without worrying about managing machines. Supercharged APIs : Supercharge your app with services such as Task Queue, XMPP, and Cloud SQL, all powered by the same infrastructure that powers the Google services you use every day. You're in control : Manage your application with a simple, web-based dashboard allowing you to customize your app's performance. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain: You just upload your application, and it's ready to serve your users. Google App Engine makes it easy to build and deploy an application that runs reliably even under heavy load and with large amounts of data. It includes the following features: Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions. Automatic scaling and load balancing. Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request. Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals. Integration with other Google cloud services and APIs. As of March 5th, 2012, Stack Overflow is Google's official community support channel for technical App Engine questions under the google-app-engine tag. Developers should continue to use the discussion forum or the StackExchange Software Recommendations sites for topics that are not a good fit for the Stack Overflow format. To report defects, use the App Engine public issue tracker . Many google-app-engine questions are specific to their SDK for python , java , php or go . Please include the appropriate language tag with those questions or use the additional tags like google-app-engine-java and google-app-engine-python . While google-app-engine covers both the standard environment and the flexible environment it may be a good idea to also tag questions specific to the flexible environment with app-engine-flexible .
