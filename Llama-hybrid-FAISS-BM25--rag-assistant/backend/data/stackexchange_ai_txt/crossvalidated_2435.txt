Probably you just have unbalanced classes (3% to 97%, if I understood well) -- try balancing them (get this 3% of true ones and about equal number of false ones) and check the classifier build on this case. If you are worried that you have thrown out most of your data, iterate it few times and connect them with some simple blender, like voting. (More complex blenders will also suffer from unbalanced classes). You should also check some better classifiers than a single tree or logistic regression -- like SVM or Random Forest. Of course you can also use some classifier immune to imbalance problem, like kNN or as you say some rule-based approach.
