The reason is that CharIndex is a lot faster and cleaner for SQL to perform than LIKE. The reason is, that you can have some crazy "LIKE" clauses. Example: SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE EmailDomain LIKE 'abc%de%sss%' But, the "CHARINDEX" function (which is basically "IndexOf") ONLY handles finding the first instance of a set of characters... no wildcards are allowed. So, there's your answer :) EDIT: I just wanted to add that I encourage people to use CHARINDEX in their SQL queries for things that they didn't need "LIKE" for. It is important to note though that in SQL Server 2000... a "Text" field can use the LIKE method, but not CHARINDEX.
