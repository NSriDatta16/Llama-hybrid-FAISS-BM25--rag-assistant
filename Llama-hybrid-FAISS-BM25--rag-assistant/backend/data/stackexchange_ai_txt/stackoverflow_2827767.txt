How to use danvk re-orderable columns with dynamically created tables?

I'm trying to implement the danvk draggable table Javascript, and while I've been successful using it for tables actually in the html source, when I try to use it with tables I'm creating in Javascript code, it isn't applied to those tables. Has anyone had the same issue?
