There is no "easy" way to slow down the redirects from the CakeTest environment. To do this, you will need to go into the SimpleTest library and make modifications there. Here is an idea of the classes involved: cake_web_test_case -> web_test_case (web_tester.php) -> simple_browser (browser.php) -> simple_user_agent (user_agent.php) If you want to slow down redirects, I would suggest opening /vendors/simpletest/user_agent.php and edit "function &_fetchWhileRedirected". Just add a sleep() in the do..while statement and it should slow down the redirects. Hope this helps.
