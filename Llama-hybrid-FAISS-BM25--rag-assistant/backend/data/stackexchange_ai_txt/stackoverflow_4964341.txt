Trying to position a span over an input box using CSS

I'm trying to reproduce the input box behavior of stackoverflow where they place span text over an input box. It looks like the text is actually inside the input box, but is actually just a finely positioned span. They hide the span when the user types text into the field. To see the behavior in action, press "Ask Question" and then look at the "Title" input box. The text says: "what's your programming question? be specific". I'm creating this for an ecommerce checkout page, so there will be multiple input boxes of different widths and positions. As a CSS newbie, is there a way to create input boxes and then somehow attach a span to the left and vertical center of a input field? I suppose I could go through and position each one individually, so I'm hoping a class could be developed that would automatically attach a span to a previously defined input box. Does anyone have an elegant way to do this without custom positioning each one?
