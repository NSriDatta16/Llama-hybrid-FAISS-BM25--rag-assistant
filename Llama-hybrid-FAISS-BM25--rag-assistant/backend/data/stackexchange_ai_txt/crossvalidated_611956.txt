It's hard to diagnose what's going on in a particular data analysis from afar, but in principle it's expected that adding covariates (or adding suitable random effects) to a model would make an odds-ratio further away from 1. The odds ratio is not collapsible. I.e. if you omit covariates that matter (more than to a non-negligible extent), you end up (on average) shrinking the odds-ratio towards 1 (or equivalently the log-odds-ratio towards 0). So, would a non-collapsible effect measure be better? Not necessarily, because they cannot possibly be constant across different risk levels (while an odds ratio could be - which doesn't mean that it is) so that you end up getting interactions in your model when they might not have been needed (if only you'd used an odds ratio).
