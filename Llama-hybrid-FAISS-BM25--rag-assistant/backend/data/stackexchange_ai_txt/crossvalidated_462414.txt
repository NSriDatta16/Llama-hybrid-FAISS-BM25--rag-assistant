A beta distribution with both shape parameters $ will have a 'bathtub' shape with modes at the ends. Modes of a beta density function will be of equal height if the two shape parameters are equal (nearly equal for samples). Beta distributions have support $(0,1).$ Example (using R): set.seed(421) x = rbeta(2000, .5, .5) hist(x, prob=T, col="skyblue2", main="BETA(.5, .5)") curve(dbeta(x, .5,.5), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) Smaller shape parameters put less probability in the middle. set.seed(422) x = rbeta(2000, .2, .2) hist(x, prob=T, col="skyblue2", main="BETA(.5, .5)") curve(dbeta(x, .2,.2), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) You can transform by a linear function to get bivariate data in intervals other than $(0,1).$ y = 3*x + 2 hist(y, prob=2, col="skyblue2") Note: All samples above are of size $n=2000.$ Larger samples tend to give histograms that follow the population density curve more closely. Smaller samples can give histograms with more 'raggedy' profiles.
