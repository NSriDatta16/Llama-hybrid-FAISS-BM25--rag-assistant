Databinding is, of course, necessary to effectively dispay data. Tooling is great and can boost productivity. It is equally important to understand what the tooling is generating, even at a basic level, in order to be able to effectively utilize the generated code. The reaction you describe seems a bit extreme. If a wizard can generate some code that works for ya, then use it. If you don't understand the generated code then that is the next priority; learn about what it is doing and why. In the meantime, you have a page that people can put eyes on regardless of how it got there. I am a bit pragmatic when it comes to tools. You do what you have to do. But, if after [insert appropriate internship length] you are still using code gen and cannot customize or fix it then you (as in the royal you, not the you you) are being lazy or stupid or both. ;-) OT:(almost) Never say never unless you want to lessen the impact of what you are trying to communicate. my 2 pesos.
