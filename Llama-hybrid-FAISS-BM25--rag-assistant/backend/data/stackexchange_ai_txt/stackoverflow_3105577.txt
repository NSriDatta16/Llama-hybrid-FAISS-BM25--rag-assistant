simple php SoapClient example for paypal needed

Could I get a simple example of using PHP's SoapClient class to make an empty call to Paypal with nothing but the version number? I have the correct WSDL url and server url, so that's not what I need help with. This is what I have: public function SOAPcall($function, $args=array()) { $args['Version'] = '63.0'; $args = new SoapVar($args, SOAP_ENC_ARRAY, $function.'_Request'); $args = array(new SoapVar($args, SOAP_ENC_ARRAY, $function.'_Req', 'urn:ebay:api:PayPalAPI')); $results = $this->soapClient->__soapCall($function, $args, array('location' => $this->activeKeys['certificate']), $this->soapOptions); } I hope it's okay I am not showing everything. The body of the request comes out completely wrong, as you can see below: xxx xxx xxx 63.0 It should look like this: api_username api_password service_version data Of course, Paypal throws a "Version is not supported" error.
