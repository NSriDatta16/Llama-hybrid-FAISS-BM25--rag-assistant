Your performance concerns should be outweighed by maintainability concerns. The biggest drawback to this kind of spaghetti (in my opinion) is that other developers who are stuck maintaining this code will have to spend extra time trying to figure out what's going on. Try to keep things relatively simple, so that any ASP.NET developer off the street can come in and easily pick up where you left off. Also, under what scenario are you thinking of organizing your web application like this? If an example of the business problem you're trying to address is provided, perhaps we can help offer up alternative solutions.
