How to sample data to classify sales performance data?

I have data about sales in a year, call and appointment records, and background of salesmen. I want to apply machine learning and data mining to predict which kind of person would bring highest sales each month. My problem is I am not sure how to sample the data. Should I treat sales of a salesman in different months as individual records? or should I only pick one record for each salesman?
