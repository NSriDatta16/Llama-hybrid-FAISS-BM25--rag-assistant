It's a good start with the hypotheses and models. The choice of model really boils down to what we know a priori about the distributions. But two important things to keep in mind: We don't choose GLM specifications deterministically based on the probability model of the response. For instance, if a response is binary, we can fit any model we choose. If I choose a logistic regression, my effect estimate is an odds ratio. If I fit a quasipoisson regression to a binary response, the effect estimate is a risk ratio (a more conservative and accurate effect to report). If I fit a linear regression, or a binomial model with identity link, my effect estimate is a risk difference. It's useless to inspect the univariate distribution of the response and conclude what the distribution is. In other words, the point of regression modeling is to "subtract off" the conditional effects of regressors and characterize the residuals in a useful way... So where does that leave us? Focusing on the data and the questions you are trying to answer. Everything you propose is reasonable and would be acceptable in a journal. The only comment I have is that for "mass eaten" when the animal eats nothing, the mass is set to NA and not to 0. It's important to mention that "conditional" when interpreting the results.
