What is a good public data set for hierarchical time series forecasting?

I'm trying to unit test a script for hierarchical time series forecasting, and I was wondering whether there is a public data set that can be used as a good example of hierarchical/grouped time series? By "good example", I mean one where there is some correlation and interaction between the individual time series that we can group, but that still each have their own individual series-specific characteristics.
