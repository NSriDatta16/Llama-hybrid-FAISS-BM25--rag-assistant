What are some good, fast persistent storage options for key->value data?

For a small PHP app I am writing, we need to store a large number of records that have a hash key, and a few simple field values ('host', 'path'). eg: '4420ffb32a' => array( 'host' => '127.0.0.1', 'path' => 'path/to/resource', ); What is the best persistent storage for data like this? Would MySQL be the best choice, or is it overkill for such simple data? What would give the best performance?
