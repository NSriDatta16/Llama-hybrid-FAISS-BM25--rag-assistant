Lately I faced the same problem. I tried repeating the CV many times, like 100, 200, 1000 on my data set trying to find the best $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ (i'm using an elastic net). But even if I create 3 cv test each with 1000 iterations averaging the min MSEs for each $\alpha$, I get 3 different best ($\lambda$, $\alpha$) couples. I won't touch the $\alpha$ problem here but I decided that my best solution is not averaging the min MSEs, but instead extracting the coefficients for each iteration best $\lambda$ and then treat them as a distribution of values (a random variable). Then, for each predictor I get: mean coefficient standard deviation 5 number summary (median, quartiles, min and max) percentage of times is different from zero (ie. has an influence) This way I get a pretty solid description of the effect of predictor. Once you have distributions for the coefficients, than you could run any statistical stuff you think is worth to get CI, p values, etc... but I didn't investigate this yet. This method can be used with more or less any selection method I can think of.
