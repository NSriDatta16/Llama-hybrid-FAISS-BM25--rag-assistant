Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a family of methods that can be used when likelihood is intractable. Approximate Bayesian Inference seems to be used ambiguously, either as a synonym for ABC, or for Variational Inference , i.e. class of methods that given (trackable) likelihood and priors approximate the posterior distribution. Neither of those have anything to do with having closed-form solution for posterior. If you don't, you can simply use Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or other approach to sampling from, or estimating the posterior.
