Flex/AS3 easy (I hope) drag and drop question - prevent dragging to other controls

I searched but couldn't find my answer, I'm sure it's easy for anyone with a little experience. I have multiple datagrids on a page, each one I want sortable with drag and drop, but I don't want items drug from one control to the other. How can I prevent a user from dragging an item out of a conrol. I would prefer to have it just stop moving with the mouse, but I am prepared to just completely cancel out of the dragging if need be. I was trying to do something like this dragExit="dragEvent.CANCEL" This is obviously wrong, but I can't find the correct way to do it. Thanks in advance. ~Mike
