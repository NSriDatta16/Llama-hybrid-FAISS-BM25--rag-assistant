Ok, as it turns out the storage/retrieval engine (a product called INsql) that sql is getting the data from appears to not work with the multiple time in statment thing. If i select the whole data set into a temporary table and work on it there with sql, the NOT BETWEEN statment works fine. Thank you all for your help in narrowing this down!
