Good questions. For the first question, the score definitions are different between YOLOv1 and YOLOv3. According to the yolov1 paper These confidence scores reflect how confident the model is that the box contains an object and also how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. If no object exists in that cell, the confidence scores should be zero. Otherwise we want the confidence score to equal the intersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box and the ground truth. This is the same as your second interpenetration. However in the yolov3 paper YOLOv3 predicts an objectness score for each bounding box using logistic regression. This should be 1 if the bounding box prior overlaps a ground truth object by more than any other bounding box prior. This is the same as your third interpenetration. Actually both options are implemented in the code you referred to, I guess they both work in practice. Second question, yes, just don't forget to apply the inverse functions to the ground truth coordinates first. Source code for reference.
