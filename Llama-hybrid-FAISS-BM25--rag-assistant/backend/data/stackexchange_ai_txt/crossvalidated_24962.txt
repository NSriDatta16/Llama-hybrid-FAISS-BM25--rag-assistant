Categorical variables in multinomial logistic regression end up converted into binary variables

When I run multinomial logistic regression with some of the explanatory variables as categorical, my algo (glm) turns them in binary variables, automatically. For examples if one categorical variable X has three values a, b anc c, then my output shows cofficient and t-values for x.a, x.b and x.c. But in fact I want t-value at the level of x itself so that I can see if variable X is significant or not in determination of dependent variable. Can you please suggest some way so that I can see output directly at the level of X?
