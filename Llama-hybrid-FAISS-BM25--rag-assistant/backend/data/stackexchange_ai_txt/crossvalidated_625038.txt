R does offer ways to do multilevel multinomial logistic regression. See this thread for a good discussion. However, if only "some" of your patients have multiple observations, then that might not work. One solution is to just use the first occurrence for each patient. Whether this is acceptable in your case would depend on what exactly you are hypothesizing, what proportion of people have more than one occurrence, and whether those people are markedly different from the singles.
