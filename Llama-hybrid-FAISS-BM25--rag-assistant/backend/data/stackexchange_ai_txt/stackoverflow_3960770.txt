What is iii, rr and mmm?

I am reading the book The Art of Assembly Language . I came across this paragraph. To determine a particular instructionâ€™s opcode, you need only select the appropriate bits for the iii , rr , and mmm fields. For example, to encode the mov ax, bx instruction you would select iii=110 ( mov reg, reg ), rr=00 ( ax ), and mmm=001 ( bx ). This produces the one-byte instruction 11000001 or 0C0h . Here I can't understand what is iii , rr and mmm ? Can anybody please explain? Thanks in advance.
