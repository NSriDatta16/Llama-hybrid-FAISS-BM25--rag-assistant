If you are developing using the Android SDK or NDK, any phone with Android Market is required to be able to be used as a developer device. If you are trying to develop IN Flash, then you will need a phone capable of Flash (Motorola Droid, any Snapdragon or better processor device) but on Android I don't believe there is a way to package a Flash app onto the device, and the Flash app is always run in the browser.
