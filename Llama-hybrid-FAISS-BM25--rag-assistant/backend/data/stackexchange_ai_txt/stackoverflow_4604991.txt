I would suggest that it doesn't make sense for the URI to have a query string unless the client were filling in arguments. That does not seem true to me. If you ask server for a handful of photos, it’s perfectly valid for the server to return something like this: You could use /photo/id/xx path instead, but that’s not the point. These URLs are usable even without the client changing them. As for your second point: If the client is filling arguments then it is adulterating the server-supplied URI and I wonder if this violates the RESTful principle. I guess this is the heart of your question. And I don’t think you have to treat URLs as opaque identifiers , see this quote by Roy Fielding himself: REST does not require that a URI be opaque. The only place where the word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I complain about the opaqueness of cookies. In fact, RESTful applications are, at all times, encouraged to use human-meaningful, hierarchical identifiers in order to maximize the serendipitous use of the information beyond what is anticipated by the original application.
