Single fitted parameter from multiple data

Let's say I have to perform more than one non-linear fit over experimental replicates, each of them being an exponential decay ( y ). What I'm doing right now is to use the R function nls for each decay, to obtain the estimated parameter A together with associated standard error of the fit. What I would like to get is a single estimate (and not one for each decay) with associated error that takes into account both the inter-sample variability and the error associated with each fit. One approach I tried is to take the average of the estimates as the best fitted parameter, and their standard deviation as the resulting error. However, with this approach I am not taking into account that each fitted parameter comes with a standard error due to the fitting procedure. Is there a way to tackle this issue? Thanks in advance
