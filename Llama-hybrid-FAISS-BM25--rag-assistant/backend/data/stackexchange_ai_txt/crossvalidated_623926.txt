Is it possible to use smooth functions as part of a nonlinear regression?

Background I am fitting nonlinear regressions with a single response and two predictors. I know the relationship between the response and each of the predictors, but I do not know how they interact. I am trying to build understand their interaction to build process-based models that incorporate it. In the meantime, I would like to adequately describe their interaction using some mix of parametric and smooth functions, if possible. Problem Let's take the Monod equation from microbiology, which is a saturating function describing how microbial growth $\mu$ changes with nutrient concentration $R$ : $$ \mu =\mu _{\max }{R \over K_{s}+R} $$ $R$ is the only predictor (/independent variable) here. Let's say we have this curve measured at several different levels of a second continuous predictor (call it $S$ ). If $S$ was categorical and these were curves from a set of different species (for example), the best solution would probably be to make this a hierarchical model. Since $S$ is continuous, $\mu_{max} $ and $K_{s}$ are both continuous functions of $S$ and I'm not sure that a hierarchical model makes sense. Instead, is it possible to make these two parameters smooth functions of $S$ ? Perhaps a different way to phrase this problem is: how can I do nonlinear regression with some smooth parameters? I recognise that the best solution would be to modify the equation to describe the specific mathematical dependence - we just do not have the knowledge to do this right now and a smooth function is a compromise. Here's some example code showing how I would fit the basic equation with the R package brms (the fitting procedure doesn't have to be Bayesian, but I prefer it). My goal is to modify this to make $\mu_{max} $ and $K_{s}$ smooth functions of $S$ , iff this a reasonable thing to do. I'm open to alternate approaches if this does not make sense. library(brms) # set seed set.seed(87) # define model with interaction double_monod $growthrate R, dat$S, 1, 20, 5) + rnorm(nrow(dat), 0, 0.1) # set prior prior1
