Refactoring multiple actionListeners

I am currently working on some Java code that has a lot of ActionListeners defined in it (one for each JButton ) and there are around 60 buttons. These are all defined as anonymous inner classes in the JButton.addActionListener method. I have been thinking of ways to refactor this to make the code look neater as this is making it looked very cluttered. I thought about possibly taking the listeners into a separate class that essentially has a load of static methods each returning a listener. This will mean that the code will look something like addActionListener(GetActionListener.addActionListener()) . Whilst this will make it neater I feel that it is not really an elegant solution. I thought also a static final map holding KV pairs with listener name to the listener itself. Again however this still does not seem like a very elegant solution. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas? I should also say that all the actionListeners are pretty different.
