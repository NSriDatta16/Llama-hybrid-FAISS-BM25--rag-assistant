This looks like a case where a linear fit might not be a good idea and there are certainly outliers and leverage points. In your first plot it looks like your estimator is tring to fit just 3 or 4 point very closely and is essentially ignoring several outliers. But I don't think it is fitting three points and ignoring the rest. It appears to me that it is trying to go through te center of that oval shape mass of points and coincidentally by doing that it practically runs through three or four isolated points. The Q-Q plot shows heavytailed behavior because of the large residuals both positive and negative due to the outliers. That should not be a surprise. What I find interesting is that the robust regression gives a negative slope to the line. it would be helpful to see the scatter plot of X vs Y so we could imagin what the least squares estimate would be. If there are leverage points for extreme values of x the slope could even change sign. Maybe any linear model would not help this. It could be that X and Y are practically uncorrelated.
