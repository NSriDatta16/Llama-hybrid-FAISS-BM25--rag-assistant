Technically speaking, it has to drop one level from the second variable, otherwise the design matrix won't be full rank. To see this, suppose that indicator variables are included in the design matrix for all levels of the second variable as well. Then summing all the columns corresponding to the first variable will give all 1's. Summing all the columns corresponding to the second variable, will also give all 1's. So, substracting the second variable's columns from the first variable's columns you get all 0's, therefore the matrix is not full rank. Intuitively, say dayFriday was also estimated. Each data point corresponds to a month and a day, so the estimated average for a given month and a given day will be the sum of the corresponding parameters. You can add a fixed value to all the month parameters, and subtract the same fixed value from all the day parameters, and the estimated average of month + day won't change. So there is no unique way of determining all parameters if all months and all days are included.
