What it sounds like you want to do is use the proportion of successful trials AND the number of attempts in the logistic regression. What I would do, at least for starters, is create a variable that is the proportion $p$ of successes. Then do regression on both $n$ and $x/n$ . $$ logit(\hat{y}_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\dfrac{x_i}{n_i} + \beta_2n_i $$ The $\dfrac{x_i}{n_i}$ is the proportion of successes in row $i$ . This will be a column in your data frame.
