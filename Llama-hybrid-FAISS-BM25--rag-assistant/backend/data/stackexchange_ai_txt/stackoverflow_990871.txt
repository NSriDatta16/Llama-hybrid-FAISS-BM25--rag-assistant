Exact time at which an event occurred

What i want to do is record the time of when a button has been pressed. All these times will be stored in an array. The program will then run through the array and look at the time values and then highlight the button states at those particular times during playback. Hopefully this makes sense, whats the best way to do this?! Thanks in advance. ------------------ MORE DETAIL ------------------ the first thing that came up on my mind was... 'ah ha, timestamp', but then looking into the documentation, in a certain section in the timestamp page somewhere in the paragraph it states the following: ....You should not use it to determine the exact time at which the event occurred but should instead compare it to the timestamp of another acceleration event to determine the elapsed time between the events.... this is not great.. as i am assuming that it will not be accurate when it comes to playback of highlighting the buttons at the exact times of when the user had actually pressed them during record. Please let me know of what i should use and do.
