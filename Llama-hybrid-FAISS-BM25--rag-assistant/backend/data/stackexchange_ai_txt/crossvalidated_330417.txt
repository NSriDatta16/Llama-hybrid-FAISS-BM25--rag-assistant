As Schaftablette mentioned, for (Pierson or any other) correlation, or even for correlation plot, keeping the values within the same range is not necessary. But rescaling both vectors to the same range (say [0,1]) would give you a cleaner plot. What is crucial in your case ,however, is the different size of your datasets. For correlation analysis, you need to have equal size of data in both dimensions. As your plots show, they are not equal. So, you need to resample your data to make them equal. You can either go with under-sampling of the larger dataset, or, over-sampling of the smaller one. I would suggest a k -fold random under-sampling. Suppose your smaller dataset has m data points. Then you can randomly sample from your larger dataset, and pick m of them and find the correlation. If you repeat this procedure k times and get the average, your final result would be fairly reliable. Of course, this is recommended only if you do not have access to more samples of your smaller dataset.
