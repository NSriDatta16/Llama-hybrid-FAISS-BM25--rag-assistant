You can't access your home computer from work which rules out a "remote support" option. Can you access other computers on the Internet? If so, you could simply set up one of the online storage options and then ftp the results from your home computer. That's a lot simpler then trying to write scripts or code to generate emails with attachments or whatever. You could then view the external computer from work.
