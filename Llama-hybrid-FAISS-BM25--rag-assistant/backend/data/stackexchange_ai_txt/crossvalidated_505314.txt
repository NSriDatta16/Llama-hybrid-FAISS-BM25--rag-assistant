Bayesian approach for getting the distribution of sum of predicted values

Let's say I have some value y for the first 7 days ( day ). I want to predict sum(y) after n days (a couple of weeks) and also get its distribution. (Note that days are already logged and scaled ( scale(log(day)) ). I'm interested in the Bayesian approach (I already found the same problem solved by frequentists) and I would appreciate an intuitive explanation and, if possible, solve it with as little math as possible (I prefer to simulate.:)). I don't mind if you use any other R package to implement the solution ( tidybayes , ...) or just explain it. library(rethinking) # both columns are already logged and normalized - the reason days are not integers data How to get the distribution of sum of predictions? This is: how is distributed sum(y) for the first n days?
