I like to use the average of the best threshold on each of training and validation data set. This is figure 4-2 from Practical Machine Learning with H2O (Disclaimer: my book): It shows the best threshold on each of train, valid and test. The dashed line is the average of the two. (Aside: valid and test lines are noisier, as they are based on less data: the split was 13:1:1 ) The point is that any of these (training, valid, their average) will be in the right ballpark. The reason I use the average is because the training data is 13x more data, but might have over-fitted, so I hope that the validation data can balance it. I give them equal weight because this particular example is time series, so the validation data is newer (closer to the test data) than the training data. (In this particular example, using the average is worse than using the training threshold, but better than the validation threshold.)
