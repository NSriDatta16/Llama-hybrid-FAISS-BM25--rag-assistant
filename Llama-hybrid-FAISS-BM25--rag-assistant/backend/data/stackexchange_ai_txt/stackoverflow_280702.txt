http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1867.html HTTP clients are encouraged to supply content-length for overall file input so that a busy server could detect if the proposed file data is too large to be processed reasonably But the content-length is not required, so you cannot rely on it. Also, an attacker can forge a wrong content-length. To read the file content is the only reliable way. Having said that, if the content-lenght is present and is too big, to close the connection would be a reasonable thing to do. Also, the content is sent as multipart, so most of the modern frameworks decode it first. That means you won't get the file byte stream until the framework is done, which could mean "until the whole file is uploaded".
