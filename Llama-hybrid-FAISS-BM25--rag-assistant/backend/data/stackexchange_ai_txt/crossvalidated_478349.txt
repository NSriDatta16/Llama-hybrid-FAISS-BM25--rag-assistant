Which Object detection model will give the best result on images when the speed is not a problem for Text Images

I want to develop a model for cropping the equations from the Maths questions as people like me are struggling a lot for doing it manually for the research purpose. I want to know if we can do this? and if we can out of all the possible solutions out there for object recognition models, which one will produce the best results on Text images. As there is tensorflow's object recognition API, RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, YOLO (v-1,2,3,4,5). An if there is any other , please do suggest. What I want to do is to detect the gray areas of equations in this image . Note : The grey region shown in the image is for just demonstrating. My actual images are simple cropped questions from books with with background and black letters (most of the books)
