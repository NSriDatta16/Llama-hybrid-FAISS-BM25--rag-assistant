3 questions need to pay attention when using propensity score (PS) as covariate in the regression model. In the practice, PS is got from logistic regression. For example: the linear model. 1: $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2P +\epsilon$ where $T$ is treatment and $P$ is PS. Because $P=\frac {\exp(X\beta)}{1+\exp(X\beta)}$, we have $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2\frac {\exp(X\beta)}{1+\exp(X\beta)} +\epsilon$. The question is: Why the response variable $Y$ has this strange relation with covariate $X$? Why we need this limitation? 2: Should we consider the variance of $P$, because $P$ is estimated from data, not observed true value? 3: If $X$ has high dimensional and/or co-linearity problem when the $X$ is used in linear model directly, $X$ has high dimensional and/or co-linearity problem in the logistic regression when you try to get PS. Is it possible to resolve this problem in logistic regression?
