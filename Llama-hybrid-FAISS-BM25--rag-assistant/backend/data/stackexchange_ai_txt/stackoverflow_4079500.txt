How to design a resource association problem in Java

I have the following modeling problem: as an exercise, I need to model a system that allocates units (police cars/fire trucks) to a specific emergency (fire/robbery/...) . Therefore an emergency needs to say how many units it needs (for instance 2 fire trucks and 3 ambulances). Of course, these units need to be assigned to that emergency. I've modeled this as two abstract classes: Emergency and Unit with the real units and emergencies that inherit these classes. Is there an elegant design so the emergency can tell in a generic way which units it needs (additional types of units and emergencies are expected)? The programming language is Java. I know this is probably one of the standard design patterns, but I'm quite new to these design patterns.
