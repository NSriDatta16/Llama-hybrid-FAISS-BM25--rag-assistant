Here is a thread with a good discussion of this. In short, the compiler is warning you that, in effect, your exported class does not seperate the interface from the implementation. If the members in question are not accessible to the clients, make them private and #pragma away the warning for that member/class. If the members are accessible and used by clients, then you will need to provide indirect access to the members through accessors and mutators.
