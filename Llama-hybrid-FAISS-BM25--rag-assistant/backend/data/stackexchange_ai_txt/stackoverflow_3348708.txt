How can it get VB not to auto generate code for my component

I build a component class it extends a combo box and generates some random numbers. But when I drag and drop my component from the toolbox to a form it auto generates Me.Randtest1.Items.AddRange(...) in the Designer which uses static numbers. The idea was to have different numbers each time and not the same. Imports System.Windows.Forms Public Class randtest Inherits ComboBox Public Sub New() setDefaultText() fillComboBox() End Sub Private Sub setDefaultText() Text = Rnd(10) End Sub Private Sub fillComboBox() For count = 0 To 5 Items.Add(Rnd(10)) Next End Sub End Class Thanks
