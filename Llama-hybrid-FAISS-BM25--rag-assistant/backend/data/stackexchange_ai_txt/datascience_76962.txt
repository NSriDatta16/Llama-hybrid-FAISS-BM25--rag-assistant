How Object oriented programming approach can be utilised in data science domain?

I have been asked many times that why you are not using classes, objects, and object oriented concepts while coding? What I do? Write python scripts to fetch data from different sources, apply pre-processing code, create necessary variables, and take these refined variables to modeling process. How I do? Write necessary functions to carry-out specific task, all the functions will be called one-by-one as top down, procedural approach. In case of different modules, I keep them into different python files, and then simply import them. In the current process, I never found a motivation to use OOPs concepts. Can you suggest how can I improve my coding practice, and what are the flaws I am putting into my current architecture which can be fulfilled by OOPs?
