I can't tell exactly without a calculator, but it looks like Grade = AVG(pack, value, durable, feat, ease) If that's the case, then you just have to define "fall far below the total average number of ratings". I'll weight against the standard deviation from the mean - which may or may not be a decent algorithm (I'm not statistician). But, this means any rating that's exactly the mean = 1, and you get +/- from there. WeightedGrade = Grade * ABS((Rating - AVG(H:H)) / STDEV(H:H))
