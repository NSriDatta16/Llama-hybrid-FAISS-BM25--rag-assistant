Very simplistically (in C#): double size = 10.36; int power = 0; while (size != (int)size) { size *= 10.0; power--; } Console.WriteLine("{0} * 10 to the {1}", size, power); Though I'm sure with a bit more thought a more elegant solution can be found. This doesn't go the other way where you've got a large number (103600 say) and want to get the smallest value to some power (1036 * 10^2).
