There are a lot of causes for sudden stalls in many database products - and MySQL is not alone. Here are a few examples: You need to load the table description from storage (no free table cache entries on forum_topics). This operation is serialized - you could be queued behind another user on another table. You are using the query cache, and the query cache is (possibly) fragmented. InnoDB is currently performing an activity like extending the size of a data file, which causes a brief pause (maybe you have auto_extend_increment set to high?) These are just examples - there are certainly more causes. What you need to do is use a profiling tool such as poor man's profiler . It will give you a stack trace as to exactly where the query is blocked. Search bugs.mysql.com for the stack trace, or try asking on something like the Percona forums .
