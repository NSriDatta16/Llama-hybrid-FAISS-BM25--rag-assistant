I think you can only do it by selecting the paragraphs that will not be protected. Below is a sample macro that is selecting a piece of text, enabling it for editing, and then locking the rest of the document. You can either use IRM or password protection, the macro below is using the latter. You should replace the method of selection below by something more elegant Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=11, Extend:=wdExtend Selection.Editors.Add wdEditorEveryone ActiveDocument.protect Password:="password", NoReset:=False, Type:= _ wdAllowOnlyReading, UseIRM:=False, EnforceStyleLock:=False
