Help creating multi page web form with perl CGI

I want to create a multi page web form using perl CGI that changes page based on a drop down selection. I have looked at tutorials for a multi page CGI form that only moves in order but I would like mine to be able to go to a different page based on the selection. I'm not sure how I should try to organize my different pages and handle switching pages without getting messy. Any suggestions to how to organize and move throughout the pages would be a great help.
