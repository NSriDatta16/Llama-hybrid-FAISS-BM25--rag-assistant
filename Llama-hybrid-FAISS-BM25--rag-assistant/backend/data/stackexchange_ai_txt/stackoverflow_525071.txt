I'd stay away. If they won't give you a contract now it means one of two things, neither good. As you indicate, it might mean they are sketchy. They intend to shaft you or at least leave open the possibility of it. The other, more likely, reason is that they don't have a contract available. They are too disorganized to do so. If that's the case, your employment is probably safe but I have to wonder what the work environment would be like. In either case, I'd stay away if I had any other options. Another thing to consider is what they'll ask you to sign once you get there. All sorts of annoying things could be in a contract like an onerous non-compete or rights to any code you create any time, restrictions on your off-the-clock activities, etc. It would suck to relocate only to find you don't want to sign.
