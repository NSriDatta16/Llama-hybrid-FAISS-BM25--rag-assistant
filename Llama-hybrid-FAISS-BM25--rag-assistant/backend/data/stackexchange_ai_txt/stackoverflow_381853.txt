I'm writing a small and inadequate linear algebra library in C++ for a project (I'm sorry) OUCH! Be careful, be very very careful... Check out JAMA/TNT -- it's got the NIST stamp-of-approval on it and they've already handled some of the "simpler" linear algebra math e.g. various factoring algorithms. Linear algebra involves lots of tricky issues with numerical precision (e.g. Hilbert matrices ) and as much as I like doing my own thing this is one of those areas where you might want to use a good solid foundation that's already been well-tested. You should be able to use long double with it (not quite sure of that) but the algorithms themselves are probably more critical than the precision of the matrices.
