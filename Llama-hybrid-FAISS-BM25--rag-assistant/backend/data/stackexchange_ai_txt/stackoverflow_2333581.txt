Saving the actual photo in a CSV file is technically possible, but very ill-advised. CSV is simply not intended for that sort of job. You obviously cannot simply embed the binary image data into the ASCII text-based CSV file. It would be possible to use Base-64 encoding to convert the 8-bit binary data into 7-bit text, and then store this in one of the fields in your CSV file. (This will also expand the storage required by about 20%). But then what software could decode this? You would have to write some other software to convert the images back on the other end, which would defeat the purpose. Furthermore, each line of the CSV file would be massive, and probably cause problems on importing. You would be much better off exporting the profile photos as a set of PNGs, and save the filename in the CSV file against each record.
