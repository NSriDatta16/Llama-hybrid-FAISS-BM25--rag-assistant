The linear regression of success rate against categorical variable C includes no information about the number of successes or number of trials. In your particular set of 4 runs, it happened that all 4 of the runs with C=1 had a higher success rate than the 4 runs with C=0. As the numbers of successes were fairly similar within each group of 4 runs, you found a "significant" p -value in regression. Now step back and take into account the actual numbers of successes: 85 among the 4 runs with C=1, and 68 among the 4 runs with C=0. Poisson-distributed counts (as effectively assumed here in the logistic regression with such a low probability of success) have standard deviations equal to their means, so the value of 85 is $\pm$ 9.2 while the value of 68 is $\pm$ 8.2; there's a lot of overlap between the 2 distributions. So the p -value doesn't meet the threshold of "significance." So is this "significant" or not? You have to use your knowledge of the subject matter, not just some quote from a textbook, to figure out which test is most appropriate for your application. Are the assumptions of the logistic regression or of the linear regression most appropriate? If these were all runs of 19000 independent trials then the logistic regression would be more appropriate. At first glance the numbers of successes seem more tightly distributed than you might expect from Poisson statistics, but it's easy to get misled by small numbers of cases. You could get tightly-distributed numbers of successes if there were some intra-run correlations: for example, if there were consistently runs of about 1000 failures followed by a single success. In that case, however, you probably should be looking at some time-series analysis within the sets of 19000 trials instead of a simple linear regression of overall success rates.
