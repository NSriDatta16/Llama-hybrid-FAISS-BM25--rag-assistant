My guess is that the 3rd version is slower because the compiler decides to put the union in a memory variable. In the cast case, it can copy the values from register to register. You can just look at the generated machine code. As to why SSE is inaccurate, I don't have an answer. It would help if you can give real numbers. If the difference is 0.3 on a vector of size 1, that would be outrageous.
