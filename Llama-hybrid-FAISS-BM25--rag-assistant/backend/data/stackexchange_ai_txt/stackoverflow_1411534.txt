I'm not sure what the application you are looking forward to implementing, however, in this sort of situation, I would usually suggest applying angular force. Would that be sufficient for your needs in this regard? Well if that is all that you need, then i have managed to perfect the angular force equation to having entities point at a given position. EntityVector = Entity:massCenter() Leverage = sqrt( ( Entity:inertia():length()^2 ) / 3 ) LookPos = EntityVector - Target:pos() A = ang( toDeg( atanr( LookPos:z() , sqrt( LookPos:x()^2 + LookPos:y()^2) ) ) , toDeg( atanr( -LookPos:y(), -LookPos:x() ) ) , 0 ) EntityAngle = ( ( Entity:angles() - angnorm(A) ) * 5 + Entity:angVel() ) * 5 Entity:applyAngForce( -EntityAngle * Leverage ) This set of equations has helped me through countless projects
