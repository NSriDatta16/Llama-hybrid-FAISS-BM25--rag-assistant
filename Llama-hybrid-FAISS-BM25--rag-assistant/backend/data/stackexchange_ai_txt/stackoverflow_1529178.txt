git + Flash Builder workflow: how do I set it up so git works smoothly?

I'm using git to track a project I'm developing in Flash Builder, and I'm wondering the best way to go about having it track it, especially regarding Flash Builder generated files, Compiler generated files, and source files that aren't necessarily flex files. I had it set up to ignore all of the flash builder .project & debugging directories via .gitignore: .actionScriptProperties .flexProperties .metadata .project .settings bin-debug and also treating any swf/swc files as binaries via .gitattributes *.swf -crlf -diff -merge *.swc -crlf -diff -merge One issue with this setup is checking out this project and using it in Flash Builder from scratch: Flash Builder doesn't like it when you have a project folder without the .project files. Only way to import the source into Flash Builder is to: Create a new Flex Application Smother the template files it created (specifially APP_NAME.mxml) with a git clone. Where do I put libraries? From a git perspective, I'd like to have them in the lib folder of the repo so when someone clones the repo, everything just works, but from a local file system perspective I'd like to store all my libraries in a single location and use Flash Builder to reference them, as I may update the library or download a later version. Maybe I should put the libraries in their own repo and load them as a git module? This way I don't need to manually remember to update my Y library files in all X projects that are using them, edit: they will simply update when I update each projects' submodules. And what about external swfs/flex modules? I've was sticking external swf files in the bin-debug folder for now so the SWFLoader class can find them, but because I'm .gitignoring the bin-debug folder, they don't come with the repo when it's cloned. One final issue is where to keep the files for the server . Do I have them in a separate repo? I'm using php VOs' with AMFPHP so it's good to be able to edit the php files alongside my actionscript files in Flash Builder... but they don't belong in the project src folder. The current solution I'm using is: Creating a 'server' folder in the project root Pointing an apache virtualhost at it Setting the run/debug settings to http://APP_NAME.localhost Then using the server folder as a replacement for bin-debug when the files get exported The problem with this is I've got a big mess of compiler generated files, and non-AS source files in my server folder . It just doesn't seem like an elegant solution. How do you set up git to work with flash builder smoothly? Could all this be resolved with multiple git repos/Flash Builder projects, or an ANT script or something? Thanks.
