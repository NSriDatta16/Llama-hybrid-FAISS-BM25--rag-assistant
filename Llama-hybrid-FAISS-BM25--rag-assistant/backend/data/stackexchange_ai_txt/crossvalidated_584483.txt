It is absolutely standard to perform a transformation of your features and then fit a model to those transformed features. Authors like Bishop even use the name "linear regression" for this combination of transformation and fitting a linear model, see e.g. his book: Bishop, Christopher M., and Nasser M. Nasrabadi. Pattern recognition and machine learning. Vol. 4. No. 4. New York: springer, 2006. So, in particular, if your transformations np.log(df['Precipitation']) and np.sqrt(df['Temperature']) satisfy the assumptions of your model better than the original features, you should apply them.
