You could look at machine learning algorithms to find algorithms with which to evaluate the effectiveness of your choice. Like for instance: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#Approaches_and_algorithms Stuff like nearest neighbour and bayes could help you improve your suggestions. This is however overkill for just suggesting "Would you like to look at this too?", but it's an interesting approach to providing better tie-ins. It would, however require some method to figure out whether or not your users value your suggestions (e.g. "I like this!"-links or log-analysis based on time spent on links, etc.)
