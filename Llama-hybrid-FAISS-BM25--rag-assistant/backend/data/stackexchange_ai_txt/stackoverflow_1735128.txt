It really is a speed/quality trade-off. First of all, you're correct that doing one dimension then the other is slower than it has to be. Way too many memory reads and writes. Your big choice is whether to support fractional pixels or not. Your example is 100x100 to 20x50. So 10 pixels map to 1. What if you're going from 100x100 to 21x49? Are you willing to operate at source pixel boundaries, or do you want to pull fractional pixels in? What would you do for 100x100 to 99x99? You have to tell us what you're willing to accept before we can say what's fastest. And also tell us the possible extremes of the shrinkage. How many orders of magnitude might the difference between the source and destination be? At some point, sampling representative pixels inside the source are won't be much worse than averaging all the pixels. But you'll have to be careful in choosing representative pixels or you'll get aliasing with many common patterns.
