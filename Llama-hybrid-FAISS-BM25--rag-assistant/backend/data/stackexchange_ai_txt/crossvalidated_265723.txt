This question is broad yet the answers are often quite casual. Alternatively, you can see this paper which gives a concise mathematical description of a broad class of MCMC algorithms including Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-within-Gibbs and auxiliary variables methods, slice sampling, recursive proposals, directional sampling, Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, NUTS sampling, pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and pseudo-marginal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, as discussed by the authors. A credible review is given here I'll find more time to elaborate its content in the format of stackexchange.
