Answering a question with a one-sided test - which direction is implied?

An employer asks to perform a one-sided hypothesis to answer the following question: Are housing prices in your regional market higher than the national market average of 288407? What's the implied null and alternative hypotheses in this question? Do we test the null hypothesis that the housing price average is less than or equal to 288407, $$H_0: \mu \le 288407$$ $$H_A: \mu > 288407$$ or is it the other way around, and we test the null hypothesis that the house price average is larger than or equal to 288407, $$H_0: \mu \ge 288407$$ $$H_A: \mu Or is it implied that we should look at the dataset, notice the direction of the effect, and define our $H_0$ and $H_A$ to get significant results - leading us to biased inference?
