I found a good example of this: Using your own SQLite database in Android applications Basically, you export the created database as an sql-file and store it in the assets-folder. On the first program start, you import the data of the file into your final database. I think it's the best approach, however your data will be there twice in the apk and the db, using some more storage space.
