If the instance name is MSSQLSERVER then you must use a template like Server=servername . For all other instance names use a template like Server=servername\instancename . You cannot specify the default instance name explicitly. As a side note you should not peak the registry for that. First of all, is undocumented and subject to arbitrary and unannounced changes. Second, is incorrect since instances that exist in the registry might not be running. And third is again incorrect because even running instances might not be connectable to if the SQL Browser service doesn't advertise them. The recommended and supported way to detect existing instances is to use the SQL Browser broadcasting functionality, and they can be leveraged from the client code by using SmoApplication.EnumAvailableSqlServers .
