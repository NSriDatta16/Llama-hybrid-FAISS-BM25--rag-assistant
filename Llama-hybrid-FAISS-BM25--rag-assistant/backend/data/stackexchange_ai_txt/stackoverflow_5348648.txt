I have created a similar image manipulation application some months ago: image drag, zoom-in/out + different custom tools to draw (add) specific items on a QGraphicsView. I used only the setCursor() function - not the unsetCursor(). I created a timer and I set the cursor-shape inside the timer-event function according to a custom "Tool-Type" flag stored in my GraphicsView subclass and taking into account the current state of keyboard & mouse. I think this is more convenient as: a) It allows you to set the cursor-shape even if the user does not move the mouse or click on a specific object - e.g. if a "zoom tool" is selected you can set the cursor to a (+) [zoom-in cursor]. If the user holds-down the Ctrl-Key you can set the cursor to a (-) [zoom-out cursor] b) There is no need to store any cursor states: You just set the correct cursor-shape according to currently selected tool and the mouse/keyboard state. c) It's the easiest way to make your cursor-shape to quickly respond to all keyboard/mouse/tool-change events I hope this timer idea can help you to overcome all cursor-shape related problems. A timer with a 30 msec interval it will be just fine.
