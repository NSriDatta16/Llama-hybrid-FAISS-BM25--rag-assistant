Well from my point of view the superior distribution mechanism is to use something like ClickOnce , or WebStart technology. You just deploy the version to the server and it gets automatically to the clients when the version is released. Also the Eclipse RCP platform contains UpdateManager that does what WebStart do, but also much more. Since I am using Maven2 for building, the deployment is just a piece of cake: copy the built jar to the location on the server, update the jnlp file if needed and you are done.
