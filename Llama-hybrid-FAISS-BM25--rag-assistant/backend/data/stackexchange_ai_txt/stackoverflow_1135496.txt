If you have external authentication service that provides web authenticaion service you can adapt some webauth extension . This one is used in my organization. You will have to customize it of course. Yet another option is OpenID login with this extension , looks similar to stackoverflow login. In these two solutions password is not sent between the "external form" and your wiki, only a token signifying that user passed the login challenge.
