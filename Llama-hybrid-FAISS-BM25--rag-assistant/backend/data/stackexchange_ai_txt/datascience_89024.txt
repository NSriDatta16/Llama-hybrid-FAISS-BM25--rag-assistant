Can neural networks be considered a method for data analysis?

I am in the process of writing my thesis. In this thesis I am stating that neural networks can be considered a method for data analysis. After a bit of though I am now unsure if this claim is justified. Wikipedia states: "Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making." So, a feedforward network does model the data, but because of its black-box nature it is problably less useful to discover useful information. However, because of its predicive capabilities it certainly could support decission-making. However, the main goal when using neural networks is still making plain predictions, not necessarily support decission making. What is your take on this? Can feedforward neural networks be considered a method for data analysis?
