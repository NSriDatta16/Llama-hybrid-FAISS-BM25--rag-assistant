I assume you know it won't fit because you wrote/complied and got the "out of memory" error. :) It appears the answers address your question pretty accurately; short of getting code examples. I would, however, recommend a few additional thoughts; Make sure all the code is really being used -- code coverage test? An unused sub is a big win -- this is a tough step -- if you're the original author, it may be easier -- (well, maybe) :) Ensure the level of "verification" and initialization -- sometimes we have a tendency to be over zealous in insuring we have initialized variables/memory and sure enough rightly so, how many times have we been bitten by it. Not saying don't initialize (duh), but if we're doing a memory move, the destination doesn't need to be zero'd first -- this dovetails with 1 -- Eval the new features -- can an existing sub be be enhanced to cover both functions or perhaps an existing feature replaced? Break up big code if a piece of the big code can save creating a new little code. or perhaps there's an argument for hardware version 2.0 on the table now ... :) regards
