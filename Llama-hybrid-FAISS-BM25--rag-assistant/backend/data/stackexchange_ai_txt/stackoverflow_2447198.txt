You might consider immersing yourself in the Python paradigms. The best way is to first know what they are then explore the best practices by reading some literature and reviewing some code samples. I recommend Learning Python by Mark Lutz; great for beginners and advanced users. You'll do yourself a great injustice if you program with Python and fail to leverage all of the built-in, developer-friendly, Pythonic syntax. As my French teacher used to say, "French isn't just English with different words."
