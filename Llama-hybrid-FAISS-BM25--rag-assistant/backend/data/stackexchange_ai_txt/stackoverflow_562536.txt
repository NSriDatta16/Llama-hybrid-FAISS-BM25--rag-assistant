I'm not sure about Excel, but Windows Media Player has a special interaction with IE where when IE requests a file with a MIME type that Windows Media Player owns, instead of handing the downloaded file over to WMP, it instructs Windows Media Player to download the file itself. This could result in requesting the file twice, once for IE to ask for the file, and a second time when WMP downloads it. It's possible that Microsoft uses this mechanism in other products like Excel too. You might be able to discover this by looking at the User-Agent header submitted in the second request. In the Windows Media case, it actually changes from IE to WMP's User-Agent on the second request.
