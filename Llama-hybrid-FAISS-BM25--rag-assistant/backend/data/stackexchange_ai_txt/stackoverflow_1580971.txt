Structure Generics in C#

Please, help me with this problem: I Try define a structure like this: unsafe struct sNodo { public T info; public sNodo * sIzq;} but i get this error: Cannot take the address of, get the size of, or declare a pointer to a managed type sNodo, how can I fix it? I'm trying to create a stack "generic" using dynamic memory. Thank you for your attention
