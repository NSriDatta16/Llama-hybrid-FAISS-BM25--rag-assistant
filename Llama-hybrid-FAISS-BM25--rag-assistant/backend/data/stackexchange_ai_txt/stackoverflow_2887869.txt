For neural networks, you don't need the exact value of the sigmoid function. So you can precalculate 100 values and reuse the value that is closest to your input, or even better (as a comment stated) do an interpolation from the neighbour values. How you can do this is described in this article (link stolen from the answer of s-lott ). This is the sigmoid function: As you can see, only values of -10 Edit: I'm sorry that I showed the wrong graph here. I've corrected it.
