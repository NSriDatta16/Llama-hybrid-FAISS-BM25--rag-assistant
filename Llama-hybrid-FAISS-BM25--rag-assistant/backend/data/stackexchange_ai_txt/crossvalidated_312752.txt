Does there exist a variant of ARIMA allowing for weighted samples?

I have a univariate time series exhibiting strong periodicity that I want to forecast, and I plan to use ARIMA. However due to specifics of the prediction task that I'm interested in performing, some of the samples are >100x more important than other samples, and I want to make sure that this information is taken into account when I fit the model. So, is there any way to incorporate the weighting of samples into an ARIMA model?
