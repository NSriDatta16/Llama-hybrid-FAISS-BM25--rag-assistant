I generally use ScalaTest in combination with the Junit4 runner so that Maven sees and executes my tests. I like the Spec/FlatSpec/WordSpec semantics for organizing tests. I'm experimenting with the ShouldMatchers but I have used JUnit for so long that asserts just seem a bit more natural to me. Here's an example: import org.junit.runner.RunWith import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitRunner import org.scalatest.FlatSpec import org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner]) class BlogFeedHandlerTest extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers with Logging { "the thingy" should "do what I expect it to do" in { val someValue = false; assert(someValue === false) } } The ScalaTest docs are at http://www.scalatest.org/
