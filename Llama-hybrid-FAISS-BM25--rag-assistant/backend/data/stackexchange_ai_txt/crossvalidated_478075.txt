Classification Models giving probabilities at extreme end only

I am building a binary classification model with proportion of 1 is at only 3% and total 70000 data points.I have 5 variables out of which 3 are coming out to be important. I have built model using logistic regression and GBM. On doing cross validation my model's log loss is 0.11. However, when I plot the probabilities I see that they are clustered at the extreme ends with almost no cases in between. The mean probability is 0.08 and median is 0.01. I am building a scoring model so I am interested in the probabilities given by the model. Any ideas on why this could happening?
