I would try to solve the issue outside the box, maybe there is some other algorithm that could do the job much better and faster than the database. Of course it all depends on the nature of the data but there are some string search algorithm that are pretty fast (Boyer-Moore, ZBox etc), or other datamining algorithm (MapReduce ?) By carefully crafting the data export it could be possible to bend the problem to fit a more elegant and faster solution. Also, it could be possible to better parallelize the problem and with a simple client make use of the idle cycles of the systems around you, there are framework that can help with this. the output of this could be a list of refid tuples that you could use to fetch the complete data from the database much faster. This does not prevent you from experimenting with index, but if you have to wait 6 days for the results I think that justifies resources spent exploring other possible options. my 2 cent
