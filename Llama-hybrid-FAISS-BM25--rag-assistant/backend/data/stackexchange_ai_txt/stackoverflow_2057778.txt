hitTest is used by the framework to determine which view is being hit, and thus which view to send the touchesBegan / touchesMoved / touchesEnded / touchesCancelled messages to. At the point hitTest is called, you can't tell. Maybe you could explain what you are trying to accomplish, because this doesn't seem like the right way to do it.
