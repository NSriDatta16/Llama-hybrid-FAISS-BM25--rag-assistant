The two will not be the same in general. A) is the simple average where all of your 2000 observations has the same impact on the mean B) is more like the weighted average, where the observations tend to get larger weights in month with smaller sample sizes. The interpretation is also very different: A) is about the expected errors for any forecast deviating the population mean and B) is about the average errors deviating from the monthly mean.
