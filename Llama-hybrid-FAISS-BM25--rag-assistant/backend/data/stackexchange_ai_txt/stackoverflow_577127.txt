As Paolo Bergantino mentioned, you tried to alter the structure of the table rather than the data contained in it. The SQL is made up of different parts, each responsible for something different. For defining your data structures (tables, views, etc.) you use the DDL (Data Definition Language). For manipulating data on the other hand, you use the DML (Data Manipulation Language). This site shows the different parts of the SQL along with examples.
