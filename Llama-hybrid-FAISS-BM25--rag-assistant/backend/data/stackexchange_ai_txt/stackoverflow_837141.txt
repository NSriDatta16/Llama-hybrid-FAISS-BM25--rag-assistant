C# simple open source application

C# simple open source desktop application to learn from? I'm trying to learn C#, but most of the times I found tutorials for non programmers which are pretty boring, or comparission with other lenguages. I tried to compile an application that look nice enough as to call my attention and simple enough ( at first glance ) as to be understood by me, but it turns out it was developed in Mono . I've downloaded VS for C# express edition in the past, but didn't knew what to do next with it. So my question is: Does anyone knows about a simple open source Windows Application developed in C# I can learn from? It doesn't have to be too simple, but most of the ones I've looked so far are pretty complex, since they are production ready. Thanks
