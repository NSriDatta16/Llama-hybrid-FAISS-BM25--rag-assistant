Significance of (mean of?) many Spearman rank correlation coefficients

I have data for a school class of grades and family income(*). To see whether the richest kids do better, I find the spearman rank correlation coefficient for the grades and income of the kids in the class. To figure out if the result is statistically significant I can consult a table. Now suppose I have this data for K classes of different sizes (ranging from 10 kids to 40). K might be in the hundreds or thousands. I have the spearman coefficient for each class. How shall I proceed? I take the mean of these coefficients - is there a way to decide if it's significant? Say the mean is 0.03, too low to be significant for any particular class - but averaged over so many might it be significant? Is it much more sensible to lump the data together and find just one spearman coefficient for all the data? What if I can't lump the together (e.g. they're graded on different scales so it only makes sense to compare kids in the same class as each other)? How can I use all this data to check whether there's a statistically significant relationship between household income and grades? (*) these details are fake but I'm facing an equivalent problem.
