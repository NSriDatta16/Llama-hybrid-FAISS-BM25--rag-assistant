If the threads are doing I/O, waiting on synchronization mechanisms, or are going to sleep, they can use less (and sometimes more) than the timeslice they would use doing straight computation. The OS tries its best to give threads with identical thread/process priority the same quantum, but in reality the actual time given can vary. For example, a thread that spends practically its entire (wall) time sleeping waiting on an exit event is going to be given less time, on average (over its total run), than one of equal priority that is doing compuation for the same amount of (wall) time.
