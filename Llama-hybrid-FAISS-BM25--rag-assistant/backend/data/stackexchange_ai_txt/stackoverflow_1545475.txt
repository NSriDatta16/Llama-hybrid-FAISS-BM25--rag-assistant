Ruby on Rails drag and drop won't work

I am trying to create a Ruby on rails application using the integrated scriptaculous drag and drop effect. Since I'm new to the ruby language I ended up with this code while viewing many documentation but can't understand why the controller code is not executed. In the html.erb page the origin div "> '> The target 'trash'%> And I identify the drop target 'origin', :complete => "$('spinner').hide();" , :before => "$('spinner').show();" , :hoverclass => 'hover', :with => "'paramid=' + encodeURIComponent(element.id.split('_').last())" , :url => {:action=>:trash_therm})%> And finally in my controller def trash_therm redirect_to(:action => 'create') end When I drop the item in the target the dropped content sticks to the target. If the target didn't "catch" the item it would revert to it's original position. I don't understand why the code in the controller is not executed. Thank in advance for help
