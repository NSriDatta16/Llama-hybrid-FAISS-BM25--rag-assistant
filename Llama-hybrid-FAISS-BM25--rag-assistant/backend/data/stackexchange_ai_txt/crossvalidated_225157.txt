Dimensionality reduction of small vectors (image processing)

I have N small floating point vectors of length K (typically, N is in the millions and K=9). I need to compute a lot (millions and millions) of squared euclidean distances between those vectors. It would be great if i could reduce this 9-vector elements to, say, length 3 or 4. I was thinking about PCA. I could pre-compute and store the reduced vectors and then proceed with the distances computation. Could this work? For instances, each of those vectors is a vectorized 3x3 patch around given pixel of a natural image. A patch is created for every pixel. In your opinion, could this work?
