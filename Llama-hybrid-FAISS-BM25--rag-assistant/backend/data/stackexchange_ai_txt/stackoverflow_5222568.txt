Sharing an Instance of a Cocoa FBA (Faceless Background Application or simply Agent)

Objective I'm building an FBA (Faceless Background Application). Other applications (clients) register with the FBA using the NSDistributedNotificationCenter. When a client registers, i'd like to be able to invoke messages directly on the client object. First Issue: When the client posts a notification requesting registration, I originally wanted to set a userInfo key to the client. [NSValue valueWithPointer:self]; // where self is the client application However when the notification is posted, an error is generated saying the userInfo is not serializable. Issue 2: I created a work around by giving the userInfo a NSNumber instead. [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedInteger:(NSUInteger)self]; The FBA now receives the appropriate pointer when it receives the notification. However when I try to access the object(the client), a EXEC_BAD_ACCESS error is generated. So, I guess my question is, how can I get access to another memory space? Do I have to create a shared memory space somehow? Is this possible? Am I stepping in the wrong direction with this design pattern? Thanks.
