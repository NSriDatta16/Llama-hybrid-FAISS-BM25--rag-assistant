Store session data in a shared store (such as a memcached server) which all app servers can access. If you have enough state in your app servers that you need your load balancer to send all requests from the same client to the same server for the duration of their session -- well, yes, you can make your load balancer do that for you, but the larger answer is that You're Doing It Wrong. Since you're using PHP, you might find the blog entry at http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/enhance_php_session_management/ (describing using memcached for PHP session storage) useful.
