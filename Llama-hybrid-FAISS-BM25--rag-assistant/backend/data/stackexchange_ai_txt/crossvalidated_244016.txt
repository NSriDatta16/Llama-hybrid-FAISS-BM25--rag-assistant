Goal: I would like to calculate a number reflecting the preferences of the shows for choosing a guest correcting for #guests and MaxShows. So you are interested in some kind of regression model that predicts number of chosen guests (e.g. Poisson regression), or probability of choosing a guest (logistic regression). Parameters for shows would be the "numbers reflecting the preferences" and regression will deal with "correcting" for the other parameters. Now you need to make a decision what kind of model suits your purpose better and what variables to include. One thing to notice is that you have a colinear variables: Totalguest has always the same values for each level of Guest , TotalShows has always the same values for each level of Show . What it means for you is that you cannot include Totalguest together with Guest , or TotalShows together with Show , since they "duplicate" the information they contain. You need to decide for using only one of each pair.
