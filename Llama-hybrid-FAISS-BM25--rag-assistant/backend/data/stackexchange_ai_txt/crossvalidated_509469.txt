I think what I was looking for is Eq. 234 in this document : I believe that this marginal likelihood is also often called the "model evidence" or the "prior predictive density". For example, this document uses the term "prior predictive distribution" to refer to the 1-D version of Eq. 234: https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-statistics/normal-distribution-Bayesian-estimation#hid6 Therefore, I will leave the title of this question as is.
