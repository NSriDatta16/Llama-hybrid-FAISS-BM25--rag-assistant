Why does this cause an endless loop in Chrome?

This may be a dumb question, but why is the below for loop going into an endless loop in Chrome but not in Firefox? (Obviously, the loop test is where it's failing - I just don't know why). for(var i = 0; localStorage[this.config.localStoragePrefix + i] != 'undefined'; i++) this.config.appCount++; It's doing checking how many localStorage elements exist. For example: localStorage['myPrefix_0'] localStorage['myPrefix_1'] localStorage['myPrefix_2'] ... Would return 3. Any thoughts on why this loops forever in Chrome?
