Why does my Perl CGI program fail when I include a file?

I'm trying to create a base template which then loads data depending on what actions are taken. I included ( required ) some pages which was fine but when I included another file which I got a 500 internal error. pasting the code straight in and it works fine: Here's what I've got; #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use LWP::Simple; require LWP::UserAgent; use DBI; #deal with post requests require "perl/post-sort.pl"; #loading stylesheets and javascripts require "header.pl"; # bring in loggin js if( $arg{REQUEST_KEY} eq "") { require "javascript/js-main-login.pl"; } print " \n"; print " \n"; ... ... perl/post-sort.pl my %arg = (); for (split /\&/, ) { my ($key, $val) = split /=/; $val =~ s/\+/ /g; $val =~ s/%([0-9a-fA-F]{2})/chr(hex($1))/ge; $arg{$key} = $val; } Any help much appreciated.
