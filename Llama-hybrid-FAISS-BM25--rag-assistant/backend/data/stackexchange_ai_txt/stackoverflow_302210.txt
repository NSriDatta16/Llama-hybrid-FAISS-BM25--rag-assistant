I'll second Ilja's recommendation for the book: http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Adoption-Patterns-Roadmap-Organizational/dp/0321514521 I think the single most valuable piece of the book is the description of what practices to adopt first to achieve certain business values (quality, time to market, ...). Reviews of the book: http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Adoption-Patterns-Roadmap-Organizational/dp/0321514521 Sample Chapter: http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321514521#info8 Finally come join an Agile mailing list at groups.yahoo.com either ScrumDevelopment or AgileProjectManagement will suit your needs well.
