Amazon S3 Multiple Custom Domain Without Cloudfront

Is it possible to setup Amazon's Simple Storage Solution to use custom domains (storage-01.example.com, storage-02.example.com, storage-03.example.com, ...) without using Cloud Front? I don't really care about having an 'edge' network, but do want the browsers to make parallel requests for assets. Thanks!
