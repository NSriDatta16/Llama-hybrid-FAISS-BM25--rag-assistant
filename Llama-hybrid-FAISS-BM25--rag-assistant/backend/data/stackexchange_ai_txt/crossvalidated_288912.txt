Uninformative (flat) Prior density for non-linear functions

We, bayesians, usually use non-informative priors for the parameters like $p(\beta)\propto 1$. Someone told me that such a flat prior is informative to some extent for non-linear functions of the parameters $\beta$. I thought this sort of prior was always uninformative for any kind of functional form. I would appreciate some clarification on this point!
