The above expression can also be found in Hamilton's Time Series Analysis, p. 488, while in the preceding pages there one can find how it is derived. As regards the "independence" issue, the answer is NO, the numerator and the denominator are not independent (but this does not affect the derivation of the limiting distribution). (Note for new comers: the denominator, even though a definite integral, is a random variable, not a constant).
