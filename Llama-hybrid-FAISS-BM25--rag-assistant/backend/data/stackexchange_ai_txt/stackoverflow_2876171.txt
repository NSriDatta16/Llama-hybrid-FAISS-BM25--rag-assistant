EDIT This applies only if you want shell integrated drag-and-drop. If you are not integrating with the shell, and only dragging and dropping between things in your own app, then this answer does not apply. My apologies for the confusion. You need to support drag-n-drop in your app or control. This involves some COM interop. It seems a little complicated at first, but once you get the basic skeleton up, it's not that hard to implement. Also there's a nice guide right here, that tells you how: http://blogs.msdn.com/adamroot/pages/shell-style-drag-and-drop-in-net-wpf-and-winforms.aspx
