Datareader or Dataset in Winform with long trips to database?

I've got a Winform app that will be used in the US and China. The SQL Server 2005 database is in the US, so the data access is going to be slower for the people in China. I'm deciding between using a DataReader and a Dataset for best performance. The data will immediately be loaded into business objects upon retrieval. Question: Which performs better (DataReader/DataSet) pulling data from a database that's far away? I have read that the DataReader goes back to the database for each .Read(), so if the connection is slow to begin with, will the DataSet be a better choice here? Thanks
