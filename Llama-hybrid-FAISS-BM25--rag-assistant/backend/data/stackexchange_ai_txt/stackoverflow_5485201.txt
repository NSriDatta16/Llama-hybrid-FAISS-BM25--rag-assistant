ASP NET MVC Templates is the solution. First of all, using ViewData is discouraged especially now in MVC 2.0 and 3.0 where there are many better ways to pass state to the view. Strongly typed view is the way to go. But What if you have a collection to pass? Well, you still can create a strongly typed view for the collection (or generic list) but standard solution is to use ASP NET MVC templates (which are ascx files) for the item and not the collection and call RenderPartial on your parent view: For example: Bar m.Bars[i].Content)%> There is a very good series on this topic here .
