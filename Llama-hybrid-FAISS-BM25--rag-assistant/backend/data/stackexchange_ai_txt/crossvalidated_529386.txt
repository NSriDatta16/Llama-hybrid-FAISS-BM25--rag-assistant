It is not uncommon to estimate an SEM from which the values of the latent variables are computed, and to use these for some other modelling (SEM or otherwise). Most SEM software that I am aware of allows the outputting of the latent variables. The intuition behind latent variables being "actual" variables, as per the question title, is simply that they are unobserved. This is the literal meaning of a latent variable. As for the ways composite variables are computed (sums or averaged) or in other cases such as PCA or exploratory factor analysis, we think of these variables as being computed from the raw variables and thus caused by them - so in a diagram you would have arrows pointing from the raw variables to the composite variable. On the other hand in SEM and confirmatory factor analysis we think of the variables as representing something that is unmeasured. A good example is "true" blood pressure. We can measure a person's blood pressure at various times during the day, and there will be natural biological variation in these measurements. There may also be variation due to measurement error. But from a clinicians point of view, they just want to know the "true" blood pressure (for example does the patient suffer from generally high blood pressure). In an SEM, we would have arrows pointing from the latent variable to the raw variables, because we think of the raw variables as being caused by the latent variable (plus some error).
