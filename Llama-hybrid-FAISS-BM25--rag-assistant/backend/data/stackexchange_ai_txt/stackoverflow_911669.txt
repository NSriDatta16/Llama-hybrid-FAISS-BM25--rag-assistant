SSIS package fails as a SQL Server Agent Job

I have a package that imports from a AS400 file to SQL. The package executes properly within Visual Studio, but fails when set up as a scheduled job. the error message is that my password is incorrect. I know that it is correct. I also setup a package configuration and this did not work. I have searched and tried many things. Could someone give me some assistance?
