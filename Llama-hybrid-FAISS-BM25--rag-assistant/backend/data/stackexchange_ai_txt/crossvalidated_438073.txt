Improvement Over Chance for an Event Forecasting System

Suppose I have a device that forecasts migraines. It does so by reading electrocardiograms and sending the ECG through a machine learning model, which returns a 0/1 classification of whether or not a migraine will occur with in an hour. How can I show that my forecasting model is better than a forecaster that works off chance? I have a few key ideas, but I am struggling in a few places: My model spends x% of time before the migraine in warning, so the chance predictor spends x% in time of warning as well. Then, I compare the sensitivities of both predictors. This doesn't make full sense though ... how would a chance predictor even work? Perhaps comparison against a naive predictor could work? ( https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/130/2/314/284154 ) Definitely a difficult problem. It's a unique question of significance: how do I prove my test/treatment/device works better than placebo/chance?
