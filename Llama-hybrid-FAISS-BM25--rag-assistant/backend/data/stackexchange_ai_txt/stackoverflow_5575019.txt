Lookup from multiple tables

Ok, so I have the database of people. Many people can be members of Many organisations. I have this implimented with a table of Orgs a table of people and a table of membership. And then a lookup listbox in Members for both This is fine. But some people are members of Sub-organisations. So I have a table of Sub-organisation (1 org has many sub orgs) Now some people are just members of an organisation without being members of any of it's suborgs. some organisations have no suborgs. ATM I implemented this by having the look up look up from both: SELECT [Sub-Organisations].[Group Name], Organisations.[Organisation Name] FROM Organisations, [Sub-Organisations]; But this only comes up with options to be part of a suborg. What am I doing wrong?
