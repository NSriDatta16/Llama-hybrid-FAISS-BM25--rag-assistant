Excel 2007: remove text limitations from cell

I would like to type at least 500 characters in excel sheet cell. But when I do that it only lets me add 1 paragraph like 196 characters . When I add another paragraph, it gives me a message ** "Exceeded Text Limit" **. How do I resolve this so I can add lot of text in the cell. I googled and tried different things and failed. Please help !!!
