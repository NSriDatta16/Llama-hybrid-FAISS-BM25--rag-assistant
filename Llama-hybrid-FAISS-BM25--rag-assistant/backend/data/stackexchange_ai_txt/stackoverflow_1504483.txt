It's a big question. The approach you mentioned is very much focused on the details when you might be better served figuring out the high-level design first. It sounds like you have a lot of data and might be overloading your users. I would recommend that you do the following: Ask your users . They live right down the hall, so this is easier for you. Ask them what kinds of things they go to the intranet for right now . (You can ask them to talk about hypothetical situations, but that's a different technique, and yields speculative data.) Ask if you can watch them use the intranet. Aggregate their feedback and try to see patterns in it. Can you group data according to some logical classification? Is it better for you to provide a database-style search interface? What about both -- they're not mutually exclusive? Look for examples . Look at websites that work for you: Stack Overflow? Amazon? Netflix? Whatever it is. What can you learn from how they organize and present information? Mock up a simple prototype . And when I say 'simple' it could just be markers and sticky notes on a whiteboard. Use this low-fidelity prototype with a few users and see if they can figure it out. Don't "help", see what they make of it -- see if they can find what they're looking for. Iterate. Do steps 1-4 over and over as you approach a design. Good luck! This is a real challenge, but if you make a system that works well you will save your company a huge amount of wasted time; and time is money.
