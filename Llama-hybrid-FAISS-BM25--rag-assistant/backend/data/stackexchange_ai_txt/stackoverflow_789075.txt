How to create Java Custom Web Controls?

This question was originary in my head as "Can I use AWT controls in a Servlet?" , which will show all my ignorance on the subject. I am new to JAVA technologies but after a bit of reading, I seem to understand AWT controls directly hook up the OS GUI elements so there is no way to use or extend JPanels, JButtons and so forth in a Servlet to be injected in a JSP and let the browser render those controls (an alternative could probably be embedding an applet in a JSP but I don't wanna do that). I am looking for a way of building custom re-usable web controls using JSPs and Servlets. How is this usually done and can you provide some samples/links? EDIT: This is part of a test run I am giving to the Google Application Engine - so it would probably make sense for me to explore the Google Web Toolkit - any pointers in that directions would be appreciated as well. Any help appreciated!
