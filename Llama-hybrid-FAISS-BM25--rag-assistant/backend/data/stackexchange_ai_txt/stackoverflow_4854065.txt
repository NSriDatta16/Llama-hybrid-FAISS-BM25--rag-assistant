Amortized basically means average per number of operations. So, if you have an array of n, you need to insert n+1 items until you'll need the reallocation. So, you've done n inserts which each one of them took O(1) , and another insert that took O(n) , so in total you've got n+1 actions that cost you 2n operations . 2n / n+1 ~= 1 That's why the Amortized time is still O(1)
