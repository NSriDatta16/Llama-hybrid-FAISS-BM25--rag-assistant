How to perform a sensitivity analysis in Bayesian statistics?

Bayesian inference is drawn from the posterior distribution or - in case we are interested in forecasting - from the predictive posterior distribution. However, these values are heavily affected by the choice of the prior, even if you have decided to go for an uninformed one (which can be implemented in many different ways). Is there a standard way to convince the audience that your choice of the prior does not lead your results a priori in a way that would diminish the value of your results (Of course your results are affected by informed priors, but slight changes in your prior should - at least in my intuition - not lead to extreme changes in the results.)? Could this problem be relaxed by the choice of hierarchical models because it also implies 'switching' priors? I am happy for each and every comment or reference on how this problem can be tackled,thank you!
