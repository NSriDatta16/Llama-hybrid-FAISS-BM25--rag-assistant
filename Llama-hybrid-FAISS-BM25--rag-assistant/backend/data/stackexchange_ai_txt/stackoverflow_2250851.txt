Add bi.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad directly after your .BeginInit() : BitmapImage bi = new BitmapImage(); bi.BeginInit(); bi.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; ... Without this, BitmapImage uses lazy initialization by default and stream will be closed by then. In first example you try to read image from possibly garbage-collected closed or even disposed MemoryStream. Second example uses file, which is still available. Also, don't write var byteStream = new System.IO.MemoryStream(buffer); better using (MemoryStream byteStream = new MemoryStream(buffer)) { ... }
