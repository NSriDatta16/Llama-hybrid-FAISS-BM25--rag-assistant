Bitwise operation and the leading paragraphs of Mask are a concise explanation, and contain some pointers for further study. Think of an 8-bit byte as a set of elements from an 8-member universe. A member is IN the set when the corresponding bit is set. Setting a bit more then once doesn't modify set membership (a bit can have only 2 states). The bitwise operators in C provide access to bits by masking and shifting .
