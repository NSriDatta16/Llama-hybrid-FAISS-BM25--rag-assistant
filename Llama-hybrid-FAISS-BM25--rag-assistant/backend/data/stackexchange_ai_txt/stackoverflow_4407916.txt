Implementation question about classic n-Queens in Java

This is a homework question. I am writing a solution for classic n-Queens problem in Java. My program looks like this but it returns a collection of all legal queens placements instead of printing them out. I represent queens placement as int[] and return Set using HashSet as it's implementation. ( Set is appropriate here since the order of the placements is not important). The problem is that Java arrays do not override hashCode and different array instances with the same values have the different hash codes. I can write a wrapper class QueensPlacements , which holds an array and overrides hashCode with Arrays.deepHashCode , and return Set . However it seems verbose and inelegant. Can anybody suggest any better solution ?
