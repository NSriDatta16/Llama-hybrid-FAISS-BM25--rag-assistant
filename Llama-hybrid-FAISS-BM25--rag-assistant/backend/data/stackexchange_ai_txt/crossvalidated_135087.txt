I think these two are actually very similar. In the experimental settings, you are comparing some mean outcome for treated versus control and you are worried that there might be individuals with some observed characteristics who appear only among participants or non-participants (or appear more often) and/or that this is happening with some unobserved characteristics, which is a much harder problem. In the prototypical survey setting, you are essentially comparing wages for low-education (C) and high-education (T) women, and you are worried that you are not observing women with large negative unobservables in the low education groups because they are not in the labor force. Education might be multivalued rather than binary, but the spirit of this comparative exercise is the same. In both cases, you are using the average outcome for the control or low-education groups in place of what would have happened to the treated or high-education group in the absence of that treatment or education, which is something you don't see.
