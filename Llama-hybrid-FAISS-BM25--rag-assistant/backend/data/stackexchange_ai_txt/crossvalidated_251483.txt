In a time series signal, stationarity can be introduced by using windowing. You can break your single time series signal into smaller signals using good window technique with overlap. Windowing is required to avoid spurious peaks in the frequency domain and overlap is required to conserve signal energy. Typically a speech signal (8KHz sampling frequency) has 30 msec frames giving 240 samples per frame. This is convoluted using a hamming window with 50% overlap.
