Sometimes, in political polls, pollsters take non-random samples from a given population, This is a bit ambiguous. Very often samples are not completely randomised and there are some selection biases. But still, the results from this non-random selection might be in some way random. The question is by how much the selection effect and the related bias is negligible. A poll among your close friends is not a good representation. Neither is a poll on some website. However a polling organisation that selects a representative mixture of the population is probably gonna get close to the true answer. The selection by the polling agency might be random or not, that doesn't really matter. Urn example Say there are 100 urns labeled $i,j$ with $1\leq i\leq25$ and $1\leq j \leq 4$ . The urns contain blue and red balls with fractions that are determined by a random process. The random process is likely depending on $j$ but not so much on $i$ . We want to know the fraction of red and blue balls in the total of all urns. Say that we can only sample twelve of those urns due to limitations of resources. We can randomize our samples in different ways: We could make a random selection out of the 100 urns, but we could also decide to fix our pick (non randomly) to 3 urns out of each of the 4 $j$ categories. We could randomly select 3 $i$ out of each $j$ but we could also select some specific $i$ (because it might be more convenient). All these non-random choices introduce potential bias . But that bias might be negligible if we consider that the intentional choices have only a small effect on bias. Also note that in the end the sampling process is still giving a random variable (but only biased random). We might have selected some urn labels $i$ non randomly, but how the balls got inside the urns is still a random process, a random value. The issue with non randomised sampling methods is not that the outcome variable is not random, but that the outcome variable might be biased. E.g. that poll among your friends is still a random variable.
