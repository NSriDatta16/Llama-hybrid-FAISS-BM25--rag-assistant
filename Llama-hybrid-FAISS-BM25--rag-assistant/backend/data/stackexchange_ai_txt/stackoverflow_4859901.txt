Postgres SQL operator does not exist; character = integer;

I am do replicating of two database (SQL Server 2000 and PostgreSQL). I use http://blog.hagander.net/archives/103-Replicating-from-MS-SQL-Server-to-PostgreSQL.html for this. Then I do last step the ERROR: operator does not exist: character = integer; Error executing the query appeared. I use the PostgreSQL 8.4.6 for that and ODBC drivers (all psqlodbc_08_04_0100.zip, psqlodbc_08_04_0200.zip) from here i also try to delete and install version that Synaptic called 9.0.2-1 and update odbc drivers i try (psqlodbc_09_00_0100.zip, psqlodbc_09_00_0101.zip, psqlodbc_09_00_0200.zip) it also return that error. The query launched from delphi where i use only System DSN runs normally
