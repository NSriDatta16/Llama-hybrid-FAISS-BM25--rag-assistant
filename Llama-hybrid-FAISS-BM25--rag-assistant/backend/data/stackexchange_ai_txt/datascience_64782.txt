How do I read accuracy and loss curves for a CNN?

I am using transfer learning and after evaluating the model I have the following plots which compare test and train accuracy and test and train loss: what I see is that between test and train accuracy there is a large gap, but how do I interpret this result? I don't think I am doing bad since I have a test accuracy of 0.880000. I am trying to do image classification and in my training set I have 3200 images, while in the test set I have 800 images. As pretrained network I am using VGG16. Can somebody please help me? Thanks in advance. [EDIT]Also the other metrics such as Recall,F1 score and Precision are good:
