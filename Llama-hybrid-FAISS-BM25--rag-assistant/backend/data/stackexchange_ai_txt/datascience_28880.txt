Basic encoder-decoder architecture

I read a couple of posts (like this one ) about the encoder-decoder architecture and their implementation. But I still don't understand a couple of things. What is the difference between a basic CNN or RNN and encoder decoder ? Are there some properties that the encoder and decoder need to satisfy ? As far as I understood the encoder encodes the input in another dimension and creates a context vector. Later this context vector is decoded by the decoder. I know that their are different types of encoders and decoders, what is the most simple architecture to implement ? Should I use predefined word embeddings like word2vect in the encoder(if i have text as an input) ?
