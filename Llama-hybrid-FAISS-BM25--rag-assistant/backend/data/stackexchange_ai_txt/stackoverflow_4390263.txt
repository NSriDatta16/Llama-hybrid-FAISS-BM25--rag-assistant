Integrate GWT with Google Fusion Tables API

I have recently tried to move a visualization project, developed in javascript to GWT, hoping to get better structure and optimised code. As a part of the transfer we also wanted to go from google spreadsheet to fusion tables as our data storage. I haven't been able to find a good tutorial that supports GWT's web applications or I might just not been able to implement them correctly. I have tried to implement e.g. Hello World and gwt-gdata , with errors as soon as I use any library. Can anyone please tell me if this is possible, if there is any way to send requests to the Fusion Tables using GWT? Thank you!
