Temporal difference definition (Reinforcement Learning)

Reading for instance Szepesvari or this : i struggle to understand the rationale behind the temporal-difference definition $\delta_{t}=R_{t}+\gamma V_{k}(x_{t+1})-V_{k}(x_{t})$ with the notation from the second reference page 33 or $\delta_{t}=r(x_{t},a_{t})+V(x_{t+1})-V(x_{t})$ with the notation from the second reference page 12. Why are we adding the reward to a difference between value function evaluation at two time steps ? I would expect this new reward to be included in $V(x_{t+1})$ .
