Best practices to modelize top layers over CNN

I'm fine-tuning a InceptionResnetv2 network to get a features extractor, so I'm training a classical classifier with my data (one label/data, i'm using a softmax). I would like to know how to choose architecture for top layers (fully connected), I read that usually Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Softmax were used. How to choose between Flatten/MaxPool/AvgPool Dense(256)/Dense(512)/Dense(1024) is it purely empyric ?
