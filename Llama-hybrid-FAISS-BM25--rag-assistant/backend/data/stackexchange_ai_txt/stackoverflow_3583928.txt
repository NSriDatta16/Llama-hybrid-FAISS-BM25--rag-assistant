PHP loop checking existence of a string in an array then outputting a boolean

Fairly rubbish with PHP, this is a continuation on from my last question . I have a list of user agents inside an array, and I want an output to be true if the user agent matches one listed inside the array. This is what I have for a single user agent: I want something like this: I guess a while loop would be a good option, but I am clueless.
