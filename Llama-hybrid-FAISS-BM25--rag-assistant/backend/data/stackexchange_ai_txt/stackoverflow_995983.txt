The error is misleading. It really should say "A large enough contiguous space in virtual memory could not be found to perform the operation". Over time allocations and deallocations of virtual memory space leads to it becoming fragmented. This can lead to situations where a large allocation cannot be filled despite there being a plenty total space available. I think this what your "segmentation" is refering to. Without knowing all the details of everything else that needs to load and other activity which occupies the 2-3 hour period its difficult to say whether this really is the cause. However I would not put it into the category of unlikely, in fact it is the most likely cause.
