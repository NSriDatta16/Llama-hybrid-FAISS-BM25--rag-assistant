since you are learning c++, I will introduce you the c++ iterator way of erasing. for (string::iterator it = paragraph.begin(); it != paragraph.end(); ++it) while (it != paragraph.end() && (*it == ',' || *it == '.' || ....... )) it = paragraph.erase(it); First, try using iterator .

Second, single quote ' and double quote " differs. You use ' for char .
