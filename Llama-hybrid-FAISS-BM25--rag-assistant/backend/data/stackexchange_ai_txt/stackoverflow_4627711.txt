C++ OpenMP program

I am trying to get a parallel effect in C++ program using the following code: #include using namespace std; int main() { #pragma omp parallel sections { #pragma omp section { cout I had run this program many times.. I was expecting interleaved output due to parallelism.. However, every time I run this program the output is: Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Am I doing something wrong? Thanks
