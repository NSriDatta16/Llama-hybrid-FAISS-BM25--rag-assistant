Let me start by saying that we run a significant financial services offering on a 100% cloud-based environment. Cloud computing is not really that well defined (like with any buzz word, everyone wants to somehow brand their existing product with the newest buzz word). The key to cloud computing in my mind is that I can look at computing resources (CPU, memory, etc) like a commodity rather than as capital. What does that mean? Traditionally, if I want to add some computing power to my organization, I need to go out and buy more computers, set them up, and maintain them. Cloud computing (Eric J.'s definition) lets me grab extra computing power exactly when I need it, and then release it when I don't. We offer a sales tax calculation service. In the run up to Christmas, we need a lot more computing power than at other times of the year. Our cloud environment lets me add resources in seconds and then release them just as quickly when I don't need them. One of our big customers sometimes has 1-hour mega-sales. I can add extra processing power just for that hour then release it when done. The solution we offer on top of that cloud computing infrastructure is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Things like GMail are SaaS, not cloud computing, in my view. So how does all of this compare to distributed computing? Distributed computing just means I break up a problem so that I can have a whole bunch of computers work on it at the same time. Berkeley University's BOINC project is an excellent example of this (and please consider signing up for it). They distribute scientific research projects across all computers that volunteers provide. The computers involved in BOINC and other distributed projects can be people's laptops, desktops, servers. They can be installed in my office, virtual servers leased from an ISP, or virtual servers that are part of a "cloud". It matters not one bit where the computers come from. If I can install the distributed computing software on a computer, it can be part of the distributed solution.
