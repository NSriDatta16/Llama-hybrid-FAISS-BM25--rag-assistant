I see three possible answers: 1) you can set up PHP so that it pays attention to the .js file, like this guy talks about: http://www.geekhelpguide.com/php/handle-images-css-js-php-httpd-conf-using-htaccess/ or 2) make a hidden variable in your .php file like this: "> and then reference your hidden variable with the javascript, like this (if you use jquery): $("#myvariable").val(); or 3) embedding your javascript inside your .php file like some of the other folks who have given answers have suggested. I hope that helps. Please mark as answer if it did.
