plotting the latent space of a GAN

I am working on gans and wanted to know how I can plot the latent space of gan. Like I have a latent space of shape (50,250). So it is an n-d array of length 50 and 250 points representing each one of them. I wanted to know a good way to plot them and also a way to make it an interactive graph of points where I can hover my mouse to see the transition from one latent point to another. I checked online but I can't find anything which can act as a reference. I was hoping someone could guide me on how to achieve this task. I tried plotting the latent dimensions by using plotly express, but that's all I can do for now.
