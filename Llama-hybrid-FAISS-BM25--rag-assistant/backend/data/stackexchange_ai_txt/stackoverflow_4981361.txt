How to stop PHPUnit from adding included/required files as part of the testsuite?

I tried to follow the PHPUnit manual on how to setup a testsuite with a custom test execution order. I now realized that i only need these lines and some includes to get the suite working: public static function suite() { $suite = new PHPUnit_Framework_TestSuite('Package'); return $suite; } But when i use the above lines the test execution order is defined by the sort order of my includes. And when i try to change it via suite() as followes the tests are executed twice, first in the sort order as defined by suite() and after that in the sort order of the includes: public static function suite() { $suite = new PHPUnit_Framework_TestSuite('Package'); $suite->addTestSuite('Package_Class1Test'); $suite->addTestSuite('Package_Class2Test'); $suite->addTestSuite('Package_Class3Test'); return $suite; } Includes are done by: require_once 'Package/Class3Test.php'; require_once 'Package/Class2Test.php'; require_once 'Package/Class1Test.php'; Result (test execution order): 1) Class1Test 2) Class2Test 3) Class3Test 4) Class3Test 5) Class2Test 6) Class1Test I am using Netbeans 7.0beta to run the PHP 5.3.5 / PHPUnit 3.5.11 on windows 7. I read the phpunit manual (http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.5/en/organizing-tests.html) but i have no clue what i am doing wrong... Please help. PS: This problem can be solved by autoloading the classes.
