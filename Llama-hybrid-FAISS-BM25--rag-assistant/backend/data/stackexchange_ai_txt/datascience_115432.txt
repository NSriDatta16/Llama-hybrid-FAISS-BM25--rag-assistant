Potential solution for a NLP clustering problem

Trying to approach this clustering-based problem Let's imagine I have a dataset containing millions of observations in a tabular data set, containing categorical, time-based, numerical, and text columns. (text column is basically a manual description uploaded by the user, detailing the complaint). Historically these complaints are raised by automatic systems or people. Many a time multiple systems or people raised the same issue, resulting in multiple individual complaints. Complaints that map to the same issue should most of the time should look similar in terms of features, according to my observation. My task is to cluster them in a way so that I can identify which complaints belong to the same problem. Historically I have data that tells me which complaints were duplicates. Now my initial approach was to do some hierarchal clustering but got stuck on some issues- How to accommodate text-based columns in clustering algorithms? Given I have label data, is there is way to leverage this to develop a better clustering algorithm? Any links or papers would be really helpful. Thanks in advance. Note - CLusters are not few. for example in 24 hr period, there will be 100k complaints of which ~40k will be duplicates and 60k will be unique.
