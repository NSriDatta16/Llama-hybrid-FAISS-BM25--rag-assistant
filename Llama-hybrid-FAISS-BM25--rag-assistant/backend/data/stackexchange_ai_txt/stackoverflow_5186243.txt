I prefer one class library for each layer. It provides good organization and hierachy between libraries. For example, UI layer never knows about Data Access Layer and it cannot know since it doesn't have reference to Data Access Layer. However, sometimes layers are placed in the same class library to shorten the compilation time. If you don't have an overhead like this, always choose seperated one.
