Updating Bayesian prior & likelihood for A/B test

I'm fairly new to bayesian. I'm trying to edit a bayesian python code for $A/B$ test analysis. I'm using uninformative priors as a beta distribution, so my $\alpha$ & $\beta$ parameters are $1$ & $1$ for both control & test for the first observation of the data. I have a function which takes in priors, visitors for control, visitors for test and their respective conversions to calculate the posterior I'm using this Bayesian formula to update the priors -> $\textrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$, and add the successes from the data, $x$, to $\alpha$ and the failures, $n – x$, to $\beta$, and there’s your posterior, $\textrm{Beta}(\alpha+x, \beta+n-x)$. Since this is for an $A/B$ test, i'm using cumulative visitors & conversions for each day as my likelihood and updating the priors from the formula above. My question is, Should I use cumulative visitors & conversions for each day as my likelihood or visitors & conversions for each day separately since I'm updating the previous days' data in priors? So my doubt is am I updating previous information in both my likelihood & prior?
