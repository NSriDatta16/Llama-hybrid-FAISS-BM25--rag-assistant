How can you use the Magento API to query a list of orders with multiple status values?

I am trying to use Magento SOAP to query an order list. I've got it pulling values for a single status but need to pull multiple values. (ex: Processing, Complete, etc.) Here's my code for one status value... $orderListRaw = $proxy->call($sessionId, 'sales_order.list', array(array('status'=>array('='=>$orderstatus)))); Any insight into having it pull for multiple values? Queries are all from a remote server so I can't use Mage.
