Is there a way to explain and generalise the decision made by random forest?

I saw a similar question was asked a few years ago, maybe there are updates on that. I would like to have a way to explain the decisions generated by random forest, possibly in a single tree. I tried to evaluate each tree and select the best performing one, but using this method I get (as expected) a lot of variation. Is there a way to generalise a random forest which would produce more consistency? many thanks,
