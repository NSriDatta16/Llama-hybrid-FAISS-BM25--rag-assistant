Without more information it is hard to give an answer -- what kind of data, how it is to be accessed? Form follows function here, too. Relational database and XML have very different models (relational vs hierarchic), and main difference is not necessarily performance (both can be efficient or inefficient) but usage and access patterns. And I am not quire sure what "raw" data would mean -- maybe platform default serialization? One minor on XML storage: XML compresses nicely, so when storing sizable XML documents, on-the-fly compression (with gzip etc) makes sense. Compression ratios can be high; I had 30-to-1 compression for log files that were written as xml.
