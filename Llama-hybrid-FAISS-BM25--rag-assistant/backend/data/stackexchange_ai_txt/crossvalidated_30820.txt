How do you predict a continuous value from many booleans & a continuous value?

Hello: I am a computer science student working as a research assistant in an undergrad IR lab, feeling spectacularly out of my element. Given an input of a single continuous value and a vector of several dozen boolean values, I must estimate the expected value of a single continuous value and output it. I have several thousand training examples where I have both the full input and the actual output. I suspect there is some sort of machine learning algorithm that will produce a function mapping the input to the output, but I'm unsure enough of the terminology involved that I'm not sure how best to seek these resources. What I am looking for reminds me of classic IR classifiers such as the naive Bayesian classifier, but classifiers give you the probability of a sample belonging to a discrete class, not an expected continuous variable. Is this a form of regression? If so, what type? Does anybody have any insight? Any webpages to help fill in the gaps in my knowledge? Or even any helpful search terms? Also, if this is an inappropriate question for stats.stackexchange.com, is there a more appropriate community based QA site you could direct me to? Thanks.
