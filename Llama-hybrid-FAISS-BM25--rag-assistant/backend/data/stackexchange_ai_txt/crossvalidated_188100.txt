@gung is correct here. I believe you want to find differences in the 200 demographic variables between the g group and the not-g group. I would use a logistic regression model. Your response would be 0 for "not-g" and 1 for "g". To figure out which of the 200 demographic variables are different between the g and not-g, you could do variable selection with LASSO without having to adjust your alpha value or testing every demographic variable individually. Here is a good thread about LASSO with logistic regression. Another option is to use a random forest to find the "importance" of your variables in differentiating between your two groups: g and not-g. Your responses would still be 0 and 1. The random forest will give you an "importance value" which describes how useful that variable is in differentiating your groups. Here is the randomForest package.
