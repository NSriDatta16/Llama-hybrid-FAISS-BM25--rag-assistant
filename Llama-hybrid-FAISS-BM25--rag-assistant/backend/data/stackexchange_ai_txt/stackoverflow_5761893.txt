Can someone explain function names in Objective-C?

Possible Duplicate: Method Syntax in Objective C So I totally get the more common functions like: -(void)viewDidUnload{ self.controllers = nil; [super viewDidUnload]; } However coming from a different programming background, I sometimes struggle with something like: -(NSInteger) tableView: (UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section{ return [self.controllers count]; } So I know the function returns a NSInteger. However I do get a little confused in how to mentally organize the rest of the function name ETC. I need to be able to visualize some structure. Like in this case is the function name numberOfRowsInSection with the parameter called section? Help in this matter would be appreciated.
