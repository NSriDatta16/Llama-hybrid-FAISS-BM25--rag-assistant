Defining Likelihood function for a given time series

I have a set of observations ${y_1,...y_n}$ generated from a given time series $$y_t = \phi y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ where $\epsilon_t$ are independent and identically distributed generated from a Gaussian distribution $N(0, \sigma^2)$ and a prior for $\phi$ is given as also being normally distributed with parameters $N(0,\sigma^2_\phi)$ I am trying to calculate a conditional distribution for $\phi$ but am unable to define an appropriate likelihood for the given data. I am aware that the distribution for the likelihood is a normal distribution but I am unable to define its parameters. Any help greatly appreciated!
