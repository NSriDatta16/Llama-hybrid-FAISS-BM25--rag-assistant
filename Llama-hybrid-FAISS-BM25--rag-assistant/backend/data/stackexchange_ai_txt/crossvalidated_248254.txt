Chi square or logistic regression when variables lack independence?

I'm performing a psych study on a group of single people . My binary dependent variable is their relationship status one year in the future (still single/in a relationship). My variables include their gender (male/female) and whether they have a crush on someone (yes/no). My chi square tests show no significance for either variable individually, but when I subgroup (women with a crush, men without a crush, ...), I achieve significance. I applied logistic regression to my data, but it showed pretty much what my chi square tests showed -- no significance for the group as a whole, but significance when I subgroup. I believe that this is because my variables are not independent? Which is a requirement of logistic regression? My question: is there a test to demonstrate that my variables are not independent? Or maybe results showing no significance for my larger group demonstrates this? If so, should I just stick with chi square and state in my methods section that logistic regression was investigated but the variables were found to lack independence? I could really use some advice for next steps. EDIT: Finally occurred to me I had collected their relationship status at 3 and 12 months and was treating these as separate outcomes when I should OR the values to create a dependent variable that relates whether participants were in a relationship at either of these two points in time. Getting much better results.
