make a special email for example "recruit-system@domain.com" and send every mail from this account. after sending a recruiting mali via that account, make shure that you save the destination e-mail adress in your database connected with the according agent who sent that mail so that you can determine who sent that email afterwards. make shure this account is only being used by your app. then make a cronjob for a php script that connects via smtp to that account and let it check out if there is any mail that returned. If there is any email look from where that mail came and look it up in your database and send the notification to the according agent. that's how i would do it.
