Stationarity of $\ y_t = c_1 +c_2t +u_t$

How can I determine if $\ y_t = c_1 +c_2t +u_t$ is stationary? $\ c_1$ and $\ c_2 $ are known constants and $\ u_t $ is a white noise process with variance $\sigma^2 $. I do not understand the role of the t. Am I right to describe this as a trend stationary process? How can I show the mean of the moving average?
