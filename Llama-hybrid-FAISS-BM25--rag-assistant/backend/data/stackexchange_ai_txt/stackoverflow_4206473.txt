As camccann mentioned in the comment, Control.Monad.Instances defines only the Functor instance. Control.Monad.Applicative defines the Applicative instance. The transformers package, and thus also version 2 and above of the mtl package, define a wrapper function writer :: (a, w) -> Writer w a . But I have not found the Monad instance anywhere.
