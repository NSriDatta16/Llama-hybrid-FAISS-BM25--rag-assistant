I did a bit of googling today with the hint you provided head geek and i worked out how to do it. wxWidgets uses an activex rapper class called FrameSite that handles the invoke requests. What i did was make a new class that inherits from this, handles the DISPID_AMBIENT_USERAGENT event and passes all others on. Thus now i can return a different user agent. Thanks for the help.
