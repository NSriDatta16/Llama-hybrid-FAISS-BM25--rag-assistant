I've just noticed that it has actually included the following code: private bool balanceFieldSpecified; [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIgnoreAttribute()] public bool BalanceSpecified { get { return this.balanceFieldSpecified; } set { this.balanceFieldSpecified = value; } } Which provides the functionality I need. I'll leave the question open for a while in case there is an elegant way to make use of nullable? type instead.
