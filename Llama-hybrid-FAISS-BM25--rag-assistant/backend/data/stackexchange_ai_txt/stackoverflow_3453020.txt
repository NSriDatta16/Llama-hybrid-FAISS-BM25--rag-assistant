If you are referring to the Windows API call then read this . I would guess that you are trying to time a short interval so this paragraph is relevant. Are you timing something shorter than that interval? If so look into QueryPerformanceCounter instead perhaps. The resolution of the GetTickCount function is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in the range of 10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds. The resolution of the GetTickCount function is not affected by adjustments made by the GetSystemTimeAdjustment function.
