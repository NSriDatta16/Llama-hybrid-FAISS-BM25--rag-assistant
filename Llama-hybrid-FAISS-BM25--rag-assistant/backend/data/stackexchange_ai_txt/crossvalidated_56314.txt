In a table like this you can partition the G-statistic produced by a G-test, rather than calculating the ORs or by running a logistic regression. Although you have to decide how you're going to partition it. Here the G-statistic, which is similar to Pearson's X^2 and also follows a X^2 distribution, is: G = 2 * sum(OBS * ln(OBS/EXP)). You first calculate that for the overall table, in this case: G = 76.42, on 2 df, which is highly significant (p Then, because you have 2 df, you can perform two smaller 1 df (2x2) G-tests. After performing the first one, however, you have to collapse the rows of the two levels used in the first test, and then use those values to test them against the third level. Here, let's say you test B against C first. Obs Rec Ret Total B 17530 717 18247 C 42408 1618 44026 Exp Rec Ret Total B 17562.8 684.2 18247 C 42375.2 1650.8 44026 This produces a G-stat of 2.29 on 1 df, which is not significant (p = 0.1300). Then make a new table, combining rows B and C. Now test A against B+C. Obs Rec Ret Total A 16895 934 17829 B+C 59938 2335 62273 Exp Rec Ret Total A 17101.4 727.6 17829 B+C 59731.6 2541.4 62273 This produces a G-stat of 74.13, on 1 df, which is also highly significant (p You can check your work by adding the two smaller test statistics, which should equal the larger test statistic. It does: 2.29 + 74.13 = 76.42 The story here is that your B and C groups are not significantly different, but that group A has a higher return rate than B and C combined. Hope that helps! You could also have partitioned the G-stat differently by comparing A to B first, then C to A+B, or by comparing A to C, then B to A+C. Additionally, you can expand this to 4 or more groups, but after each test you have to collapse the two rows that you just tested, with a maximum number of tests equal to the df in your original table. There are other ways to partition with more complicated tables. Agresti's book, "Categorical Data Analysis", should have the details. Specifically, his chapter on inference for two-way contingency tables.
