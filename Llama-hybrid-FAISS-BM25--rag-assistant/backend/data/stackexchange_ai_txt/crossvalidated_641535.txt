How to incorporate p-value information for pairwise distances into clustering?

Consider I have a $n \times n$ distance matrix I want to use for hierarchical clustering, where the distance metric I use ranges from 0-1. I also have a second $n \times n$ matrix that gives me the p-value corresponding to each pairwise distance. The p-value is calculated based on permutation tests. Here, for each pairwise comparison, the two vectors are randomly filled with entries of the joint vectors, and the distance is calculated again. This is repeated 1000 times to get the null distribution of the pairwise distance. The goal of hierarchical clustering is to obtain a dendrogram that can be compared to existing dendrograms (e.g. cophenetic dissimilarity matrices, etc..), independent of this data or approach, and to test if identified clusters are the same. For this, I want my dendrogram to be as robust as possible, so including p-value info would potentially increase robustness in my hierarchical clustering. So when using the distance matrix for clustering, is there any (known) way to include the p-value information, e.g., as weights, or does it make sense to set all as non-significant entries (given a p-value threshold) to say a distance of 1, when constructing the dendrogram? How else can the information of pairwise distance significance be incorporated to build a more robust dendrogram? E.g., For using average linkage, can p-values or 1/pvalue used as weights somehow? P.S. (I only have the distance matrix and the p-value matrix, and I don't want to move to bootstrapped distance matrices based on the original data).
