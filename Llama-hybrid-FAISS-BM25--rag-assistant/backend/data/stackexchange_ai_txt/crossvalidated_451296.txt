Visualize Analysis of clustering after pca

I am using kmeans for clustering and if I read the topics around here and somewhere else it is always recommended to do a graphical check-up for the number of clusters. The problem is my orginal dataframe has 80 features. So I did a pca in python pca = PCA(n_components=2) X_pca = pca.fit_transform(data) Is it ok to use this as analysis now? The output looks like this (only two dimensions): Or do I miss something when I did the pca?
