Picking the Order of Images in a Component (Div) (Drag-and-Drop jQuery)

I have a problem. I have a div component where I'll drag multiple images. This part is working perfectly. But I am not able to read the order of these images played in the component. What happens, I can play any position in the image of the div component, however, like to read in order as they are, from left to right. I believe it is possible, but the solution must be complicated. Some of his friends could help me in the routine javascript to read this? Or know any technique that can help me. Thanks The Page Code: (all code) Untitled Document .draggable { width: 90px; height: 80px; padding: 5px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-size: .9em; } .ui-widget-header p, .ui-widget-content p { margin: 0; } .ui-widget-header-modified p { color:#99CC99; } #snaptarget { height: 300px; } var Cont = 0; addComponent = function(strImg){ if ($.trim(strImg) != '') { Cont = Cont + 1; $('#imgPrompt img').remove(); $('#imgPrompt').prepend(' '); $('#' + strImg + '_Img' + Cont).draggable({ snap: true }); } } Estrutura do Caminh√£o:
