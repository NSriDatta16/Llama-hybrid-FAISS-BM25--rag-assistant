A graph that helps understand DGP of a mixture of Gaussians (DAG, Kruschke's DBDA style graph, etc.)?

Hastie, et al in “Elements of Statistical Learning” describe a particular DGP(Data Generating Process) or causal model on page 13. The training data in each class (2 classes total) came from a mixture of 10 low variance Gaussian distributions, with individual means themselves distributed as Gaussian. A mixture of Gaussians is best described in terms of the generative model. One first generates a discrete variable which determines which of the component Gaussians to use, and then generates an observation from the chosen density. Having learned most of what I know about DAG’s from Pearl’s Primer book, which does not include a mixture as an example, I am just not sure what a DAG would look like in this case. John Kruschke, in his book "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" offers an attractive alternative to DAGs, which show a sketch of the distribution indexed by its parameters. See here and here . So if you prefer to do a DBDA style plot over the DAG, that works too.
