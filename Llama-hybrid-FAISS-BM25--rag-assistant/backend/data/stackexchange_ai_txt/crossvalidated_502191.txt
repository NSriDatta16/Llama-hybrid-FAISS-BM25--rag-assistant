It might be late but this is for those who encountered the same type of output. I got the snake-like embedding when I reduced the dimensionality of a time-series data with 400 features. Most of the features were correlated. Output was not ideal for clustering. The convention is to sample from the data (in my case %10 was enough), fit the sample to UMAP. Then transforming the rest of the data gives much more "nice-looking" results.
