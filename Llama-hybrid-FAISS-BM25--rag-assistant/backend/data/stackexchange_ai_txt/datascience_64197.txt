where to start in natural language processing for a language

My native language is a regional language and few people speak it. I have some assignements in a machine learning course and i was thinking about doing some natural languge processing on my native language but i don't know where to start since there is almost no research about this language ( no corpus , no research papers , ... ) and i'm new to machine learning. I want to start doing everything from bottom and i want to do things right , can you please guide me to steps i should follow? I also want to build my own corpus ,since it's a very tiring work , is there a way to build a single corpus that can be used on several NLP applications ( at least for translation and speach recognition) ?
