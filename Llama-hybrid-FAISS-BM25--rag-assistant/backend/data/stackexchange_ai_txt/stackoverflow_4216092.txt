I'm not sure why the book would say that; it is emphatically untrue that the default == calls Equals . Additionally, object does NOT overload == . The operator == by default performs a value-equality comparison for value types and a reference-equality comparison for reference types. Again, it is NOT overloaded for object (it is for string ). Therefore, when you compare object a = 1 and object b = 1 using the == operator you are doing a reference-equality comparison. As these are different instances of a boxed int, they will compare differently. For all that are confused by this issue, I encourage you to read ยง7.10 and especially ยง7.10.6 of the specification extremely carefully. For more on the subtleties of boxing (or why we need it in the first place), I refer you to a previous post on this subject.
