Thanks for answering. I did found your explanations and link suggestions interesting and encouraging. Anyway, I did not make myself clear with my question. What I did want to know was how to create any property, even without knowing it's name. I did read several docs and tutorials until I figured it out. Hope this can be of help. var data:XML = ; var $my_attr:String = 'id'; data.@[$my_attr] = 'foo';
