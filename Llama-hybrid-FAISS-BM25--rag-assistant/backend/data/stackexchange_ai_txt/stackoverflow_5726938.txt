Sort Tcl dict by value

I was wondering if there is an elegant way of sorting dict by value in Tcl. Suppose I have a following dict: set d1 [dict create k1 10 k2 89 k3 1 k4 15 k5 20] # Results in dict of form # k1 => 10 # k2 => 89 # k3 => 1 # k4 => 15 # k5 => 20 Now I want to sort this dictionary so that I have: # k3 => 1 # k1 => 10 # k4 => 15 # k5 => 20 # k2 => 89 I was hoping there is something similar to Python's sorted().
