I will borrow a paragraph from the book An introduction to survival analysis using Stata by M.Cleves, R.Gutierrez, W.Gould, Y.Marchenko edited by Stata press to answer to your question. It is common to read that interaction effects should be included in the model only when the corresponding main effects are also included, but there is nothing wrong with including interaction effects by themselves. [...] The goal of a researcher is to parametrize what is reasonably likely to be true for the data considering the problem at hand and not merely following a prescription.
