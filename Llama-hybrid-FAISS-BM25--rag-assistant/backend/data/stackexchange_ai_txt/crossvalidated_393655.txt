The eigenvalues that you get in Matlab with pca() are already in decreasing order, so you are guaranteed that the first n Principal Components will be the most important ones. You can see this yourself if you look at a vector latent which is a vector of eigenvalues. If then you would like to reduce your variable set to 20 variables, you can simply retain only 20 first PCs from the coeff matrix. What you do is you project your original data set $X$ (which is 800 $\times$ 67) on a reduced PC basis: Z = X * coeff(:,1:20) to get the PC scores matrix $Z$ which is the representation of your original data in a 20-dimensional space instead of 67-dimensional. The matrix $Z$ is size 800 $\times$ 20.
