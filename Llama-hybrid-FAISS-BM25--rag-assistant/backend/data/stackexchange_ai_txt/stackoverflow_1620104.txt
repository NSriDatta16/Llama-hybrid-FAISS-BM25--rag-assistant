Though I can't point out specifics, I'm pretty sure it's undefined behavior. The method a graphics card uses for shading fragments can vary (do different amounts at a time, etc), but in any practical case, it does more than one fragment at a time. This means you'll be both reading and writing to the same locations, causing race conditions. I don't think it's recommended.
