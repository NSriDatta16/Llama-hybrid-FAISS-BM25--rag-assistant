As far as a simple drag and drop goes, you could do something like you said with a palette and a dialog that changes color based on the drop. I would recommend the jQuery framework as it is very easy to use and has a great API . The steps for the test itself are pretty simple: Have a palette with the colors: [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] These can be table cells ( ) that you can click on and 'drag'. You could do tables and when you click on one of the tables, you use jQuery to get the background color. When you actually click on the , assign the color to a variable. You could create a semi-transparent that follows the mouse as you drag it. Set a mouseup listener on the target (the one that would change color) and have jQuery set the background of the to the color in the variable. Edit: There will be a slight problem with 'text selection' when you drag something. A fix can be found here: How to disable text selection highlighting using CSS?
