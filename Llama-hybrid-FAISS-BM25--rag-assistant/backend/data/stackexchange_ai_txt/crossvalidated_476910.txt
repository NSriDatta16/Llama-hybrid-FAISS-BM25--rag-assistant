Choose between 3 models with the same AUC mean score

I'm trying to classify if it will be rain tomorrow (1 for yes and 0 for no). I've done pre-processing and ran a k-fold CV to choose the model with highest mean AUC score. I received 3 models with same score (0.87) and I'm trying to decide which one of them to use. The models are : Random Forests, ANN and Logistic Regression. How can I decide which model is the best for me?
