Colormapping is nonlinear filtering . A color map is simply a transform; the breakup into three dimensions further interprets it as filtering and decomposition. turbo is preferable to jet for inspection ( 1 -- 2 -- 3) - which is to say, it's not arbitrary, and the human visual system favors it. In turbo (or jet ), as one use case, we can quickly skim an image for peaks, which will be red, and we may wish to focus only on those - that's identical to the "R" channel. "Image" involves efficient (and nonlinear) compression . The standard approach to STFT compression is direct subsampling ( i.e. hop_size ), which aliases. An improvement is decimation, i.e. lowpass filtering + subsampling, which is a linear compression. If something so simple was effective, there'd be no need for all the sophistication of JPEG . In ML terms, we can view "save as JPEG" as a highly effective autoencoder, also effective dimensionality reduction. There's more to say but I'll just share the main points for now. Note that this is completely separate from using image-excelling NNs on STFT images. That can be detrimental . Also, @Ghostpunk's answer is mistaken and misleading, as I commented. It may be owed to the popular "windowed Fourier transform" interpretation of STFT. Spectrogram losses can also be measured. Relevant posts: Equivalence between "windowed Fourier transform" and STFT as convolutions/filtering Role of window length and overlap in uncertainty principle? Note I realized the question, and my answer, are ill-suited for this network, and I may not be developing my answer further here. If I develop is elsewhere, I'll link it. In the meantime, refer to my discussion with @SextusEmpiricus . Still self-accepting since, though elaboration is due, my answer can be understood with the right (mainly signal processing + feature engineering) background, and I believe it contains the most pertinent explanation.
