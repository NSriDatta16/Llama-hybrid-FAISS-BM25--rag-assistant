This related to my other question . I have this table CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE hits (ip bigint, page VARCHAR(256), agent VARCHAR(1000), date datetime) and I want to calculate average time between googlebot visit for every page. ... WHERE agent like '%Googlebot%' group by page order by date Something like select datediff('2010-09-18 04:20:47', '2010-09-16 05:23:04') but for every date in table If there is no mysql way, how can I do this in php?
