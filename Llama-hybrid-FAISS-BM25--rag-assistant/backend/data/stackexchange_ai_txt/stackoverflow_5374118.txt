You can create an AdHoc version of your app. You just need to code sign with your distribution profile. Also you need to add a entitlements.plist which contains item called "get-task-allow" with type as Boolean and value as NO. Now you simply need to add this Entitlements.plist to your code signing entitlements and then you need to just "Clean" and "Build and Archive". The archive would be formed in Oragnizer. Then you need to share it as save it to disk as . .ipa Now this .ipa file along with your .mobileprovsion file is to be sent to your client. NOTE: You need to add the client's Device ID to your distribution profile. Only then the Client's device would be allowed to install this app on it and test it. Hope this helps you. If you have any doubts on this then you may just leave a comment here. :-)
