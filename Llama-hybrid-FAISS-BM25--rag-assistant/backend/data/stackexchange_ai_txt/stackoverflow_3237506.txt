What I like to do is: Generate a unique, random ID in the registration process Store the ID along with the E-Mail address, a "confirmed" field (default: "no") and any additional data in a database table Send out the E-Mail with an URL pointing to activate the unique ID (e.g. domain.com/activate.php?id=102939505595 The activation page checks whether the unique key exists and changes the confirmed field to yes (or 1 or whatever). Additionally and optionally, save the confirmation date/time, IP address and user agent.
