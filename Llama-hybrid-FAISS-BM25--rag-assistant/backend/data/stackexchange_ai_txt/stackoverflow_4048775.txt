Whatever data your View needs, put it in the ViewModel. The way i see it, once your view is going through the rendering process, it should have all the info it needs from the Model it is bound to. If you start to use helper methods, then the View is "going back to the controller" in a sense. Extension/helper methods are fine for formatting, etc, but they should not call through the model . Don't forget, you also have ViewData (basically HttpContext.Current.Items, lives for single request), which is a lightweight storage mechanism that can be used to share data across partial views (for example).
