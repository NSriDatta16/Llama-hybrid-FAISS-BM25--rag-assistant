I know that it's not Windows Search, but I have long used Agent Ransack for this: it is very quick and searches through all the various java archive formats (jar, war, ear) as well as zip. A feature that I particularly like and use a lot is saving a search: you can save the criteria (so that you can repeat that search easily) or the results.. So when I am working on a project, I will often want to search through the project directory tree for a file (or a file within a jar/zip). I perform the search once and save the criteria as a .srf file, which I can open quickly to perform similar searches afterwards.
