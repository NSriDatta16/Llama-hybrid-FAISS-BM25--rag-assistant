logout feature in code igniter

I started using codeigniter for my project. I have user authentication system for my website. I have seen the videos from nettuts for the login information. I am confused why the logout is not working properly. I have the following logout function in my login controller. function logout() { $this->session->sess_destroy(); redirect('main'); } If I click on the logout button I am redirecting the user to the main page. But after redirecting the user to the main page, if click on the back button on the browser I will see the logoff and my name on the top of the page. I need some help on where I am going wrong or is there any important piece of code I am missing in my controller Thanks in advance EDIT I think I found the solution. I should append the following code into the appropriate controller $this->output->set_header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, no-transform, max-age=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); $this->output->set_header("Pragma: no-cache");
