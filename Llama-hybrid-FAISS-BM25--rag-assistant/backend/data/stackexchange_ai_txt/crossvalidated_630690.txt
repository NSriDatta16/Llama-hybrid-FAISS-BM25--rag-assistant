clustering approaches: binary data

I am investigating clinical outcomes following an injury. I have 8 different outcomes, all binary, and there is correlation between them with different subjects have combinations of different outcomes. I have done a PCA of the variables, with loading plot showing grouping of different outcome variables. I was wanting to examine with a clustering-type approach to assess if there are clusters of patients with certain combination of outcomes. I can then investigate what the biological signatures of these clusters are. I was wondering what clustering approach people on the forum would take. It is 8 binary variables with no continuous variables. All 8 are different outcomes. I mainly work on R. Many thanks
