How to override default drag&drop cursors when the darg source is outside my application

In Drag&Drop , if I want to customize the cursors, I can subscribe to GiveFeedback on the drag source and set e.UseDefaultCursors = false , and the render the content I want. But that only work if the drag source is my application. If I want to do the same when dragging files from explorer, for example, I can not subscribe to that event because I only have access to the drop target and not to the drag source. Is there any other way to disable the built in cursors and copy and link signs so I can render my own in that case?
