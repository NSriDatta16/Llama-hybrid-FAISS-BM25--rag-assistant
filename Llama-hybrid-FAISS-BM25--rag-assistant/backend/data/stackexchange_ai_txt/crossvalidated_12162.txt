I believe that Weak convergence and optimal scaling of random walk Metropolis algorithms by Roberts, Gelman and Gilks is the source for the 0.234 optimal acceptance rate. What the paper shows is that, under certain assumptions, you can scale the random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as the dimension of the space goes to infinity to get a limiting diffusion for each coordinate. In the limit, the diffusion can be seen as "most efficient" if the acceptance rate takes the value 0.234. Intuitively, it is a tradeoff between making to many small accepted steps and making to many large proposals that get rejected. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is not really an optimization algorithm, in contrast to simulated annealing. It is an algorithm that is supposed to simulate from the target distribution, hence the acceptance probability should not be driven towards 0.
