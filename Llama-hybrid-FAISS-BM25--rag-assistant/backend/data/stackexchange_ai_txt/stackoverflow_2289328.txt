Is it necessary to have a Primary key which is sequence generated even though I may not use it for DB operations

Hi I had parent table which has ID and some other columns and a child table which have many values based on this ID(foreign Key). I wanted to create the table with a Primary Key which is sequence and this Parent table ID as Foreign Key but later I found I had one more Foreign Key EMPID which on combination provides uniqueness. Even for retrieval and batch update i can simply use the combination of these two FKs. So do I still need to use the sequence generator keeping in mind DB performance or just drop the Primary Column.
