This should be the right way: $elem.attr("readonly","readonly"); This way, you create valid XHTML as every attribute has to have a value and element and attribute names have to be lower case . For most boolean attributes that means that the value is the same as the name. See also here : This is a boolean attribute, so it has no contents. In valid XHTML write readonly="readonly" And also this remark : Some HTML user agents are unable to interpret boolean attributes when these appear in their full (non-minimized) form, as required by XML 1.0. Note this problem doesn't affect user agents compliant with HTML 4. The following attributes are involved: compact, nowrap, ismap, declare, noshade, checked, disabled, readonly, multiple, selected, noresize, defer. Or you change the document type ;)
