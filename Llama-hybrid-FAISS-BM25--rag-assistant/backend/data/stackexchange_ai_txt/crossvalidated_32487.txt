This is a Likert type scale and involves ordinal numbers and since intervals are not defined nor are ratios there is really not a meaningful concept for it. However when scores are averaged there are models such as the Rasch model which allow these averages to be viewed as interval data. I really know nothing about these models but Peter Flom and others at this site have discussed these ideas here yesterday and prior to that. Gung and Peter Flom provide some information on this at this question. Is 0 a valid value in a Likert scale? If we accept that the average score is interval then the standard formula for the standard error of the mean could be applied to give you an estimate of the standard deviation for the mean. I still would not think an standard deviation for the sample responses makes sense but you could calculate something that looks like a standard deviation by multiplying the standard error of the mean by square root of n where n is the number of independent responders.
