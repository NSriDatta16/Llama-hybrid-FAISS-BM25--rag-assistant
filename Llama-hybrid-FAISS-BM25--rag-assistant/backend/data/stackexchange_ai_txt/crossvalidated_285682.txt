Does prior distribution affect classification results SVM?

I trained an SVM (RBF kernel, optimized C and G) on a dataset with a balanced class distribution (i.e., 50% positive, 50% negative class samples). Testing the model on a corpus with an unbalanced class distribution (i.e., 1% positive) shows significant overgeneration of the model, as about half of the test instances received a positive class label. Does this mean that the model takes prior distribution information into account? Can someone help to explain?
