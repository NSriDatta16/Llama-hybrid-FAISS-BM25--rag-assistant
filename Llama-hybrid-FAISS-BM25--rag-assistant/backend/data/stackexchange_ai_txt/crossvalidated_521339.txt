How does statsmodels calculate in-sample predictions in AR models?

I am very new to time series modeling and statsmodels and trying to understand the AR model in statsmodels. Suppose I have a data record y of 1000 samples, and I fit an AR (1) model on y . Then I generate the in-sample prediction from this model as y_pred . I do this as from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model import AutoReg model = AutoReg(y,1).fit() y_pred = model.predict() I get the parameters of the model using model.params . I would like to know, after estimating the model parameters, how does statsmodels calculate the in-sample predictions? For ex. how is y_pred[10] calculated? I am sorry if the question is too basic, thanks for the help.
