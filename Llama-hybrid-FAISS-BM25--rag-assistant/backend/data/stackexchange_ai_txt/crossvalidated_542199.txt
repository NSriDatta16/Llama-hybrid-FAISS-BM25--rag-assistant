I think you are confused about what cross validation is and why you use it. Quite simply, cross validation in this context is just repeated use of the learning and validation sets you describe above. Instead of splitting your data once into learning and validation you do it multiple times and take the average of your results to decrease the variance associated with randomly splitting your data. So cross validation isn’t any different than the process you describe above and saying “does not avoid the appearance of over fitting” is incorrect
