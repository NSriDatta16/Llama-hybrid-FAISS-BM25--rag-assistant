What's the meaning of f1-score in binary classification with equal number of pos e neg test samples?

I am using a CNN for movie reviews classification using the IMDB Dataset. They provide 25000 Train Samples, half positive and half negative and 25000 Test Samples, half positive and half negative. After the training, I evaluated the CNN on the test set using keras evaluate function. The output is: score: 0.339593573859 accuracy: 0.885 I'd like to have more accuracy but I can work on it. What is really worrying me is the f1 score. Isn't it too low? I have checked its meaning, but for me in a half divided test sample is pretty useless. Am I wrong?
