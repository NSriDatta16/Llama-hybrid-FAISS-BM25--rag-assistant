Visual Studio 2008 References too long?

I have recently re-organised our source control and found one of our solutions no longer builds. The only error that we get is: Error 65 Unknown build error, 'The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.' I went through each reference in visual studio and the longest complete path (path AND filename) of each reference was 161 characters. My solution folder structure is thus: C:\projects_svn\ABC\branches\01.02.03\ABC\ABC SUITE\ABC.DEF.GHIJKLM.NOP\ Any help would be greatly appreciated, I do not feel this folder structure is too long, given the project size, and organises things much better. Here are some technical details which may help (if you need more let me know): Visual Studio 2008 SP 2 running on Windows XP or Windows 7. Using Subversion as SCM. Coding in C#/WPF. Thanks
