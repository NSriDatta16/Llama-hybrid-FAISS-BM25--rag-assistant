Anything you can do in interface builder, you can do equally well in code. If you like dragging lines around and building programs like legos, then interface builder is great. If you like text better, then do it in code. When I write code, I tend to have a Terminal open as well. For example, I use command line subverison even though it is build into xcode. I would not say one way or the other is better, it is just a matter of how you work and how you think. I almost never use interface builder, but that is personal choice. There are a few things you can only do in code, but those things are fairly rare and can easily be used in conjunction with interface builder. There are also some things that are better in interface builder. It rarely comes up for me, but any time you have the equivalent of an html form with several different controls I think interface builder is the better choice. I end up with lots of table, web and text views in my programs but not many forms to fill out.
