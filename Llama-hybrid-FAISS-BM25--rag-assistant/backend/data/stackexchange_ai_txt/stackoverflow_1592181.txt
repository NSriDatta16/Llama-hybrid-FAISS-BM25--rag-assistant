Ah, I see; I should have actually tried out your example. The OpenType name of the font isn't Linux Libertine , it's Linux Libertine O . Alternatively, you can use the PostScript name: \setmainfont{LinLibertineO} Still, this font doesn't have all those four characters either. You might have a hard time finding one that does.
