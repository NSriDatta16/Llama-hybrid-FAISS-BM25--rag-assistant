As you've seen, another thing it does is confuse new (or new to the language) developers. C folks especially like getting things down into a single line. It feels elegant. There are certain idioms or turns of phrase in both C and C++ that we just recognize without hesitation. When you come across one of these, there's nothing wrong with writing out (on paper or in a scratch file) the long version of it (like in @polygenelubricants answer) so that you then have a chance to work out the big-picture meaning of it (like in @Mark Byers answer). But leave it the short way once you understand it.
