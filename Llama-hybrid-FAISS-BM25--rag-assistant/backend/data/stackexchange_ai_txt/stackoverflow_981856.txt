Does Internet Explorer remove the element from DOM?

I have markup in my page that includes the tag: Some Markup The idea is for browsers to display the content of the by default, but if a special JS library is present, it will find all the elements and transform the ones it cares about (based on @codetype ). This works in Firefox and WebKit, but fails in IE, because that browser seems to strip off the outer element, and just leaves the inner . That is, under Explorer, the DOM I get from the above markup looks like this: Some Markup Is this a documented behavior? Is there any way to make IE preserve the element in the DOM untouched? (I am currently testing this with IE7.) Note : This isn't for embedding Flash, or similar multimedia.
