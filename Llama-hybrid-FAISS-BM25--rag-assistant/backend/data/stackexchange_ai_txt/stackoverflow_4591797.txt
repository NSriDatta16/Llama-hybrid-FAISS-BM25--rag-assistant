You can leverage Conditional Formatting as follows. In cell H8 select Format > Conditional Formatting... In Condition1 , select Formula Is in first drop down menu In the next textbox type =I8="Elementary" Select Format... and select the color you want etc. Select Add>> and repeat steps 1 to 4 Note that you can only have (in excel 2003) three separate conditions so you will only be able to have different formatting for three items in the drop down menu. If the idea is to make them visually distinct then (maybe) having no color for one of the selections is not a problem? If the cell is never blank, you can use format (not conditional) to get 4 distinct visuals.
