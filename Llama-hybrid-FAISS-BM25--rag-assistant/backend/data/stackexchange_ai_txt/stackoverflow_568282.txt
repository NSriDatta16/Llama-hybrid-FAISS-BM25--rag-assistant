Assigning Datasource to a region

I was wondering if there is an existing control that I could use to achieve what I am trying. Basically, I have a html table that I display my header information. It looks something like this: Job ID 10 Client Tom Comments Comments are here I am wondering if there is an existing control that I can use as a container. Then I can assign the datasource to that control and leverage the field values as such. Job ID Client Comments private void BindHeader() { SomeObjectType data = DAL.SomeMethod(); someid.Datasource = data; someid.DataBind(); } Is there anything out there to do this? I want to be able to control the layout of the fields within the container. Thanks.
