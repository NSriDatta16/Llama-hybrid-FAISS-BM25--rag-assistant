How you branch is one of the most important decisions you can make with respect to source code configuration management. It needs to match your organization, your processes, and your teams. What you decide early will be, to a great degree, what you wind up using forever, so don't take the decision lightly. My personal recommendation (only because it works for us) is to use the MAIN and DEV branch approach. This provides the ability to perform a level of quality assurance (e.g. trial builds) prior to merging to the MAIN branch. The DEV branch becomes your primary integration branch, so forward integration isn't as much of a burden (since everyone is working off of the DEV branch). Just to give you some reference, we literally spent between 3 and 6 months discussing our branching strategy, running it through use cases and trying to poke holes in it, before we decided which one to use.
