"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Flat is simpler than nested. If you're dealing with data with relevant nesting, then flattening it probably violates the "but not simpler" part. I took the Zen of Python instead to be encouraging you not to complicate your life with nesting you don't really need, like an XML config file where a simpler flat format might suffice.
