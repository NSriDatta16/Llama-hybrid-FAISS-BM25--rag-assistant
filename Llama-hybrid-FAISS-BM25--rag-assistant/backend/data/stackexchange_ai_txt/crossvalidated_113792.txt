How could a Bayesian estimation proceed without additional information, is there any sensible prior for $n$? Your question is almost exactly the same question that Adrian Raftery answers in his paper " Inference for the Binomial $N$ parameter ." Instead of aquariums, the author was looking at counts of animals in a wildlife preserve. He assesses this question from several different directions, comparing Bayesian estimates to some classical but ad hoc estimators. Is there a good choice of prior? How to select priors is a question that is far too broad for this forum, is somewhat subjective, and entirely depends on what kind of problem you're trying to solve, and what an acceptable prior means to you, for your problem. No one else can do your analysis for you. For example, one might characterize priors as noninformative, weakly informative and strongly informative. Within each of these taxonomies, reasonable people may disagree about which specific prior fits in each category. And you might disagree about which of those three paradigms are most appropriate. The more elaborate models sound like reasonable elaborations of the basic problem. Clearly, constraining the range of values to lie in some interval will dramatically change your inferences. Likewise will attempting to model deaths, especially if different species have different lifetimes and if there are inter-dependencies between different species. There is something to be said for parsimony: estimating a model of baroque complexity from a single vector places an enormous demand on both your prior and your data collection. One must wonder how sensitive your results would be to small changes in the values of observed data.
