Random permutation test for feature selection

I am confused about permutation analysis for feature selection in a logistic regression context. Could you provide a clear explanation of the random permutation test and how does it applies to feature selection? Possibly with exact algorithm and examples. Finally, How does it compare to other shrinkage methods like Lasso or LAR?
