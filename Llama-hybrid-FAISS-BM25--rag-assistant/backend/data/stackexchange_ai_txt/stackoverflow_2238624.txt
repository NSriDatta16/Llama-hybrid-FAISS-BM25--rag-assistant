I don't use TeamCity, but Bamboo. The way I do this is for the maven goals, I have this defined: -Dmaven.repo.local=${bamboo.M2REPOHOME}/${bamboo.buildKey} ... Then the property M2REPOHOME is defined to be someplace on the filesystem, and bamboo.buildKey is the project name. I keep my m2 repositories all in one spot so I can easily nuke them. You should probably do something similar by setting maven.repo.local to the value of agent.work.dir , or someplace else. Quickly looking at the TeamCity docs, it looks like you would do something like this: -Dmaven.repo.local=%agent.work.dir%/m2
