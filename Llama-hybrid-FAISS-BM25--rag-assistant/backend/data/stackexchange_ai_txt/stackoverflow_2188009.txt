I wonder if it's related to the onclick -- am I correct to assume that every now and then clicking any link does not follow it? To me, this seems related to the way you touch the screen (or how this is interpreted), like maybe by clicking next to the link and dragging a bit, rather than clicking on the link? (If my assumption is correct, then this might be faulty hardware: maybe you can try on another device? Or maybe it only happens on a particular side of the link if the screen is not aligned well, and then there might be some software offset one can change?)
