Is conditional GAN supervised learning?

I am trying to understand this paper about conditional GAN, it says that extra information y (class labels) is given to the network. However, I cannot understand its usage during training or its benefits. As far as I know, GAN is unsupervised learning, in this case of extra information usage, can we say that the architecture is supervised?
