get the content of matched element

i have a string $str = "this is [start] my string [end] at this moment"; i need to get the content within [start] and [end] . when i use $result = preg_match('/\[start\].+\[end\]/',$str, $m); it mutches [start] my string [end] , but i need to get only my string (without spaces). sure i can make another preg_replace and delete them, but i think there must be more elegant solution. Thanks
