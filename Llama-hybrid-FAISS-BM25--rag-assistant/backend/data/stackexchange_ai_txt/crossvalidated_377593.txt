Reinforce Algo - Theta parametrized by a deep NN

I'm following a course on Reinforcement learning on EDX called "Reinforcement Learning explained - DAT257x" . I m learning about policy gradient method and in particular about REINFORCE algo. At a certain point author want to consider a gradient where theta is parametrized by a deep NN. The problem happens when applying backpropagation in a NN: we are not in a context of supervised learning and we don't know the correct labels. So the author claims that we are going to use some pseudo - labels. But how actually we can build pseudo - labels? For example: We take a certain action ( go North) what my label will be? How can i invent a labels when i'm not aware which action is good and which is not? Thanks
