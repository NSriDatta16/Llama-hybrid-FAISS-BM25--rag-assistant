This may require P/Invoke. Way to know if two partitions are in one physical hard disk without WMI? From above link: The Win32 function you'll need is called DeviceIoControl(). The API documentation can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363216(VS.85).aspx . Call DeviceIoControl() with the control code IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER and you'll get the physical disk drive for the given partition device handle. The device handle for the partition can be retrieved using CreateFile() API.
