Is this a LINQ lazy loading problem?

Something very strange is happening in my program: I make this query agt.DefaultNr == 1 on a collection and get 3 items as Result: IEnumerable favAgents = from agt in builtAgents where agt.DefaultNr == 1 select agt; For every item I set the DefaultNr = 0 foreach (Agent noFavAgt in favAgents) { noFavAgt.DefaultNr = 0; } I do another query but for some reason my favAgents collection is empty now! IEnumerable smallAgents = (from agt in favAgents where agt.tempResultCount What is going on here? Is this a LINQ lazy loading problem? Looks like there will be some kind of re-query after I set all items = 0 because I my collection is empty!
