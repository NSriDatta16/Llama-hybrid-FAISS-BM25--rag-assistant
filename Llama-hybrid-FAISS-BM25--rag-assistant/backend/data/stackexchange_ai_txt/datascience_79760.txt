Semantic networks and conceptual graphs

I would like to use semantic networks to understand changes in texts. For example when I add/remove some words within a text. I would like to eat pizza tomorrow evening. I ate pizza yesterday. Or just adding a not before a verb, which changes the text meaning: I would prefer to not eat pizza tomorrow evening. I didnâ€™t eat pizza yesterday. I have read about the use of word2vec and neural networks to do this, but I would like if anyone has already tried to do something similar. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
