If you can't stand your terminal's blue color, you can probably change it. The different terminal emulators have different tools for this, but most use X resources. My own personal color choices for urxvt: URxvt.background: #000000 URxvt.foreground: gray75 URxvt.color3: DarkGoldenrod URxvt.color4: RoyalBlue URxvt.color11: LightGoldenrod URxvt.color12: LightSteelBlue URxvt.color7: gray75 URxvt.colorBD: #ffffff URxvt.colorUL: LightSlateGrey URxvt.colorIT: SteelBlue URxvt.cursorColor: grey90 URxvt.highlightColor: grey25 But of course, your own terminal emulator of choice may have a different class (URxvt) or application (urxvt, not used in my example) name, and the resource names may be different as well. urxvt will use color names (from the server's rgb.txt file -- use xcolorsel(1) to see them in a handy application) or numbers, but other terminals may not be this flexible. From my xterm(1) manpage, the colors and their numbers are: 0 black 1 red3 2 green3 3 yellow3 4 a customizable dark blue 5 magenta3 6 cyan3 7 gray90 8 gray30 9 red 10 green 11 yellow 12 a customizable light blue 13 magenta 14 cyan 15 white If your terminal does use X resources, save your desired resources to a file (by convention named ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources ) and use xrdb -merge to load your resources into the server. Then start your terminal again, and try it out. If your terminal uses some other mechanism to configure color choices (perhaps it has a Preferences menu item or something similar), it will probably still have different colors listed somewhere, and you'll need to change colors 4 and 12 to change the blue color. On the other hand, if you like the blue for everything except emacs, you can either try to get emacs to use a different color (no idea there, sorry), or you can run your terminal emulator with a different "class", so it will read different X resources. ( xterm(1) has a -class parameter for this.)
