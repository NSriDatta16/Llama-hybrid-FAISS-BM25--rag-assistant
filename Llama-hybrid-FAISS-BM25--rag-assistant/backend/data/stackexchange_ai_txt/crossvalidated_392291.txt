What problem is it when I want to map these documents to these 3 different labels?

I am completely new to machine learning, and that means I am new to the ML-related jargon too. I have a problem at hand where there about a 1000 documents (on an average 500 words each) which need to be mapped to 3 different classes. Each class is defined based on some real-life concept like Cancer, Drug, children. These concepts are backed by certain taxonomy/controlled vocabulary. For example, MeSH terms for Cancer/Neoplasm. What problem is it when I want to map these documents to these 3 different labels? Only when a document is mapped to all the labels, then a document is considered a positive match. Should I use pattern matching for it or Machine learning?
