You can run SVM and, if you wish, different feature selection mechanisms, quite easily with scikit-learn . Hint: Note that SVM is already regularized (margin is maximized = weight vector norm is minimized). So you can try first with vanilla linear SVM. Exactly because of its inherent regularization it is known to work well even when there are millions of features. In my experiences sometimes it works better like this than when performing feature selection in pre-processing.
