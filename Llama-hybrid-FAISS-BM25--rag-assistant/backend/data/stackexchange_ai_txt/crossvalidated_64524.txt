Can I use factors from principal component analysis in correlation and regression analysis

I used PCA to reduce outcome variables (cognitive function) from 5 to 2 factors. Now can I use these two factors as dependent variables (representing cognitive function) in Spearman correlation matrix and in multiple regression analysis instead of using the original cognitive results?
