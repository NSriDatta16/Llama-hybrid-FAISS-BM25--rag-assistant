To me it is readable and understandable. I'd simply extract the ugly part of the code to a separate method (following some basic principles from "Robert C.Martin: Clean Code") and add some javadoc (and apologies, if necessary) like that: //... try { Method method = MethodFinder.findMethodIn(clazz); catch (NoSuitableMethodException oops) { // handle exception } and later on in MethodFinder.java /** * Will find the most suitable method in the given class or throw an exception if * no such method exists (...) */ public static Method findMethodIn(Class clazz) throws NoSuitableMethodException { // all your effort to get a method is hidden here, // protected with unit tests and no need for anyone to read it // in order to understand the 'main' part of the algorithm. }
