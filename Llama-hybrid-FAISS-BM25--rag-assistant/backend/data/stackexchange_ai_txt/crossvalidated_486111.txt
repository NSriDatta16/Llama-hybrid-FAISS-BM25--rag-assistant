It seems to me that the answer is much simpler than what has been described so elegantly with others' answers. Overfitting increases when the sample size decreases. Overfitting is a function of the effective sample size. Overfitting is minimal for a given apparent sample size when Y is continuous, i.e., has highest information content. A binary Y with cell probabilities of 0.5 0.5 has lower information than a continuous variable and results in more overfitting because of the lower effective sample size. Y with probabilities 0.01 0.99 results in worse overfitting because of an even lower effective sample size. The effective sample size is proportional to min(a, b) where a and b are the two cell frequencies in the sample data. For continuous Y the effective and actual sample sizes are the same.
