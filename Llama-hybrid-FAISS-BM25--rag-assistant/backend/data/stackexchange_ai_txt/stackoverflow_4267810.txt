UNION has an implicit de-duplication function. This means that a side effect of using it is everything gets jumbled together as its sorted for that to happen. It also (usually, but not always) means that you get sorted output (see next paragraph). UNION ALL removes this, but, there's still the caveat that output from a query without an explicit order by has no guaranteed ordering. This has been covered by another answer, but I thought it worthwhile to point out why it matters.
