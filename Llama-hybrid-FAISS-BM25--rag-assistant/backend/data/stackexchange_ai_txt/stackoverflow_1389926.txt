And even more concerning is that the databases support different locking mechanisms, so you may be able to get some tables and indexes in there, but you might introduce some issues that are very difficult to debug/replicate when you expose it into the wild. You need as 3 experts to sort that lot out - one each of SQL Server, MySQL and Oracle. That or your database needs to run with a maximum of one user, with poor performance and very average database mechanisms. Sorry...
