How big will these XML files be?? FILESTREAM really starts to shine when the vast majority of your files are 1 MB+ or more in size. If your XML is most a few or a few hundred KB, just store it as XML. Also: if you store it as XML datatype, you can query it using XQuery - that's not possible in a FILESTREAM storage.
