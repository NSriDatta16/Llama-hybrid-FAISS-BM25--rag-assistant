It does not sound reasonable to me. I believe, that some application's configuration should be in jar file. Such things as ORM mappings, spring config, custom spring namespace XSD, other XSDs, etc.. should be in most cases in jar. It's important part of deployment artifact. The fact, that it's not class file, does not mean, that it should be taken out of jar just because it's theoretically can be modified without building a new jar. Can you imagine a modification of *.hbm.xml in production? for me it sounds very scary . I think some configuration, like spring xml, is meant in most cases to better organize your application and dependencies, but not to change them at runtime in production.
