Test for effects of two categorical variables on a binary response variable?

I am looking for a test similar to a 2-way ANOVA that would work on a binary response variable. My response variable is survival of plant seedlings (alive or dead). My explanatory variables are Treatment (3 treatment groups) and Site (3 sites). First, I would like to know whether Treatment, Site and their interaction have a significant effect on survival. Second, if either Treatment or Site is significant, I would like to test all pairs of treatment groups or sites to know which pairs of levels are significantly different, as I would normally do with an ANOVA. I have considered several options: Transform the response variable, for example through an arcsin transformation, and then perform an ANOVA. This does not work on my data because at one of the sites I measure 100% survival. Therefore there is 0 variability at this site and no transformation will change that. Logistic regression with Treatment and Site recoded as dummy variables. The results do not seem to give me a test of significance of Treatment, Site and interaction term - Instead, I get the relative importance of each treatment group and each site separately. Furthermore, it seems that I cannot test all the pairs of treatment groups or sites, I can only compare one "baseline" or "default" group to each of the two remaining groups. Chi-square test on each explanatory variable separately. This has the obvious drawback of not being able to test the interaction term. Also I suspect that I am omitting important information if I am comparing survival across the 3 treatment groups without taking into account that this survival data is grouped in 3 different sites. Does this bias the results? Can anyone recommend a different test or what the best approach would be in my case? UPDATE: Logistic regression can in fact give a test of significance of each independent variable. In R, I discovered I can use glm to contruct a model and then the anova function to extract p-values for each IV: mymodel
