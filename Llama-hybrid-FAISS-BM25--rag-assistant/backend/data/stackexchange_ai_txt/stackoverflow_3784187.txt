How to use string variables to create variables list for ddply?

Using R's builtin ToothGrowth example dataset, this works: ddply(ToothGrowth, .(supp,dose), function(df) mean(df$len)) But I would like to have the subsetting factors be variables, something like factor1 = 'supp' factor2 = 'dose' ddply(ToothGrowth, .(factor1,factor2), function(df) mean(df$len)) That doesn't work. How should this be done? I thought perhaps something like this: factorCombo = paste('.(',factor1,',',factor2,')', sep='') ddply(ToothGrowth, factorCombo, function(df) mean(df$len)) But it doesn't work either. I think I am close, but not sure the proper way to do it. I suppose the entire command could be put into a string, followed by an eval() call of the string, but hopefully is there a more elegant way?
