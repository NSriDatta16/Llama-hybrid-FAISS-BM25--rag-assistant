Several single-species GLMMs -> A multi-species GLMM (random effects syntax?)

I'm looking to describe annual relative abundance for several species over several years by analyzing point count data. I'm using a Poisson GLMM in glmmTMB for each species, it looks like this: m[[i]] As an aside: This has a linear trend for year, plus year random effects, which is conceptually similar to the Sauer & Link models from the Breeding Bird Survey (though they use a Poisson log-linear regression, and it's Bayesian). Instead of having a separate GLMM for each species, though, I'd like to have one single GLMM for all species (a multi-species model). I know I could do part of this by using year_numeric*species , but: what would be the syntax for the random effects? Thanks!
