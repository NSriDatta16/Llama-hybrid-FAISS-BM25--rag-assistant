Testing significance of correlation between time series

I would like to know if there are some methods (or better, some statistics or even better, some R functions) like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#Inference or in the R function cor.test() which can be used to test the hypothesis $H_0: \text{corr}(X_t,Y_t)=0$ for 2 time series $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$ and especially for stationary time series (I'm aware of the spurious correlations one can have with non-stationary series, hence I know that we often need to take differences). I already found many similar questions here but I feel like they only partially answer the question. Also, I feel quite lost between the approaches I know, like cointegration test, Granger causality test, pre-whitening and some papers I saw like this one or some other papers containing many complicated statistics like this one or this one and many others... Finally, I would like to see answers giving a kind of survey of (some of) the possibilities we have, the tools we should/must use (in which case and/or in which order) and if possible, please indicate some R functions which would be helpful (of course, I know ccf() function). I hope it's clear and I hope it's not too much demanding. Edit: After thinking, I can ask the following questions: 1. How to test the significance of Pearson correlation between 2 stationary time series? This has been answered below by @taylor. 2. I have also the same question for Kendall correlation and for distance correlation. If possible (and if it exists), could you provide some R functions which perform these tests? Last edit: Finally, I'll create a new question for this 2nd point, following the advice of @Juho Kokkala in his comment below.
