What information can be drawn from the area between the warping function and the diagonal path in DTW?

I'm using the R package dtw: Dynamic Time Warping Algorithms to study the similarity of two time series. This package provides also the possibility to estimate the area between the warping function and the diagonal (no-warping) path, in unit steps (function warpArea ). I found an interesting application of this quantity in the following paper Latency as a region contrast: Measuring ERP latency differences with Dynamic Time Warping : a positive distance, which results from the warping path being below the diagonal, indicates that the reference time series, used for alignment, precedes the query time series, while a negative indicates that the reference time series follows the query. What other information can be drawn from the area between the warping function and the diagonal path?
