You might want to have a look at Django ratings module. It's very nicely structured and provides a powerful ratings system. And not overly complicated at the same time (although if this is your first web-app it might look slightly intimidating). You won't have to deal with calculating averages etc. directly. Edit: To be a bit more helpful If you use django-ratings, your models.py would probably look something like this: class Beer(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=200) brewer = models.ForeignKey(Brewery) style = models.ForeignKey(Style) ..... criteria1 = RatingField(range=5) # possible rating values, 1-5 ... criteria5 = RatingField(range=5) No need for Beerrating model. Instead all the ratings information will be stored in Vote + Score models of django-ratings.
