Constructing a meaningful regression model

I'm developing a probit model to predict the partial effect of independent variables on the expected probability of my dependent variable being one (that is the event that a strong growth in GDP occurs). Does it make sense to regress the binary dependent variable on an average growth rate of an independent variable, $g_{t-k,t}$ , the average growth rate of import of computers from $t-k $ to $t$ ? But, in this case the change in the independent variable, $\Delta g_{t-k,t}$ is an acceleration. Does this make sense in your opinion?
