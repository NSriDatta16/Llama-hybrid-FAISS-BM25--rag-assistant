Model checking in bayesian stats considered "virtually illegal" in the 90's (Andrew Gelman's quote)

In this post , Andrew Gelman says: Bayesian inference can make strong claims, and, without the safety valve of model checking, many of these claims will be ridiculous. To put it another way, particular Bayesian inferences are often clearly wrong, and I want a mechanism for identifying and dealing with these problems. I certainly don’t want to return to the circa-1990 status quo in Bayesian statistics, in which it was considered virtually illegal to check your model’s fit to data . What is Andrew Gelman exactly referring to? What rationale would Bayesians give to consider model checking "illegal"? Isn't this view dogmatic and shortsighted, or are there scholars that still advocate it?
