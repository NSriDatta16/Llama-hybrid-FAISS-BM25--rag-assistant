I would go with identity columns in the customer and company tables, then in the phone number table do as you said and keep one null and the other populated. I do something similar to this and it works out fine as long as you validate data so that it doesn't go in with both values being null. For a more elegant solution you could have two columns: one that is an id, and another that is a type identifier. Say 1 for customers and 2 for companies, that way you don't have to worry about null data or a lot of extra columns.
