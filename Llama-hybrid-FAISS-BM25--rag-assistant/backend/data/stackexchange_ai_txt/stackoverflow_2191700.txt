prototype - Replace & with &

I am working with Magento which uses the prototype javascript library. Unfortunately some of the client's data (being fed from point of sale system in to Magento) has & in the html instead of &amp; . Can anyone help with a method to change all instances of & in the html to &amp; for validation purposes?
