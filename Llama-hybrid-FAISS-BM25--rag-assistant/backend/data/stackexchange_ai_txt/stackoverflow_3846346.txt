You need to pick the right storage engine for your application. myISAM -- read frequently / write infrequently. Ideal for data lookups in big tables. Does reasonably well with complex indexes and is quite good for batch reloads. MEMORY -- good for fast access to relatively small and simple tables. InnoDB -- good for transaction processing. Also good for a mixed read / write workload. NDB -- relatively less mature. Good for fault tolerance. The mySQL server is not inherently multiprocessor software. So adding cores isn't necessarily going to jack up performance. A good host for mySQL is a decent two-core system with plenty of RAM and the fastest disk IO channels and disks you can afford. Do NOT put your mySQL data files on a networked or shared file system, unless you don't care about query performance. If you're running on Linux issue these two commands (on the machine running the mySQL server) to see whether you're burning all your cpu, or burning all your disk IO: sar -u 1 10 sar -d 1 10 Your application sounds like a candidate for myISAM. It sounds like you have plenty of hardware. In that case you can build a master server and an automatically replicated slave server But you may be fine with just one server. This will be easier to maintain. Edit It's eight years latar and this answer is now basically obsolete.
