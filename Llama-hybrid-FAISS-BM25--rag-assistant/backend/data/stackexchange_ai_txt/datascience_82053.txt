Appropiate ways of treating Inf or NA ratio variables for xgboost or random forest

I have several variables ordered by date, and I would like to take the ratios of growth from one month to the next one. I understand that it is normal to loose the first value. But my question is, how should i replace the infinite values in ratios where the lag value was zero (by replacement of NA or because it was actually zero) For example: example % group_by(id) %>% mutate(var1_lag = (var1 - dplyr::lag(var1, 1))/dplyr::lag(var1, 1), var2_lag = (var2 - dplyr::lag(var2, 1))/dplyr::lag(var2, 1)) %>% ungroup() example_g What are good approaches for random forest, neural nets or xgboost? I would think that for tree based methods simply replacing Inf/-Inf by something like 99999/-99999 would suffice, but i'm not sure if i'm missing something, and if that would work for neural nets. Has anyone faced a problem like this? what did you do?
