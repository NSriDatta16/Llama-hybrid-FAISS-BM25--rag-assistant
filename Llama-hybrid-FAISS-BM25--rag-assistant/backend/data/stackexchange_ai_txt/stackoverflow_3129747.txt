Image pan and zoom with GWT

I have a fixed size image and I want to show a subset of the image. I want to allow the user to click and drag to move the visible area of the image. The Image class has a nice setUrlAndVisibleRect method which can handle the image area display. The problem I am having is getting the mouse click and drag to work. I registered Mouse Down/Up/Move handlers and it all looked very promising in Firefox. Then I tested it in IE8... The behaviour I see in IE8 as I click and drag: - MouseDown event when I click - browser then displays a "no entry" symbol cursor as I drag - finally when I release I get no mouse up event. What is the correct way to handle this in a cross browser fashion?
