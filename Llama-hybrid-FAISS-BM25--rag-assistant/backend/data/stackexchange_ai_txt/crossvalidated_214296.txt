Lag-free filter methods for time series

I'm currently working with accelerometer based raw data (100 hz). Now I want to low pass filter this timeseries of accelerations for further analyses. I tried different filters like the simple moving average (SMA) or the exponential moving average (EMA) filter. But both methods produce lag, which I want to avoid. Are there any lag-free filter methods available for my kind of data? I'm doing my analysis in R, so appropriate R packages are prefered.
