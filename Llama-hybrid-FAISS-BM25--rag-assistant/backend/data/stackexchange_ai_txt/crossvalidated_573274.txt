Sum of PCA principal components

Short I wonder is it possible to sum the principal components together to obtain a score? For example, PC1 + PC2. Details I got the below dataframe: admin_username sales sign book team_sales team_sign team_book sub turnover ada 400000 9 0 670000 31 2 12 0 billy 85000 6 1 168000 16 2 7 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... --- ... ... In order to compare the users' performance, I performed the PCA. I set the n_components=0.8 that said I wanted the PCs can cover at least 80% variance. Moreover, the values are normalized by StandardScaler , I will state the normalized values as norm(value) .Below is the result: explained_variance_ratio_ : [0.47 0.2 0.14] components_ : [[ 4.72509076e-01 2.54901887e-01 4.91158593e-01 1.07551283e-01 -0.00000000e+00 5.10704453e-01 4.38406087e-01 7.70533828e-02] [-2.14573422e-01 -2.39650814e-01 -4.01742075e-02 -6.93156538e-01 -2.77555756e-17 2.05160081e-01 2.48732242e-01 5.57213957e-01] [-5.75108585e-02 7.18532379e-01 -2.11472525e-01 1.89615365e-01 -5.55111512e-17 -1.47130170e-01 -1.00609858e-01 6.06596633e-01]] Then the PC1 of ada is calculated by 0.472509076 * norm(sales) + 0.254901887 * norm(sign) + ... + 0.438406087 * norm(sub) + 0.0770533828 * norm(turnover) For PC2, it is similar to the calculation of PC1, just using different coefficients as stated by components[1] As a result, I will get both PC1 and PC2 these 2 values of ada . However, I would like to determine the users' performance by just one number rather than two. Would it be possible to simply add PC1 and PC2 together? or 0.47 * PC1 + 0.2 * PC2?
