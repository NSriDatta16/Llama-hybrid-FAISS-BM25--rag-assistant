HTTP POST contents in Haskell

I'm trying to post some data to a server in Haskell and the server side is coming up empty. I'm using the Network.HTTP library for the request. module Main (main) where import Network.URI (URI (..), parseURI, uriScheme, uriPath, uriQuery, uriFragment) import Network.HTTP import Network.TCP as TCP main = do conn u updateTest = Request { rqURI = updateURI :: URI , rqMethod = POST :: RequestMethod , rqHeaders = [ Header HdrContentType "text/plain; charset=utf-8" ] :: [Header] , rqBody = "Test string" } This test is returning the empty string as the response body from the server, when I think it should be echoing the "Test string" post. I would ideally like to replicate the functionality of: curl http://localhost/test.php -d 'Test string' -H 'Content-type:text/plain; charset=utf-8' and am validating results with serverside test.php: Am I doing this wrong or should I just be trying another library?
