"Under the ANOVA null, within group and between group sample variance are both estimates of the pop. variance" -- why only under the null?

In Statistical Methods by Snedecor and Cochran, it states something to the effect of "the within-group variance is an estimate of overall variance given the null hypothesis" and this point is used to justify that the ratio of between-group and within-group variances follows an F distribution under the null. But why is this true only under the null? At first I thought it was some kind of weighted average, but with the quadratic numerator I'm not so sure.
