Large primary key: 1+ billion rows MySQL + InnoDB?

I was wondering if InnoDB would be the best way to format the table? The table contains one field, primary key, and the table will get 816k rows a day (est.). This will get very large very quick! I'm working on a file storage way (would this be faster)? The table is going to store ID numbers of Twitter Ids that have already been processed? Also, any estimated memory usage on a SELECT min('id') statement? Any other ideas are greatly appreciated!
