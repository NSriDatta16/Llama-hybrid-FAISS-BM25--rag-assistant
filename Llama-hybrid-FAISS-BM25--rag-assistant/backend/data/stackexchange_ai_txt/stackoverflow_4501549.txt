Android: Use different drawables after choosing a different theme, keeping the same references

Is possible to make the app use different drawables after choosing a theme in Android? An explanatory example: i have a layout which background uses a reference to: "@drawable/backgroundsolid", that is image backgroundsolid.png in res/drawable-mdpi . I want that, if the user choose "Glass" theme, the reference stays to "@drawable/backgroundsolid" but the resources folder is changed to res/drawable-glass , which contains a different backgroundsolid.png image. Is it possible to set this programmatically? Thanks a lot!
