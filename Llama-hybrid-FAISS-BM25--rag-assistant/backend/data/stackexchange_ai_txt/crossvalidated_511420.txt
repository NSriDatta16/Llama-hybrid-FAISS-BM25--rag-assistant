'False Positive' detection in corona testing using ML techniques

I am working on the detection of false positive test result in COVID-19 testing. The false positive sample are mainly due to the contamination during the routine testing. Samples are handled in batch of 96 (plat) and this plate will go inside the PCR machine. There are a couple of possibilities that virus from one sample transmits to other samples. I have created a couple of features such as number of positive samples in row, column, how many samples are consecutively positive, the nearest distance to the positive samples for each sample. I want to deploy ML model to detect the false positive sample, since data is unlabeled, I am thinking following techniques Unsupervised Anomaly Detection to simply detect the contaminated ones First develop a clustering machine learning model using dataset features including both positive and negative samples. The contaminated samples (false positive) must cluster with the negatives samples Then a classifier model to predict positive or negative. If the classifier calls a sample negative, but it's labeled positive, then that's our tentative contaminated sample. Any other possibility to this problem?
