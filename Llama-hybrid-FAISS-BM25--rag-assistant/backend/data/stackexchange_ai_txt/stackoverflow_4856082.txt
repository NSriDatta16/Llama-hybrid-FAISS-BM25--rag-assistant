In reality unless you are concerned with the DTD implementation there are almost no differences between the various XHTML versions and there's almost never a valid reason not to use XHTML 1.1. In what way is your website dependent upon 1.0 transitional? If you can get your site valid with 1.0 strict then moving from that to 1.1 shouldn't cause problems because essentially the only difference is the modularized DTD, which really has no drawbacks to it. If you're still struggling with the philosophical problem of XHTML MIME I wouldn't worry because conceptually serving the wrong media type with the better organized 1.1 DTD is no more of a crime than with 1.0. The reason RDFa is implemented as it is is because adding the RDFa module to the XHTML 1.1 DTD only involves adding a few lines to the main module. Doing that to the 1.0 DTD would be harder and not as clean. Some other things to consider are that the XHTML 1.1 second edition spec includes an XML schema implementation. Also, the latest XHTML+RDFa 1.1 working draft finally drops the (stupid) requirement for specifying a doctype altogether, so you could use schema-only validation. This would work out really well if you can figure out a way to use XML/XHTML mimetypes because no doctype declaration is required in order to get standards mode rendering on browsers which support it (all of them but IE8 and below).
