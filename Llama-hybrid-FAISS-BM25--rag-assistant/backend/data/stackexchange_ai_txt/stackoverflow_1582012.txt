I use the MaxMind GeoIP City/ISP/Organization (Web Service), this cost $20 for 50,000 queries and is always updated (see http://www.maxmind.com/app/web_services#city ). I like the fact that I don't need to worry about database updates since it is all done on there server. I'm using PHP to send the client IP address and in return I get the latitude, longitude as well as other useful like the region code, city, metropolitan code, area code, country, ISP, and organization name if known.
