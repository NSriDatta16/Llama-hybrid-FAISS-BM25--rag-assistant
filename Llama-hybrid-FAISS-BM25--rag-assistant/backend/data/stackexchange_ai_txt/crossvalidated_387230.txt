Are your data integers? It looks like you might have count data. In that case, look into Poisson and negative-binomial regression. These techniques are generally used for count data. A skewed dependent variable is not necessarily a problem for tree-based models per seâ€”there are no assumptions in a decision tree that specify a conditional distribution of the errors, like in the generalized linear model. However, what is the goal of your analysis? If you are looking for some type of inferential statistic or readily interpretable parameter, a random forest will not give you those. In that case, stick with a regression model. I would suggest looking into the generalized linear model. In this, different link functions (kinda like transformations) are used to model data that cannot be negative, must be between 0 and 1, etc.
