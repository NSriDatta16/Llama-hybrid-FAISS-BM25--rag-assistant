jQuery - Make table rows selectable, draggable and droppable onto a box? (like SproutCore)

What I'm trying to do here is to mimic one part of the way SproutCore and Cappuccino work. You know how Mail.app works? You click on a message, it gets selected? You Shift+Click, everything in between gets selected? You Command+Click, it gets added to that selection? You drag over many, they all get selected? Then you can drag them all to another mailbox, a little red star with the number of rows selected shows up while dragging. That is what I'm trying to do. There are lots of records that will need to be sorted out in that way in this project, the only problem is, I have no idea of how I can make table rows selectable and draggable? jQuery-UI doesn't work with tables. Could you help?
