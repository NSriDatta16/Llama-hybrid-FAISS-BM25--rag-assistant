Well I had this code involving the run tags too (I didn't write it and I can't remember where it was taken from so I won't take any credit for it). Is it different from yours? int blockCount = 0; int lineCount = 0; foreach (Block b in myRTB.Blocks) { if (b is Paragraph) { p = new Paragraph(); p = b as Paragraph; foreach (Run run in p.Inlines) { lineCount++; } blockCount++; } }
