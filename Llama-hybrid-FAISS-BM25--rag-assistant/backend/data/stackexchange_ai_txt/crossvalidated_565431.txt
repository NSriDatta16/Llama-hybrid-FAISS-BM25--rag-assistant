Note: This Answer was for a quite different original version of the question. First, here is an example comparing two movies: For Movie X, 1000 subjects give an average rating of 7.0 and, for Movie Y, 1100 subjects give an average rating of 4.9. Summaries of individual scores for the two movies are given below: summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 3.000 6.000 7.000 7.049 8.000 10.000 summary(y) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.000 4.000 5.000 4.977 6.000 9.000 Boxplots of the scores (X bottom) show that about half of the scores for X were 6, 7 or 8 and about half of the scores for Y were 4, 5, or 6. The non-overlapping 'notches' in the sides of the boxes suggest that there is statistically significant difference in the popularity of the two movies. boxplot(x, y, horizontal=T, notch=T, col="skyblue2") For small samples, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test has difficulty giving definitive results, if there are many individuals with the same scores ("ties"), as is often true of movie ratings. However, for large samples, results are reliable. The P-value very near $0$ shows strong evidence of a statistically significant difference. (Results from R.) wilcox.test(x,y) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: x and y W = 902510, p-value However, if 900 ratings for Movie W are much more diverse than for Movie Y, it is more difficult to say which movie is better, even though both have similar median ratings (both around 5). summary(w) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 1.000 3.000 5.000 4.991 7.000 9.000 Boxplots (W on bottom) show overlapping notches. We can say the scores are more diverse for Movie W, but it is more complicated to try to claim one movie is more popular than the other. boxplot(w, y, horizontal=T, notch=T, col="skyblue2") A Wilcoxon test is looking for a difference in 'location' and finds no difference at the 5% level of significance. wilcox.test(y,w) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: y and w W = 494870, p-value = 0.992 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 If the people who really like Movie W express their opinions more loudly than the the the ones who hate it, Movie W might turn out to make more money than Movie Y. Note: Here is R code for sampling the fictitious scores for Movies W, X, and Y. set.seed(2011) x = rbinom(1000, 10, .7) y = rbinom(1100, 10, .5) w = sample(1:10, 900, rep=T)
