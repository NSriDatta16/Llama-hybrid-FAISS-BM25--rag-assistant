GridSearchCV Acting Weird

I am using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for SVM. However, the parameters chosen by GridSeasrchCV do not seem to be the best ones. I tried some parameters randomly and they are working much better. I tried both combinations in the test set. Here is the picture: The second confusion matrix + classification report is the random but improved one. Why isn't GridSearchCV selecting this combination?
