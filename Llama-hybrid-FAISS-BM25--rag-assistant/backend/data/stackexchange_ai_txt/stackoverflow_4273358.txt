By using System.setOut() and System.setErr() you can set standard output and error stream to any PrintStream, and capture everything. ADDITION: I don't know if there exist any elegant way to do this, but one way to do so is: 1. Save default output stream PrintStream defaultOut = System.out; (System.getOut() would be fun to have though) 2. Redirect System.out to the printstream you want (e.g. any file) 3. Instead of using System.out.println() use your print function, which does following: print(Object o){ defaultOut.println(o);//Assuming that defaultOut is visible in this function System.out.println(o); }
