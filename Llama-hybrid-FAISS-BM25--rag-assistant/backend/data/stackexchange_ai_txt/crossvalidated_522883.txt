Measuring statistical significance of monthly survey?

I have a survey where the same question is asked every month. The survey asks each respondent to give a 1--5 rating, which is then averaged and presented to me. I have the benchmark average (for the entire pool of respondents), and the average for my group that I care about. The benchmark average is constant month over month, but my group's average shows a decline. However, at the same time, the number of responses in my group has increased. For reference, here's the data: January February March My group's average 4.1 3.9 3.8 My group's # responses 16 20 21 Benchmark average 3.9 3.9 3.9 Benchmark # responses >1000 >1000 >1000 How do I determine whether my group's decline in average is statistically significant?
