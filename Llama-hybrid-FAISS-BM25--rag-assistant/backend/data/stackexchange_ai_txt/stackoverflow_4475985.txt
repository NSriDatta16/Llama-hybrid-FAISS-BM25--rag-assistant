Telerik MVC Extensions: Grid: During Ajax binding calls why is so much data posting back in the query string?

I am using Ajax binding with the Grid and ran into a problem where ASP.NET MVC was throwing a HttpRequestValidationException when I attempted an operation on the grid that invoked the Ajax call (like sorting). Using Fiddler I was able to determine my browser was attempting to post back my entire model in the query string and there were some characters that would have triggered ASP.NET's request validation. I was able to work around this by simply adding [ValidateInput(false)] to my controller action. I'm wondering why was the grid sending back so much data? And is this a symptom of a bug in my code or Telerik's? Here is what I saw in Fiddler (note the extremely long query string, even though the HTTP verb is "POST").
