"The problem is, I do not know how to account for this in a logistic regression model." Interesting idea. Can you provide more information here? Specifically, how you are coding your outcome variables. The logistic regression model can only predict what you operationalize as your dependent variable. So if you have a multinomial model, which is what I'm assuming you have, the outcome, whether 10 or 4 teams, can only be whatever you code it as.
