I dont have a definite answer for you, but the first thing I'd suggst is to put your AC_OUTPUT at the end of your configure.ac , after the LT_INIT . It's not completely this simple, but it's not far wrong to think of the contents of configure.ac as expanding in turn to fragments of shell script that are executed in turn. If you emit the configured Makefile before you've found libtool , then that could explain LIBTOOL being empty. A fairly conventional layout of your configure.ac would be the following: dnl Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script. AC_INIT(libcsv.c) AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(libcsv, 3.0.1) AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4]) dnl find programs AC_PROG_CC AC_PROG_CXX LT_INIT AC_PROG_RANLIB dnl check functionality AC_CHECK_FUNCS([strerror]) AC_FUNC_MALLOC AC_TYPE_SIZE_T AC_OUTPUT(Makefile) I don't think you needed LT_OUTPUT , and the docs note that AC_PROG_LIBTOOL is a deprecated synonym for LT_INIT (so having both is probably asking for trouble). (Apropos of nothing very much, note that OS X has a command called libtool , which is nothing to do with GNU Libtool. I'm pretty sure that's not your problem here, but it's a gotcha that's confused people before)
