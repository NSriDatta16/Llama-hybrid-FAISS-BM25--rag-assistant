Using XML for storage behind a standard object interface

Forenote: When I refer to 'interfaces' here, I mean the actual interface to an object, not interface classes, i.e. class Customer { public Name {get;set;} } includes a Name property in its interface. Is there a pattern for exposing XML element values as class interface properties, e.g. with the following XML: Hello there, blah blah. I would have a Notification interface with properties called Name and EmailAddress that would return RequestCreated and xxx@yyy.com respectively. It seems clumsy to use an XmlDocument instance and XPath for each interface property, so I'm hoping there is some sort of mapping mechanism I can use.
