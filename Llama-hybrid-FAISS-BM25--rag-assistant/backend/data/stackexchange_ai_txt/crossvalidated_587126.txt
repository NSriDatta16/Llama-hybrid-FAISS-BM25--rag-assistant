Choosing parameters for an artificial neural network with a likelihood ratio test

I am currently trying to choose which parameters to use in my artificial neural network. Because the end goal is a comparison between the logistic regression and the neural network and I have already used the likelihood ratio test for exluding variables on the same dataset for the logistic regression, I thought the results could justify the variable selection for the neural network as well. Especially because a comparison should be as similar as possible. Is my thought process correct, or am I missing out on something?
