Modelling the Conditional Variance in a Panel Setting

I am familiar with ARCH-type models to estimate the conditional volatility of some variable of interest in a univariate setting. I know that there also exists the concept of multivariate ARCH-type models. However, as far as I understand, such models are used to derive conditional covariance matrices (correct me if I am wrong, my knowledge is very sparse in this area). However, I am interested in modelling the conditional volatility of a variable in a panel setting (thousands of univariate time series). My approach thus far is as follows: I specify and estimate a conditional mean model for my panel: $y_{i,t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1x_{i,t-1} + e_{i,t}$ . Assuming that this model is true, I then use the squared residuals, $\epsilon_{i,t}^2$ , as a proxy for the variance and specify a conditional variance model: $\epsilon_{i,t}^2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \epsilon_{i,t-1}^2 + v_{i,t}$ , with $v_{i,t} = \epsilon_{i,t}^2-\sigma_{i,t}^2$ ( $\sigma_{i,t}^2$ being the true conditional variance). This corresponds to an AR(1) representation of an ARCH(1) model as far as I understand. Thereby, model 1 allows me to forecast the conditional mean of $y$ and model 2 allows me to forecast the conditional variance of $y$ . As suggested multiple times here, I realize that doing 1. and 2. in a single step is advantageous. However, the software packages I know that can do so only apply to a univariate time series setting. My question is: Is my approach, although very naive, reasonable? Are there any "standard" procedures of applying ARCH-type models in a panel setting?
