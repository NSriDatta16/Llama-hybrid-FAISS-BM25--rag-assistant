console.dir(object) object works fine in Firebug and JS inspectors derived from it. Beware that not all interpreters support console though, so the usual idiom is: if (typeof console !== 'undefined') { console.dir(object); } From http://getfirebug.com/logging : Object inspection How many times have you hand-written code to dump all of the properties of an object, or all of the elements in an HTML fragment? With Firebug, you'll never write that code again. Calling console.dir(object) will log an interactive listing of an object's properties, like a miniature version of the DOM tab. Calling console.dirxml(element) on any HTML or XML element will print a lovely XML outline, like a miniature version of the HTML tab.
