How can I create disposable NSManagedObject objects?

I like using Core Data object modeling, because it gives me generated code and behavior that I like. For example, relationships with the inverse object being updated automatically. However, for most of my projects I don't need persistent storage. Specifically, I'd like not to save all the objects I created every time I save the context. What would be a good way to do this? I thought of using an extra context for disposable objects.
