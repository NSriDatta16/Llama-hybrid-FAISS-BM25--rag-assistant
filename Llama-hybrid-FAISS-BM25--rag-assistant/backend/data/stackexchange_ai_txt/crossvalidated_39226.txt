To answer some of my own questions, after additional reading and experimenting: The trick with the coefficient is that it's in the space of the data after Box-Cox transformation. So invert the transformation to get the beta in the original units. Yes, the standard approach in intervention analysis is to use a step function for the regressor, unless you have reason to think that the effect will be either an impulse or a slower ramp-up. One of several resources that I found useful was McLeod et al., Time Series Analysis with R . I figured out the Box-Cox thing by reading the forecast::forecast.Arima() code.
