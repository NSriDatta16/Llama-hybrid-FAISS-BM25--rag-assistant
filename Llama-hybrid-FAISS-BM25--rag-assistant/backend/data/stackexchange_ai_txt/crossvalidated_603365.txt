Personally, I like to draw a table for these kinds of situations (see this post ). Your model is: $$ \operatorname{E}(\mathrm{mathscore}|\mathrm{gender}, \mathrm{course}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\mathrm{gender_{m}} + \beta_{2}\mathrm{course_{none}} + \beta_{3}\underbrace{\mathrm{gender_{m}}\times\mathrm{course_{none}}}_{\text{= interaction term}} $$ Tabulating all possible combinations with their corresponding coefficients, we have: $$ \begin{array}{l|l|l} & \text{Gender = m} & \text{Gender= f} & \text{Difference} \\ \hline \text{Course = completed} & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} & \beta_{0} & \beta_{1} \\ \text{Course = none} & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} + \beta_{2} + \beta_{3} & \beta_{0} + \beta_{2} & \beta_{1} + \beta_{3} \\ \hline \text{Difference} & \beta_{2} + \beta_{3} & \beta_{2} & \beta_{3} \end{array} $$ Let's summarize the interpretation: $\beta_{0}$ is the estimated average math score for a female with a completed course. $\beta_{1}$ is the difference between males and females that completed the course. $\beta_{2}$ is the difference between females who completed the course and those who didn't. $\beta_{3}$ is the additional difference between the average math scores between males and females when we change from course completed to none. To make it specific: The difference between males and females who did complete the course is $\beta_{1} = 5.14$ but the difference between males and females who did not complete the course is $\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} = 5.14 + 3.13 = 8.27$ . Here is a schematic plot that hopefully aids the interpretation (note that the depicted effects do not correspond to the values of your coefficient):
