I've run into similar problems before. I assume you're using the length() function to determine the size of the file? If so, it;s likely the data that you're posting is UTF-8 encoded, instead of ASCII. To get the correct count you may need to add a "use bytes;" pragma to the top of your script, or wrap the length call in a block: my $size; do {use bytes; $size = length($file_data)} From the perlfunc man page: "Note the characters: if the EXPR is in Unicode, you will get the number of characters, not the number of bytes."
