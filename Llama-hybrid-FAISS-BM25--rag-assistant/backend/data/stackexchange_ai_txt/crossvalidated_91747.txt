Interpretation of coefficient sign change and order of terms

I have a logistic regression with data that are kind of like this: y I'd like to show that there are more A's than B's in y (instead of a Bernoulli with p = 0.5), even after controlling for x , so I fitted two logistic regression models and used an ANOVA to compare them. mlogis.x I have a few questions: Does what I did make sense overall? Is it okay to not have an intercept in the more basic model and then add it to the full(er) model? The coefficient for x changes sign between the two models, how should I interpret this?
