The usual model for ordinal logistic regression does not make any assumptions about whether the DV is skewed or not. It does assume proportional odds. If this assumption is violated, there are various remedies. The most straightforward is to use multinomial logistic regression, but this generates a lot of parameters. Another possibility is partial proportional odds. This is available in R (your graphs look like R graphs) see here . Another worry, as I mentioned in a comment, is the large number of predictor variables. You will want to be careful in how you build your model.
