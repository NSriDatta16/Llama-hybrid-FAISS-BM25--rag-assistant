+1 on what Brian said. Is there a better way to handle it? I can think of a couple of ways: convert the postback events to a handler. Then you can wire your dynamically loaded linkbuttons to regular links and use jquery ajax to post to your handler. You could load your aspx page as an iframe I think the 1st option is more elegant but requires more work.
