I think this [Bayesian updating] may be better than just learning from all the data at the same time, because I am interested in simulating future matches, so I would like to give some sort of priority to the latest data. Bayesian updating done sequentially gives you the same result as done all-at-once, so this would not solve the problem. Of course, this is true for the math, while if you use some kind of approximation, like MCMC, to obtain the posterior, and plug-in this as a new prior, than the result would not be exactly the same because of approximation errors, but it would be less precise, rather than be giving more weight to more recent samples. If you want to give higher priority to latest data, you need a model that explicitly does that by weighting the most recent data more. Moreover, as you noticed, vanilla Bayes theorem assumes exchangability, while you are dealing with time-series data, so there is a time-dependence between the observations. This means that you need a time-series model, that tracks the changes over time.
