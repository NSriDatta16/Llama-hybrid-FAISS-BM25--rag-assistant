When doing strategic planning, internal customers tend to care more about features that requirements. I tend to create a feature roadmap using a tool that supports traceability (I prefer Enterprise Architect by Sparx Systems but many tools will do). I review the desired features and the order they are needed in at the project sponsor level. Then, I work with appropriate individuals (sometimes business experts, business analysts, or senior IT folks such as architects) to break down each feature into a set of high level requirements. I create traceability from the high level requirements to the features. At this point, the requirements are often at the level of "Add an ABC screen", "Add a DEF screen", "Create a background process to recompute XYZ" and so forth, without further details. At this point, I work with appropriate people to estimate the effort for each high level requirement based on whatever metrics are available (ranging from gut feelings to statistics on how long e.g. screens take on average to add). My modeling tool then sums up the total estimated effort for each Feature, which can then be presented to the project sponsors and placed in a project plan. Then we start an iteration to address the first Feature or Feature Set. Each high level requirement is refined into detailed requirements ("Screen ABC needs a First Name field, max length 40, required" and so forth). Depending on project needs, we may re-estimate effort for the more detailed requirements and roll them up to the high level requirement they trace back to. More commonly, a developer will be assigned to develop Screen ABC, will enter his own estimate in the sprint planning tool, and that estimate will roll back to the original model. Since the requirements he's implementing (and estimated) trace to the high level requirements, which trace to the feature level, the plan is constantly updated as we get into each iteration. It requires some discipline and effort to set this up, but it is well worth it.
