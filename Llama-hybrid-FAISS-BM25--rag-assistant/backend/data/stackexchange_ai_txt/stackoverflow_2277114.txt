Good question for which I don't have a sure answer, because I myself would like to know. But in response to the question: So we can perhaps save time in selecting the values of C and gamma? ... I find that, with libsvm, there is definitely a "right" value for C and gamma that is highly problem dependent. So regardless of the order in which gamma is searched, many candidate values for gamma must be tested. Ultimately, I don't know any shortcut around this time-consuming (depending upon your problem) but necessary parameter search.
