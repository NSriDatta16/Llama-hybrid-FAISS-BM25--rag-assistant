When and How to Scale Numeric Interaction Variables in Machine Learning Model

I found one similar question on cross validated, but it was unanswered; my apologies if this has been answered. I'm experimenting with feature interaction in a regression model I'm working on in R. My only concern right now is with building and scaling/centering the features. Is there a "more statistically correct" means of scaling/centering numeric interaction features? The options I've thought through include: option 1: Scale/center all numeric features, THEN calculate interaction values Secondary question here... do I need to then re-scale/re-center those values? option 2: Calculate interactions on all features, then scale/center it all at the same time Well I had histograms to accompany the code below, but I don't have enough rep to post links to images. Example of option 1: # taking a small sample of "airquality" data set.seed(2) my_aq Then if I re-scale/re-center that, I'm left with this, which seems fine: # 1) do I need to scale/center again? denmat_pp_scaler I think this looks like what I would want from a machine-learning/modeling perspective. So if I go with option 1, I'd likely rescale/recenter. Example of option 2: # postscaled - not scaling until AFTER interactions have been computed denmat2 Question: Is one of these methods more statistically sound than the other? Or is this one of those "it depends" type situations. I find it interesting to see how much of an impact these different methods have on the overall skew of the final values as well. That was not something I anticipated. If anyone could apply a more statistically rigorous explanation of which is better and why it does/doesn't matter, that would be awesome. Thank you! edit: The main model I'm using now is extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) with the objective set to "reg:linear" but I will likely also be trying lasso and ridge regression with glmnet. edit2 Due to some upvotes, I now have enough rep to add my histogram images.
