You need to include the covariates if they are confounders for the effect of the instrument on the outcome . Consider the following causal diagrams (aka DAGs) In both scenarios, one option to estimate the effect of the treatment $(D)$ on the outcome $(Y)$ is to include $X_1$ and $X_2$ as covariates, assuming they are observable. If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are unobserved, you can instead use $Z$ as an instrument for $D$ in Scenario 1. In Scenario 2, however, you would have to include $X_1$ as a covariate for $Z$ to be a valid instrument. Here's an example using Card's ''college proximity'' data, where we are trying to estimate the effect of education on earnings using nearc4 (a dummy, = 1 if the individual grew up close to a 4-year college) as an instrument for years of education. library(wooldridge) library(ivreg) library(sandwich) library(lmtest) data("card") card |t|) (Intercept) 13.590682 0.088891 152.8913 College proximity is associated with about half a year more of schooling and can be used as an instrument if it is as good as randomly assigned, meaning that people who grew up close to a college and far from a college should be comparable in all other respects. However, if we check for balance in IQ bal |t|) (Intercept) 100.61065 0.63311 158.9162 we find that people who grew up close to a college have a higher IQ on average. I'm not sure when the IQ-test was actually administered, but let's assume that everyone took it on the first year of high schoool, which would mean that the IQ difference cannot be due to a difference in how many years of schooling were completed. Rather, college proximity appears not to be as-if randomly assigned. If we are sure that IQ is the only characteristic in which people who grow up close to / fram from a college differ, we could adjust for it to make the instrument valid. iv1 |t|) (Intercept) 3.6734020 0.8148133 4.5083 6.903e-06 *** educ 0.3332829 0.1290477 2.5826 0.009873 ** IQ -0.0193081 0.0097107 -1.9883 0.046909 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 If there are more confounders for the effect of college proximity on earnings, we must include them as covariates as well.
