How to figure out the behind concept of statistical-look problems?

The following is my experience doing some researches linked to statistical concepts. In the most situations I had no idea on how to organize the questions , how to ask for answers , and how to provide feedback showing my acceptance or rejection. I'm certainly not talking about the language issue but pointing on that it was not clear to me what the concept behind my question is . Sometime it comes out that there is a misunderstanding regarding the question. Some people do not tolerate the lack of formality (~standards) in the question and so their replies are not useful but discouraging. I believe that there is some sort of kindness and helpfulness trying to answer questioner with the hope being satisfied. Provided this background, I would appreciate it if you would provide me a list of: tools / tips-and-tricks / methods / skills / techniques / strategies / ... to find out how to seek for solution / help / ... in facing with statistical problems. For example this site (Stats.StackExchange.com) is a tool providing a forum based technology to ask statistical questions. Some people probably recommend reading books etc which I consider them not a shortcut solution although for young scholars it could be a good idea. The reason is the questioner in my question has lots of thing to do and also has other profession. My experiences showed that asking a clear/complicated question from an academic (unknown/famous) who does not know you has no way to be succeed. For a keen researcher it is however disappointing. For this question I tried to be clear as I could if you see it not clear enough, you got the problem. Any ideas? Please read this before commenting: I accept that the main question (the idea behind this post) might be a bit hard to be caught up by immediate-commentators. Briefly, in the first time facing with a problem we would have some guesses about the related topics/subject/methods in statistics that could help us to understand the problem and to propose solutions. This post discusses the problem solving strategies to connect a proper statistical analysis to the problem being investigated even roughly. Although productivity could be developed by the help of professional statistician however this is not the case to be addressed in this post. The main purpose of this post is to help self-learning practitioners who have enough background about the main concepts being investigated however do not have a clear idea if there is any modern/classic developed concept regarding the problem or not. For statistics as for other parts of sciences there are always tips-and-tricks that could help the researcher to speed up the progress of productivity, at least I have a bunch of them. I would recommend commentators to give a fair opportunity for discussions even if it is not their favorite. Please think positive and deep you'll see good points in this post. Nevertheless, to me what you comment or mark or vote will be useful even if those are not directly addressing the question and regardless the tone/language all are appreciated. Comments-on-comments @cardinal: Thanks. the provided link is an interesting post.
