Is there any single disadvantage to use GPU in deep learning?

In most cases I frequently heard that to make a deep learning experiment, it is highly recommended to use GPU. It makes the computation blazingly faster than CPU, and sounds like a magical tool (although I can't use it since I use MacBook...). However, is there any single disadvantage to use GPU, possibly except the higher monetary cost? For example the higher likelihood of getting crashed, etc...?
