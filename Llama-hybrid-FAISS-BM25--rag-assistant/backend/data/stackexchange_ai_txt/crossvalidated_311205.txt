Those are two separate issues, AUC can be used to compare arbitrarily many algorithms. AUC is also not more linked to logistic regression than to random forests or any other algorithm. Just test both algorithms on the same data-set splits (hold-out, cross validation, bootstrap or whatever it is you do) and compare the numbers. AUC has other drawbacks like being limited to binary classification and being less intuitive than say accuracy, but that's data-set related and thus also independent of the number and type of algorithms to compare. There are many measures you can use, AUC is one of them.
