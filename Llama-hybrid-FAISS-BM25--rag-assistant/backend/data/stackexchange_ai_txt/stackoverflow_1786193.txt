One possible explanation is that w3.org might be refusing to serve the DTD to you based on your User-Agent string or IP address (or their combination, or something else). Depending on your exact setup and needs, you could try one of the following: Switch off validating/DTD loading, if you don't need it (and there is a way to disable it), or configure your XML processing system to use a local copy of the DTD instead of fetching it over the network, or omit the DOCTYPE declaration from your XHTML document entirely, or change the system identifier in the DOCTYPE declaration to point to a local copy of the DTD, or configure the system to access the DTD through a HTTP proxy that has it cached and won't refuse to serve it to you.
