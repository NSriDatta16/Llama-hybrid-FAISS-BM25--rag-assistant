Assuming you have positive numbers in your list and you're serious with I am looking for reasons based on resource utilisation, compiler performance, GC performance etc. rather than elegance. You should implement it by yourself like: import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class Int { public static void main(String[] args) { List list = new ArrayList (); list.add("10"); list.add("20"); int total = 0; for (String str : list) { int val = 0; for (char c : str.toCharArray()) { val = val * 10 + (int) c - 48; } total += val; } System.out.print(total); } } The only GC relevant thing would be toCharArray() which could be replaced by another loop using charAt()
