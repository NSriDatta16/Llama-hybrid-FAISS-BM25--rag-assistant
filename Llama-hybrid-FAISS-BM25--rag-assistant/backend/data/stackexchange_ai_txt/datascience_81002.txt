onehotencoder random forest

In a Random Forest context, do I need to setup dummies/OnehotEncoder in a dataset where features/varibles are numerical but refer to some kind of category? Let's say I have the following variables: Where Y is the variable I want to predict. X's are features. I will focus on X1 . Its numerical but refers to a specific category (i.e. 1 refers to math, 2 refers to literature and 3 for history). Do I need to apply OnehotEncoder (or dummy approach) for a Random Forest algoritm? I guess I don't need to do it, but I 'm not sure.
