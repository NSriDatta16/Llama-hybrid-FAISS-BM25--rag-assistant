Are you using PHP or ASP.NET to enter the values? If the user is directly keying into the table, you can try using a trigger to set the last value. However, Comp_Cont_Id is what is called a derived field. Its value depends on other fields. Examples of derived fields are the total number of records, average of prices and etc. It is better to come up with the field on the fly, dynamically, rather than to store it. Of course, there are exception to this, such as when performance is important.
