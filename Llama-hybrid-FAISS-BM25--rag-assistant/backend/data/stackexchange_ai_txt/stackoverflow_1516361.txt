Either way, you are going to need testing. Say you export 40000 products to Excel, he re-organizes them and then you bring them back into a staging table(s) and apply the changes to your SQL table(s). Since Excel is basically a freeform system, what happens if he introduces invalid situations? Your update will need to detect it, fail and rollback or handle it in some specified way. Anyway, both your suggestions can be made workable. Personally, for large changes like this, I prefer to have an experienced database developer develop the changes in straight SQL (either hardcoding or table-driven), test it on production data in a test environment (doing a table compare between before and after) and deploy the same script to production. This also allows the use of the existing stored procedures (you are using SPs, to enforce a consistent interface to this complex database, right?) so that basic database logic already in place is simply re-used.
