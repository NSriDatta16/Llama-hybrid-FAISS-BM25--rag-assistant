Justificable to round non-integer values to use Poisson/Negative Binomial Regression?

I have mean litter size values reported from a number of studies. They are count data, but because I'm using the averages, they aren't integers (although they are the means of count data). It seems like a Poisson or Negative Binomial GLMM using the study site as a random intercept would the most appropriate choice for modeling effects of a number of environmental predictors on the response of litter size. Is it justifiable to round my average litter size values to that I can have integers to use? Would it be better to log-transform these values? What considerations should I take into account?
