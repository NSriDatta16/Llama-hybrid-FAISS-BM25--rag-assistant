It's possible that my background in psychological research is disguising some understanding of the broader application of PCA and K-means, but I'd say the following: PCA is used to reduce a set of variables to a smaller number of dimensions k-means is used to group cases. For example , take a study of 1000 participants who have completed 10 different ability tests (verbal, mathematics, spatial, etc.). I could use PCA (or factor analysis) to group tests in order to identify the main underlying dimensions. I could use k-means to identify types of cases. As a side point, I often find one approach is theoretically more interesting . If the cluster analysis is just grouping in terms of high and low on the first principal component, then I find PCA to be the more meaningful analysis, and the whole concept of clusters as an arbitrary dichotomisation (or categorisation) of a continuous variable.
