My guess is that your code isn't handling the result very well. Short answer: try changing your stored procedure to: CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetNumberToProcess] AS SET NOCOUNT ON RETURN 999 GO The NOCOUNT setting will prvent SQL from sending the '1 record(s) affected' which could influence your return value.
