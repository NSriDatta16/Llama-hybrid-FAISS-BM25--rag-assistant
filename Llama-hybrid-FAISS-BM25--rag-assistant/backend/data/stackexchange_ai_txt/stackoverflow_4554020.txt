When designing Form s, Panel s, etc. Visual Studio generates code for each item you drag onto the design view. You can find this auto-generated code in xxx.designer.cs files. It is this feature of Visual Studio that you want, not of Form or Panel class. You would have to perform code generation (as Shadow Wizard put it) to achieve the same thing. Otherwise it is not possible, at least in my knowledge.
