Is C = 1/lambda in SVM?

I was looking through the documentation for SVM.SVC where it said: C: float, default=1.0 Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive. The penalty is a squared l2 penalty Does this mean it's equal to inverse of lambda for our penalty function? ( Which is l2 in this case ) If so, why cant we directly alter the lambda instead of the inverse of it since that's the hyperparameter in the formula?
