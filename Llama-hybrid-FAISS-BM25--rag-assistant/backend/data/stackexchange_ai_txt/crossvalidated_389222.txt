How to forecast individual customer's spend (for millions of customers)?

Which forecasting model fits better to forecast the customers spend in the next upcoming visit? We have millions of customers, so ARIMA or any other time series modeling for each of the customers is not feasible (computationally). Built Linear model (using a different level of moving average terms and other independent variables) and the average model (average spend per visit in the last X visits or time period). The performance of the linear model is similar to that of average model. How can I improve the linear model or build a better forecasting model? Sample data: Customer Visit Date Spend 1 1/21/2018 302 2 1/21/2018 308 3 1/23/2018 2112 4 1/35/2018 123 1 2/14/2018 234 1 2/16/2018 534 2 3/4/2018 1254 3 6/6/2018 854 1 6/2/2018 150 1 6/8/2018 720 2 9/9/2018 440 4 12/12/2018 323 3 12/15/2018 445 1 12/16/2018 660 1 as_of_today ? 2 as_of_today ? 3 as_of_today ? 4 as_of_today ? Edit on 2019-01-31: I am not looking to forecast individually for each of the customers. I did segment the customers and built the linear models for each segment. However, want to build a better model than a linear model. So looking if there are any better forecasting techniques that can help me.
