Probability of sum of normal distributions under threshold, given that each distribution is under a known threshold

Say we have $k$ mutually independent normal random variables $M_1,\ldots,M_k$ where $M_i = \mathcal N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)$ . We have another normal random variable $R = \mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ that is independent to each $M_i$ . Let $T_1,\ldots,T_k$ be positive reals. What, then, is the following conditional probability? $$\mathbb P \left( \sum M_i \leq R \;\middle|\; \bigcap M_i\leq T_i \right)$$ This comes from a project I'm working on in the field of systems engineering and design; unfortunately, I've been unable to come up with something elegant. Obviously a numerical solution works, or there is a $k+1$ th order integral over a $k$ -simplex...
