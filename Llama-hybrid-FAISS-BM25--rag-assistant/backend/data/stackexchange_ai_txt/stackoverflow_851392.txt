I have used lots -- but its difficult to remeber any specific app as really good UIs are prety much forgetable. I can remember lots of bad ones. Anyone who bitches about lotus notes has obviously never used any SAP or ORACLE forms based apps. For sheer efficiency I would suggest you look at the old SABRE airline reservation application. Two lines of text no spaces or other punctuation First line the flight second line payment details something like this would book and pay for a flight: 123109BA176Y 276.00GBPAM1122123412341234 travel agents became addicated to it and for years refused to accept the super duper windows GUI replacement firing up the green screen terminal emulater instead. I think it only died the death when airlines switched to three letter codes and four digit flight numbers.
