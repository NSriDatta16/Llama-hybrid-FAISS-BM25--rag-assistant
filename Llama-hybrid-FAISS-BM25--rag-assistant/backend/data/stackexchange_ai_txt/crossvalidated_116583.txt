Since you can write down the survival function (or CDF) of the log-normal distribution, then just have to specify this into the likelihood function. The contribution of the ith censored observation to the likelihood function is: $$p_i = \Phi\left(\frac{\log(U_i)-\mu}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{\log(L_i)-\mu}{\sigma}\right).$$ Once you specify this, just run your MCMC sampler to obtain a posterior sample. In this case, a Metropolis-Hastings should work well. Using the posterior samples you can approximate the predictive survival function as follows: $$PS(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_j \left[1-\Phi\left(\frac{\log(t)-\mu_j}{\sigma_j}\right)\right],$$ where $(\mu_j,\sigma_j)$ represent the $N$ posterior samples of these parameters. The point values $T_i$ cannot be estimated, but you don't need to do this since you can get inference about the parameters without them.
