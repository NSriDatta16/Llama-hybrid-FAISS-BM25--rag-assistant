Help me choose ML method

I have a dataset with a lot of classes with varying amounts of data points in them, from 1075 to 1 with an average of ~19.5. Each datapoint has information of a subset of labels where the correct one is among them. Apart from this, each data point has a large number of features. For training and testing the correct label is also given. So far I have been testing SVMs but I don't know how to implement the information from the subsets. Any tips are greatly welcomed
