Multinomial logistic regression vs one-vs-rest binary logistic regression

Lets say we have a dependent variable $Y$ with few categories and set of independent variables. What are the advantages of multinomial logistic regression over set of binary logistic regressions (i.e. one-vs-rest scheme )? By set of binary logistic regression I mean that for each category $y_{i} \in Y$ we build separate binary logistic regression model with target=1 when $Y=y_{i}$ and 0 otherwise.
