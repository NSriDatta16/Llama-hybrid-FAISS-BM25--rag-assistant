Appending a random string is the most commonly used way to get around the cache. You can try setting pragma: no-cache header, but I am not sure this will be honored; I have a faint memory of this not working for me in the past - please see it for yourself and post back :-) var header:URLRequestHeader = new URLRequestHeader("pragma", "no-cache"); var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url); request.requestHeaders.push(header); If you have control over the web service, you can send pragma: no-cache header, which I assume you'd be doing already.
