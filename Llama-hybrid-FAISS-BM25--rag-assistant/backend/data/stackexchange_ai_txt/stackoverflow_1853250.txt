Real Time Twitter Status

I'm looking to write a Twitter application, and I need to get real time (or as close as possible) updates. The official REST API only allows 100 calls/hour or so, and if I want to get status from more that just a couple users it's going to add up pretty fast. Besides, requesting every 30 seconds seems like an overall pretty inefficient and inelegant solution. The Twitter Facebook app seems to have near-realtime updates, though of course they may be using prive backend things. Does anyone know what accessor method (REST/RSS/etc) would be best for this?
