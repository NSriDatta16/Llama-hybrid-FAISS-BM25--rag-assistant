I found a really good paper on post-treatment variables that mentions: If passage rates on an attention check are rejected by the treatment for any reason, then dropping respondents who fail it would be the equivalent of dropping cases on a post-treatment covariate and would again risk bias. So, yes, your concern is valid. I believe they talk about possible techniques to handle this case. I'm not an expert, but my gut is that you should: 1) document what percentage of the control group failed the check. 2) Analyze all of the data, ignoring the check question, as if the question weren't asked. By ignoring the check question, you won't commit post-treatment bias -- which in your case could be severe I think -- but you will add some noise because of participants who were not paying attention. But you do at least have a baseline percentage of check failure in the control group. Hopefully it's low. I think we could say that a similar proportion of the treatment group would also fail the check if stress were not part of the treatment, so that proportion of the whole would give a rough idea of how much noise -- meaningless surveys -- we introduced into our study by "not doing" (not using, actually) an attention check. (For the record, your original posting seems to imply that the check is a question about the task ahead, that's administered before the survey. But I think it's a question slipped into the survey to check comprehension/attention.)
