Using ordered factor as predictor in R

This is a really simple problem I am having, yet for the life of me I can't find a solution searching around. In theory I can simply recode the data, but that is an extreme solution I would rather not use if I don't have to. I am simply trying to do a logistic regression with an ordered factor as my predictor. For a toy data set, consider: radiation leukemia other total 1 0 13 378 391 2 1-9 5 200 205 3 10-49 5 151 156 4 50-99 3 47 50 5 100-199 4 31 35 6 200 18 33 51 I want to execute the following: glm(cbind(leukemia,other)~radiation,data=leuk,family=binomial("logit")) That is, leukemia are the "successes" and other are the "failures". Basically, trying to predict dose-response relationship between radiation and the proportional mortality rates for leukemia. However, this model is oversaturated: Call: glm(formula = cbind(leukemia, other) ~ radiation, family = binomial("logit"), data = leuk) Coefficients: (Intercept) radiation1-9 radiation10-49 radiation100-199 -3.3699 -0.3189 -0.0379 1.3223 radiation200 radiation50-99 2.7638 0.6184 Degrees of Freedom: 5 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 54.35 Residual Deviance: -3.331e-15 AIC: 33.67 I don't want each level of radiation as a factor to be its own predictor variable; that makes no sense, especially when you only have a small number of data points (note, this isn't actually the real data I am using, this is just a toy example that is similar). In any case, how do I force R to simply consider the factor radiation as a single variable with multiple levels? For example, if I do the following: x This is more in line with what I want. But I am nervous about using that x variable in the regression for fear of changing the interpretation of the results. Similarly, I'd prefer to avoid an irritating system of dummy variables. How do I go about doing this? Or is there a better workaround altogether for studying this type of relationship that I am not considering?
