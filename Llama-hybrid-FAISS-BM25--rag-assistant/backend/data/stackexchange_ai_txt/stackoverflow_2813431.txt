There's no standard way to specify a dependent app. So, you need to somehow watch the system. You don't have to actively poll; you need to use some system mechanism to tell you. To watch for a GUI app to launch, you need to write a background app, get the NSWorkspace's notification center by NSNotificationCenter* nc=[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] notificationCenter]; and watch for NSWorkspaceDidLaunchApplicationNotification. See the Apple doc . To watch for a non-GUI app to launch, you need to use kqueue . (This is a BSD feature.) See the man page . Typically you have to watch launchd to fork or execve processes. Note that there are multiple launchd processes, one for root and one for each logged-in users. In any case you need to start automatically the background app you write. There're many ways to do that. To watch a file or a directory to change, you can use launchd agents. See the man page . By the way: the official Last.fm app, on its first launch, installs AudioScrobbler.bundle inside ~/Library/iTunes/iTunes Plug-ins . iTunes reads all the plug-ins when launched, and the plug-in then launches the Last.fm app. It's a rather hackish, non-condoned usage of the interface, because the plug-in is for the visualizer. See Apple doc .
