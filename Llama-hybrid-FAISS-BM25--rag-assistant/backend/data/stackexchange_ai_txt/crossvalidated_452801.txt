OK, I think you only need a simple test of proportions where you are testing that $H_0: p_0 = p_1$ where $p_i$ denotes the population proportion for cytotoxic. In Minitab I believe this is called a two-sample proportion test. You have 0 cytotoxic responses before our of 133 trials, and 0 out of 133 after. I think that is exactly as you describe. If you want more information, I would fit a proportional odds logistic regression model with a single predictor variable (again, before/after), but that would let you model each level of your outcome variable.
