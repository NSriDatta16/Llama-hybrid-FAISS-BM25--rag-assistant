Best Practice: Organize Unit Tests

I have solution with >270 projects, it contains various folders and etc. Imagine each project have Unit Tests, what do you think what is the best way to organize them? Should each project have Unit Tests near by, or I should create special folder for them, or even different solution for just unit tests. How do you organize them for such a big solutions/projects ?
