I was waiting for a definite answer to this, but seeing as nothing's come up I might as well share what I've found out. I traced addFieldToFilter and apparently every value you use ends up quoted so you can't really "hack" this by using the name of a column. In fact I don't see any way to do this, at least not within this class. Realistically I think you'll need to go with post-load filtering, at least for now. This of course is the very definition of inefficient code, but then again if computational efficiency was a priority, you wouldn't be using Magento in the first place...
