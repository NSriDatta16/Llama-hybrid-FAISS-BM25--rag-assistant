The KPSS test is used for testing a null hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary around a deterministic trend. You can see that the critical values are given by: Critical values for H0: mIlliq1 is trend stationary So as you can see, you cannot reject the H0, that your data is trend-stationary. So the data follow a straight-line time trend with stationary errors. But since you cannot reject, that only means that there is no evidence that it is not trend stationary; see the discussion here . The following picture shows what is maybe appropriate for you, a trend-stationary model: You now Estimate the trend via OLS Use the residuals to fit an ARMA model Check the model (final residuals) Thats it.
