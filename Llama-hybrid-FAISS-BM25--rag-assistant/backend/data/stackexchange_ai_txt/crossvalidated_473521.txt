According to this reference ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_reduction ) on log reduction , we have a greater than 2log10 reduction in viral load if $R = log_{10}c_{b} âˆ’ log_{10}c_{a}>2$ , where $c_{b}$ is the true baseline viral load and the $c_{a}$ is the true viral load at the end of 24 weeks. Both $c_{b}$ and $c_{a}$ are unknown (or unobserved), and needs to be estimated (or measured) first. An average of 3 consecutive measures is used because we want more reliable estimation of $c_{b}$ and $c_{a}$ , thus I think based on this interpretation, the second way looks more correct.
