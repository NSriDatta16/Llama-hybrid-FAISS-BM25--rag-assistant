Convert string to Brushes/Brush color name in C#

I have a configuration file where a developer can specify a text color by passing in a string: Rather than have a gigantic switch statement look for all of the possible colors, it'd be nice to just use the properties in the class System.Drawing.Brushes instead so internally I can say something like: Brush color = Brushes.Black; // Default // later on... this.color = (Brush)Enum.Parse(typeof(Brush), prasedValue("color")); Except that the values in Brush/Brushes aren't enums. So Enum.Parse gives me no joy. Suggestions?
