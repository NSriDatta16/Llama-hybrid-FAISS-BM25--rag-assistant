How can you measure speed at which the user is moving their finger across the iPhone/iPad screen?

I'm diving into iPhone development and I'm trying to get my head around gestures and the touch events. How can I measure how fast the user is moving their finger across the screen of an iOS device using the touche events (touchesBegan, touchesMoved, etc)? Thanks so much in advance for your help!
