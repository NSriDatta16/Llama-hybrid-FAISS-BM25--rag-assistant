your graph doesn't suggest a downwards trend , it suggests (slightly ) 1 or more level shifts. A level shift is not a trend but a change in intercept... The program you are using only tests for level shifts. It appears to me that your sample size is soooo large it might be falsely suggesting level shifts. The only way to resolve this is to 1) adjust pulse anomalies ; 2) identify any persistant sarima structure ; AND then 3) test for time trends and/or step/level shifts as laid out by Intervention Analysis Coding in R TSA Package and Time series trend
