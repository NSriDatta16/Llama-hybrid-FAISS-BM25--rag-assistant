Gelman et al. (1996) showed that the optimal proposal distribution for a $d$-dimensional multivariate normal posterior with covariance matrix $\Sigma$ is a zero-mean multivariate normal with covariance matrix $5.76\Sigma / d$. To make this statement more operational, I usually run my inference in three steps: Use gradient-based optimisation to find the MAP estimate (assuming unimodal posterior) Compute an estimate of the posterior covariance at the MAP estimate by evaluating the Hessian of the log posterior and inverting it Run an MCMC sampler starting at the MAP estimate and with the proposal covariance discussed above This will give you the optimal approach if your posterior is Gaussian and will work well if it is close to Gaussian.
