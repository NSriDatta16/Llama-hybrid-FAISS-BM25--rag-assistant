This problem is very common in the Bayesian framework. Student's T distribution is the posterior predictive of the Gaussian model. Given $n$ points, having mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the posterior predictive distribution for subsequent points is (noncentral scaled) Student T distributed. The exact same calculations can be done for your model, which is the Beta-binomial model. You can find details on the Wikipedia page . Like the Student T, it's a three parameter distribution with density: \begin{align} f(k \mid n,\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(n-k+1)} \frac{\Gamma(k+\alpha)\Gamma(n-k+\beta)}{\Gamma(n+\alpha+\beta)} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}. \end{align} This is over the domain $k\in [0,1]$. $\alpha-\frac12$ and $\beta-\frac12$ are your number of successes and failures, $n=1$ since your model is Beta-Bernoulli. To find your $\alpha$-interval, I guess you'll have to integrate and invert the density, likely by numerical means.
