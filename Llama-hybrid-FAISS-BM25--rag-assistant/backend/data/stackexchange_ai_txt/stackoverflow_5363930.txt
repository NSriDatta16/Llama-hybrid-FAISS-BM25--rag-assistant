PHP is still far more common than Python as server-side language. However, there's nothing that can be done with PHP but not with Python. There are lots of very elegant Python libraries and toolkits (especially popular as server framework is Django ). Generally, you should not be afraid to use Python if your existing infrastructure allows it ( personally, I think Python's clear and expressive syntax represents a huge progress compared to PHP ).
