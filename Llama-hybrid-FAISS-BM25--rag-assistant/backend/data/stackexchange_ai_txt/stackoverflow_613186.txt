The REST camp have some guiding principles that we can use to standardize the way we use HTTP verbs. This is helpful when building RESTful API's as you are doing. In a nutshell: GET should be Read Only i.e. have no effect on server state. POST is used to create a resource on the server. PUT is used to update or create a resource. DELETE is used to delete a resource. In other words, if your API action changes the server state, REST advises us to use POST/PUT/DELETE, but not GET. User agents usually understand that doing multiple POSTs is bad and will warn against it, because the intent of POST is to alter server state (eg. pay for goods at checkout), and you probably don't want to do that twice! Compare to a GET which you can do as often as you like (idempotent).
