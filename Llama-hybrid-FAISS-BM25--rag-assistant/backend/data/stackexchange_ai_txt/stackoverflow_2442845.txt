1) Yes we do measure simple node coverage, beacause: it is easy to do with our current project* (Rails web app) it encourages our developers to write tests (some come from backgrounds where testing was ad-hoc) 2) Code coverage is part of our continuous integration process. 3) The numbers from the reports are used to: enforce a minimum level of coverage (95% otherwise the build fails) find sections of code which should be tested There are parts of the system where testing is not all that helpful (usually where you need to make use of mock-objects to deal with external systems). But generally having good coverage makes it easier to maintain a project. One knows that fixes or new features do not break existing functionality. *Details for setting up required coverage for Rails: Min Limit 95 Ahead
