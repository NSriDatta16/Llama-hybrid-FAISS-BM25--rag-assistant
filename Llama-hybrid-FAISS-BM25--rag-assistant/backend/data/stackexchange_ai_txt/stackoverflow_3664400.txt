Is there anything I can do to optimize the tab loading in javascript?

My colleagues have create a website and there is a webpage which contains a Tab. He Implement the tab with the following method: 1.Load all content of the page 2.Use javascript to display those group content as block and organize them into tabs. 3.when user click one tab, then acitve it, and hide all other tabs. And these functions works very well, but the performance is bad: 1.Load all contents cost lots of time 2.It will show all content at first, and then shrink to a tab control. When the user see this, it might think this is a bug of our system. And These code are ready to deploy, is there any quick fix to handle these problems ? Thanks in advance !
