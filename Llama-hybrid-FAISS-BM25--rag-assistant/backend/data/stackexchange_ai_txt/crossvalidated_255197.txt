What statistical significance test should I use? (Monty Hall Problem)

I've been scratching my head over it, but as a mere high school student I can't seem to figure it out. As a big school project I've been doing research after the Monty Hall Problem . I'm trying to figure out whether or not the number of doors in the problem influences the choice of the player (to switch or not to switch doors). I've calculated that by avarage players chooce to switch 16.3% of the time. I did this by looking at the control groups mentioned in this paper . I took the average of the two control groups: $$\frac{17 \times 35 + 16 \times 67}{35+67} \approx 16.3\%$$ Now my results return (in a test with 20 doors in stead of 3) a 29.3% ratio. (58 test subjects, 17 switchers, 41 non-switchers) However, I don't know how to prove this result whether this result is significant or not, and I was hoping someone could explain me how.
