Luke Crawford's recent post about Muxtape offers another perspective. I spent my first 4 years as a web developer using PHP, and it was fun at the time, but as I began to realize how severely inefficient it was I started looking elsewhere. I’d abandoned my traditional computer science background for the web and its greater design possibilities, but because of this I knew there was a better way. PHP developers shouldn’t be ridiculed as much as they often are because, frankly, it enables people without a more rigorous background to accomplish amazingly technical things. This should satisfy nerds but usually is turned into some kind of weak ‘machismo’ thing instead. Anyways, this dissatisfaction began in late 2004 and Ruby on Rails was brand-new, stable, and addressed every limitation I’d confronted with my old homegrown PHP MVC framework. I’ve exclusively done Rails work ever since. In any case, it would be hard to defend the categorical statement "Rails does not offer any significant advantages over PHP." PHP is a great tool to solve certain problems. Rails is a great tool to solve certain problems.
