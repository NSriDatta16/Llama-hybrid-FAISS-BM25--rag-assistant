What are some good Flash game frameworks?

Pretty straightforward. Open source is good, but organization and documentation is better. Actionscript 3 is a must, I don't really want to start working with the older versions. I guess that's the crux of my problem using Google, because there are vast quantities of how to do thing "the old way" out there, but I'm having trouble getting solid AS3/Flash9+ stuff. And the point is shortening development time, so "in progress" or 0.x versions need not apply.
