This dialog is produced by the visual studio runtime, in response to abort() . abort() is by default called by e.g. terminate() . You'll get this from e.g. unhandled c++ exceptions, call to pure virtuals, failed assertions. So, it's not platform dependent, but run-time library dependent. abort() is, by the c++ standard, required to terminate the program without executing destructors for automatic and static storage objects, and without calling atexit() handlers.
