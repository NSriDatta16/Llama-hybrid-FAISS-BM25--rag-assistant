You are not using the sampled values at each iteration to calculate the mean of the distribution, you are using them to calculate a sample of the optimal portfolio weights. At the end of, say, $N$ iterations, you have $N$ samples of optimal portfolio weights, and you form your optimal portfolio by averaging them. Each sample optimal portfolio weight vector is a nonlinear transformation of the sampled parameters, and as a consequence, the averaged sample optimal portfolio weights will (almost certainly) be different than the ones you would have calculated using the original estimated parameter values.
