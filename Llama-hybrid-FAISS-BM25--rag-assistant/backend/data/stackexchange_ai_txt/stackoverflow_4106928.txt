I believe the highest Normal Form you may achieve here would be 3NF or BCNF. I say this is because: 1NF requires the elimination of repeating groups and attributes are atomic. You do not have any repeating groups so the requirements for 1NF have been met by default. 2NF and 3NF deal with how relations are constructed with respect to Functional Dependencies . I see you have the following Functional Dependencies described: (A -> BCD, BC -> DE, B -> D, D -> A). Given these, you may structrue relations into 2NF, 3NF and possibly BCNF. 4NF and above deal with multi-valued facts. You have not described any of these so it is reasonable to presume there are none. Some may argue that any BCNF relation where no multi-valued facts exist is also in 4NF - I don't want to get into that one because it just boils down to a "glass half full/empty" type of arguement. I have not taken the time to sort out all of the FD's (it is your homework after all), but I would pay close attention to the FD's: BC -> D , D -> A and A -> B . The difference between 3NF and BCNF is a bit subtle. This slide show and Wikipedia article should help sort it out.
