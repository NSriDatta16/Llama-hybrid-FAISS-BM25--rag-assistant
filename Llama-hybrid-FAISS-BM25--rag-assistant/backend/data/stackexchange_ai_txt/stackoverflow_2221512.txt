You can't know, not exactly and not always. You can make a good guess. It depends on the browser, OS, RAM, CPU, what else is running at that moment, how fast their connection is, what else they're transferring, etc. Figure out several situations you expect for your average user, and test those. Add for various best, worst, and interesting (e.g. mobile, tablet) cases. You can, of course, apply experience and extrapolate from your specific cases, and the answer will change for the future. But don't fall into the trap of "it works for me!" I commonly see this with screen resolutions: as those have increased, it's much more popular to have multiple windows visible at the same time. In 1995 it was rare for me to not have something maximized; now fifteen years later, it's exactly the opposite. Yet sometimes people will design some software or a website, use lower contrast [1] , maximize it, and connect to a server on localhostâ€”and that's the only evaluation they do. [1] Because they know what the text says and don't need to read it themselves, so lower contrast looks aesthetically better.
