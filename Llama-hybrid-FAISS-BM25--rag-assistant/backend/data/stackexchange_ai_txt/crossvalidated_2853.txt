In applied settings it is typically more important to know whether any violation of assumptions is problematic for inference. Assumption tests based on significance tests are rarely of interest in large samples, because most inferential tests are robust to mild violations of assumptions. One of the nice features of graphical assessments of assumptions is that they focus attention on the degree of violation and not the statistical significance of any violation. However, it's also possible to focus on numeric summaries of your data which quantify the degree of violation of assumptions and not the statistical significance (e.g., skewness values, kurtosis values, ratio of largest to smallest group variances, etc.). You can also get standard errors or confidence intervals on these values, which will get smaller with larger samples. This perspective is consistent with the general idea that statistical significance is not equivalent to practical importance.
