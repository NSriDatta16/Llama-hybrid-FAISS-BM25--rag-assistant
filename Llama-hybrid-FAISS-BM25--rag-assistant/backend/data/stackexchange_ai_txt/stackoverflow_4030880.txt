As preciously stated - user agent BUT , do you really mean to ask "is it a mobile phone"? Or do you really mean something else? Lines are blurring these days. I bought a nice little Android slate with 7" screen from eBay for $99. Is that a mobile phone? Is a mini-netbook with 6" screen? Is a Kidnle-like-device? I'm just wondering why you want to know if it is a mobile 'phone ... screen size? processing power? something else? You probably did mean mobile 'phone but, if not, please rephrase and we can help further.
