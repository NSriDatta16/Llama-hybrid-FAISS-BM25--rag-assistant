Can Machine Learning Algorithms Process Contextual Features for Regression?

Take Figure 1 showing point interpolation, where point L0 is being interpolated using points L2 and L1 and the distances L11, L12, L21, and L22. Whilst the graph shows a linear interpolation example, it is just to demo the idea whilst the Target variable is a product sum of arrays (non-linear) Target/L0 = L1_Lag_Point * L11 + L1_Lead_Point * L12 + L2_Lag_Point * L21 + L2_Lead_Point * L22 Can a Machine Learning Algorithm understand that L11 is associated ONLY with Lagging Point L1, L12 with Leading Point L1, L21 with Lagging Point L2, and L22 with Leading Point L2?!
