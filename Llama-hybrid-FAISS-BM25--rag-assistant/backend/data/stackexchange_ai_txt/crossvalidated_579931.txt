quasi-PCA reconstruction of the matrix by orthogonal basis

Let's say I have a "data" matrix $X$ of $N$ rows and $p$ cols with $N \gg p$ . Now PCA with $L$ components can be formulated as $$ X_L = \underset{Y:rank(Y) = L}{\text{argmin}} ||X- Y||^2_F, $$ where $Y$ is taken to be an $L$ -dimensional approximation of $X$ . It's known that $X_L = X W_L W^T_L$ (see here e.g.) where $W_L$ is $p \times L$ matrix of first $L$ principal components of $X$ . However, suppose I instead want to choose an arbitrary orthonormal basis $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_p$ and construct $W_L = [w_1 w_2 \dots w_L]$ for $L = 1, 2, \dots, p$ . Am I guaranteed that the "unexplained" variance $||X- X_L||^2_F$ is going to monotonically decrease in $L$ , the number of dimensions I retain, if the matrix $W_L$ is built iteratively (that is, if we fixed $w_1$ we may only add $w_2, w_3$ etc., but never throw away $w_1$ )? It feels like the answer is "yes", but maybe I'm missing something? It definitely decreases from $L = 1$ to $L = p$ .
