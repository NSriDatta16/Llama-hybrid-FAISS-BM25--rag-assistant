How to calculate efficient local average of each coordinate of large matrix (average filter) in python

I have large matrix, 4000x4000 I need to calculate local average of 11x11 window for each x,y of this matrix Generally it must be something like for x in range(4000) for y in range(4000) b[x,y]=mean(a[x-5:x+5,y-5:y+5] But this will run a lot of time Is it some more efficient way to do this? Thanks.
