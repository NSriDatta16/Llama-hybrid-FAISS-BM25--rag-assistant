Since you don't have more than one year, you can't be sure if those massive changes are repeating or not. Maybe there is another external factor affecting only that year, e.g. coronavirus. Normally, train/validation splitting strategy should mimic the real world testing. That is why we use time series cross validation. Assuming daily data available, the best way would be splitting from the mid-month , predict the other half, and move forward for each month, e.g. use data available up to mid-April, predict the other half of April. Use data available up to mid-May, predict other half of May etc. You can go with daily steps if your training is cheap.
