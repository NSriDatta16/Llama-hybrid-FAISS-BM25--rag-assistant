I think the simulator you saw was a website meant for people who want to explore the iPhone interface (and iPhone support agents). There are several such simulators available for this purpose and they are being updated for 3.0/3GS features. These, however, are not true simulators like the iPhone Simulator app on OS X and you cannot really interact with them. They're generally interactive image slideshows or PDFs.
