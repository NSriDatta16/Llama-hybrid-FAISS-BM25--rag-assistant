The most anoying IE6 feature is it's box model handling. You should stick to margin instead when positioning boxes, and try to use relative font sizes to allow font resizing on IE. The rest of the quirks are well documented . Using conditional comments is the cleanest way of having both a clean style sheet for well behaving browsers, and still using being beautiful on IE. This is what I use, only needing 1 css file of a few lines to repair my sites look and feel. The dark path of crossbrowser consistent look & feel are css hacks , but I strongly discourage it's use, specialy now that for some time we'll have to target three different IE (6, 7 & 8) Normally, if you get the style to work in both FF and Chrome/Safari, IE is only a few corrections away of being correct.
