it is better to do such formatting before data is persisted Absolutely. Should the domain later be responsible for defensive/coercive formatting of data? With the currently stored data you won't find a right place to introduce the trim. it's because the consistency of your storage is broken. You could try the self-healing approach. Read the data and trim it somewhere before displaying in a dialogue. As soon as the user saves this dialogue, the data in the database gets "fixed". As for the new input, I'm leaning toward opinion that trimming data is some cleaning operation that belongs neither to the domain layer nor to the data layer. The user input should get "cleaned" somewhere close to the UI layer before you actually start working with that data.
