Some time ago, I was searching for a text editor for my new Mac. Since this was some months ago, some points might have been corrected in the meantime. I feel that Aquamacs is by far the best OSX-Emacs. However, it feels a bit too Mac-like in some areas. For example, it rather uses several windows instead of several buffers and the coloring schemes are not "normal" Emacs-style. If you look for a more basic set, Carbon Emacs might do it as well, though you might want to add some additional packages to add PHP support or AucTeX. Emacs.app feels broken in my opinion. It not even opens files using drag and drop.
