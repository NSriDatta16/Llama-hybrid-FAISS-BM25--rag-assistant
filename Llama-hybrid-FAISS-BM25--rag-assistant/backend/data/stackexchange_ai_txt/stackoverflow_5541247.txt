Graceful way to handle item not found in a collection in C#

I have the following scenario: I have a foreach loop that loops through a collection, if an item is found (based on criteria as in example below), it will return that item. If not what is the most graceful way to deal with this exception. I have a throw new notimplementedexception but I think there is a more elegant way. Code is: foreach (SPContentType type in sPContentTypeCollection) { if (type.Name == contentTypeName) { return type; } } throw new NotImplementedException(); As you can see, it's not what I would call readable code. How can I make it easier for the next guy to maintain. On a side note, it does what it should from a technical perspective.
