c# create an arbitrary length generic parameter string e.g. ?,?,?

I know I am forgetting to remember how to do this and it is late. I want to, in an elegant manner, build a placeholder list for a munged sql command. Have a command with an arbitrary number of parameters, need to build ?,?,? Did I mention that it was a wet brain fart? this is what came out: You are welcome to make me feel like more of an idiot if you just remember me what I am forgetting. ;-) Ok, looks like I should be calling it a night. Both you guys confirmed what I was doing before going off the deep end. This is my name list, string names = string.Join(",", _command.Parameters.Cast ().Select(p => p.ParameterName).ToArray()); And I just replaced the p.Name with '?' string vals = string.Join(",", _command.Parameters.Cast ().Select(p => "?").ToArray()); But for some reason I did not approve. Thanks.
