It is true that the MLE in this case is an estimate that the probability of heads is one. Bear in mind that this is only a point estimate, so it does not necessarily follow that the classical method would assert that all future tosses will land heads with probability one. More likely the latter prediction would be made using some kind of confidence interval estimate using a pivotal quantity. It is broadly true that Bayesian analysis incorporates prior information and so it is more likely to give sensible results in these kinds of cases, where we have an a priori belief that the coin should be "close" to fair. This issue is discussed in O'Neill (2009) where the classical and Bayesian methods are contrasted (using an example of a real-life attempt to determine the fairness of a new coin), and the phenomenon that you are talking about.
