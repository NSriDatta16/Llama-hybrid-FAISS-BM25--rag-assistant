Send objects with custom attributes via a wcf service

I just began studying WCF because i need it for a school assignment. But i have a problem when i am trying to send an object with some custom attributes. The object is: [DataContract] public class Person { [DataMember] [Searchable("ID")] public virtual String ID { get; set; } [DataMember] [Searchable("LastName")] public virtual String LastName { get; set; } [DataMember] [Searchable("FirstName")] public virtual String FirstName { get; set; } } The custom attribute is: [DataContract] [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property)] public class Searchable:Attribute { public Searchable(String PropertyName) { this.PropertyName = PropertyName; } [DataMember] public virtual String PropertyName { get; set; } } I use svcutil to generate the configuration file and the client. The communication between the client and the service is going on fine. But when I receive an object of type Person and try to search for attribute of type Searchable i can't find any. Is this possible? If yes could you provide any hints on how to achieve this kind of behavior? Thanks. Denis.
