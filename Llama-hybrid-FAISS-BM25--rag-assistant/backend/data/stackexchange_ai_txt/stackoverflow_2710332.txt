The reason such a container is not part of the standard library is that it would be inefficient. Using a vector for storage means objects have to be moved if something is inserted in the middle of the vector. Doing this on every insertion gets needlessly expensive. (On average, half the objects will have to be moved for each insertion. That's pretty costly) If you want a sorted vector, it is likely better to insert all the elements, and then call std::sort() once , after the insertions.
