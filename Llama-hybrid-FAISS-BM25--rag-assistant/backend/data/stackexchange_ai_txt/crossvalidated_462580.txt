This seems misguided to me, but perhaps more importantly you cannot test if the two strategies are different in each individual year with this data. To simplify this a bit: you only have one data point for each strategy in each year, but testing for a difference requires a set of data points so that you can compare the averages (usually the mean). If you had data for each of the strategies from each year from many different countries , for example, you would be able to test whether the strategies are different. I would still not recommend doing so, however! There are almost certainly better ways to address your underlying question. I would strongly recommend reading more about hypothesis testing, statistical significance and p-values before proceeding. There are a number of relevant threads on this site, including: Why is "statistically significant" not enough? What is the meaning of p values and t values in statistical tests? When to use Fisher and Neyman-Pearson framework?
