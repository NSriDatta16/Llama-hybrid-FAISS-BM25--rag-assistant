Visual Studio 2010 introduces "No drag and drop customization of menus and toolbars"

What went wrong with the Microsoft Visual Studio team, for them to remove the drag-and-drop functionality of menu and toolbar customizations? You now are greeted with a friendly looking dialog box that lets you "Add" and "Remove" items using listboxes and other primitive means of customization. How do I quickly customize items here? Or should I switch back to VS 2008?
