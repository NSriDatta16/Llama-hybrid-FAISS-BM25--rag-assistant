Well, off the top of my head: Yes, should be static. A company complaining about that would not be worth working for. Yeah, but what would you do? Return? Or throw an exception? It'll throw an exception the way it is already. I think the main problem is that your code is not very elegant. Too many checks in the inner loop. Too many redundant checks. Just raw, off the top of my head: public int findArray(int[] largeArray, int[] subArray) { int subArrayLength = subArray.length; if (subArrayLength == 0) { return -1; } int limit = largeArray.length - subArrayLength; int i=0; for (int i = 0; i You could keep that check for the first element so you don't have the overhead of setting up the boolean and the for loop for every single element in the array. Then you'd be looking at public int findArray(int[] largeArray, int[] subArray) { int subArrayLength = subArray.length; if (subArrayLength == 0) { return -1; } int limit = largeArray.length - subArrayLength; for (int i = 0; i
