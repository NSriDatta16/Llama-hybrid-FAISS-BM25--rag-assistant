How much data are you trying to store? For very basic needs I've used localStorage. It probably wouldn't be good for a lot of data, but can be easily used to access smaller portions of data. localStorage.setItem(key, value) localStorage.getItem(key) //returns value associated with this key To store more info you could possibly write to and read from a local file using fileWriter and fileReader if you want to implement it using javascript on the phonegap side of things. Just look at the phonegap api .
