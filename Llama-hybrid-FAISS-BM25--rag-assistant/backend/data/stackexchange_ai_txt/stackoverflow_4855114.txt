Access DOM objects of parent window from jQuery DOMWindow loaded with iFrame

I have a web-page with a jQuery DOMWindow that loads its content from an iFrame. I need to access elements of the parent window from the iFrame. Is this possible? This is the configuration for the DOMWindow that is opened from my main page: $('.AjaxDOMWindow').openDOMWindow({ anchoredClassName:'DOMWindow', draggable: 1, eventType:'click', height:500, loader:1, loaderHeight:16, loaderImagePath:'/js/jquery/DOMWindow/animationProcessing.gif', loaderWidth:17, positionLeft:0, positionTop:0, positionType:'centered', width:700, windowSource:'iframe' }); I'm attempting to access the parent window's elements from the DOM box with: parent.document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML = ''; But this doesn't appear to work. Thanks!
