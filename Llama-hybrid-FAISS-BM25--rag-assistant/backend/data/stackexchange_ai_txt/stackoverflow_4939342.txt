The WCF team did this when they introduced DataContractJsonSerializer. There are far more touchpoints than the ones mentioned here in the other two answers -- for example you may have to introduce and change the operation behaviors and operation formatters being used, add a new encoder, and add entirely new service and client behaviors as well. It depends on what the new serialization format is and what you're trying to do. However, if your goal is to only add a new serializer for stand-alone serialization, it's simpler. What I would recommend is -- look at all the different usage of DataContractJsonSerializer (via Reflector) in System.Runtime.Serialization.dll, System.ServiceModel.Web.dll, and System.Runtime.ServiceModel.dll. If you're interested in only the standalone serialization aspect, just look at the DataContractJsonSerializer and the associated classes in the Serialization namespace. It should be fairly intuitive for you to grasp the various subtleties of custom serialization implementation. Ask away if you have specific questions, but I truly believe this is the quickest and most elegant way to learn this particular solution...
