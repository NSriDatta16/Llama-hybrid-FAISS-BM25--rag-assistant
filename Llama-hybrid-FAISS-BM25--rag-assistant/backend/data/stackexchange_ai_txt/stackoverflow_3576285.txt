Embeddable open-source key-value storage with liberal license

Is there any open-source document-oriented key-value map/reduce storage that: is easily embeddable (Yes, it is possible to embed, let's say CouchDB, but it might be a pain to take the whole erlang machine onboard and I just don't feel good about it bounded on some port when my app is running) does not keep the whole map in RAM (Hello, Redis!) is good enough to be in production use has a license different from GPL/LGPL/AGPL/whatever-else-GPL (Hey, MongoDB and Tokyo Cabinet!) I don't really care about horizontal scalability, as I think about building a desktop application, but what will be nice to have is some sort of the “attachments” like in CouchDB, i.e. a way to store binary files attached to my documents.
