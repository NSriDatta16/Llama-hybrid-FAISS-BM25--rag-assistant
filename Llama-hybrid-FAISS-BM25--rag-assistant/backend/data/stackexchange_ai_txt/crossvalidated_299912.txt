As far as I understand it, A/B testing is only a marketing term for the two-sample t-test. As you have a factor variable (original checkout page) as control variable, you need multivariate regression. I would go for a logistic regression model with the binary variable "converted" as dependent y-variable, and the colour of the button and the location of the button as two independent dummy variables plus original checkout page as factor independent variable for control. Does this make sense?
