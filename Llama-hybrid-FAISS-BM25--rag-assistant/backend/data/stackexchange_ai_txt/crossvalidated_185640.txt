Is anyone using the last but one layer of a deep neural networks for classification or search?

According to the paper " Return of the Devil in the Details: Delving Deep into Convolutional Networks " the last but one layer in a deep neural network trained on a very large dataset can be used as semantic representations of objects in the same domain but from different smaller datasets. I was wondering if someone has experience with using the last but one layer as features for search or classification tasks.
