UML Modeling - Does it become voodoo science in practice at some point?

I am looking for insight on modeling. I had a intro course on Design Patterns and basic class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use cases. The class diagrams I have found invaluable as a tool of organization in my programming. The use cases are moderately useful so far. This semester I am in a class going into UML in much more depth i.e. Domain Analysis, Requirements Analysis, Software Design vs. Software Engineering etc. There is a certain feeling that this is starting to be more voodoo-sciencey or non-concrete when we start trying to be precise with the ambiguities in scenarios, and changing requirements. Is UML past basic class diagrams and use-case diagrams practically useful in productivity in most applications?
