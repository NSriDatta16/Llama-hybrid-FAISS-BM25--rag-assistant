Creative commons zero is what I've seen recommended for open data. Here's the FAQ page , and here's a list of organizations that use it. . Here's a third-party advocating its use . cc0 essentially puts your data into the public domain. Compared with the GPL or CC-share-alike, it gives your users more freedom, especially if they're working with hundreds of data sets with conflicting licenses for a meta-analysis or something. For instance, with cc0, if they augment your data set in some way (e.g. by combining it with their own data), they don't have to share. If you'd object to them holding on to the modified data, then you want a different license. But if you don't, then cc0 will make everyone else's life easier.
