Yes, it's doable. Shift your dynamic needs out of memory and onto disk (or whatever mass storage you have available) -- and suffer the consequent performance penalty. E.g., You need to build and reference a binary tree of unknown size. Specify a record layout describing a node of the tree, where pointers to other nodes are actually record numbers in your tree file. Write routines that let you add to the tree by writing an additional record to file, and walk the tree by reading a record, finding its child as another record number, reading that record, etc. This technique allocates space dynamically, but it's disk space, not RAM space. All the routines involved can be written using statically allocated space -- on the stack.
