A couple of thoughts. 1) Do you have the autogenerated tag in your file header (comments at the top of the file), like this: // // This file is auto-generated... // This tag is important (the contents are not), as some tools will skip such files (e.g. StyleCop can be configured to ignore these files). 2) If you are autogenerating code why not autogenerate at least some XML comments? I can understand that you don't want to spend a lot of time documenting code that probably won't ever be read, but when debugging code I often find myself dropping in to some autogenerated proxy and even a simple comment can be helpful, even if it just says "autogenerated code" :) Edit 3) You can also suppress warnings by adding the pragmas to the build options (right click on the project, choose properties, choose the Build tab). This is more convenient than adding to code. Try adding 1591;1574;1587 to the Suppress Warnings box. 4) You could go in to the Code Analysis tab in the Project Properties and uncheck "Treat Warning as Error" for specific warnings that are causing you problems. Obviously both these are global settings, they don't just pick on the autogenerated files.
