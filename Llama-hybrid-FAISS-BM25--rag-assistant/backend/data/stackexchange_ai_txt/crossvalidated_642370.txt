I'd like to add that if the goal of this correlation analysis is feature selection in a machine learning context, I'd suggest looking at mutual information. From scikit-learn's mutual_info_classif link : Mutual information (MI) between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency. For two random variables, you should use mutual_info_score link
