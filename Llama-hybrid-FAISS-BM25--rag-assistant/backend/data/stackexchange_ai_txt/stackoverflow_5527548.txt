Using Quartz in a clustered environment

I'm looking to use the quartz scheduler in my application because I have a clustered environment and want to guarantee that only one instance of my job runs each hour. My question is...Do I have to use a JDBC job store or some sort of "outside" storage of job data to guarantee that only once instance in my cluster runs the job at any given hour or is there more magic to Quartz that I am aware of?
