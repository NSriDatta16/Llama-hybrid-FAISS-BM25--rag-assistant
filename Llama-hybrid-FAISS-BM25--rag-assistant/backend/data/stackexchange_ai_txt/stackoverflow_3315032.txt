As I understand it the "autocache" issue with imageNamed is that once you open an image with UIImage::imageNamed, it's cached by the system and never released. That's why Apple encourages usage of UIImage::imageWithContentsOfFile instead for images that are used occasionally. For images that are used very often in the UI, imageNamed is OK. Your instance, while you retain it, will not be unloaded.
