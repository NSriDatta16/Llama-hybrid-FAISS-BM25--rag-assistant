Predict probabilities from Firth logistic regression in R

I'm using the logistf package in R to perform Firth logistic regression on an unbalanced dataset. I have a logistf object: fit = logistf(a~b) Is there a predict() function like on that's used in the lm class to predict probabilities for future data points? Or do I have to manually input the estimated parameters from the Firth regression.
