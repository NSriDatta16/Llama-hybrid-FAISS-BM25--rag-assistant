I had a similar problem. I had to modify a method in a class file with no source. The method was rethrowing the exceptions badly so I had to tweak it. I have decompiled the class with Classfile Analyzer (http://classfileanalyzer.javaseiten.de/) I have edited then the resulted file and recompiled it with Jasmine assembler. Using Apache BCEL you can accomplish the same thing but in a more elegant way - at runtime - not as I have described above at compile time.
