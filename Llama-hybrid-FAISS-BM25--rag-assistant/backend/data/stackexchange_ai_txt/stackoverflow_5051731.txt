No. Nothing in this stops meta redirects, or timeouts or intervals already in flight, and it does nothing about same origin iframe s (or ones that can become same origin via document.domain ) that can reach back into the parent page to redynamize content. EDIT: The sheer number of ways scripts can stay submerged to pop up later is large, so unless you control all the code that can run before you want to do this, I would be inclined to say that it's impossible in practice to lock this down unless you have a team including some browser implementors working on this for some time. Other possible sources of submarine scripts : XMLHttpRequest s (and their onreadystatechange handlers), flash objects that canscript , web workers, and embedding code to run in things like Object.prototype.toString .
