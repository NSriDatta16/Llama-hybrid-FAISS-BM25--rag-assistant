The problem with Webstart is, that you actually have to 'start' something which isn't at all that fast even with a fast connection, while with a webapp you enter the URL and the app is there. Also a lot of things can go wrong with webstart. Maybe the intended user doesn't have the privileges needed, or the proxy of webstart is configured wrong, or something went wrong with jre dependencies or there is simply no java installed in the first place. So for the average john doe in the internet it is not at all pleasent. In controlled environments like a company it is a good and easy solution in many cases.
