Accessing controls for page layout in code behind

I am developing a publishing portal in SharePoint. The page layouts, master pages are designed using Visual Studio and I deploy the page layouts into the content database using wspbuilder. I have a requirement wherein I have to access the controls of the page layout in code behind and assign or get values to/from the controls. But, the VS intellisense never shows the controls used in my page layout. What should I do in order to access the controls using code behind? Is there any workaround for this? Regards, Raghuraman.V
