How can I "override" [] to accept two arguments in C++?

I am trying to create a bit-vector class in C++ to model some hardware. In most HDLs (hardware description langauges) that I know, specific bits are referenced like this: my_vector[bit_position] and sub-vectors are referenced like this: my_vector[msb:lsb] or my_vector[msb,lsb] I want to be able to do something similar with my bit-vector class. Is there any way to tell operator[] to accept two arguments? The alternatives I've considered are: using a range method: my_vector.range(msb,lsb) using a string and parsing it: my_vector["msb:lsb"] But neither of them is attractive. The first, because it is too different from the way it's modeled in HDL, the second because I don't like dealing with strings when I don't have to, and it seems inelegant. What's the best way to do this?
