Why does the best model in the training set have the worst test result?

I have trained eight models using 10-fold cross-validation, and evaluated the models by using resampling technique as described here . The result shows that SVM with sigmoid kernel (SVM-s) and random forest (RF) are the best models, while penalised regressions had the lowest performance: However, when I predicted the target variable by using the test set, the ROC curves showed very different ranking of model performance. The SVM model turned out to have the lowest AUC, and the penalised regressions had outperformed naive Bayes, neural network and CART. AUC: Lasso, RF, Elastic net, Ridge: 0.75; Naive Bayes, neural network: 0.70; Classification tree, SVM: 0.65. Are there any good explanations for almost opposite model performance?
