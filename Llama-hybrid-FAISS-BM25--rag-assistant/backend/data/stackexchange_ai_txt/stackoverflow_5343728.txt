Unfortunantly the error was all on my part. While I did have an error withiin my CSS file regarding the use of the position attribute within my styles. below is the updated style: .resultController { position:static; width:90%; border: 1px solid #7C90BE; margin:5px; } .resultImage { display:table-cell; color:Green; height:36px; width:36px; } .resultContext { display:table-cell; padding:3px; left:50px; color:Red; } .resultButtons { top:5px; } The larger problem (all my fault) was the browser was not purging teh cache on close. After dumping the cache and reloading the page the styles began to render correctly. Thanks to all for taking the time to look at this and offer your input.
