Considering you're comfortable with the idea of making subjective assumptions, and it's not a model that will determine if someone lives or dies, I would suggest a Bayesian model might be a good option. This would allow you to state your assumptions explicitly and visualize them in a graph, so it can be audited and interpreted in a fairly straightforward way, and still yields quantitative outputs.
