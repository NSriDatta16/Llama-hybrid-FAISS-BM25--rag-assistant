Using Page.IsPostback Within a User Control Wrapped in an Update Panel

I have a main page into which i load a user control with a grid and add/edit link buttons. If I bind the grid by setting the datasource and calling the databind() method in the page load event then it sets properly. However, I want to keep the selected row between postbacks, so I wrap the bind code in "if (!Page.IsPostBack) {}" as usual. My problem is the page load always registers it as a postback and my code never runs. I am using the 2.0 framework, and my grid is an 2008.1 Infragistics for the 2.0 framework. I thinking this must be something simple.... or hoping anyway! Thanks in advance
