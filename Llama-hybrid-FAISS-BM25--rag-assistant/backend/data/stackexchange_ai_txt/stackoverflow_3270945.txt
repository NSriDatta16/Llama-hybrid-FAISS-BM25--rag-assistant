Spring and Mixing SQL and NoSQL db

The answers to my previous post encouraged me mixing SQL and NoSQL db. What is the best practice implementation of two databases in terms of application context configuration and DAO creation? Let's choose Derby as the SQL db and Cassandra as the other one. What I am searching for is e.g. an example appcontext.xml, two DAOs, one implementing CRUD on Derby and the other one ond Cassandra and one (not two) sample unit test using both DAOs simultanously. Tutorials, sample (maven ;-) ) projects, book recommenditions etc. welcome.
