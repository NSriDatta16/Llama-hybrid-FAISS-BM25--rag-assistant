I also had the same problem. Then I came up with this solution, and it is working fine for me. When you call the camera activity, in EXTRA_OUTPUT pass an Uri of a temp file on the storage card. When the camera activity come back, in the onActivityResult() callback method, get that temp file created previously, and add it to the MediaStore. At the end delete the temp file.
