This can be worked out directly. We seek to find $P$ such that if sample variance is defined as $$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{P} \sum^M_{i=1} (x_i - \frac{1}{N}\sum^{N}_{i=1} x_i)^2 $$ with $N \geq M$ then $$E(\hat{\sigma}^2) = Var(X)$$ Answer : after some working out, what I get is that you should choose $P$ as $$P = M \cdot \frac{N-1}{N}$$ For $M = N$ , this is $N - 1$ as expected, and for $N = 100$ , $M=50$ , this is $49.5$ (nicely equal to the average of the cases with 0 and 1 missing degrees of freedom).
