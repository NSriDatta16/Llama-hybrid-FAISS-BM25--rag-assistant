Help interpreting count data GLMM using lme4 glmer and glmer.nb - Negative binomial versus Poisson

I have some questions regarding specification and interpretation of GLMMs. 3 questions are definitely statistical and 2 are more specifically about R. I am posting here because ultimately I think the issue is interpretation of GLMM results. I am currently trying to fit a GLMM. I'm using US census data from the Longitudinal Tract Database . My observations are census tracts. My dependent variable is the number of vacant housing units and I'm interested in the relationship between vacancy and socio-economic variables. The example here is simple, just using two fixed effects: percent non-white population (race) and median household income (class), plus their interaction. I would like to include two nested random effects: tracts within decades and decades, i.e. (decade/tract). I am considering these random in an effort to control for spatial (i.e. between tracts) and temporal (i.e. between decades) autocorrelation. However, I am interested in decade as a fixed effect also, so I am including it as a fixed factor also. Since my independent variable is a non-negative integer count variable, I've been trying to fit poisson and negative binomial GLMMs. I am using the log of total housing units as an offset. This means coefficients are interpreted as the effect on vacancy rate, not total number of vacant houses. I currently have results for a Poisson and a negative binomial GLMM estimated using glmer and glmer.nb from lme4 . The interpretation of coefficients makes sense to me based on my knowledge of the data and study area. If you want the data and script they are on my Github . The script includes more of the descriptive investigations I did before building the models.

I have some questions: It appears my data do not support using a Poisson model and therefore I am better off with negative binomial. However, I consistently get warnings that my negative binomial models reach their iteration limit, even when I increase the maximum limit. "In theta.ml(Y, mu, weights = object@resp$weights, limit = limit, : iteration limit reached." This happens using quite a few different specifications (i.e. minimial and maximal models for both fixed and random effects). I have also tried removing outliers in my dependent (gross, I know!), since the top 1% of values are very much outliers (bottom 99% range from 0-1012, top 1% from 1013-5213). That didn't have any effect on iterations and very little effect on coefficients either. I don't include those details here. Coefficients between Poisson and negative binomial are also pretty similar. Is this lack of convergence a problem? Is the negative binomial model a good fit? I have also run the negative binomial model using AllFit and not all optimizers throw this warning (bobyqa, Nelder Mead, and nlminbw did not). The variance for my decade fixed effect is consistently very low or 0. I understand this could mean the model is overfit. Taking decade out of the fixed effects does increase the decade random effect variance to 0.2620 and doesn't have much of an effect on fixed effect coefficients. Is there anything wrong with leaving it in? I am fine interpreting it as simply not being needed to explain between observation variance. Do these results indicate I should try zero-inflated models? DHARMa seems to suggest zero-inflation may not be the issue. If you think I should try anyway, see below. R questions I would be willing to try zero-inflated models, but I am not sure which package impliments nested random effects for zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial GLMMs. I would use glmmADMB to compare AIC with zero-inflated models, but it is restricted to a single random effect so doesn't work for this model. I could try MCMCglmm, but I do not know Bayesian statistics so that is also not attractive. Any other options? Can I display exponentiated coefficients within summary(model), or do I have to do it outside summary as I've done here?
