Cross validation accuray assessment

I'm using SVM for clssification of remotely sensed data. I have training samples of 1000. I randomly divided the set into test and validation set and performed cross vlidation. Am I following the correct way of accuracy assessment or should I use ground truth data for test and validation set? But I have very less number of ground truth data of aroud 40 sample points. Could any one help me on this?
