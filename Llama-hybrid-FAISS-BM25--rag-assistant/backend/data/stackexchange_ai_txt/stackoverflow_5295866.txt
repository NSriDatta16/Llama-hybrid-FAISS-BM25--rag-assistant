how to divide an integer array into 2 sub-arrays and make their averages equal?

Please help me with the above question. An algorithm with a working example will be appreciated. Also, please handle the case when the above is not possible. Okay, what I have till now is the following: Go through entire array and get average of whole array. O(n). Let us call this avg Then from this average can get the average of the whole array except a[0] (the formula is: avg(a[1..n-1])=(avg(a[0..n-1])*n-a[0])/(n-1) ). Then you take this new average and compare it with a[0]. If they are not equal you move to the next value calculating the averages from the previously know averages using the formula from above. Though someone has provided me a solution that "works", I am looking for the most efficient implementation.
