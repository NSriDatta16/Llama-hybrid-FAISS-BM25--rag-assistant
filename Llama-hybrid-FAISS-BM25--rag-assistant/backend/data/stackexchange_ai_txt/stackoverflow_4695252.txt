As long as each instance of memcpy believes it is writing into only its part of the buffer, it is completely safe. Array allocations of any form in C++ are very low-level; it is a contiguous block of storage allocated at the appropriate size for the program, and the array as an object that exists as anything other than a pointer is simply an illusion. Give memcpy non-overlapping ranges of the array, and it has no way of knowing that they aren't simply two completely separate arrays that just happen to be adjacent to each other. The writes won't interfere.
