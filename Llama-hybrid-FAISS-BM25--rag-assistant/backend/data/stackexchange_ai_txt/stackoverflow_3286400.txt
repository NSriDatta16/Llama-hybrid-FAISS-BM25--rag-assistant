I don't think there's a JAX-RS specific way to do what you want. The closest would be to do: @Path("/something/") class MyResource { @Context javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers providers; @GET public Response get() { ContextResolver resolver = providers.getContextResolver(StorageEngine.class, MediaType.WILDCARD_TYPE); StorageEngine engine = resolver.get(StorageEngine.class); ... } } However, I think the @javax.ws.rs.core.Context annotation and javax.ws.rs.ext.ContextResolver is really for types related to JAX-RS and supporting JAX-RS providers. You may want to look for Java Context and Dependency Injection (JSR-299) implementations (which should be available in Java EE 6) or other dependency injection frameworks such as Google Guice to help you here.
