SPSS Chi square of one sample test

I am trying to analyze the following data: participants chose over 18 trials whether they would like option 1 or option 2. Option 1 is recoded as 0, option 2 is recoded as 1. Now if I count all answers across 24 trials I for instance get '14', which means that in 14 cases they chose option 2 and in 4 cases option 1. Wilcoxon median test lets me compare with the hypothesized median 9, so far so good. I have three groups (within subjects, three phases to the experiment). Now I need to know if the difference between the groups is significantly different from 0. So I create Group2-group1 and want to compare it to 0. and Group 3-group2 and compare it to 0. My advisor says to use chi square for this, but I cant find the correct way in SPSS. via non paramatric tests one sample it counts frequencies, not compares averages. via one sample non parametric test I can't insert '0' for some reason as test value. Any ideas? my data is structured as follows P1 GR1_X1 GR1_X2 GR2_X1 GR2_X2 GR3_X1 GR3_X2 SDB 0 1 0 0 0 0 tyc 1 0 0 1 1 0 .. and so forth. I created group scores but don't know how to continue.. I know I can't use a normal t-test because the data is binomial and not normally distributed.
