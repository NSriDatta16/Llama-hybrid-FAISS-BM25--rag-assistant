Why do you think that ordinal logistic regression isn't appropriate for your setup? It seems to fit your description quite well. Often, it doesn't really matter whether your predictors are categorical or continuous variables, especially if we are dealing with binary variables as it's the case here. If your variables are non-binary, it can get a bit tricky to code them appropriately. Anyway, there shouldn't be a problem to run an olr on categorical variables. Your 1to10-Score dependent variable should fit olr quite well to. As you noted, it is not a continuous but discrete, ordinal variable.
