I have a funny story to tell here. I was working on this Javaish application, filled with getters & setters that did nothing but get or set and interfaces and everything ever invented to make code unreadable. One day I stumbled upon some code which seemed very well crafted -- it was basically an algorithm implementation that looked very elegant = few lines of readable code, even though it respected every possible rule the project had to adhere to (it was checkstyled automatically). I couldn't figure out who on the team could have written such code. I was dying to discuss with him and share thoughts. Thankfully, we had switched to subversion (from cvs) a few months earlier and I quickly ran am 'svn blame'. I loled all over the place, seeing my name next to the implementation. I had heard stories about people not remembering code they wrote 6 months back, code that is a nightmare to maintain. I could not believe such a thing could happen: how can you forget code you wrote? Well, now I'm convinced it can happen. Thankfully the code was alright and easy to extend, so I've only experienced half of the story.
