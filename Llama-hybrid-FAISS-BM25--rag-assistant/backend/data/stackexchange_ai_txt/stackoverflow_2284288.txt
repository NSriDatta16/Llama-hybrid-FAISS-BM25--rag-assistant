First, most modern neural networks aren't really modeled after biological synapses. They use an Artificial Neuron which allowed Back Propagation to work rather than a Perceptron which is a much more accurate representation. When you feed the output of one network into the input of another network, you've really just created one larger network, not two separate networks. It just happens that in this case portions of the networks would be trained independently. That said, all neural networks have to be trained. Which means you need sample input and sample output. You are looking to create a decision engine of sorts I suppose. So you would need to create a dataset where it makes sense that there might be an emotional and rational response, such as purchasing an item. You'd have to train the 'rational' network to accept as a set of inputs the output of an 'emotional' network. Which means you are really just training the rational decision engine to be responsive based on the leve of 'distress' caused by the emotional network. Just my two cents.
