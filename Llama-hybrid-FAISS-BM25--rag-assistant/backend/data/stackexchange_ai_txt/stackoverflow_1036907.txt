Do yo know of a more dynamic grid for Labels + TextBoxes data entry layouts?

My LOB app has loads of screens that have columns of labels and textboxes, side-by-side. I'm wanting to achive something in-between what a Grid and a WrapPanel layout - where when the Page/Window is wide enough, the label + textbox pairs re-organize into multiple columns. Imagine: Narrow Window Layou: Label | TextBox Looooong Label | TextBox Label | TextBox Label | TextBox Broad Window Layout: Label | TextBox | Looooong Label | TextBox Label | TextBox | Label | TextBox Using a Grid is easy enough, since the label columns width can be "Auto"... but then it's hard to dynamically set the number of columns as the window width increases / decreases, since it nescessitates a style on every label/textbox. Using a WrapPanel achieves the multi-column effect, but then each Label's width is different. I would prefer a solution that doesn't involve restricting all of the label's Width properties through styling or binding. Do you know of an elegant solution to this problem, or have you come across any open-source/3rd party panel controls which specifically offer this? I respect the Stack-Overflow community and will definately up-vote any reasonable suggestions.
