What benchmarks/baselines do you know in the topic of forecasting non-linear chaotic systems?

I would like to know what established benchmarks/baselines are in use to predict (forecast) chaotic series when we treat those as time-series problems: "Datasets" (=equations) (e.g. logistic map, Lorenz attractor equations) Evaluation methods (MAE, MSE) Models to compare myself to As I saw in the machine learning and deep learning world, the publications do not compare their models to other methods so, it is really hard to see improvements overt time. Maybe I am missing something, and this is what I would like to learn about.
