If you collect ratings for a single feature lets say FeatureX and place in a column lets say FCOLX then you can: Use the built in Mysql AVG() function Fetch all values and calculate the average in the php script. Calculating an average usually goes like this: $myRatings = $dbHandler->fetch(); //generic fetch $totalRatings = count($myRatings); $sum = 0; foreach($myRatings as $index=>$rating){ $sum+=$rating['FCOLX']; //where FCOLX is the column where you have the user rating [1-10]; } $average = 0; if($totalRatings>0){ $average = $sum/$totalRatings; } The resulting average will be for the scale of 1-10 that you use.
