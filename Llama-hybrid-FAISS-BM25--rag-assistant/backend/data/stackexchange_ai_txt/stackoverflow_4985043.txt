How can I create Linq To SQL Classes with the VS designer when using a Connection String

As you may have seen from my previous posts I'm starting to teach myself MVC and C# as it's time for me to move from being a designer to a developer. I've been told not to use the Server Explorer in Visual Studio but just connect to my database with a connection string in the web.config. I've done this but obviously the LINQ to SQL Designer in Visual Studio doesn't seem to know or recognise my database connection and I can't just drag onto the designer to make the classes. Must I create these manually or am I missing something? Any ideas are appreicated. Cheers Mark
