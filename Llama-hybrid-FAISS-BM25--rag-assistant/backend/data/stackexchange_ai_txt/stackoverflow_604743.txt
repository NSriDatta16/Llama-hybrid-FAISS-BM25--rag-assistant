How to get a category listing from Magento?

I want to create a page in Magento that shows a visual representation of the categories.. example CATEGORY product 1 product 2 ANOTHER CATEGORY product 3 My problem is, their database is organised very differently to what I've seen in the past. They have tables dedicated to data types like varchar, int, etc. I assume this is for performance or similar. I haven't found a way to use MySQL to query the database and get a list of categories. I'd then like to match these categories to products, to get a listing of products for each category. Unfortunately Magento seems to make this very difficult. Also I have not found a method that will work from within a page block.. I have created showcase.phtml and put it in the XML layout and it displays and runs its PHP code. I was hoping for something easy like looping through $this->getAllCategories() and then a nested loop inside with something like $category->getChildProducts() . Can anyone help me?
