How to deal with discrete and continuous output multi variables in neural network?

I have created neural networks using nnet for either discreate or continous output variables, but not using both at once. Now I have a problem in which the output contains both discrete and continuous variables, like this: Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 0.3821665898 1.2883648663 X E 1 0.6514063927 0.5815594038 Y B 10 0.2811264971 0.5610311362 X D 4 0.4887534697 1.1842930657 X A 5 0.5851027465 0.6844661487 Y B 11 0.8273730366 1.0426096583 X C 6 0.9663713202 1.2532121355 X D 7 0.5929174765 1.4039754421 Y E 5 0.8357351425 1.1997673572 Y C 4 where Y1 and Y2 are continuous output variable and Y3 - Y5 are discrete variables. Can I use discrete and continuous variable together as an output to train a neural network using nnet ? If we come across discrete variables in features we could transform them into a continuous form, like this: X1 A B C A 1 0 0 B 0 1 0 C 0 0 1 A 1 0 0 C 0 0 1 C 0 0 1 where X1 is the real feature and A , B , and C are transformed columns. Do we need to do such transformation in output variables also? What should else I looking for when doing such kind of neural network training?
