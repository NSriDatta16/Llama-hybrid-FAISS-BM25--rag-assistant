So far, I had a great experience with the community wiki and documentation of Jboss, and it pretty much covers everything. Though, I found quite obvious configuration settings left out in their latest documentations, but I guess this must have been improved since then. For ActiveMQ, I found very little documentation comparing to Jboss. I have done certain research using MOM with Jboss and GlassFish, but one of the most important impact was the permanent storage if you are going to use any. I think this itself is very important, especially their compatibility, support, documentations. Take a look at this. Apparently there are certain concern when it comes to persistent storage in ActiveMQ. http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/jbossmessaging/freezone/docs/userguide-2.0.0.alpha1/html/performance.html#performance.results
