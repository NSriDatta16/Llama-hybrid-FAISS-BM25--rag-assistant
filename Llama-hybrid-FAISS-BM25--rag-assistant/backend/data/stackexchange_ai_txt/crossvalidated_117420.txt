Pattern recognition with time series analysis

I'm looking for some good pointers to pattern recognition with time series. Possibly something practical that can be easily understood. As a toy example, think about collecting data from an accelerometer of a phone. Different types of motion (running, sitting, falling down, etc..) may correspond to different patterns. This is just an example, and I'm looking for some feasible solutions in the domains of time series. Of course, if there are methods not based on time series, I'm open also.
