Magento doesn't have (that I know of) a competent way to export product attributes with large value lists. If the second machine is a fresh install of Magento (or you don't mind editing a little SQL), I'd offer that you should just dump the database tables for eav_attributes and copy it into the new database. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
