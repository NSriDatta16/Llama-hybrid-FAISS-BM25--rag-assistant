Basically enCapsa is a shared data storage system, focused on providing a way for storing any kind of data (even from etherogeneous data sources such as different designed db tables) and consequently obtain it through a sort of human friendly queries, just like on a search engine. They offer the possibility to upload data from everywhere (it's CSV based) and later download to use wherever you need it. Usages are many, consider it's a centralized DB accessible through web and they say it meets high security standard. A usefull way to employ this service is to have data stored in there without the need to keep them synchronized across company computers.
