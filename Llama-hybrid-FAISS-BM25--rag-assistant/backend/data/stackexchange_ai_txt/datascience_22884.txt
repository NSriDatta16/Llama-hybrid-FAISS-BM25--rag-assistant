Is it ok to use a dataset from public API for Final Year Project?

I am about to start a final year at my university and I want to do a Final Year Project based on Machine Learning. I would like to learn basics of Machine Learning by utilising sci-kit. My project may involve predicting prices for graphics cards depending either on sales of games or prices of bitcoin. I read this post and I understand that's generally illegal to get/scrap data from APIs without permission, but is it possible to get it and use it for 'fair-use' and 'non-profit' for my project? Thank you
