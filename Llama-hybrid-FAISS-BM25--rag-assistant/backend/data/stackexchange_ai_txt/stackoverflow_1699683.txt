Best way to manage projects

What is a best way to organize many software development projects, interaction with clients, project documentation, sources, emails, knowledge, time tracking, issue and features tracking, support for releases and versions etc. for a small company? For me (and I believe for many others) it is obvious that it must be some sort of web-based solutions. It would be great if it could provide an interface for iPhone (if not, it is also OK). Important thing: it must be hosted on our servers, so PHP + MySQL is the best platform so far. I have found the following system to consider: http://www.activecollab.com/ (but I didn't found issue tracking as well as support for releases and versions, so it is not the best match for software development company) http://www.mantisbt.org/ (Great tool, but no project planing...) http://www.twproject.com/ (didn't try yet, but it has very strange interface) But none of them is a 100% solution for me. It also should (but not must) support SCRUM We have about 25 people in our team and about 50 from client side. At once we run about 3-7 projects (some in dev. phase, some in support). So, my questions: does anybody knows any good web-based system that gives everything software development company needs? I believe this information will be useful for many of us.
