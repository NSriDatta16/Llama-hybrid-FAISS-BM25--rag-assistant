Somers' $D_{xy}$ since it conditions on $y$ is invariant to event prevalence (relative number of events; ratio of number of events to number of non-events). You need to have a real motivation for using percentiles of risk rather than using estimated absolute risk. Grouping continuous predictions is discouraged as some of the groups will be heterogeneous and there is information loss. Gold standard measures of predictive performance are all tied to the log likelihood (likelihood ratio $\chi^2$, deviance, pseudo $R^2$, etc.). But if you only care about rank ordering predictions then a rank correlation measure like Somers' is of value. Be careful when adjusting coefficients later to fit a new batch of data. If not done carefully this could represent tweaking and will overfit. But no matter what I cannot think of a reason for stratifying risk into quantile groups.
