Conjugate Prior for Probit likelihood function

I am trying to do a Bayesian analysis in which my likelihood function is a probit function on two parameters. From various sources, I found out that Normal distribution is a conjugate prior to probit likelihood, but I am not being able to compute the posterior from the functions. Here are the details of the problem Likelihood: $\Phi(\theta-\beta)$ Prior for $\beta$: $\phi(\beta-\mu_1)$ Prior for $\theta$: $\phi(\theta-\mu_2)$ Joint Posterior: $C\Phi(\theta-\beta)\phi(\beta-\mu_1)\phi(\theta-\mu_2)$ Now I want to get the marginal distributions from this joint posterior
