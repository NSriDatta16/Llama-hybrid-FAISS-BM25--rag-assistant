Is the outcome in your logistic regression a dichotomized version of the outcome in linear regression? There is no direct equivalent in logistic regression to the semipartial correlation. There can hardly be, when one type of model assesses linear relationships and the other assesses relationships via an S-curve. "Can I compare" -- I see that you have :-) Just be aware that Cohen freely admitted (insisted, when necessary) that these guidelines of his were rough and were not equally applicable to all situations. I think you would do best to seek substantive interpretations: describe the results from each regression -- semipartial correlation, odds ratio and not least the coefficient itself -- and try to interpret (and perhaps indirectly or informally compare) their meaning and their level of importance specifically for your context. You can also generate standardized regression coefficients (linear) or their rough equivalent (logistic). You might look up Scott Menard's online logistic regression book for info on that.
