I would like to build a Java Web Application. What's the quickest start?

I am a reasonably competent programmer, with about 11 years experience. I particularly like Ruby/Rails and ActionScript. And Java is easy enough, I've used it for ordinary applications, and mostly as ones that run on the server, just not web-based ones. I'd like to develop a web application in Java in order to leverage things like BlazeDS and help tie front-ends together with my previously-written Java apps. i.e. use existing Java code but in a web context. But I'm having trouble - and confused - looking for a smooth start. I don't want to use Grails, been there, thanks, I want to use Pure Java, with whatever Framework you can think of. Spring, Hibernate, etc. Where do I start?
