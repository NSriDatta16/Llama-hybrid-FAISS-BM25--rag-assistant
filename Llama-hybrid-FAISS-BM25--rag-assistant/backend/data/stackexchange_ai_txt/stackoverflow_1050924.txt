Sometimes the bug is not reproducible even in a pre-production environment that is the exact duplicate of the production environment. Concurrency issues are notorious for this. Random Failures Are Often Concurrency Issues Link: https://pragprog.com/tips/ The reason can be simply because of the Heisenberg effect, i.e. observation changes behaviour. Another reason can be because the chances are very small of hitting the combination of events that triggers the bug. Sometimes you are lucky and you have audit logs that you can playback, greatly increasing the chances of recreating the issue. You can also stress the environment with high volumes of transactions. This effectively compresses time so that if the bug occurs say once a week, you may be able to reliably reproduce it in 1 day if you stress the system to 7 X the production load. The last resort is whitebox testing where you go through the code line by line writing unit tests as you go.
