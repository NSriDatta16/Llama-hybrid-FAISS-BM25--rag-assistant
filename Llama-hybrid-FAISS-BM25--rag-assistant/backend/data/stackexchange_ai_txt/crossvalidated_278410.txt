Building a Diagnostic System for Psychiatric Disorders

I am an undergraduate with near-infinite passion to the theoretical machine learning and ML applications. Inspired from my challenging mental disorders, I am really interested in building a diagnostic system for the psychiatric disorders (with focus on thought-driven disorders) that could diagnose a patient with certain mental disorders, and even predict what he/she might have in future. I have a couple of questions: 1) Beside knowledge about the machine learning and implementation of its algorithms, what do I need to build diagnostic system? Do I need to study recommender system too? 2) As you might know, we do not have big data for psychiatric disorders due to different regulations for privacy of patients. Is there a technique in machine learning designed for dealing with "small data" (perhaps an ensemble learning like a random forest)? 3) Following from the question above, is there a technique that could create simulations of what patients' record might look like (i.e. create new but hypothesized datum about patients to build small data into big data)? 4) Is there a way to translate ordinal data into cardinal data? As you might know, the existing diagnostic methods for mental disorders are in ordinal form (i.e. your symptom is from 1-10)? Due to different diagnostic methods, I think learning by rank will not be useful... Thank you very much for your time, and I am sorry for this long post...
