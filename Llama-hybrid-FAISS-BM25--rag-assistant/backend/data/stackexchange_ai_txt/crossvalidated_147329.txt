How to represent kWh usage by year against average temperature?

Just for fun, I want to chart my monthly household power consumption year-over-year. However, I wish to include some reference to monthly temperature so I can determine if my home or behavior is improving, worsening, or holding steady in regards to kWh usage. The data I am working with: +----------+--------+-----------+----------------+----------+-----------+------------+ | Month | # Days | kWh Usage | Daily kWh Avg. | Avg. Low | Avg. High | Avg. Temp. | +----------+--------+-----------+----------------+----------+-----------+------------+ | Mar 2015 | 32 | 1048 | 33 | 40 | 60 | 50 | | Feb 2015 | 29 | 1156 | 40 | 32 | 54 | 43 | | Jan 2015 | 33 | 1143 | 35 | 38 | 57 | 47 | | Dec 2014 | 30 | 887 | 30 | 39 | 61 | 50 | | Nov 2014 | 29 | 645 | 22 | 45 | 67 | 56 | | Oct 2014 | 29 | 598 | 21 | 60 | 78 | 69 | | Sep 2014 | 32 | 893 | 28 | 70 | 85 | 77 | | Aug 2014 | 30 | 965 | 32 | 72 | 87 | 79 | | Jul 2014 | 29 | 784 | 27 | 72 | 87 | 79 | | Jun 2014 | 32 | 1018 | 32 | 69 | 87 | 78 | | May 2014 | 30 | 702 | 23 | 63 | 82 | 72 | | Apr 2014 | 33 | 722 | 22 | 50 | 71 | 60 | | Mar 2014 | 29 | 830 | 29 | 41 | 62 | 52 | | Feb 2014 | 28 | 1197 | 43 | 32 | 52 | 42 | | Jan 2014 | 33 | 1100 | 33 | 38 | 59 | 49 | | Dec 2013 | 30 | 856 | 29 | 40 | 63 | 51 | | Nov 2013 | 33 | 686 | 21 | 48 | 70 | 59 | | Oct 2013 | 30 | 527 | 18 | 61 | 77 | 69 | | Sep 2013 | 30 | 817 | 27 | 69 | 86 | 77 | | Aug 2013 | 28 | 991 | 35 | 72 | 86 | 79 | | Jul 2013 | 31 | 993 | 32 | 73 | 86 | 79 | | Jun 2013 | 30 | 847 | 28 | 66 | 83 | 74 | | May 2013 | 29 | 605 | 21 | 59 | 76 | 67 | | Apr 2013 | 34 | 791 | 23 | 47 | 66 | 57 | +----------+--------+-----------+----------------+----------+-----------+------------+ I started with a column chart easily comparing month-to-month values: I envisioned a nice background area or line graph mapped to a secondary (right) vertical axis showing the high/low ranges but realized that would be problematic with the multi-year groupings. It would be easy with one single year: I am curious to know if anyone can recommend a way of combining all the yearly data into a single chart with temperature comparisons? Is there some ratio I could use that could effectively relate the kWh usage to average temperature... or some other display technique I am overlooking... or am I stuck with one chart per year?
