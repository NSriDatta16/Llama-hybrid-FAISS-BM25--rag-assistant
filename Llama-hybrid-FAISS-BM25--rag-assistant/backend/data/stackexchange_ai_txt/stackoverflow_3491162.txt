Using ActionMailer in a Rails Plugin

I'm trying to create my first Rails plugin and am having some troubles leveraging ActionMailer in it. The plugin just collects user feedback and emails it off a given address so in terms of functionality it's not too complicated... All the functionality was working perfectly in my original application until I decided to pluginise this stuff. I've been following the railsguide on creating a plugin as much as possible and you can find my entire plugin's source here: http://github.com/gshankar/rocket_feedback Though I'm pretty sure the problem is in one of these files: 1- The file that loads everything in: rocket_feedback/lib/rocket_feedback.rb require 'rocket_feedback/routing' require 'action_mailer' %w{ models controllers }.each do |dir| path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'app', dir) $LOAD_PATH 2- The controller which calls the deliver_feedback method rocket_feedback/lib/app/controllers/rocket_feedback_controller.rb class RocketFeedbackController ''} end end end 3- The model (which inherits from ActionMailer) class RocketFeedback The only clue I have is this error message when I try and send feedback via the plugin: NoMethodError (undefined method `deliver_feedback' for RocketFeedback:Module): Thanks in advance for you help! (And please feel free to critque my plugin's structure, it's my first attempt so I'm sure I've done all kinds of things wrong...)
