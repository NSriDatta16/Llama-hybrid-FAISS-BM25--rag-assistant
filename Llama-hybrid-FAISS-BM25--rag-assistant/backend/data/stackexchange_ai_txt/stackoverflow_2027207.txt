You can work on that issue on two fronts. One is internal. Switching to the approach which expects many changes in requirements all over the time should reduce your (and your team's) frustration a bit. Now you're trying to fill the work 3 weeks ahead. Some teams work with Scrum using 1-week iterations which make planning more frequent (weekly) but also reduces chance that something will change during iteration. You can even go further and try Kanban, where you change priorities all over the time and still from engineer point of view that's more of an order than a chaos. Another thing is working with business people. It they really don't care they're burning money it can be hard, but even then you can try to set up some techniques which isolate their ever-changing decision from the team (e.g. making change management pretty formal or engaging them to organize priorities of whole backlog every time you plan work for another period of time).
