Number of parameters in a Markov chain

I was reading the book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop, which stated that for the first order Markov chain with K states, the number of parameters is K(K-1). Why is that? I think it should have been just K-1, because if we have $p(x_n|x_{n-1})$ for n=2 to K that will only be K-1, correct?
