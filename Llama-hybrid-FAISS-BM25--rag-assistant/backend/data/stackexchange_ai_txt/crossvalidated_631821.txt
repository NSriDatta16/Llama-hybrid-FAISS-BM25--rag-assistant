Looking for books and/or other resources for Multivariate Statistics for Optimal Estimation

I was trying to familiarize myself with state estimation theory by going through Optimal State Estimation and I realized I don't have the required background in Multiple Random Variables and Multivariate Stats. But all books on these topics I can find seem to be geared towards experiment design or economics or biology. I obviously don't fully understand the significance of most of these topics but I've looked into it enough to understand that *NOVA analyses or hypothesis testing isn't quite what I need?- Please correct me if I'm wrong. These are the topics I believe I'm looking for: Multivariate Distributions- mostly Gaussians Covariance and Correlation Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis Multivariate Time Series Covariance Modelling Are there any books on Multivariable Statistics with these topics (ideally for self-study) that are geared towards Engineering applications? My background is in Engineering. I know what a normal distribution is, what random vectors are and am familiar with linear algebra.
