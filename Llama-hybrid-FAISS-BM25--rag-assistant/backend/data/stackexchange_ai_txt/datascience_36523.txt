As the great Tom Mitchell has said in his book "Machine Learning is the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Machine learning algorithms are widely employed and are encountered daily. Examples are automatic recommendations when buying a product or voice recognition software that adapts to your voice. AI is any technology that enables a system to demonstrate human-like intelligence. "If we plug several photos of cats doing different things or in different places into a computer, but all the photos are still tagged as cats, then the computer will learn from each photo it is shown,” said Kamelia Aryafar, Ph.D., director of machine learning at Overstock . “Eventually, it will recognize that the cat is the common denominator in each set of data, in turn helping the computer learn to identify cats.” When a machine can tell the difference between objects and make a choice to discard or accept them, based on understood criteria, AI is born. In fact, any time a decision is being made by a machine, that is artificial intelligence and has gone beyond mere machine learning.
