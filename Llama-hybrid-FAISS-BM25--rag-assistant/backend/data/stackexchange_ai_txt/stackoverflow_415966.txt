Am failing to transform xml to SOAP

I'm having a problem calling a webservice from Mule using Axis. I've created a fairly simple example where I have xml in a file being read by Mule, it's then transformed into a Document and sent to the webservice. The relevant code in the mule config looks like this: However the call for the webservice fails as the above config is generating a SOAP message with an tag just after the tag and closes it just before the tag. The generated SOAP message looks like this: POST /holidayService?method=echoXXXX HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml X-MULE_ENDPOINT: http://localhost:8081/holidayService?method=echoXXXX SOAPAction: http://localhost:8081/holidayService?method=echoXXXX directory: D:\bea\weblogic92\samples\domains\wl_server\files\processed filename: HolidayRequest.xml method: echoXXXX originalFilename: HolidayRequest.xml style: document use: literal User-Agent: Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8081 Content-Length: 1183 D:\bea\weblogic92\samples\domains\wl_server\files\processed\HolidayRequest.xml -1 -1 2009-08-13 1988-12-12 3434 John Smith The webservice works fine in SOAPUI without the tag and from what I've read on the Mule website I don't know why it's being inserted.
