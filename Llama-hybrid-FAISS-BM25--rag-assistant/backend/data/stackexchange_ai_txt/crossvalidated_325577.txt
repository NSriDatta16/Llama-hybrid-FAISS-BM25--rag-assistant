How can I identify duplicate images using CNN?

I am working for a property portal and in our portal customers post several images with watermark and duplicity. I have created a CNN that can detect good images and watermark, but I am unsure how can I train my model to detect duplicate images? For example, if a customer posts 2 hall, 2 bedroom, 2 kitchen, how can I make my model to detect duplicate images so that I can take further action upon it like deletion from webpage.
