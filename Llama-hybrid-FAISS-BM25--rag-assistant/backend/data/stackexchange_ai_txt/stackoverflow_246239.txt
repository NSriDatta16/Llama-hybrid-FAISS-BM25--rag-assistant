A regular expression can only match a fragment of text that actually exists. Because the substring 'ton' doesn't exist anywhere in your string, it can't be the result of a match. A match will only return a substring of the original string EDIT: To be clear, if you were using the string below, with an extra 'n' toooooooonoooooon this regular expression (which doesn't specify 'o's) t.*n would match the following (as many characters as possible before an 'n') toooooooonoooooon but the regular expression t.*?n would only match the following (as few characters as possible before an 'n') toooooooon
