If you complete your pattern-matchings with a constructor [] and not the catch-all _ , the compiler will have a chance to tell you to look again at the function with a warning the day someone adds a third constructor to lists. My colleagues and I, working on a large OCaml project (200,000+ lines), force ourselves to avoid partial pattern-matching warnings (even if that means writing | ... -> assert false from time to time) and to avoid so-called " fragile pattern-matchings " (pattern matchings written in such a way that the addition of a constructor may not be detected) too. We consider that the maintainability benefits.
