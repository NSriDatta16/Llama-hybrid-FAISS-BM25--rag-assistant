I have realized that at a higher level the issue isn't so much to address error as it is to minimize the spread relative to the mean. One measure of spread is the standard deviation, so this works out to be the coefficient of variation . Ultimately, your organization would really like a lower mean cost for members and you'd like more certainty (less spread) around the expected cost (which isn't the actual, realized cost). There are three ways to look at this: A good modeler will reduce the CV by reducing the SD A bad modeler will reduce the CV by increasing the mean ("just to be safe") A good negotiator will reduce the mean and, hopefully, the SD. This may reduce the CV, but a good negotiator might just say that having some bands (and penalties for exceeding those bands) for the expected costs is an adequate compromise for reducing the mean. We could help you reduce CV through models (not to be confused with the "CV" of this site, by the way ;-)), but it would be better to negotiate this in such a way that you reduce the costs and the uncertainty.
