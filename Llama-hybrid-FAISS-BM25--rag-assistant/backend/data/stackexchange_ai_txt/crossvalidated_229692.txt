good way to model y=f(x1)+f(x2)+...+f(x30)?

In a football manager game, there are many players as in this screenshot: My y is the average rating of a player, my sample size N is big enough, and x1,x2,x3,...,x30 are the attributes like finishing, acceleration and pace (which can take values from 1 to 20). No attribute has a negative effect. Can I use regression or another technique to find parameters such as: y=f(x1)+f(x2)+...+f(x30) In other words, after sampling N players, I want to know which attribute has the most effect in average rating, and which the least, and a scale to know how much more important is one attribute compared to the least important one.
