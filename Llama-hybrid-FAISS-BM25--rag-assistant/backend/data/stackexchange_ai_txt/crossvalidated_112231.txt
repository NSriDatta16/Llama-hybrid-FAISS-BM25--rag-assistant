Is Outlier detection in two separate databases is equal to one combined database?

Suppose that we have two databases : Database_1 and Database_2 . Database_1 has 300 samples and Database_2 has 700 samples. Database_all is combination of two databases. Is finding outliers using abs(X-mean(X))>=1.9*std(X) in Database_all is equal to finding outliers separately in Database_1 and Database_2 ? In both cases we will remove same samples or not? Suppose that we will remove outliers with column 1 on above databases. In column 2 and 3 we have data that we want create a label for every sample like this (column_2_value-column_3_value)/mean(column_2) ( mean(column_2) is average of all values in column 2 ) We want calculate this label for all samples after removing outliers. In this case we have same label values if we remove outliers from Database_all compare to calculate after removing outliers separately in Database_89 and Database_90 ? Please mathematically prove this problem if you have time. Thanks.
