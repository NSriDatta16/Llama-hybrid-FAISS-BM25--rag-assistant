What you call 'doubleArgs' is more often called dup - it is the W combinator (called warbler in To Mock a Mockingbird) - "the elementary duplicator". What you call 'dup' is actually the 'starling-prime' combinator. Haskell has a fairly small "combinator basis" see Data.Function, plus some Applicative and Monadic operations add more "standard" combinators by virtue of the function instances for Applicative and Monad ( from Applicative is the S - starling combinator for the functional instance, liftA2 & liftM2 are starling-prime). There doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm in the community for expanding Data.Function, so whilst combinators are good fun, pragmatically I've come to prefer long-hand in situations where a combinator is not directly available.
