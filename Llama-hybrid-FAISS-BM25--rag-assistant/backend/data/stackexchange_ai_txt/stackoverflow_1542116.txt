Unless you are new to software development, I wouldn't buy an IDE book. I would go to the help menu and walk through the tips, and also print out the default key map (also found on the help menu) and try the various keystrokes. I would pay attention most to the keystrokes for items on the GoTo, Code, and Refactor menus, as I use those all the time. Also, learning the various "live templates" is useful. You should also tie IntelliJ into your version control tool, having buttons and shortcuts to it inside your IDE saves time. If you buy the book, most of the tips and keystrokes should be the same. I've used IntelliJ since v4 and the most-used ones have pretty much stayed constant. Unfortunately (for book buyers) much of the configuration of IntelliJ and of IntelliJ projects has changed significantly so the book might show screens that no longer exist.
