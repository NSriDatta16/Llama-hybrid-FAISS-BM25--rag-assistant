How to train a neural network model in python or any language that can train itself from a excel file and validate itself also from a excel file?

I have a large amount of data. I need to make a neural network that trains itself from an excel data sheet and validates its output from another excel data set. There will be an output coloumn in the validate excel file. The model needs to give the output near about the givern row.
