For the multiple choice questions, it seems like an automated scan would be fairly reliable. If you have the option of scanning in all the documents before data entry starts, then incorporate the scans into the UI with computer guesses in place. For a multiple choice question, have the data entry form on one side and the original scan on the other side. If the computer guess is above a certain threshold, fill in that choice in the data entry area. If the computer guess is below a certain threshold (multiple answers or no answer found) then do not mark an initial answer and highlight that question as needing attention. Even without the guesses, having the scanned paper visible on screen next to the data entry seems helpful. For the handwritten answers I have no real suggestions beyond having the scanned input beside the the data entry area. Even if the image is not as legible as the original document, it will help ensure that the correct text is entered for each question. A fairly common input error is to be off by one, where the correct answer is entered for the wrong question. Having the image on screen could reduce that a little, and make it easier for another human to verify. This assumes that all the forms are identical in layout so you can write some code to display a certain part of a certain page and expect it to be the right part of the form.
