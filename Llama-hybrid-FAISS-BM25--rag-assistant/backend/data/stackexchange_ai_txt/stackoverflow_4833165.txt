Remove hard line breaks from text with Ruby

I have some text with hard line breaks in it like this: This should all be on one line since it's one sentence. This is a new paragraph that should be separate. I want to remove the single newlines but keep the double newlines so it looks like this: This should all be on one line since it's one sentence. This is a new paragraph that should be separate. Is there a single regular expression to do this? (or some easy way) So far this is my only solution which works but feels hackish. txt = txt.gsub(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/,'[[[NEWLINE]]]') txt = txt.gsub('[[[NEWLINE]]][[[NEWLINE]]]', "\n\n") txt = txt.gsub('[[[NEWLINE]]]', " ")
