I will take this as an opportunity to explain some fundamental issues regarding the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics, by interpreting frequentist practices from a Bayesian standpoint. In this example, we have observed data $D_1$ for the original and data $D_2$ for the combination case. One assumes that these are generated by Bernoulli random variables with parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively, and that these parameters come from the priors, $f_i(p_i)$ (with cdfs $F_i(p_i)$). The probability $p_1 > p_2$ can be calculated, as you pointed out. It is: $$ P[p_1 > p_2;f_1,f_2] = \frac{\int_0^1 \int_0^1 I(p_1 > p_2) P[D_1|p_1] P[D_2|p_1] dF_1(p_1) dF_2(p_2)}{\int_0 ^1 \int_0^1 P[D_1|p_1] P[D_2|p_1] dF_1(p_1) dF_2(p_2) } $$ Here the Bayesian chooses priors $f_1(p_1)$ and $f_2(p_2)$ (and will usually choose the same prior for both, due to exchangeability) and proceeds with inference. The frequentist takes a "conservative" approach when choosing a prior. The possible values of $\theta$ are assumed to be known, but the frequentist has so little confidence in their ability to assign a meaningful prior, so that they effectively look at all possible priors and then only make an inferential statement when that inferential statement is true under all possible priors . When no inference is valid under all possible priors, the frequentist remains silent. That is the situation in this case. When one considers the priors $g_{\theta_i}(p_i)$ given by: $$ g_{\theta_i}(p_i) = \delta (\theta_i) $$ that is, the point mass concentrated at $\theta_i$, then one can easily see that the probability desired is $$ P[p_1 > p_2;g_{\theta_1},g_{\theta_2}] = \delta_{\theta_1, \theta_2}$$ that is, 1 when $\theta_1 = \theta_2$ and 0 otherwise. Thus the frequentist remains silent. (Or, alternatively, makes the trivial statement: "The probability is between 0 and 1...")
