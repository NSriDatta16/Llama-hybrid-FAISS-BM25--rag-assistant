I really like the ease of backing up and transporting the databases, which I have found harder with mySQL. Use SQLite as mentioned in another answer. There is only one file to backup, or set up periodic dumps of the MySQL databases to SQL files. This is a relatively simple thing to do. I see that everyone seems to prefer the mySQL way - and it likely is faster when it comes to queries Speed is definitely a consideration. Databases tend to be a lot faster, because the data is organized better. other than that is there any reason to stay away from flat-file dbs and (finally) properly learn mysql ? There sure are plenty of reasons to use a database solution, but there are arguments to be made for flat files. It is always good to learn things other than what you "usually" use. Most decisions depend on the application. How many concurrent users are you going to have? Do you need transaction support?
