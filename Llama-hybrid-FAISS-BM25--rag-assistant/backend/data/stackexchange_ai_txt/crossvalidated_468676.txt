No one should care about the performance on the training set, the key quantity is whether you can generalize out of sample. Having the area under the ROC curve be 1 for the training data is irrelevant (and occasionally achievable with random forests), and thus you'd in any case need to include the same estimates for the validation set and/or test set to provide useful information on your classifier. Again, whatever you report on the training set can be overfit to an arbitrary degree, the only real test of value is hold-out set performance.
