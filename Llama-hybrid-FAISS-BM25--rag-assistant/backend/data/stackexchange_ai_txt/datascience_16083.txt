Convolutional net topology

I have been implementing a convolutional neural net for Character recognition (MNIST) and I'm having troubles when trying to train it (basically the CNN doesn't learn). So I was wondering if the topology that I used is wrong... CNN topology: Input -> Conv layer 3*3 (10 filters) -> Maxpool 2*2 -> Conv layer 4*4 (30 filters) -> Maxpool 2*2 -> Fully Connected layer -> Fully Connected layer -> Fully Connected layer (the result of this layer is the output). As you see, I'm not using softmax, but I think that not using it should not be the problem. I also use root-mean-square error as loss function . Another thing I want to add is that, when I say that it doesn't learn, I mean that 10% of the time the output is correct, but I noticed that the output that is correct is when the image is a 9 (and not any other number). If anyone could give me some advice about some CNN structure or about an existing CNN, I would thank you a lot.
