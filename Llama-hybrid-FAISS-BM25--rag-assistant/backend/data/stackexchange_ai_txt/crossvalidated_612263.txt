Is an MCMC estimator biased if the confidence interval contains the true parameter value?

Let’s assume I am simulating data under a given model, and using MCMC with said data to estimate a (known) model parameter. Let’s assume I do this thousands of times. The results I obtain show that the median of the posterior distribution for this parameter is always smaller than the true value, yet the 95% highest posterior density interval generally contains the true value. Is the estimator biased? A biased estimator is one whose expected value systematically differs from the true value. If the median of the posterior distribution is the expected value, then it is, as I always obtain smaller values than expected (never larger ones). However, across ~75% of replicates, the true value still falls within the confidence interval of the expected value. Any thoughts?
