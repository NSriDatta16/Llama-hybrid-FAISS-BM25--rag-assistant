Binary classifier probability measure?

I've the following situation. I've a binary classifier which classifies input feature vectors into either of two classes '$y$' or '$n$', along with the probability of it being in either of the classes $P_y$ and $P_n$. I know that the classifier is right 60% of the time. How do I estimate the true probability of it being in each of the classes? What I'm doing now is to compute $0.6*P_y / (0.6*P_y + 0.4*(1- P_y))$. This is a Bayesian adjustment, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.
