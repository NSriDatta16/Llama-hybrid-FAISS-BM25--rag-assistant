What you may need to do, is to contact the spec lead for the given JSR. They can give you more information on obtaining a TCK. It may be that you have to pay a license to obtain access to the TCK. Certainly with the Java SE specification, Sun does indeed charge a license fee for the TCK, unless you qualify as a non-profit organization to receive it for free. That said, I believe it varies from JSR to JSR, so as I said above, the best bet is to contact the JSR spec lead.
