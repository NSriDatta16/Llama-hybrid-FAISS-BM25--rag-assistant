A CNN will learn to recognize patterns across space. So, as you say, a CNN will learn to recognize components of an image (e.g., lines, curves, etc.) and then learn to combine these components to recognize larger structures (e.g., faces, objects, etc.). You could say, in a very general way, that a RNN will similarly learn to recognize patterns across time. So a RNN that is trained to translate text might learn that "dog" should be translated differently if preceded by the word "hot". The mechanism by which the two kinds of NNs represent these patterns is different, however. In the case of a CNN, you are looking for the same patterns on all the different subfields of the image. In the case of a RNN you are (in the simplest case) feeding the hidden layers from the previous step as an additional input into the next step. While the RNN builds up memory in this process, it is not looking for the same patterns over different slices of time in the same way that a CNN is looking for the same patterns over different regions of space. I should also note that when I say "time" and "space" here, it shouldn't be taken too literally. You could run a RNN on a single image for image captioning, for instance, and the meaning of "time" would simply be the order in which different parts of the image are processed. So objects initially processed will inform the captioning of later objects processed.
