Your confusion is perhaps due to the fact that there are different modes of convergence of a sequence of random variables. Definitions first. The CLT tells us that: under suitable conditions, the standardized sample average has limiting distribution $N(0,1)$ that is $$ \frac{\sqrt{n}(\bar X_n -\mu)}{\sigma}\overset{d}\to N(0,1). $$ On the other hand, the (Weak) Law of Large Numbers (LLN) deals with averages and tells us that Under suitable conditions, the distribution of the sample average is the point mass at $\mu$ (the population average) that is $\bar X \overset{P}\to \mu.$ The message here is that the CLT is an instance of convergence in distribution whereas the LLN is an instance of convergence in probability. The fact that $\bar X \overset{P}\to \mu$ , i.e. that $\bar X-\mu \overset{P}\to 0$ doesn't conflict with CLT because LLN targets the (centred) sample average whereas the CLT targets the standardized sample average.
