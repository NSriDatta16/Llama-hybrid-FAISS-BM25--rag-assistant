What does an expectation with respect to a policy mean in the reinforcement learning value function

I would like to know what the formal definition of the following expression is $$ V_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}(G_{t+1} | S_t =s) $$ What does it mean to have the policy in the subscript? How would I write this out as a summation over states, rewards, actions? Is it equivalent to: $$ \mathbb{E}_{A_t,R_t,S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, R_{t+1}, S_{t+2}, \dots}(G_{t+1} | S_t =s) $$
