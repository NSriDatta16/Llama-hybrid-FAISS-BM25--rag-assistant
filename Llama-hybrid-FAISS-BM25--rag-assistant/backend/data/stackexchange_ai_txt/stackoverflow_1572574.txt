Java Fast Data Storage & Retrieval

I need to store records into a persistant storage and retrieve it on demand. The requirement is as follows: Extremely fast retrieval and insertion Each record will have a unique key. This key will be used to retrieve the record The data stored should be persistent i.e. should be available upon JVM restart A separate process would move stale records to RDBMS once a day What do you guys think? I cannot use standard database because of latency issues. Memory databases like HSQLDB/ H2 have performace contraints. Moreover the records are simple string objects and do not qualify for SQL. I am thinking of some kind of flat file based solution. Any ideas? Any open source project? I am sure, there must be someone who has solved this problem before.
