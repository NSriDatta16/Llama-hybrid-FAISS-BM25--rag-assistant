data structure for bigger number of files

I'm looking for effective way to sort albums with songs. I have around 10000 and growing albums with approx 10 songs in every album. So that means 100000 files. Now I do not want to store all folders (albums) in one main folder, but I'm looking for a better way to store it. All folders are hierarchy equal, so I was thinking to group folder by initials or just simply pack 1000 folders in another folder. But a lot of people says that this could be messy.. What do you suggest? (I know it's not directly linked to programming, but I think that data storage should be also important)
