As mentioned in the FAQ page "How do I find a particular class from an Eclipse plug-in?" , External Plug-in Libraries is a project automatically created in your workspace, which will: have all the Eclipse plug-ins you selected on its build path, ensure that they will be consulted by the Java search engine when searching for and opening Java types. That means you have the RCP edition where a workspace is already set up so that all Eclipse plug-ins are found by the Java search engine. The manual way to do this is: Activate the 'Plug-ins' view by going to Window > Show View > Other > PDE > Plug-ins. Select all plug-ins in the view. From the context menu, select Add to Java Search. As of Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) the External Plug-in Libraries Java project is hidden by default (see bug 194694 ). Use the Java element filters dialog to include the External Plug-in Libraries project in the Package Explorer view.
