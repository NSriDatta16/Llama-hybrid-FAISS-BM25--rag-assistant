Winforms Datagridview too slow with ImageColumn

In my winforms app, i have a datagridview that takes about 0.8 seconds to be populated with +/- 5000rows - if all columns are textbox columns. One of the columns is an integer column, so I decided to change that column to an ImageColumn and in the Cell_formatting event of the grid, I use the following code to determine the appropriate image to display: private void dgv_CellFormatting(object sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs e) { if (dgv.Columns[e.ColumnIndex] is DataGridViewImageColumn && e.ColumnIndex == 1) { int cellVal = (int)e.Value; switch (cellVal) { case 1: e.Value = Properties.Resources.Pending; dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[e.ColumnIndex].ToolTipText = "Item pending attention"; break; case 2: e.Value = Properties.Resources.Tick dgv.Rows[e.RowIndex].Cells[e.ColumnIndex].ToolTipText = "File is available"; break; default: break; } } } It works. However, the datagridview now takes almost 5 seconds to populate itself!! and sorting columns just becomes too time consuming. 5 seconds now may not seem like a lot, but the rows will grow to about 30,000 in about 2months time!! Is there a more efficient way to handle this scenario? Thank u!
