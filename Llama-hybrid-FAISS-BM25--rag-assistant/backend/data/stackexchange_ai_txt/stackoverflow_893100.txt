To my knowledge, you can't get a TextSymbol to scale along with the map. That's because the TextElement isn't changeable based upon the map's extent but, instead, uses the font size to determine how large it's going to appear on the screen. The best way that I can think of to do it while still using a TextSymbol is to change the point size (and, if the extent is large enough, hide/show the element) as the extent changes. I don't know of a "text control that pays attention to the extent," which is what you would really need. Alternately, couldn't you just use an annotation layer or label the layer where you want the text size to change?
