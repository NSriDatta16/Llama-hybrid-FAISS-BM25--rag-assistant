Most touchscreens simply emulate a mouse, so if your needs are simple you don't need to do anything special - JButtons still fire ActionEvents, combo boxes still fire ItemEvents, etc. If you want to do anything fancy (multitouch, flick-scrolling, etc.) then you can use the regular mouse events (mouseClicked, mousePressed, mouseDragged etc.) and provide your own gesture logic, or take a look at the libraries suggested in the answer for this similar question .
