How are p values misinterpreted in logistic regression and how should we interpret them?

I am currently going through the book Practical Guide to Logistic Regression by Joseph Hilbe and there is this part I came across: For whatever reason, it gives this warning, but sorta trails off and doesn't explain why this is the case. As far as it is my understanding, the p values are calculated in a similar fashion as those in linear regression, so I was curious as to why this warning was given.
