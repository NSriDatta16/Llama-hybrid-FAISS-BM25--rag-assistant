Drag anything onto the desktop

Is there a way that we can drag text or images onto the desktop itself from within another application? Say for example there is some text in my app, and the user wants to drag it right onto the desktop, and be able to move it around and edit it right on the desktop... Would this be possible at all? Thank you :) I mainly use C# and C++. But if I have to use another language or learn another language for this, then I'm prepared to do so.
