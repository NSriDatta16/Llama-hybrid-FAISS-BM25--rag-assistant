Personally I would go for 80% coverage, but of course this is only relative... I personally didn't achive this yet, too. Currently we have very high coverage (99%) on our utility classes, which is good because bugs in there will hunt you through your whole application. Mediocre coverage is for most GUIs, because writing tests for them is hard and time expensive, so we often leave it to opening the gui in the unit tests and if there is no error we close it automatically.
