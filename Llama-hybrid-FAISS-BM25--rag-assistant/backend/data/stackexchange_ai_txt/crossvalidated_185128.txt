What is the name for this iterative regression method?

What's the correct term for regression where you first regress on one input variable (feature), take the errors, regress on the next feature, etc.? In what specific cases is this useful? Are there any references for this technique? More specifically, I am talking about regressing $y$ on $x_1$ , then regressing $(y-b_1\times x_1)$ on $x_2$ , etc. This is because each $x$ is a time series, and needs to be sampled differently, so I cannot take them all as inputs to the regression at the same time.
