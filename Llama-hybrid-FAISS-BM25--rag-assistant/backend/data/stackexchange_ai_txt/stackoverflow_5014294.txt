That definitely looks like IBM Rational's Modeling Software. The Rational Software Architect family to be specific: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/products/rsa/ See the screenshots here for comparison: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-soa-bddhealth/ I'm using it on a daily basis, and it isn't bad. The newest version is Eclipse 3.6-based and leverages the open-source frameworks like EMF, GMF, JET, etc. IBM add a lot of proprietary things, like Java, C++, etc. to and from transformations. It's very expensive, but their support is very good (if your willing to pay for premium). If your looking for something open and free, check out the Papyrus MDT project.
