Can I transform my output variable in an imbalanced dataset?

I have a dataset that has an output variable that is quite right-skewed and imbalanced. I want to use a neural network as a regressor to predict the output variable. Visually, it looks like there may be a function that I may be able to use to make the distribution roughly uniform, as the current distribution resembles a 1/x function or exponential function. Is there a robust way to transform this data into a uniform distribution? Or am I going about this in a totally incorrect way when something like under- or oversampling would be more appropriate?
