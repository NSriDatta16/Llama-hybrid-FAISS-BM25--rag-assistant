If the datapoint is a matrix it is always possible to unroll the matrix to a vector. But in your case it dosn't make sense. I think the best way for you is to use basic feature engineering to create a vector for each school. Features could be simple - average grade in math, chemistry, etc. You can use quantile, min, max, percentage of highest grade etc. The private/public would be another feature. For this setting you don't event need to assume constant number of students in each school.
