Parsing XML is an fairly expensive task. The average DOM parser would already need at least five times of the memory space as the XML document big is. You should take this fact into account as well. To ensure that there is no memory leak somewhere else which caused the memory shortage for the XML parser, you really need to run a profiler. Give it all more memory, double the available memory and profile it. When you've nailed the cause down and fixed the leak, then you can just fall back to the "default" memory and retest. Or if there is really no means of any leak, then just give it all a bit more memory than default so that it all suits. You can also consider to use a more memory efficient XML parser instead, for example VTD-XML ( homepage here , benchmarks here ).
