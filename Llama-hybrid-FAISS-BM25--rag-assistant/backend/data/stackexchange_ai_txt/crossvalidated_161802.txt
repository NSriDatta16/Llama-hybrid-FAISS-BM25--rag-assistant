Here is the actual answer from the MedCalc website user41466 wrote about http://www.medcalc.org/manual/logistic_regression.php Sample size considerations Sample size calculation for logistic regression is a complex problem, but based on the work of Peduzzi et al. (1996) the following guideline for a minimum number of cases to include in your study can be suggested. Let p be the smallest of the proportions of negative or positive cases in the population and k the number of covariates (the number of independent variables), then the minimum number of cases to include is: N = 10 k / p For example: you have 3 covariates to include in the model and the proportion of positive cases in the population is 0.20 (20%). The minimum number of cases required is N = 10 x 3 / 0.20 = 150 If the resulting number is less than 100 you should increase it to 100 as suggested by Long (1997).
