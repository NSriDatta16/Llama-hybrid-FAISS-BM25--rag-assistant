To me, $R^2$ -style measures compare how your model performs to the performance of a na√Øve baseline model. In the simple letting of linear regression, that baseline model for predicting conditional expected values is the marginal expected value, which is why the $\bar y$ appears in the denominator of this way of writing $R^2$ . $$ R^2=1-\left(\dfrac{ \overset{N}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}\left( y_i-\hat y_i \right)^2 }{ \overset{N}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}\left( y_i-\bar y \right)^2 }\right) $$ The predictions from your model are the $\hat y_i$ . The predictions from the baseline model are $\bar y$ every time. You have time-dependent data, so I would take a somewhat different stance. If you have only a short period of time before when you must make a forecast for a year in the future, you predict the mean from that short period of time. If you have a longer period of time on which you can base your forecast, your baseline model is the mean of that entire period of time. The baseline is dynamic, in that you keep updating it, but this does feel like it is within the spirit of my usual take on $R^2$ . Since you want to mimic McFadden's $R^2$ , you would use the log loss incurred by your model (numerator) and the log loss incurred by this dynamic baseline model (denominator). $$ R^2_{you} =1-\left(\dfrac{ \overset{N}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}\left[ y_i\log(\hat y_{i,\text{model}}) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat y_{i,\text{model}}) \right] }{ \overset{N}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}\left[ y_i\log(\hat y_{i,\text{model}}) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat y_{i,\text{dynamic baseline}}) \right] }\right) $$ This seems consistent with the article you cite. In this way, the procedure mimics what a statistical model would have predicted with the information available at any point in the past. This link discusses Campbell and Thompson (2008) that seems to use this same approach of using a dynamic baseline model. Even if they are not using McFadden's $R^2$ , I think you can cite them as inspiration, and you have more evidence that people use this kind of dynamic $R^2$ . Referring to this as "the" $R^2$ seems misleading, since the calculation really is different from the usual ways, but it certainly strikes me as within the spirit of the usual $R^2$ being interpreted as a comparison between model performance and the performance of a baseline model.
