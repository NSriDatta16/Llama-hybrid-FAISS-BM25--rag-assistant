How does recurrence work in RNN's?

So I am reading up on how RNN's are different from feed forward neural networks. I understand that it uses the time-1 during training. However it is not clear to me at what "level" this happens. Does a RNN during the training of a sentence like "I am going out." Pass every word individually through the entire network before it evaluates the prediction or am I picturing this wrong? So does it: Pass "I" through all layers of the network. Save that output state as t Pass "am" and t through all layers of the network. Save that output state as t Pass "going" and t through all layers of the network. Save that output state as t Pass "out" and t through all layers of the network. Save that output state as t Pass "." and t through all layers of the network. Make a prediction Evaluate prediction Back propagation
