Help deciding the best statistic tool for my data

I'm not from the data science area, and I need to perform some statistical analysis on my data, but I don't know which analytical tools I should use. Number of variables - 6 Independent Variables 3 - (one is scalar (e.g., 2,4,6,8,10) and the other two are nominal (e.g., A,B,C and Lote 1, Lote 2, Lote 3, Lote 4, Lote 5) Dependent Variables - 3 (all scalar variables and dependent on all three independent variables, they are basically performance metrics) One question I would like to answer is how the dependent variables behave when the scalar independent variable increases, taking into account the nominal variables. The picture below shows a sample of my data.
