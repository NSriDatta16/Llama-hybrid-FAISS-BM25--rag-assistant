I would need more information, but judging solely from your plot, it looks like a simple median filer (not average/mean) would do the job. If your outliers are single ticks, even a median filter of window size 3 would be able to discard them. But if the outliers show well-defined peaks, the window size should be roughly larger than the peak bases.
