I would look into Hadley's reshape package. It does all sorts of great stuff. The code below will work with your toy example, but there is probably a more elegant way of doing this. Simply, your data already appear to be in the ?melt form, so you can simply ?cast it. Also, check out these links http://www.statmethods.net/management/reshape.html http://had.co.nz/reshape/ library(reshape) help(package=reshape) ?melt D1
