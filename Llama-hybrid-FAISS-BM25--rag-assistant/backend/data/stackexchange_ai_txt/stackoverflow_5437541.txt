A* is a single source shortest path algorithm that use a heuristic function in order to speed up its search. The algorithm is similar to dijkstra's algorithm , but uses the heuristic evaluation of each node to determine which node should first be explored. The A* algorithm is both complete [will always find a path if one exists] and optimal [finds the shortest path] if the heuristic function provided is admissible . If more than one path exists with the same "lowest" cost score, the algorithm will return the path first explored. Usage example: Finding a path for an agent on a grid-like plane, from a single source to a target.
