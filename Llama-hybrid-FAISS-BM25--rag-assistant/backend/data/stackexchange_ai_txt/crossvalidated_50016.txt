Exponential Distribution - Rate - Bayesian Prior?

I have gone through WinBugs documentation (for example, http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/thebugsbook/examples/html/Chapter-11-Specialised/Example-11_7_2-leukaemia.html ). And also through this book ( http://www.amazon.ca/Bayesian-Survival-Analysis-Joseph-Ibrahim/dp/0387952772 ). Both use a gamma distribution prior for the rate (lambda) for the exponential distribution. They alternate between Gamma(0.01,0.01) and Gamma(0.001,0.001). I would like to use a non-informative prior.... but I don't think this is it? Could someone explain whether this is a non-informative prior? If not, can anyone suggest one?
