Is my understanding of neural ODE correct?

Given an ode $$\dot x = F(x(t))$$ The neural ODE model introduced in the paper: " Neural Ordinary Differential Equations " uses a neural network to model the solution of this ODE, i.e., $$x(t) = G(x(0))= \int_0^\infty F(x(t)) dt$$ then the neural ODE model is simply the function $G$ . Is my interpretation correct? It seems that knowing an approximation of this function $G$ would be extremely helpful. What information is used to train a neural ODE model?
