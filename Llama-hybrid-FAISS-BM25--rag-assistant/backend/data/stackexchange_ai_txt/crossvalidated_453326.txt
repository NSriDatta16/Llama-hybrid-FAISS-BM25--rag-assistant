Does aggregating ordinal data destroy the signal?

In an university assignment we are being asked to perform ordinal regression on wine data, predicting the quality of wine on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 = inferior, 2 = average, 3 = superior. So far all ordinal regression methods I have tried on the data set performed poorly. Interestingly, the ordinal regression methods seem to perform worse than their non-ordinal counterparts: ordinal forest performed worse than random forest, SVOREX and SVORIM (Chu et al. 2005) performed worse than the vanilla SVM with radial kernel, etc. After some research I found that for this assignment the profs aggregated the ratings from another wine dataset rated on a scale of 1 to 10(so [1:3] maps to 1, [4:6] to 2, etc). Does this explain why ordinal regression methods performed so poorly? More generally, does aggregating ordinal data like this destroy the underlying "ordinal" signal?
