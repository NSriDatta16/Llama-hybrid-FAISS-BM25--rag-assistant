You've not mentioned where the data template is. I'll attempt to cover 2 possibilities both of which are very similar. If you have the datatemplate in the resource of the user control you can setup events in the code behind file for the user control. Then in the UserControl.cs private void staffImage_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { } Now if you the datetemplate in a resource dictionary then you can do the exact same thing but you need to create a code behind file for the resource dictionary. See here . For drag and drop walkthrough itself...See Jamie Rodriguez post here . Hope that helps.
