Actually, I'm a Waterfall developer in an Agile organization. Things that don't "feel" right to me include: Starting work on a project with barely any idea what it should do. Documenting the processes, but not the products; being unable to get information without having to go talk to someone. All I should need is a Requirements document, a Design document (which I may write myself), and Google. Spending more time in meetings than coding. Spending more time coding at home than at work. Having no idea when the project will be done. PM's being useful in any way. Having a meeting to prepare for a meeting to prepare for a meeting where somebody else logs onto a server and copies a file; thus spending six hours on a process that takes six minutes Multiple checkouts Knowing how something should flow, but not having actual requirements. Developers' unique skill sets are downplayed or outright ignored as they make the developer non-interchangeable. When there are no stories remaining... nothing to do... just kinda sit there... Could be adding a new feature; may not be needed but the time isn't being wasted... Every six months when I change contracts, I have to adapt to a new coding standard? By the time I get used to it, I'm already looking for my next contract.
