Whenever using a SSL URL, the JVM tries to recognize the certificate based on its trust store. The truststore file is named 'cacerts' and is present in the java/jre/lib/security folder.For the Webapp to recognize the SSL certificate, the root certificates* of the service must be imported into the cacerts store. This can be done with the help of 'keytool -import' in the java/jre/bin folder. Root certificate is the Certifying Authority [CA] of a service i.e the Organization that provides the SSL certificate will have a CA cert to identify itself. Let me know if you need more details.
