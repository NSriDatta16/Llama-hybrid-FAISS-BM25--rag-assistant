Unfortunately I don't think that there is a better way. Perhaps preventing users from being able to enter any of the characters/character patterns that are considered malicious as their password might be the pragmatic option. Turning the request validation off may potentially open up bigger holes than the minor inconvenience of one user not being able to use or > in their password. You may want to look at something like the Web Protection Library and the Security runtime engine for additional web application security.
