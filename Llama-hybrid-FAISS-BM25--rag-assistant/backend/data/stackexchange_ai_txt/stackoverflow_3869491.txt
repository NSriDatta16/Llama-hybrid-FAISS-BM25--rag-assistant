C: fscanf erases integer variables values?

I've got a C program that encounters errors when I enter a while loop. I initialize a variable (fragmentcount) and write into it using fscanf and assign it a value of 4 (this works) int fragmentCount; if ((fscanf(fp, "%i", &fragmentCount)) == 1) { ... } However, when I try to access it in a while loop below, fragmentCount = 0 while ((fscanf(fp, "%[#]", discards)) != EOF) { printf(fragmentCount); // For a brief experiment, I tried taking away the fscanf as the conditional test for the while loop, and fragmentCount was the correct value (4). Why is this so? How can I avoid this?
