I think that you already understands what there is to understand. These statistics are used to measure the average precision of prediction models, and to compare the accuracy of different models. You already noted that: Based on the result, model 2, in general, have higher MSE, RMSE and MAE(meaning model1 fits the model better than model 2). You noted that the accuracy of model 1 is higher than the accuracy of model 2 in average. I do not think that you can interpret anything further. The only additional observation I could think of is the following: For the groups "student5" and "student9", you have $MAE_1 but $RMSE_1>RMSE_2$ . This suggests that in these groups, model 1 produces some "significant" (do not interpret this word in a statistical way) outlier, which increases the MSE due to the squared error.
