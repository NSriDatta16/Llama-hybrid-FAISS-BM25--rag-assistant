Proving stationarity with difference equations

This is exercise 2.9.b from Time Series Analysis â€“ With Applications in R (Cryer, Chan). First of all, for $m\in\mathbb N+2$, let us define the $m$-th difference of a discrete time series $\{A_t\}_{t\in\mathbb Z}$ as $$\nabla^{m+1}A_t\triangleq\nabla(\nabla^m A_t)\quad:\quad\nabla A_t\triangleq A_t-A_{t-1}\quad.$$ Let $\{X_t\}_{t\in\mathbb Z}$ be a zero-mean stationary series with autocovariance $\gamma_k$ for every integer $k$, $\mu_t$ a polynomial in $t$ of degree $d$, and $Y_t\triangleq X_t + \mu_t$. Show that, for natural $m$, the $m$-th difference of $\{Y_t\}_{t\in\mathbb Z}$ is stationary if and only if $m\ge d$. I realize that $$Z_t\triangleq\nabla^mY_t=\sum_{j=0}^m(-1)^j\binom m jY_{t-j}\quad,$$ and that this would be trivial if we were dealing with the continuous derivative, because polynomial derivatives vanish if their degree is greater than the degree of the polynomial. Nevertheless, I get lost manipulating $E[Z_t]$ and $Cov[Z_t,Z_{t+k}]$. How do I prove neither of these depend on $t$?
