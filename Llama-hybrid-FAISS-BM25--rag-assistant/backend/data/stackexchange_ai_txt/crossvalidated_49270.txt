Imputation with Random Forests

I have two questions on using random forest (specifically randomForest in R) for missing value imputation (in the predictor space). 1) How does the imputation algorithm work - specifically how and why is the class label required for imputation? is the proximity matrix which serves to weight the average value to impute a missing value defined separately by class? 2) If the class label is needed to impute missing values - how can this be used to impute missing values for new data that you are trying to predict?
