You're interpreting the coefficient correctly, assuming this is a log-link model. If the exp of the coefficient is > 1, the average response value is higher on average. If it's less than 1, it's lower on average. Your statement that every increase of 1 standard deviation results in a mean response x% higher is only correct if you've scaled your input variables to have standard deviation 1. In the level of the categorical variable associated with this coefficient you probably have no examples of positive counts, or the positive counts are all also in other low-count categorical levels.
