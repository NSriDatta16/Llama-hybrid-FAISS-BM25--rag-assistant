How to transform this time series data?

Given in these plots above is the US unemply. Data since 1948 till recently a month back. I tried using a log and difference transform to make the data look more stationary. This is what I get as the final result. This looks more squished in a bit more stationary looking. But the model I end up getting is much more complicated than wanted. Is there are possibilities I may look into to see if I can come up with a better model? I need to keep the data as is meaning I do not want to get rid of portions. Thanks.
