Advantages of TSQL: greater compatibility with Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server Disadvantages of TSQL: some statements and functionality are only available in Watcom-SQL procedures. Some examples: greater control over EXECUTE IMMEDIATE behavior in Watcom-SQL LOAD TABLE, UNLOAD TABLE, REORGANIZE (among others) are only available in Watcom-SQL the FOR statement for looping over the results of a query and automatically declaring variables to contain the values is very useful, but not available in TSQL error reporting is less consistent since TSQL procedures are assumed to handle their own errors, while Watcom-SQL procedures report errors immediately. Watcom-SQL procedures can contain an EXCEPTION clause to handle errors statements are not delimited by semi-colons, so TSQL procedures are more difficult to parse (and read). Syntax errors can sometimes fail to point to the actual location of the error no ability to explicitly declare the result set of a procedure no support for row-level triggers in TSQL event handlers can only be written using Watcom-SQL The documentation for SQL Anywhere T-SQL compatibility is available online . There are some database options that change behaviour to more closely match what you would expect from Sybase ASE. In addition, there are some functions that can be used to translate from one syntax to another. Note that if you want to start adding statements in the Watcom dialect into an existing stored procedure, you will need to change the SP so that it is entirely written in the Watcom dialect. You cannot mix syntaxes in a SP, trigger, or batch.
