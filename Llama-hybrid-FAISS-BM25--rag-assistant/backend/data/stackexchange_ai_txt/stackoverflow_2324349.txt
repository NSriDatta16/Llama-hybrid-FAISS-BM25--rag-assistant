Reporting Services: dynamically add filters to server report

I have some server-based reports (*.rdl) which returns data from a SQL Server 2008 view. The user would like to be able to dynamically add filtering, e.g. show me only data with Language = English, or show me only data for a given organizational unit or stuff like that. The number of filter criteria is reasonably small (four or five). But how do I do that?? I have my RDL on the server, with the basic query ( SELECT (fields) FROM MyView WHERE ...... ) inside the report data set - how can I dynamically add filtering to that?? I was hoping I might be able to define dataset filters, but those seem to have to be in place when the RDL gets rendered, too (e.g. they become part of the report RDL itself). The possible values for each criteria are too numerous that I could simply add them as a list and define an IN (list of values) kind of filter..... Any ideas?? Thoughts? Am I missing something?
