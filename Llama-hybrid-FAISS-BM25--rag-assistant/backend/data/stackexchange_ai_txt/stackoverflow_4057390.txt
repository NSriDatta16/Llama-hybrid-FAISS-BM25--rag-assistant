There's also another alternative as I have described at: http://www.softwarerockstar.com/2010/10/readonlydictionary-tkey-tvalue/ Essentially it's a subclass of ReadOnlyCollection>, which gets the work done in a more elegant manner. Elegant in the sense that it has compile-time support for making the Dictionary read-only rather than throwing exceptions from methods that modify the items within it.
