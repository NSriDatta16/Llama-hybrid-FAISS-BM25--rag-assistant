Drag and Drop in .Net c#

I have implemented a list that i want to be able to order using drag and drop. I have implemented the list using the ajaxToolkit ReorderList. It works perfectly on the user interface the problem i am having is related to the update of the data into the database. I created a button that allows the user to save the changes (all at once), the problem is that in the click event if I loop troughs the ReorderList the items are returned in the original order, not the one as the user have modified it. Seems like despite the list is re-orderd the ReorderList maintains the original datasource. this is my list ' /> ' /> '/> '/> Any idea how I should implement this? How do I implement the protected void rlWorkItems_ItemReorder(object sender, ReorderListItemReorderEventArgs e) { } method? Thanks
