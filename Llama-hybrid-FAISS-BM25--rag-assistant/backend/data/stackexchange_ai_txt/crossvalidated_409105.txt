Sensitivity Analysis with categorical predictive variables in R

I am doing a project where I have to predict the Sales Units in fashion and intend to run a Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machine models. However, my predictive variables are all categorical, such as color or price range. How can I do the sensitivity analysis of the actual values of my predictive variables in R? For instance, if I pick the color, how do I know whether blue or yellow has a higher impact?
