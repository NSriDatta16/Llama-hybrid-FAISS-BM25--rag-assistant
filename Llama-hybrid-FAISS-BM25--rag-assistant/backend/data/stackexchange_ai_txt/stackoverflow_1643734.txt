SQL gets badmouthed from several sources: Programmers who are not comfortable with anything but an imperative language. Consultants who have to deal with many incompatible SQL-based products on a daily basis Nonrelational database vendors trying to break the stranglehold of relational database vendors on the market Relational database experts like Chris Date who view current implementations of SQL as insufficient If you stick to one DBMS product, then I definitely agree that SQL DBs are more versatile and of higher quality than their competition, at least until you hit a scalability barrier intrinsic in the model. But are you really trying to write the next Twitter, or are you just trying to keep some accounting data organized and consistent? Criticism of SQL is often a standin for criticisms of RDBMSes. What critics of RDBMSes seem not to understand is that they solve a huge class of computing problems quite well, and that they are here to make our lives easier, not harder. If they were serious about criticizing SQL itself, they'd back efforts like Tutorial D and Dataphor.
