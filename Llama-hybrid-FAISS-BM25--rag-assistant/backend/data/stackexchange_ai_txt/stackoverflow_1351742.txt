Emacs has term-mode which is full blown terminal emulator you can run emacs in emacs. Anything you run on terminal will run in term-mode Also emacs has tramp mode which can open files through ssh. /scp:user@ipOrHost#port:/ it will transfer files back and forth. you just edit them as you would edit local files. No need for x11 forwarding or other shenanigans.
