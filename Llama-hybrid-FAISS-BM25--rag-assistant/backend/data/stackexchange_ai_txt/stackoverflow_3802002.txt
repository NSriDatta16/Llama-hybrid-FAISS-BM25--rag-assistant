For very large data cubes storage and retrieval, HDF5 storage is working rather well (h5py or PyTables for a Python interface). Your application can then either run on a machine with a local copy of the HDF5 database or make an ad-hoc server solution (still in Python). I have been designing hybrid SQL / HDF5 storage strategies when needed, and they are performing rather well. If really need the MDX query language: as an ORM (earlier answers on stackoverflow) cubulus (although only a subset of MDX is implemented) run the OLAP of your choice as a separate server and communicate with it through an ad-hoc interface (might even be XML through http).
