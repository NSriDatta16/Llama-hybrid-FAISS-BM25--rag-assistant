What are the current approaches to topic modelling (i.e. better than LSA, LDA, LSI)?

I am looking into methods for topic modeling with the purpose of keyword generation. Given a corpus consisting of multiple documents, I would like to get a list of semantically relevant and significant keywords. What are the current approaches for this task of keyword extraction? So far I have found the following. Anything else? Statistical models: Hierarchical latent tree analysis - HLTA (Liu et al., 2014) Paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-662-44851-9_17.pdf Non-negative matrix factorization - NMF in Arora, Ge, Halpern, Mimno, Moitra, Sontag, Wu, & Zhu (2013); Paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/arora13.html Also Arora et al., 2021: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1956 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis - pLSA (Hofmann 1999) Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6705 Implementation e.g.: https://github.com/hitalex/PLSA Deep learning models: Replicated Softmax Model (RSM), combined with RBMs (Restricted Boltzmann Machines), Pre-Training and Auto-Encoders.
