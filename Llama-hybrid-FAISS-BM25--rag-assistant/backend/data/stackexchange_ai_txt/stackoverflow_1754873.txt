Unsupervised classification methods available

I'm doing a research which involves "unsupervised classification". Basically I have a trainSet and I want to cluster data in X number of classes in unsupervised way. Idea is similar to what k-means does. Let's say Step1) featureSet is a [1057x10] matrice and I want to cluster them into 88 clusters. Step2) Use previously calculated classes to compute how does the testData is classified Question -Is it possible to do it with SVM or N-N ? Anything else ? -Any other recommendations ?
