Given you have two different responses you want to test for a difference in I would carry out two separate analyses: i.To test for differences in the average star rating you could use an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. I suggest ANOVA as the star rating is analogous to the Likert scale and the test is robust enough to handle this . ii.The resolution proportion is on a different scale though. In this case I would use a logistic regression model comparing the group shown the feature and those who weren't. Sample size can be calculated with the bits you have supplied using this calculator . *One additional point though - the fact that star rating is not obligatory will lead to an unknown bias in your data. I for one know I am more likely to leave feedback if my experience was really poor.
