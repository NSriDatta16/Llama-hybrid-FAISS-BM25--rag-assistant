Time series prediction is a regression problem and you should consult to regression error metrics. However, you can make a classification based on time series. For example, you might need to decide a person's health status considering some physiological recordings. Then, your problem turns into a classification task where you can use classification metrics such as accuracy. I presume this is the source of your confusion There are multiple metrics for quantifying time series prediction models. Some of them: Mean Absolute Error: $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}|y_i-y_i'|$ Mean Squared Error: $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i-y_i')^2$ Mean Percentage Absolute Error : $(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\frac{y_i-y_i'}{y_i}|)$ x $100$ where $y,y'$ and $N$ are observed time samples, predicted time samples and total number of time samples used for error calculation, respectively. The procedure is straightforward: using previous time samples, you predict following $N$ time samples and calculate error based on these predicted samples. Although these all are widely used, percentage error is a good starting point since it is not affected by the data scaling and therefore, easier to interpret.
