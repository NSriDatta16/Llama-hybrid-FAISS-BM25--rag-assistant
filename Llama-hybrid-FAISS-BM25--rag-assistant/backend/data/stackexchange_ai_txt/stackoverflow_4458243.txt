TcpClient bandwidth estimation

I want to create bandwidth estimation tools using TcpClient. The problem im having is, I want to perform measurement in predefined time (instead of predefine buffer data length to transfer). If i use loops(transfer small chunks of data repeatedly), wouldnt that slow down the performance(manual fragmentation vs auto fragmentation)?
