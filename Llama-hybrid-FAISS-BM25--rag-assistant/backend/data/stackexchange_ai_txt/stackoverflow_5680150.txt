How to keep variable value throughout request

I'm creating REST service where I will expect specific "ticket" to be passed every request. This way I don't have to create sessions (and my clients can't support them). I want to store this ticket somewhere until request completes. I will call methods and they will call other methods, connections, etc - I just want this data to be available from code anywhere during this request. I know static class/variable won't work since it's application-wide. What my choices are? EDIT: Basically, I want some kind of storage "bag" that I can populate in my webservice method and that will be accessible from any place in app. And this need to live only for length of this request.
