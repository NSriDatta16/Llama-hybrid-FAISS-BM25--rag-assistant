How to handle negative delays when predicting flight delays?

I am working with the nycflights dataset . My goal is to predict departure and arrival time delays using random forests . My problem is that some flights have a negative delay , meaning they departed/arrived earlier than the scheduled time. So far, I have thought of 2 solutions to this: Dropping the rows with a negative delay and considering only the records with an actual delay. Replacing all the negative delays with the mean delay. I am, however, worried that doing any of the above might have a negative impact on the prediction accuracy, since I am not taking into account the negative delays in any way. What is the best way, in this case, to handle the negative values?
