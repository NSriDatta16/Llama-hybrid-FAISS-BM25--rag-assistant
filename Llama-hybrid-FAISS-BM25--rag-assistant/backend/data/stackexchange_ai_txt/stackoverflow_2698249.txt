The enterprise pattern for this is to have a amendment shadow table for every table you create to show the after-image (and possibly a before image) for all columns. You will need: scripts to create the amendment table the triggers to populate them and maintain the above when the table changes over time. But for a well setup enterprise all this should already be in place. My organisation only uses this for the following: An audit for dbas and support to manually determine what happened (using SQL). Enterprise Data Warehouse (SAS) sucks all delta's from the production systems for analysis. We create different tables if they are needed for the operational systems themselves.
