How to keep track of user changes to objects in a web application?

I'm needing help to come up with a clever way of keeping track of user changes in a web application. Lets say we have this scenarion: User X logs in and updates a few fields in their profile, lets say the email address. This causes the user to be flagged as updated and it should be checked by an admin In the admin UI we want to highlight the modified field(s) The question then becomes, what is the best approach to keeping track of these changes? The admin might not check the user for days or even weeks. I don't really have a need for keeping the original values (at this point at least), I just want to be able to determine what fields were changed. What would be the best way to keep track of this in the database? The application is written in Java / JSF with Hibernate and MySQL for data access and storage. Thanks!
