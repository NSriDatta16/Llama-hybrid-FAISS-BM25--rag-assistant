How to incorporate an xml fragment into tomcat's server.xml

I'm doing a distribution of tomcat for a many servers and in each of these servers the realm is going to be different. I would like to have a file /etc/tomcat/realm.xml containing the realm for that installation and have the file /var/lib/tomcat/conf/server.xml import it directly. I've tried with Xinclude without luck and I'm about to resort to sed to the import when running /etc/init.d/tomcat . Is there a better way to do this?
