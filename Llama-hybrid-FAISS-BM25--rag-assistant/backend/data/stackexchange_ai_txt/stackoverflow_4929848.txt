joining xml fragments

I want to join these 2 fragments together by id or whatever .. I have 2 ways 11 1 1 .... 2 .... 3 .... 4 ..... 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 .... the problem with the first one that this will increase the file size by adding elements if I already have huge data or another way is attribute like and but I need something more lite and efficient how the schema will look like referring to this question how xsd can represent different xml file? thanks in advance
