FxCop is a static analysis tool for .NET that has the ability to detect various possible bugs as well as advise you of good programming practices and Microsoft naming conventions. It seems like Microsoft have stopped development on the standalone FxCop tool now in favour of encouraging you to buy a version of Visual Studio with the static code analysis built in (which I think for VS2010 is the "Premium" edition and above).
