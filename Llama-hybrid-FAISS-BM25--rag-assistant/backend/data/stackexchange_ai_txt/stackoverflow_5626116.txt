How "best" to allow a web-page visitor to construct mathematical or statistical tools?

I have a free web site that streams real-time stock-options data. I want to let users make and then save their own JavaScript-callable tools to interpret options data. Users can invoke these custom tools to help them make their own sell/buy decisions about options. But I am totally stopped, stymied, dead-ended, and buffaloed as to how to accomplish this. If there were just a few choices, I guess I could stumble around blindfolded (as I am now) and finally hit on one that kind-of worked. But the choices seem endless: Let the user write JavaScript tools that I'd then interpret; Mathematica and like toolsets; Many statistics packages; Google spreadsheet API. And overwhelmingly many more. If anyone has struggled through the process of giving a user some facility for making statistics and probability tools, how did you finally end up? And would you do it that way again? Plus, my feature-creeposis and perfectionitis want me to integrate charts, graphs, heat maps, and who knows what else more; or at least to allow later integration of graphics. Graphics would be nice and sexy: I'd like to drop everything and do graphics. But I have to resist and get something onto the page real soon now . 1 Q: What can/should I do to allow and encourage easy, intuitive, secure, and powerful tool construction? EDIT: I definitely don't mean that I want to invent a whole new system de novo . I only (uh-huh, yeah, that's right; 'only' :-) want to interface with some already-existing JavaScript-callable package. Thanks so much! 1 Now I know a little bit of how my employers might have felt about me at one time: "aw, c'mahhhhhhhhhn, this feature is just too sexy to leave out."
