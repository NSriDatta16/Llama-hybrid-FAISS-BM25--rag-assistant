Generate bytecode from Eclipse's CompilationUnit

I am not working on an Eclipse plug-in project; however, I use an external library that generates an instance of org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.CompilationUnit. Is there a way to generate Java bytecode from it? Some searching revealed that CompilationUnit's are typically built by registering a custom builder for the Eclipse project, then letting eclipse invoke it... but I couldn't find any way to leverage that for a stand-alone application.
