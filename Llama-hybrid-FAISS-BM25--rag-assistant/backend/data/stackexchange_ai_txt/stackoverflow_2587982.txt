It's called integration testing . Integration tests are much more difficult to make automated, and are very often done by hand. Many simpler tests can still be done using NUnit though - you don't have to do anything special, just don't use Mocks (like you should be doing for unit tests) so you can test how the modules actually fit together. Context/specification is a good way of organizing these tests.
