This is a 'for what it's worth' answer. Firstly, I believe one should be cautious with highly correlated variables and logistic regression. I've heard, and have my own anecdotal evidence, of logistic regression not doing a very good job with correlated or too many variables. Having said that, I think you have answered your own question. You have variables, build all the models and let either cross validation or, better yet, a train/test analysis of the data, decide on which model is best. I know one can also bring AIC into the picture for logistic regression in R.
