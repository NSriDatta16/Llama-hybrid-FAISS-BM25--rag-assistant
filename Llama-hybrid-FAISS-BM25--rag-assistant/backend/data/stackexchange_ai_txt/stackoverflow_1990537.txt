Correct me if I'm wrong but, When you #include something, it more-or-less inserts the entire included file into the one with the include command; that is, when I include, say "macros.h" in "genericTools.cpp", the entire contents of "macros.h" is placed in "genericTools.cpp" at that point. This is why you need to use things like "#pragma once" or other protections, to prevent including the same file twice. Of note, templated code needs to be entirely in the file you're going to be including elsewhere. (I'm unsure of this - can template specializations be ommited from the included files, and linked like a normal function?)
