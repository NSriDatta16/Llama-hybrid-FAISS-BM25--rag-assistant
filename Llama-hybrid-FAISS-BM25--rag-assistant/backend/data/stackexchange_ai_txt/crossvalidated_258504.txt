$\tilde{x}$ is a new i.i.d. variable the distribution of which is described by the t-distribution. Formally, $\tilde{x}$ is the argument of the posterior predictive pdf and hence a dummy. The posterior predictive pdf is the density of the distribution of a new and independent variate with same distribution as the observation. μ is the known mean and is the first parameter of the distribution μ is the known mean of both the observation and the predictive variate. It is the location parameter of the $t$ distribution $t_{2α′}$ is a t-distribution with ν=n−1 degrees of freedom that has been shifted by μ and multiplied by σ. $t_{2α′}$ is a $t$ distribution with $2α′$ degrees of freedom, not $n-1$, location parameter $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$. $σ^2$ is second parameter of the distribution and is the Bayesian variance estimate given by the ratio of the posterior β and α $σ$ is the scale parameter of the $t$ distribution, provided by the ratio of the hyperparameters of the posterior distribution. the pdf is given by $$f(x) = \left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})} {\sqrt{\nu\pi}\,\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})} \left(1+\frac{x^2}{\nu} \right)^{\!-\frac{\nu+1}{2}} + \mu\right)\sigma$$ No, the density of a location-scale $t_\nu(\cdot;\mu,\sigma)$ distribution is $$\frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu+1}{2})}{\sigma\sqrt{\nu\pi}\,\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})}\left(1+\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\nu\sigma}\right)^{\!-\frac{\nu+1}{2}} $$
