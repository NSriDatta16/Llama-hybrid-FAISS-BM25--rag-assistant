For the machine learning algorithm you mentioned, regression and neural networks are formulated in optimization framework, and tree-based method is based on information gain. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a local search method. Given a value in the solution space, it will mutate to create several candidates. A criteria will be used to evaluate each candidates and only the few best ones will be kept for further mutation. It could usually be proven that GA could converge to the best solution if there is enough iteration. However, it is unfeasible practically. More discussion could be found here As for ensemble learning, it refers to (weighted) voting of multiple models. There are two normal ways, bagging or boosting.
