Count data time series with multiple seasonality

I am analyzing a time series (hospital admittance) registered by date - time at hourly frequency, collected all days during 2010 - 2014 (5 years). The time series exhibits seasonality at multiple level (hour, weekday, month). The conditional distribution could be reasonably modeled using a count distribution (Poisson, NegBin). I wonder what could be the best approach for modeling this. I was thinking about a Poisson loglinear model, say $$E\left[admittance_t\right]= \alpha * hour * weekday * month,$$ but I do not know how to account for autocorrelation. I s there an approach to perform this in R? Are there possible alternatives in R?
