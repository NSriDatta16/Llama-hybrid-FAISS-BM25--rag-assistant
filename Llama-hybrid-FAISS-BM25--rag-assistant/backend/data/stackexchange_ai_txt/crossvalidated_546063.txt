Intercept of logit vs intercept of multinomial logit

If I simulate the success probability for a Bernoulli random variable $t_{binary}$ conditional on some regressor $x$ : N the average probability ( mean(p) ) will be 0.5 as long as the intercept b0 is zero. Changing the slope of $x$ to something other than $0.3$ has no impact on this average. But if I simulate the probabilities of a 3-category $t_{multi}$ : p0 the average probability is split evenly (.33,.33,.33) only when the slope of x is the same for the three categories or if I fiddle with the intercepts. Is this correct (is this a property of the multinomial logit) or am I just simulating it wrong? The formula I have in mind is: $P(t_{multi}=c|x)=\frac{exp(\beta_{0c}+\beta_cx)}{\sum_{k=0}^2exp(\beta_{0k}+\beta_kx)}$ Thanks.
