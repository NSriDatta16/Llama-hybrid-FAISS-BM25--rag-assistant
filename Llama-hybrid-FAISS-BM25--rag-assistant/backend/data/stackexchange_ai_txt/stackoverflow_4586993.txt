you can declare a view inside your nib and set that of class SettingsViewController (if its a view). or drag a view controller in IB and set this of class type SettingsViewController //EDIT: so you want to present a view like MFMailComposerViewController . I also have a MessageViewController in my App which does nearly the same: MessageViewController *mView = [[MessageViewController alloc]initWithNibName:@"MessageView" bundle:nil]; mView.navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:mView]; [masterView presentModalViewController:mView.navController animated:YES]; [mView release]; notice that navController is a UINavigationController which is connected in IB to a navigation controller.
