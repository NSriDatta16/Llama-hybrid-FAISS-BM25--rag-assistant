Targeting both cloud and self hosted application?

I'm planning to build an application that can be either hosted by the customer in a traditional manner or in the cloud (SaaS). As there are many differences between the two targets, what are the guidelines I have to follow to reduce future problems ? I'm especially thinking about the persistence store... In one hand I have traditionnal RDBMS (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) or maybe nosql systems like MongoDB, couchDb, etc. and in the other hand, I have to work with "proprietary" and specific storage (Azure Table, Sql Azure in the MS world). I have the feeling it will be possible but with a lot of IOC, but as I'm new to the cloud, I'd appreciate any feedbacks. Of course, I want (optimistic?) to be able to quite easily switch between approaches... thx
