If you serve your document with an XML content-type (such as application/xhtml+xml ) then you shouldn't have this problem. It sounds like you are serving your document as text/html (although this isn't blessed by the text/html specification , which only goes up to XHTML 1.0) in which case you need to follow the HTML compatibility guidelines as you are telling browsers (and other user agents) that it is HTML rather than XHTML. I might be able to just convert all tags to <> , but that would mean that things like become -- which is just weird, albeit valid. … and wrong. Some browsers will treat that as . Elements defined as EMPTY should use self-closing syntax , everything else should have explicit start and end tags . Sadly, the simple option of using the correct content-type just introduces a different problem… … although I believe this will be resolved when IE8 and lower lose significant market share as IE9 introduces support for XHTML.
