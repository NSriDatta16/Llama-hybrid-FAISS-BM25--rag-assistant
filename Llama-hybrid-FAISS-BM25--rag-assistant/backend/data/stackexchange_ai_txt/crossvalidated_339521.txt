If an auto-regressive time series model is non-linear, does it still require stationarity?

Thinking about using recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting. They basically implement a sort of generalized non-linear auto-regression, compared to ARMA and ARIMA models which use linear auto-regression. If we are performing non-linear auto-regression, is it still necessary for the time series to be stationary and would we need to perform differencing the way we do in ARIMA models? Or does the non-linear character of the model give it the ability to handle non stationary time series? To put the question another way: Is the stationarity requirement (in the mean and variance) for ARMA and ARIMA models due to the fact that these models are linear, or is it because of something else?
