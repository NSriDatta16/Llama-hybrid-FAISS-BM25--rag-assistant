Whenever you create a class ask "what does it do?" The methods go in the class. You need to look first from the perspective of the person using your Karel. Here is myK he is a Karel oh, I wonder what he can do ... hmmm looks like a Karel can jump myK.jump(howHigh) hey he jumped wonder what else he can do ... What that person doesn't want is plethora of different object myK, mySuperK, myColouredK to do different jobs. You give him a nice coherent and complete Karel object. If you feel that this results in a very big "Karel" class, and you want further organisation then you may decompose the Karel implementation (think wheels, pens etc) to do the various tasks, but from the outside it's a Karel.
