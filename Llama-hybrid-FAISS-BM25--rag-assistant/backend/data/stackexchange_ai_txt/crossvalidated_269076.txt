Representing Text for Section Labeling While Avoiding Bias

Problem Background: I have free form text data with more or less arbitrary formatting/structure, but semantically it can be broken down like this: {header} {title} {subtitle} {article} {boilerplate} However, not all sections need necessarily have Length > 0, except {article} and {title} . Another thing to consider is that by far the longest section is {article} , often $\gtrapprox 90\%$ of the whole text. In the end I want to find those sections within a given text. The {header} is not just a line or two, it often is several lines of text unrelated to the other sections, and is usually a couple of sentences addressing the following {article} and what should be done with it. In other words the {header} is often a full email, which precedes the {article} . All remaining sections are related to the {article} section. Example Data: An example might look like this: Hello Mr. X, I've attached a new press release regarding Y and would like for you to do Z with it. If you have any questions I would be glad to answer them. Best Regards, Mr. X Awesome News Really awesome news about some stuff. A long and nicely formatted couple of paragraphs with pictures tables and whatnot follows... To learn more visit some website Or contact Mr. X Attempt: I think trying to label individual words according to the section they are in won't do me much good, not without training some deep network with millions of samples, which I don't have. I've thought about other approaches. Such as focusing purely on the structure, e.g.: Line Length #words in line Capitalization Relative Position of Line in Text Number of paragraphs ... i.e. all kinds of structure I can find in the text. This approach while, presumably, not as much as a purely word based approach would still result in a lot of bias towards the {article} section. Another thought I had was to transform the text labeling into an image segmentation problem. Since, most of the time, the sections could be easily divided with four horizontal lines if converted into a picture, and the font type/size plus other formatting and position indicators would also help. Question: Could you maybe point me in a possible direction I could take to tackle the problem ? What would be a good model ? Is there maybe some paper which discusses text part segmentation as I want to do it and how to avoid bias ? Is the problem maybe not a good fit to be solved through a ML approach ?
