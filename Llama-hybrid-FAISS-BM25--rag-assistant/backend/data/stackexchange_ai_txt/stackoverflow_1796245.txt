I would strongly suggest that you write the code for both and time it. It's pretty simple to do this and you'll get an answers that is not a generic "rule of thumb" but instead a very specific answer that holds for your problem domain. Vance Morrison has an excellent post about micro benchmarking, and has a tool that makes it really simple for you to answer questions like this... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc500596.aspx If you want my personal "rule of thumb" then it's that RegEx is often slower for this sort of thing, but you should ignore me and measure it yourself :-) If, for non-performance reasons, you continue to use Regular Expressions then I can really recommend two things. Get a profiler (such as ANTS) and see what your code does in production. Then, get a copy of the Regular Expression Cookbook... http://www.amazon.co.uk/Regular-Expressions-Cookbook-Jan-Goyvaerts/dp/0596520689/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1259147763&sr=8-1 ... as it has loads of tips on speeding up RegEx code. I've optimized RegEx code by a factor of 10 following tips from this book.
