Grails: update view on data change

What I would like to do is to update a .gsp page on data is change. Something like this: http://weichhold.com/2009/07/20/updating-multiple-page-fragments-with-grails-and-ajax/ but here the content page doesn't change on data changes. There is a easy way to do this?
