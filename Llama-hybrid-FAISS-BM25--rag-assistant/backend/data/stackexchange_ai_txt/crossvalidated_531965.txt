What is the "lower bound average gain" metric used in GMM stopping criterion used in Scikit learn?

In Scikit Learn's GMM class, it says that GMM training algorithm stops according to the "lower bound average gain" https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html After some digging, almost all references to this term traces back to this doc. Does anyone know what this function might be alluding to? I think knowing the precise stopping criterion for GMM is quite important in practice.
