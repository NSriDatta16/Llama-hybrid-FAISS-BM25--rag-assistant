I think there is a split between MLers (classifier) and statisticians ([logistic] regression). [I don't think regression trees are good probabilistic classifiers] - I am on the logistic regressin side I would say from a business perspective I would agree with that statement ( you don't want to retrain the model everytime the business changes their threshold.... Its easy to get a classification from a probabilistic classifier, but getting probabilities from a random forest etc is not. all the methods suggested are basically hacks (see eg https://people.dsv.su.se/~henke/papers/bostrom08b.pdf ). In addition these non probabilistic models have problems with typical real world problem of 'rare' classes (do I have cancer?) so it is suggested to eg undersample your data etc.. However, regression trees are not trained to output probabilities ( they use some other metric AFAIK) so I wouldn't recommend them. In addition trees make the assumption of full 'non linearity', so you will need many more splits to achieve a continuous output - as opposed to a classifier tree, which in the limit only has to split the data into 2 groups. so if you want to use trees then a classifier is likely to work better than regression tree; if you are not tied to trees then I would suggest logistic/multinomial regression (with nonlinear inputs) or NNs.
