Does this series have a unit root?

I am trying to figure out whether my time series is stationary or not. In order to do so I run four different tests: the three test from the Dickey-Fuller test (standard, drift and trend) given by the library urca and function ur.df and one corresponding to the Augemented Dickey Fuller test adf.test (library "tseries"). Here is how my time series looks like: And here are the outcome from the tests: I) UNIT-ROOT TEST (NO DRIFT, NO TREND) x = ur.df(AC.HousePrices, type = "none", selectlags = "AIC") summary(x) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) z.lag.1 -0.12044 0.04723 -2.55 0.01195 * z.diff.lag -0.24261 0.08544 -2.84 0.00526 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.03546 on 128 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.135, Adjusted R-squared: 0.1214 F-statistic: 9.985 on 2 and 128 DF, p-value: 9.338e-05 Value of test-statistic is: -2.5499 Critical values for test statistics: 1pct 5pct 10pct tau1 -2.58 -1.95 -1.62 II) UNIT-ROOT WITH DRIFT x = ur.df(AC.HousePrices, type = "drift", selectlags = "AIC") summary(x) Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We can reject the null hypothesis in the first two tests and accept the alternative hypothesis since the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical values. This will indicate that the series is stationary. Moreover, these results are in a 95 percent confidence interval. Nevertheless, the third test seems to indicate that at the 95 percent confidence interval we cannot reject the null hypothesis, which will indicate that the series is NOT stationary. On the other hand, the augmented Dickey-Fuller test seems to indicate that the series is nonstationary (large p-value that does not allow rejecting the null hypothesis). The question then seems to be if the series has a drift and a trend. If it does, then the series is not stationary, but if it does not, then it is. Si there any way, to determine whether or not it has these two components?
