You have a binary response. That is the important part of this. The count status of your explanatory variable doesn't matter. As a result, you should be doing some form of logistic regression. The part that makes this more difficult is that your data are clustered within just four participants. That means you need to either use a GLiMeM, or the GEE. This is a subtle decision, but I discuss it at some length here: Difference between generalized linear models & generalized linear mixed models in SPSS . Depending on the options that your software affords you, you may also have to un-group your data, so that you have a ( very long ) matrix where the response listed in each row is a 1 or a 0.
