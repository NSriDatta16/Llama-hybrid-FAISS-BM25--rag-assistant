On Unix-like systems, dynamic linking can make life difficult for 'root' to use an application with the shared libraries installed in out-of-the-way locations. This is because the dynamic linker generally won't pay attention to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or its equivalent for processes with root privileges. Sometimes, then, static linking saves the day. Alternatively, the installation process has to locate the libraries, but that can make it difficult for multiple versions of the software to coexist on the machine.
