How to calculate likelihood for a bayesian model?

I am trying to do Bayesian posterior predictive checking, whereby I calculate the DIC for my fitted model, and compare to DIC from data simulated from the fitted model. I can get the DIC out of winBUGS, however I am not sure how to calculate the likelihood (for the DIC) outside of winBUGS (i.e., without fitting new models). All of the literature is quite general with respect to discrepancy functions for model checking, and have notation like p(D|theta) which I understand, but doesn't help me when I want to actually do the calculation. Given a set of parameter values, and a Y_rep data set - how do I calculate the likelihood?
