The Free Pascal compiler supports Object Pascal and it says you can call a Pascal library from a C program . With luck this will be as good as embedding. That what you're looking for? (If not, you can translate Standard Pascal to C with p2c , a Pascal-to-C translator that is available from Debian, among other places. But having used p2c , I can't recommend it, and I don't think it understands Object Pascal.)
