So, it turns out that this was being caused by a side effect of how my XML was structured. The XML I was applying to the TextFrame contained a number of tags which seemed to confuse the layout engine when assessing the overflows. I ran my XML through a script to replace the tags with &#x2029; (the paragraph separator character) and it works fine now.
