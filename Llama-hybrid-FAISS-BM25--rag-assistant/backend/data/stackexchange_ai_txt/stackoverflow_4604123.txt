Create UIToolbar in UIViewController without navigation controller

I have create a nib that is a UIViewController and have drag a UIToolbar to my interface using the nib. I have make the necessary link of the toolbar in nib to the IBOutlet UIToolbar class variable. When I run the app, the toolbar did not appear. Am I missing out something? I have also create the @property and @syntesize for the class variable. Thanks.
