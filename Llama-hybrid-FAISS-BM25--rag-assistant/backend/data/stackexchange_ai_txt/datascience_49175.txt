Use char-rnn . I used it to make a Twitter bot, @peopledex , that generated Pokemon descriptions based on names, but you could easily reverse the fields. Examples - the bit before the colon is the name (input), after is the description (output). Dribbur: Thought for evolution, it seeks the coming of sprays. The area basisones from behind. Convictur: It rests when it evolves into a hundred special magnetism. As a result, the magma courses through its body glows. Litigant: It slicks virious trees and was reanimated from a fossil. It can compresse minute silk that was reanimated from the light The descriptions don't make much sense, but with names that would be less of a problem. The nice thing is that working with fictional generation there's no wrong answers.
