In linear regression models (aka OLS), you can interpret the estimated coefficient(s) as the percentage change in case $y$ and $x$ are log-transformed using the natural log (see this post "Both dependent/response variable and independent/predictor variable(s) are log-transformed" or see also this post ). For a model like: $$ log_e(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log_e(x) + u,$$ the interpretation would be: "if $x$ changes by one percent, $y$ changes by $\beta_1$ percent on average". This also works in a multivariate setting (with more than one $x$ ).
