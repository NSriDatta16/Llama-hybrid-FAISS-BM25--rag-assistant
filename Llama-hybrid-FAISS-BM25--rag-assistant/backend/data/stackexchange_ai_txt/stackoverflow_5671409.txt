Regular Expression GUI?

I've just started looking at regular expressions, and they are pretty cool. They are also pretty annoying looking, and I really don't want to 'learn' them if I can avoid it. Which is why a nice gui would be great. I'm looking for something intuitive, where you can drag and drop 'condition boxes', select which conditions you want them to select for, get a list of things that your conditions go against, etc. Something which makes building regular expressions easy... heh If anyone knows of anything, let me know! Edit: Thanks for all the responses. After looking at some, I googled questions based on them and found this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89718/is-there-anything-like-regexbuddy-in-the-open-source-world Quickrex seems to have alot of the stuff I want (although not as good as some), plus its integrated into eclipse, which is the IDE I use at the moment.
