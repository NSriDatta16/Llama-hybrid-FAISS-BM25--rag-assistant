I do not think Rave Reports has any inbuilt function which converts numbers to works. However, I have found a article, which explains How to Convert Numbers (Currency) to Words , on About.com. Have a look at the ConvertToWords function in the NumberToWords unit. You could convert the number and pass the words to the report at runtime. Edit: You can pass parameters to your reports like this. RvProject.Open; RvProject.SelectReport('ParametrizedReport',False); RvProject.SetParam('Name','Leonel'); RvProject.Execute; RvProject.Close; Have a look at the Introduction to Rave Reports article.
