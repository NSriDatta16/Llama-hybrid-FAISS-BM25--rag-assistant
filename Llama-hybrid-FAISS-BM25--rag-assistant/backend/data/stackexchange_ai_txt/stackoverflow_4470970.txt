I tested using the Microsoft Interop Forms Toolkit 2.1 which made it possible to create a UserControl that could be embedded as an OCX (visible ActiveX control). Registry writing turned out to be necessary since managed COM components cannot set the OCX flags needed for embedding using registry-free COM (these flags are only available for native COM). After programmatically adding an "object" tag to mshtml in the C# mshtml host, I could get to the HtmlObject instance and its @object property to get to the managed UserControl subclass and add additional child controls. Oh, and I made sure to register the control both in the 32-bit and 64-bit parts. The only thing that still bothers me is the dependency on the registry...
