Personally, I've never trusted any system to return an exact order unless that order is specifically defined. If you really need an order, then use a dictionary aka 2dimension array and assigned a place value (0,1,2,3...) to each value in the list. If you apply this rule to everything, you'll never have to worry about the delivery/storage of that array, be it XML, JSON or a database. Remember, just because something happens to work a certain way, doesn't mean it does so intentionally. It's akin to thinking rows in a database have an order, when in fact they don't unless you use an ORDER BY clause. It's unsafe to think ID 1 always comes before ID 2 in a SELECT.
