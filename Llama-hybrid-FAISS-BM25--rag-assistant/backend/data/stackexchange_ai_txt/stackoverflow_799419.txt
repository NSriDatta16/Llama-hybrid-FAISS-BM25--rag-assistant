I second Rodrigo's recommendation of looking at the installation guide. However, I'll also add that in most live environments you'll want to do a good security planning before installing, as a secure and functional deployment can be complex. In particular, play close attention to the permissions required by each person interacting with BizTalk (sysadmins, sql admins, etc) and make sure you define separate accounts for each service / host and how they should be configured. Normally, you'll deploy BizTalk with at least two separate machines (one running SQL server for the databases and one running BizTalk itself). This requires that you define your BizTalk accounts and security groups before hand and that you create them in your AD infrastructure before deployment, so make sure you get that right. Even if you're going to deploy everything to a single server, make sure you use domain accounts for everything and don't skip the security planning. This will make it a lot easier to later move to a multi-server deployment without having to start from scratch.
