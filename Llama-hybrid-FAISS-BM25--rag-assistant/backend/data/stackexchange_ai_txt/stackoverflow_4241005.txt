XML Sitemap Too Big?

Having an XML sitemap is important for SEO, but should I limit the pages that are listed in the file? Here is my situation: My client wants a high school biology review site. One of the features is a 'Word of The Day', which is a specific word, a 2 sentence quick explanation, and a separate 2-3 paragraph explanation with pictures. I'll anticipate 250-400 total 'words of the day'. There will be an index that lets you view any of these words you want, in addition to today's word. Essentially, each of words' big explanation is a separate page. My question is, should I make a separate XML sitemap entry for each of these? Overall, that could make the sitemap over 400 entries. I'm inclined to do it, since my understanding of SEO is that the more you list items, the higher likelihood they will be indexed. Thoughts?
