Difference between missing data and sparse data in machine learning algorithms

What are main differences between sparse data and missing data? And how does it influences machine learning? More specifically, what effect sparse data and missing data have on classification algorithms and regression (predicting numbers) type of algorithms. I'm talking about a situation, where percentage of missing data is significant and we can't drop the rows containing missing data.
