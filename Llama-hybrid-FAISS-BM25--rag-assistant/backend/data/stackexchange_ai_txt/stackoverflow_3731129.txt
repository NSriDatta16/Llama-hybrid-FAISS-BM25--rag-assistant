How do structures work in Java?

In c++, one could simply do something like this: struct GraphObject { Color color; double value; String name; }; However in Java, I can't simply do this, I only see creating a class just for this as an option. What I do not like about that is then I need to drag around GraphObject.java and Graph.java (since Graph will hold an ArrayList of GraphObject. Is there a way to put the object class in with Graph.java or is this simply impossible/bad practice? Thanks
