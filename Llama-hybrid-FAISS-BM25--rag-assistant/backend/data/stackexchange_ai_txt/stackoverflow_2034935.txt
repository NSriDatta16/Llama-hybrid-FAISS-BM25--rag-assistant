Changing Java EE version in Netbeans

I downloaded Java EE 6 and it installed with no errors. I am attempting this tutorial from Sun: http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/jsf-jpa-crud-wizard.html The problem is that I have no idea how to change Netbeans to allow me to use Java EE version 6. I am still only offered 5. This is where I downloaded Java EE 6: http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp How do I get Netbeans to recognize the newer version?
