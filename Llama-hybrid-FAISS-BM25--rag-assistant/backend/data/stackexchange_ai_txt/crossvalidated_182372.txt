I see no way of using the delta method, but ... Reading about the convergence of the empirical distribution function we read that the central limit theorem gives us: $\sqrt{n}(\hat{F}_n(x)-F(x)) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,F(x)(1-F(x)))$ We can use this to create varying CI's around each $\hat{F}_n(x)$ : $\hat{F}_n(x) \pm 1.96\frac{\hat{F}_n(x)(1-\hat{F}_n(x))}{n}$ , since $E(\hat{F}_n(x))=F(x)$ , $\hat{F}_n(x)$ is our best estimate of $F(x)$ . Using the following R-code: #confidenc ebands calculation: sim_norm epsilon ) leq 2*exp(-2n*epsilon^2) # set alpha to 0.05 and alpha=2*exp(-2n*epsilon^2): # --> epsilon_n = sqrt(-log(0.5*0.05)/(2*n)) # #lower and upper bands: L #using clt: U2=(1:n/n)+1.96 sqrt( (1:n/n) (1-1:n/n)/n ) L2=(1:n/n)-1.96 sqrt( (1:n/n) (1-1:n/n)/n ) lines(sim_norm_sort, L2, col="red") lines(sim_norm_sort, U2, col="red") We get: We see that the red bands (from the CLT method) gives us more narrow confidence bands. EDIT : As @Kjetil B Halvorsen pointed out - these two types of bands are different types. I had @Glen_b explain exactly what he meant: Very different kinds of confidence bands. With a pointwise confidence band you'd expect a number of points outside the band even if it was the distribution from which the data were drawn. With simultaneous bands you wouldn't. If you have a 95% pointwise band, on average 5% of the points for the correct distribution would be outside the bands. With simultaneous bands, there's a 5% chance that the point with the biggest deviation is outside.
