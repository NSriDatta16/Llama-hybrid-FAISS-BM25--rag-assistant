Can everything be done programmatically in WCF or are configuration files for certain features?

I have a strong preference for working in code, leverage IntelliSense and opening up all of the power of the C# language to work with WCF but I want to make sure that I'm not moving in a direction that ultimately will limit the WCF feature set I can access. My experience is so limited with WCF that I don't understand the benefits of using the configuration files, especially if you can do everything in code (?). Note: I'm using .NET 3.5. Can you do 'everything' with WCF programmatically or are configuration files required for the full WCF feature set?
