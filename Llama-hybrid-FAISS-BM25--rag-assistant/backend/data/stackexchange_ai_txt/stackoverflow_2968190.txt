How to select saxon TransformerFactory in Java

In my web application I need to use Saxon TransformerFactory in order to use XSLT 2.0 but I can't use setProperty method because I don't have this right on the web server and there is a Security Manager. So I have read that it should be possible to do this: Use the Services API (as detailed in the JAR specification), if available, to determine the classname. The Services API will look for a classname in the file META-INF/services/javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory in jars available to the runtime. I found this file in WEB-INF/lib/saxon9.jar but when I istantiate a TransformerFactory, the default factory is always selected instead of a Saxon factory. How can I select Saxon Transformer Factory? Thanks
