Reference for Two-level Logistic Regression

I am an undergraduate student . In this level , we aren't taught Multilevel Logistic Regression. But my project topic is Multilevel Logistic Regression and I am working with only two-level . What I know only to use the glmer() function in R to estimate the fixed and random effect parameters . But I don't know , when to use which types of residuals , though R has given the reference Davison, A. C. and Snell, E. J. (1991) Residuals and diagnostics for the usages of each type , I didn't get the pdf of the reference . Also I haven't any theoretical background of estimation procedure . Would you please give me some online reference so that I can conduct my project issue sample size determination in Multilevel Logistic Regression fairly well ? Thanks ! Regards .
