The results of LOOCV are supposed to be aggregated and averaged in some meaningful way, depending on whether it's a classification or regression problem. That is how good your model is at predicting new values. You mentioned coefficients and standard errors... CV is done for predictive purposes, not for interpretation or coefficient estimation.
