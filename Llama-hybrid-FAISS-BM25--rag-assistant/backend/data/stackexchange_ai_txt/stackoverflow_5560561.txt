My recommendation would be to stay with IsolatedStorageFile for this kind of purposes, because it will provide better performance for large data sets in general for your app. If you do want to switch to IsolatedStorageSettings, it is very to use as it is just a key/value pair storage. So if you represent the data part of your note as an object, you can store/retrieve it in the settings simply by assigning it a unique key. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage.isolatedstoragesettings(VS.95).aspx
