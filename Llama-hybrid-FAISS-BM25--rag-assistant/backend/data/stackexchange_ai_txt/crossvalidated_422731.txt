I like that table, too. To me, your modifications are unnecessarily restrictive. One can ask questions about population risk or subpopulation risk using predictive models. For example, one might want to answer, for a population with certain qualities, what is the average expected risk? You may ask whether population-level or aggregate individual-level factors affect the risk in a population. Your model may not even be for individual risk (i.e., the units may be counties, for example), or even if it is, the goal of the analysis is to compute the effect of a variable on subpopulation-level risk (e.g., using a multilevel model). One may also be interested in individual causal effects. Designs like interrupted time series or synthetic control get at individual causal effects, and some big data analysis methods allow you to estimate individual causal effects from standard treatment-outcome data (with many covariates observed). Some causal inference techniques are also concerned only with the existence of a causal effect in a sample (e.g., randomization inference-based methods), with no population to generalize to. It's still coherent to ask these kinds of causal questions that don't refer to populations. I would not say the primary distinction between predictive and causal methods is on whether the target of inference is an individual or a population. Although many predictive methods are particularly well suited for making predictions at the level of the individual and many causal inference techniques focus on making population-level inferences, these are not the only applications of these methods, and either can make claims about individuals or populations.
