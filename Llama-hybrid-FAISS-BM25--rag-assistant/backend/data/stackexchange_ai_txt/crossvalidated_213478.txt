Number of neurons in the output layer

In a classification problem, how do you decide on the number of output neurons you have in your neural network? Is the number of neurons equal to the number of classes you have? Is there a limit on the total number of output neurons that you can have in the output layer? My network seems to have thousands of output neurons. What are the disadvantages of having a large number of neurons?
