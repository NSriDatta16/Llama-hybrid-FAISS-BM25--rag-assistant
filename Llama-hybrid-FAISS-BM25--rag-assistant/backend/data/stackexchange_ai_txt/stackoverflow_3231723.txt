How would I drag UITextView around the view screen?

I have a project where a UITextView (for multilines) can be dragged around the screen. So far my solution to this has been an overlay of an invisible UIButton which when dragged its center is the same as the UITextView's center. However I've seen apps that seem to just allow the UITextView to be dragged and edited on the fly so it seems there might not be an overlay in those but I'm not sure. Thoughts? By the way, c in this code is the UIButton and this is how I have moved it thus far: - (void) draggedOut: (UIControl *) c withEvent: (UIEvent *) ev { if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait) { c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; AddedText.center = c.center; } else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown) { c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; AddedText.center = c.center; } else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft) { c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; AddedText.center = c.center; } else if(self.interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight) { c.center = [[[ev allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; AddedText.center = c.center; } }
