In my opinion, you should be able to integrate your database with the standard aspnet_db reliably, but I would advise against duplicating or replacing the aspnet_users table. That is the focal point of all the providers that use the aspnet_db schema, including custom providers that may augment but do not implement custom replacement. To maximize reuse of strong tested infrastructure code in the provider stack/API it is best to go with that flow. You will want to be very attentive to any modified membership core functions and ensure that the way your new constraints behave in an expected fashion in each case. The facet of the membership story that I have found needs the most attention is deleting a user, and a simple modification/addition to the delete user sproc can manage this capably.
