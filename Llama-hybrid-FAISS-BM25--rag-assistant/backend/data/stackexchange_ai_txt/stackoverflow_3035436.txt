Nasty redirect loop in WordPress (trailing slash, no trailing slash, and so on)

I read a ton of pages and tried lots of solutions but none have worked yet! My problem is that: test.asifa.net/asifa-wp Redirects to: test.asifa.net/asifa-wp/ Which redirects to the first page. What's a little bizarre is asifa-wp produces: 301 Moved Permanently Moved Permanently The document has moved here . Whereas asifa-wp/ produces an empty page but the following headers (curl -v output): * About to connect() to test.asifa.net port 80 (#0) * Trying 69.163.203.138... connected * Connected to test.asifa.net (69.163.203.138) port 80 (#0) > GET /asifa-wp/ HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.18.2 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.18.2 NSS/3.12.0.3 zlib/1.2.3 libidn/0.6.14 libssh2/0.18 > Host: test.asifa.net > Accept: */* > .htaccess looks like: # BEGIN WordPress RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /asifa-wp/ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /asifa-wp/index.php [L] # END WordPress Any help at all would be tremendously appreciated!!!
