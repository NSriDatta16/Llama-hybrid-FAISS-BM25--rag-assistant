You have a bad problem with HTML. In HTML you don't need more than one submit button. A submit does not submit a field, but a whole form . You don't even need it, as most user-agents will submit a form if you press Enter on a textfield. Anyway, your fields will have an attribute name , unique within the form, and shall have an id attribute unique within the document. When they are sent, all data can be accessed in PHP as an array. The superglobal $_POST in your case, or $_GET if that method was used to submit it. There, you do your magic.
