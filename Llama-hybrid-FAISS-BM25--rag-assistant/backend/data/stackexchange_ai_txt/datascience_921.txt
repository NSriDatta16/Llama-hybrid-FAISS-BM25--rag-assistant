Avoid iterations while calculating average model accuracy

I am fitting a model in R. use createFolds method to create several k folds from the data set loop through the folds, repeating the following on each iteration: train the model on k-1 folds predict the outcomes for the i-th fold calculate prediction accuracy average the accuracy Does R have a function that makes folds itself, repeats model tuning/predictions and gives the average accuracy back?
