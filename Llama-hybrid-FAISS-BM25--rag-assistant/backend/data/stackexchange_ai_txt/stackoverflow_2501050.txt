Attach XML object to REST POST in asp.net REST starter kit

I'm using the REST starter kit in asp.net for the first time and having a bit of trouble. I've created some XML... String newOrganizationStrin = " "; XmlDocument newOrganizationXml = new XmlDocument(); newOrganizationXml.LoadXml(newOrganizationString); Then I create an httpClient... HttpClient http = new HttpClient("https://companyname.capsulecrm.com/api/"); http.TransportSettings.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("APIKEY", "PASSWORD"); Now I need to use http.POST() to post the xml to the correct URL. The overloaded method I need I think is (string url, httpContent body). So I guess the missing piece of the puzzle is how to convert the xml to an httpContent, which I can't seem to instantiate. Any ideas? Jon
