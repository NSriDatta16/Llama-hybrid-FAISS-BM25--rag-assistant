hCard address with a 'care of' (c/o) element

Say I've got an address like this: Foobar Widget Team c/o ACME Widgets Inc. 123 The Drive Someplace Town BN1 1AB I want to mark this up as an hCard but I am not sure what class names I should apply to the two organisation names. Foobar Widget Team might be a group of employees who get together and run a local football team, supported and sponsored by ACME but not officially an organisational unit of ACME - they're just using ACME as the mailing address. So what is the best way of expressing this using hCard? I thought of using the AGENT property, but that seems to apply to a person rather than an organisation acting on behalf of another. Organization-unit isn't quite right either as, strictly speaking, Foobar Widget Team isn't a unit of ACME. How else might I mark this up?
