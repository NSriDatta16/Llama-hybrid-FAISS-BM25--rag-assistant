How to perform a repeated measure CFA

My purpose is to verify that a specific scale is unidimensional, and that the one dimensional structure is persistent over time. I have a 10 item scale, about 200 cases and score values at two different time points. It would be simple if it was only one measure: I would split the data in half, I would perform PCA in one half and CFA in the other half, an approach that indeed is working well for the first measure. However, I would like to somehow provide a measure that the unique factor structure is persistent over time. How can this be done?
