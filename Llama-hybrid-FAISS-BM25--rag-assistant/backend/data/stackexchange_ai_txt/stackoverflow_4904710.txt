There should be an efficient way using a 2-D array on the client-side (php) to achieve the pivoting. To address Ken Downs' concerns about byte pushing, a ragged raw pivot data consumes less bytes than a fully materialized 2-D pivot table, the simple case is cows | pigs | sheep | goats | country 1 null null null Canada null 2 null null USA null null 3 null Egypt null null null 4 England which is only 4 rows of raw data (each being 3 columns). Doing it in the front end also solves the issue of dynamic-pivoting. If your number of pivot columns is unknown, then you would require a MySQL procedure to build up a dynamic sql statement of the pattern "MAX(CASE....)" for each column. There are advantages to doing this on the client side can be done (at least considered as an alternative) can be rendered earlier, if the savings in network traffic is significant despite requiring either (1) php pivottable construction or (2) client side javascript does not require a MySQL procedure for dynamic pivoting
