canvas moved on startDrag() without calling set x/y or move() - how does startDrag() exactly work in as3/flex?

i have an .as class that extends mx.containers.Canvas (it's a draggable border of a resizable component), it becomes draggable on MOUSE_DOWN and stops being draggable on MOUSE_UP , MOUSE_OUT and ROLL_OUT . before calling startDrag() i create a Rectangle to define the drag area, i also have a _dragging: Boolean variable to control if it's draggable at the moment. the problem is that when i click this border it jumps to a negative coordinate without calling startDrag or switching _dragging to true . i've overriden get x , set x , get y , set y and move() methods in order to solve it but the only thing i got was the fact that position changes without calling coords setters or move(), but at the moment it's changed a getter is called and returns new (negative) value so my question is what happens on startDrag() and how to filter unwanted incoming coords values?
