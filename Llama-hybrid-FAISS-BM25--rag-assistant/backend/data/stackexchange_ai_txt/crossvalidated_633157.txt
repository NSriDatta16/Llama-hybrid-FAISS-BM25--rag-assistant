Welcome to CV. Your question is an interesting one. My answer addresses the two specific questions in the body of your question: "I'm wondering why we need to kind of "discretize" our judgements using hypothesis tests. Why can't we just, every time a study is done, have people report the data, and the p-values and effect size, and then report how the data altered their subjective probabilities?" Regarding your first question, it is very common in applications for hypothesis testing to be used inferentially. For example, perhaps reporting statistical significance at the 5% level and simultaneously supplying the p-value. There may not be any formal decisions as such. Supplying the p-value allows readers to make their own judgements about the evidence. Your second question proposes a mixed procedure that reports frequentist calculations (p-values, estimated effect sizes) along with requiring researchers produce and report Bayesian posterior probabilities of the hypotheses. As background, in my view, frequentists are interested in modelling the data-generating process itself but they are usually not interested in modelling their own uncertainty about that process. That is the key divide between frequentists and Bayesians, (and that is also why many scientists are instinctively non-Bayesian). Implementing your proposal would raise some serious practical issues: How do you coerce unwilling scientists and statisticians into modelling their uncertainty using prior probabilities when that is not the form that their uncertainty takes? How do you make the scientific community or even the general community value Bayesian posterior probabilities? (How should Julie view Bobâ€™s posterior probability?) Most studies are multi-authored, so I guess there would need to be a prior probability meeting prior to data collection at which they should all report their priors, or perhaps they could try to negotiate a compromise prior? What happens if they cannot reach a compromise? Presumably each author's priors and posteriors should be published. Also, should they also provide calculation software with the final report so future readers of the report can input their own priors? In short, this does not sound like a positive approach for science. However, my comments are not meant to be criticisms (although they are likely to be unpopular). Well done for asking such a thought-provoking question.
