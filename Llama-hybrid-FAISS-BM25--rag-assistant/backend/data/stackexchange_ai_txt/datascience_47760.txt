From Keras repo.: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. And Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. We recommend the TensorFlow backend. So Keras is a skin (an API). TensorFlow has decided to include this skin inside itself as tf.keras . Since Keras provides APIs that TensorFlow has already implemented (unless CNTK and Theano overtake TensorFlow which is unlikely), tf.keras would keep up with Keras in terms of API diversity. Therefore, I would suggest to go with tf.keras which keeps you involved with only one, higher quality repo. instead of two, which means less headache. Which one do you choose?! tf.kerasâ€¬ .
