How can I isolate the effect of an event on a sequence of sales numbers?

I have a sequence of integers that represent total sales of my product for each day. From time to time, we have large press or marketing events that increase sales on the day of the event and for a few days after that but then eventually taper down to the long-run average. Here's some made-up numbers showing what I mean: 34, 40, 35, 36, 150, 110, 140, 107, 80, 68, 75, 50, 45, 35, 38, 41, 42,... ^^^ ^^^ event occurs here reversion to mean I have limited experience with statistics, so I'm looking for some guidance on statistical methods that I could use to determine: how much of the sales on the event day and the following days should be attributed to the event whether the press or marketing event contributes to a permanently higher sales average, even after its initial effect has worn off.
