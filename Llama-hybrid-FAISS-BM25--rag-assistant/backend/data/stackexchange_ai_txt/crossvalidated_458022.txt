Use vegdist function before metaMDS?

I am trying to do calculate beta-diversity of bacterial community data. I have been following numerous tutorials regarding this subject and I am getting mixed advice. I am trying to calculate beta-diversity and illustrate using NMDS plot. Some people would say that you have to calculate beta-diversity first using the vegdist function from the vegan package like this: bray_dist However, there are people saying that vegdist is included in the metaMDS function and it can be calculated like this: beta_nmds_bray = metaMDS(OTU, distance="bray", k=2) Naturally I am getting different results and am confused about which route is correct. I also read that this approach is also representitive of beta-diversity, but not sure. I think it is part of PERMADISP? bray_dist Any advice would be appreciated!
