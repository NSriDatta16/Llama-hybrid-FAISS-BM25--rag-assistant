you can put code wherever you want, but typically you want things organised. heres how i do it: 2 assemblies MyProject.Domain this contains all my domain code; business logic and entities MyProject.Web this contains controller code, views and assets like css/images Your HtmlHelpers belong in the .Web project because they are mvc related (nothing to do with the domain). You probably want a new folder called Helpers or Extentions. Its really up to you, the key point is to decide where something belongs and to namespace it accordingly
