I want to click a button to toggle div slideUp & slideDown and quick anywhere else on the page to close the div

I have a button #clickme. When clicked a div #cart slides up, when clicked again it slides down. I also want to be able to close it by clicking anywhere else on the page apart from #cart or #clickme. The code I've attempted doesn't quite work. What happens now is that when I click #clickme, it slides up and then back down again quickly. I imagine what is happening is that the click event is triggered at both the document and #clickme levels, causing one effect after the other. What's an elegant way around this? $('#clickme').click(function() { if ($("#cart").is(":hidden")) { $("#cart").slideDown("slow"); } else { $("#cart").slideUp("slow"); } }); $(document.body).click(function () { if ($("#cart").not(":hidden")) { $("#cart").slideUp("slow"); } });
