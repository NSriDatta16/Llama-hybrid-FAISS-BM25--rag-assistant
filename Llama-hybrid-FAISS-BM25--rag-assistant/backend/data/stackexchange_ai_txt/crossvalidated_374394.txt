If you use x , your child sets would be $C_1=[0,0,0,0]$ and $C_2=[1,1,2,2]$ . In $C_1$ , you've 2 samples from class 0, and two samples from class 1; which yields entropy $1$ . In $C_2$ , the situation is same. You have no information gain. When x is applied, one child's entropy is $0.918$ as you stated (6 samples); and the other has $0$ entropy. The average entropy is $0.688$ . Your information gain is $0.312$ .
