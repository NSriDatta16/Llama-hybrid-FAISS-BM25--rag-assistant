This is a hard problem if you really care about getting it right. You'll find that NLP parser packages probably provide this functionality. If you want something faster, you'll need to end up duplicating some of that functionality with a trained probabilistic function of a window of tokens (you'd probably want to count a line feed as a token, since i may drop a period if it's the end of a paragraph). Edit: I recommend the Stanford parser if you can use Java. I have no recommendation for other languages, but I'm very interested in hearing what else is out there that is open source.
