The first example is more "easy to read". Actually, in my opinion you should only use the second one whenever you have to add some "else logic", but for a simple Conditional, use the first flavor. If you are worried about the long of the condition you always can use the next syntax: if(ConditionOneThatIsTooLongAndProbablyWillUseAlmostOneLine && ConditionTwoThatIsLongAsWell && ConditionThreeThatAlsoIsLong) { //Code to execute } Good Luck!
