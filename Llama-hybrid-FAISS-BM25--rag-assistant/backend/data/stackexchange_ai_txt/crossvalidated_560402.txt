In general association among trained weights and class-imbalance is not that easy to establish. One way to overcome the imbalanced dataset and see how weights are changing, is using transfer learning, use balanced version the train first and then continue training with the unbalanced version of the dataset. However, this is an open research, see a survey article Survey on deep learning with class imbalance .
