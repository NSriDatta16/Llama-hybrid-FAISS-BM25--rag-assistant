SQL database queries basic question AVG Difference

I have a really basic question on SQL. Relational Schema: Student (Sid, Sname ) Class (Sid, ClassName, mark) ClassName = { MATH, ENGLISH, PHY, .......} I want to list out all the student who have taken MATH, and their MATH class average minus the student's math mark Select DINSTINCT S.Sname, (E.Mark - AVG (E.Mark)) From Student As S, Class As C Where C.ClassName = 'MATH' AND S.Sid = C.Sid I don't know how to do difference; I don't think this is right; can someone tell me how to fix this?
