Look into the concept of Granger causality which deals with precisely this. Basically you do a predictive model of one variable to the other. Then you run a hypothesis test to see how much of the variance in the output was explained by the input variable. If enough variance is sufficiently explained, then you can say that temperature 'Granger causes' disease. Note g-causation is weaker then causation because both variables could be influenced by a third unobserved variable. However, this is in principle the best you can do with only two time series....
