Lucene.Net is an information retrieval library, not a search engine. In particular it won't do any of: Crawl web pages or parse sitemaps Reporting HTTP-based administration pages SQL Server support (Lucene.Net uses its own simple but highly effective file format, and doesn't use SQL Server) Although I'm a strong supporter or SQL and would recommend it as the full-text search component of a search engine, you will also need a crawler / html parser component in order to create a full functional search engine, and you are going to have to carefully design your Lucene.Net indexes to maximise the performance of the queries that you want (searching by language/locale) Try looking at the Solr project which is a fully fledged search engine using Lucene - this might be more suited towards your needs.
