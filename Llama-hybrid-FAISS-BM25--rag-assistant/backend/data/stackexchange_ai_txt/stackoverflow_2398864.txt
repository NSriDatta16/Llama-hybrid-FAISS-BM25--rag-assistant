This document is a little more detailed than the links you listed. It's dated September 2009 but I believe is still mostly accurate. http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9703594 One key paragraph from this document is: Analysis Services, Replication, Reporting Services , and Service Broker are not currently provided as services on the SQL Azure.
