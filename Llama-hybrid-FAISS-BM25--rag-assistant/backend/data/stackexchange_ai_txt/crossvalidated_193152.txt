Does logistic regression determine the direction of the association?

I've conducted a logistic regression in which a binary outcome was the dependent and some continuous factors were entered as independent variables. First: Can this model determine that the independent factor will proceed the dependent factor or do we just have associations (since I conducted a case-control study by which I can't determine the causality)? Second: if the odd ratio is 1.22 of the continuous variable (Biomarker) and the outcome is the binary outcome (vitamin deficiency or obese patient). How can I interpret this results? Finally, when I entered other risk factors to the model do I interpret the result as dependent and independent risk factor?
