I think you only have two options here: Use the 'Exclude From Project' feature. This isn't ideal because the project item will be excluded from any integrated IDE source control operations. You would need to click the 'Show All Files' button on the Solution window if you need to see the files in Solution Explorer, but that also shows files and folders you're not interested in. Use a post-build event script to remove any project items you don't want to be published (assuming you're publishing to a local folder then uploading to the server). I've been through this before and couldn't come up with anything really elegant.
