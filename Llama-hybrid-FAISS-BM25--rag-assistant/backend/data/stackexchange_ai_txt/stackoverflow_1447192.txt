From this link: http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20021016.asp Performance InProc - Fastest, but the more session data, the more memory is consumed on the web server, and that can affect performance. StateServer - When storing data of basic types (e.g. string, integer, etc), in one test environment it's 15% slower than InProc. However, the cost of serialization/deserialization can affect performance if you're storing lots of objects. You have to do performance testing for your own scenario. SQLServer - When storing data of basic types (e.g. string, integer, etc), in one test environment it's 25% slower than InProc. Same warning about serialization as in StateServer. So it would seem that StateServer is a little faster that SQL Server for storing session state. In terms of the why, I'd suggest that the SQL Server is more multi-purpose and will likely be used for other things as well. Not only that but the storage mechanism is to disk, where as the StateServer is running in a separate process, yet it is simply storing the data in the memory space of the other process rather than having to write it to disk (virtual memory permitting)
