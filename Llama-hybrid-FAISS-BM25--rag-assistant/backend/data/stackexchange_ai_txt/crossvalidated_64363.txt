The second reference you give is, in my opinion, still the best book on NN, even though it might be a bit outdated and does not deal with more recent developments like deep architectures. You will get the basics right, and become familiar with all the basic concepts around machine learning. If you go through the book, you will need linear algebra, multivariate calculus and basic notions of statistics (conditional probabilities, bayes theorem and be familiar with binomial distributions). At some points it deals with calculus of variations. The appendix on calculus of variations should be enough though.
