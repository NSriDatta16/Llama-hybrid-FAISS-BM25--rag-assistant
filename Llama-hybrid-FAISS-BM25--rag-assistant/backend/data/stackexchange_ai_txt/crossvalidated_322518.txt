Frank Harrell , in his 'Regression Modeling Strategies' (2015) offers a range of possible modeling strategies (section 4.12, if you are able to obtain a copy), some of which may be considered facetious ('develop a black box model that performs poorly and is difficult to interpret'), but he then goes on to develop a strategy for regression models which provide accurate predictions, and then discusses how this model may be improved to allow accurate effect estimation, commenting 'estimation of effects for these models must involve accurate prediction of overall response values'. Effectively it seems doubtful that you can have an accurate estimate of the value of a predictor's effect size if you don't have a model that accurately predicts your target. Harrell points out some useful considerations needed to ensure that a model providing good accuracy can provide good estimates of predictor effects. For example, one is strict attention to interaction effects. Another is the role of imputation for missing data, especially if a variable whose effect size is a high priority has many missing values e.g. it might be sensible to impute the missing values if model accuracy is the only goal, but not sensible if estimating that particular effect is the goal. At the same time, the above implies that it is possible to achieve a level of accuracy with respect to the target without having achieved accurate estimates of each predictor's effect. You also mention causal analysis, and one of the commenters rightly observes that you can achieve accurate estimates of correlations without accurately understanding causal relationships. Overall, it begins to look like a hierarchy, where a strong predictive model forms the foundation for accurate estimation of predictor effects, and accurate predictor estimates of predictor effects could then be the beginning of an analysis of causation. Then the answer to your main question is 'yes, it is legitimate to use the coefficients from a predictive model for inference, under the condition that the model has been analysed carefully to ensure the legitimacy of the effects estimates'.
