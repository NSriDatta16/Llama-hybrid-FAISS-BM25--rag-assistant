Making machine learning predictions for individual users

Currently a student, I am fairly new to machine learning. I am developing a classification model in python which has ratings history of a 100 users for a specific movie, I have a total of 20,000 rows. I have split my train and test dataset and have build a few models that achieve decent accuracy. My problem is: I want to train and test the data for individual customers using their customer_id. For example, while making predictions my model should only train on the rating history of a single user and make predictions based on training on the same data. The user_ids are randomly generated 15-character long including both numeric and text. I tried including the user_id as inputs during training but the model would'nt accept that. Please help :)
