There are some things you should do like use generics instead of objects to avoid boxing/unboxing and also improve the code safety, but the best way to optimize your code is to use a profiler to determine which parts of your code are slow. There are many great profilers for .NET code available and they can help determine the bottlenecks in your programs. Generally you shouldn't concern yourself with small ways to improve code efficiency, but instead when you are done coding, then profile it to find the bottlenecks. A good profiler will tell you stats like how many times a function was executed, what the average running time was for a function, what the peak running time was for a function, what the total running time was for a function, etc. Some profilers will even draw graphs for you so you can visually see which parts of the program are the biggest bottleneck and you can drill down into the sub function calls. Without profiling you will most likely be wrong about which part of your program is slow. An example of a great and free profiler for .NET is the EQATEC Profiler .
