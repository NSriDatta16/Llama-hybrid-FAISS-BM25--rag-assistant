On the information given (ReportDate, CampaignID, ZipCode) or (ReportDate, ZipCode, CampaignID) seem like better candidates for the clustered index than a surrogate key. Defragmentation would be a potential concern if the time taken to rebuild indexes became prohibitive but given the sizes I would expect for this table (10s or 1000s rather than 1,000,000s of rows per day) that seems unlikely to be an issue.
