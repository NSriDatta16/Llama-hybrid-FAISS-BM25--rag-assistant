It is standard-complaint. The issue was brought to the attention of the ISO C++ committee in relation to problems with offsetof implementations that broke on this. Amongst the solutions considered were tightening the POD definition, or adding an extra restriction on types to be used with offsetof . Those solutions were rejected when the reinterpret_cast solution was brought up. Since this offered a standard-compliant way around the problem, the committee did not see a need to add extra requirements to the offsetof , and left fixes to the implementations.
