Changing reference level on mixed model changes pMCMC value

I'm using an lmer on a set of continuous data. This post helped me a great deal when interpreting results, as I have two conditions and three levels as well, but I've run into a frustrating problem. My data is from French speakers in two conditions: 1) with an English interviewer and 2) with a French interviewer. They are either intermediate, advanced, or native proficiency. When the reference level is "Eng/Intermediate," I get different pMCMC values than when the reflevel is "Fr/Intermediate," between the same groups. I starred what should be the p-values for Intermediate vs. Advanced in the French condition as an example. The first set of R output is with group = eng and proficiency = intermediate as the reflevels, and the second is with group = fr and proficiency = intermediate as the reflevels.
