I partially disagree with what @shimano said The variability of the samples generated which you mentioned in your question isn't really a function of the latent distribution The sampling space is very crucial for the GANs results. For instance, sampling $z\sim\mathbb{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ where $\sigma=1$ or $\sigma=10$ would ends up quite differently even when you dataset is not natural images (i.e. MNIST). The intuition behind this is where your prior ($z$) has very small STD it would create very similar results but with relatively high quality and on the other hand too large sigma would tend to create more versatile images but with relatively low quality. I am sorry that I don't have any reference for this statement but I explored a bit this area of prior sampling so it isn't only a gut feeling.
