Following up on Peter's response on ensemble methods: This is covered in "The Elements of Statistical Learning" (see page 288, for example). Witten and Frank "Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques" covers this in section 7.5, including a discussion of Bagging, Randomization, Boosting, Additive regression, Additive logistic regression, Option trees, Logistic model trees, and Stacking. This is covered in Chapter 14 of Christopher M. Bishop "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" , including Bayesian Model Averaging, Boosting, Committees, Tree-based Models, and Conditional Mixture Models.
