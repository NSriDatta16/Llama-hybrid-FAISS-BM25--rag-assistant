I prefer scapy for this kind of application. It's a powerful python package that allows you to capture, manipulate and transmit packets at various layers of the protocol stack. There are several ways to perform your man-in-the-middle attack. I'd probably use the "sniff" function with a filter that captures packets from Host A. I would then specify a callback (via the "prn" parameter) that modifies the packet and retransmits it to host B using "sendp". Note that scapy also includes a built-in "arpcachepoison" function.
