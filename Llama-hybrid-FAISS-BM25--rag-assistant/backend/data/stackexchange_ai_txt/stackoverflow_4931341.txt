From what I can tell, the Google Translate Android app does not expose any standard Intent s that you could use (it's a pitty, but it's weird at the same time. You'd think Google would encourage this type of interaction between apps.. anyway). However, it seems Google have opened up the translate API via a web service . This way, you can do the translation yourself and show it within your app. It's a bit more work, but it should do the job. You could look at google-api-translate-java if you want to spare yourself from writing an API wrapper.
