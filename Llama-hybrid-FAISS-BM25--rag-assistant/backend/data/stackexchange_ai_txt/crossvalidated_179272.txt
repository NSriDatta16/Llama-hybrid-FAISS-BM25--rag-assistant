learning shared weights

I have a classification problem with 100 variables measured during 5 conditions, so 500 features. Some conditions are more informative than others, so I would like to have a learner that learns weights for every condition (5 weights, shared across features) and then use those weighted means (100) for a classification preferably by SVM. I have no idea how to do it, any pointers will be appreciated.
