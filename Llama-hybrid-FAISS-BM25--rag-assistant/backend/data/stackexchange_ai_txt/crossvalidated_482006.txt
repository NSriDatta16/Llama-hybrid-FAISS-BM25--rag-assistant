This can happen when your data are not independent but instead have some dependence structure. For example, consider homes from across the country with some being in large expensive cities while some are in more affordable small towns. Homes in the same locale are likely to have similar prices and to have prices vary similarly. Overall, we may not care explicitly about a given locale: we just want a model for something we think is stationary like sale price per square foot of living space. We might then estimate a fixed effect for each town or locale to compensate for differences in the mean price per square foot. However, we might only care about the divergences of price/sqft from the overall average, and we may want to allow for uncertainty in pricing that is related to locale. One way to model this is to have a random effect for the town or locale. This doesn't affect the fixed parameter estimates, but it does tend to account for the data not all being independent. (Random effects are a way of doing correlation modeling.) Thus standard errors are larger. I suspect if you had included random effects or done some correlation modeling, your confidence intervals would be closer to what you see with the bootstrap. Finally, the fact that your data are not independent also can bias the bootstrap estimates. It is possible that a better model which accounts for correlations or random effect would have larger confidence intervals than your bootstrap intervals.
