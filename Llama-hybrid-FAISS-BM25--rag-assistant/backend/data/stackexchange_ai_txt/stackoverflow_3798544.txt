I think the reason you get the runtime error is because you're testing/compiling it against Android SDK 1.5. If you aim for 1.5 compatibility, you also need a default "drawable" folder, as of the official documentation, ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and nodpi modes were added with API Level 4 (Android 1.6). http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html ldpi: Low-density screens; approximately 120dpi. mdpi: Medium-density (on traditional HVGA) screens; approximately 160dpi. hdpi: High-density screens; approximately 240dpi. nodpi: This can be used for bitmap resources that you do not want to be scaled to match the device density. Added in API Level 4. Edit: If I'd be you, I'd simply rename the drawable-ldpi folder into drawable folder and store the ldpi files in drawable
