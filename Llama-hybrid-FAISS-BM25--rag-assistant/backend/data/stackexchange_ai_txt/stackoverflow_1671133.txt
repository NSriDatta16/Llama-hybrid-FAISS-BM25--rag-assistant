Step A: Calibrate your Librarian. Pick a random book in the library, walk to a random spot and then ask the Librarian if the book (whose location you know) is to your left. Keep testing the Librarian until you have a good estimate of the probability, p, that Librarian answers correctly. Note that if p If you find that p depends on the question asked (for example, if the Librarian always answers certain questions correctly, but other questions always falsely), then go to Step B1. Step B1: If p==0.5 or p depends on the question asked, start thinking outside the box, like Beta suggests. Step B2: If p Step B3: If p > 0.5: Choose N. If p is close to 1, then N can be a low number like 10. If p is very close to 0.5, then choose N large, like 1000. The right value of N depends on p and how confident you wish to be. Ask the Librarian the same question N times ("Is the book I'm looking for to my left"). Assume for the moment that whatever response is given more frequently is the "correct answer". Calculate the average response, assigning 1 for the "correct answer" and 0 for the wrong answer. Call this the "observed average". The responses are like draws from a box with 2 tickets (the right answer and the wrong answer.) The standard deviation of a sample of N draws will be sqrt(p q), where q = 1-p. The standard error of the average is sqrt(p q/N). Take the null hypothesis to be that p=0.5 -- that the Librarian is simply giving random responses. The "expected average" (assuming the null hypthesis) is 1/2. The z-statistic is the (observed average - expected average)/(standard error of the average) = (observed average - 0.5)*sqrt(N)/(sqrt(p*q)) The z-statistic follows a normal distribution. If the z-statistic is > 1.65 then you have about a 95% chance the average response of the Librarian is statistically significant. If after N questions z is less than 1.65, repeat Step B3 until you get statistically significant response. Note that the larger you choose N, the larger the z-statistic will be, and the easier it will be to obtain statistically significant results. Step C: Once you get a statistically significant response, you act upon it (using George Stocker's binary search idea) and hope you have not been statistically unlucky. :) PS. Although the library might be 3-dimensional, you could play the Binary Search game along the x-axis, then the y-axis, then the z-axis. So the 3-dimensional problem can be reduced to solving 3 (1-dimensional problems).
