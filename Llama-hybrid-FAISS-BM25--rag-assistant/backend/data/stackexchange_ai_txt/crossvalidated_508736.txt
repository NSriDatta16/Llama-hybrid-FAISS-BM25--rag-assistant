difference of means of non-normal data using Bayesian model

I have two distributions, group 'c1' and 'c2' that are not normally distributed, but rather log-normal: Now, I'd like to compare the means between 'c1' and 'c2' using bayesian methods, as described in John Kruschke's paper "Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test" ("BEST") see here To model the distributions I used pymc3, simply using an uniform prior on the mu and sigma parameters The trace plot looks fine (0 divergences) so at the end I look at the difference between the posteriors of mu and sigma parameters of the two models, but also at the difference between the means given by $e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2}$ : In all three plots it's clear that 0 is outside HDI, thus 'c1' are 'c2' different. So my questions is: Does this model make sense to analyze the difference in means between groups 'c1' and 'c2'. If yes, does it make sense to show the difference between the calculated posterior means or is showing the difference between $\mu$ s and $\sigma$ sufficient?
