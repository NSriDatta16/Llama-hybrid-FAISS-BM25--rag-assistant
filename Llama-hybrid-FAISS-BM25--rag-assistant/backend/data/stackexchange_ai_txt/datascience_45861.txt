TensorFlow has two ways of processing image data Built-in Image Ops ( https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/image ) tf.keras Pre-processing ( https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/ ) Feature extraction is at pixels / channel level. Higher level features (Such as Edge / Contrast) are learnt typically by CNN layers. If needed, you can feed Image Data + Features extracted by OpenCV to TensorFlow.
