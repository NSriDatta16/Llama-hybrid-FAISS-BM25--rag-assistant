If I keep visiting the same code over and over again when fixing bugs, I figure it's time to refactor it. If I've joined a new project or become responsible for new code, I also sit down and start refactoring. If I am extending something, then prior to any big changes I refactor out all of the old problems first (before they become too ingrained). You've finished refactoring when you've reached some targeted level of normalization . If it's just general clean up: 1,2 or 3 is good enough. If you're extending the code, then 4 or 5 are better. If you're really trying to leverage the existing work over a long period, then 6 is the way to go. Paul.
