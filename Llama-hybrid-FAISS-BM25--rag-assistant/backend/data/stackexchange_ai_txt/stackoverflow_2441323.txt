Create a Flex Library project and put the code in the /src folder. Click on project properties-> Flex Library Build Path -> Classes to make sure all your classes are included. You can set the 'Output folder' here to point to your main project /libs folder to have it automatically build into your project or just drag the .swc manually when it's created from your 'Output folder' to the 'libs' folder of your project. Hit the [OK] button and your .swc will be created. The code is now available in your main project.
