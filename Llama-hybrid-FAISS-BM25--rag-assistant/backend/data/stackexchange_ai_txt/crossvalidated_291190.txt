I do not believe that you can predict regime change and that is what is happening in 2008. There is nothing in the model that stands as a parameter for this differential shift in a model that just uses time-series procedures to capture the past. I discuss the underlying problem in this piece https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256801634_The_practice_of_quantitative_methods which distinguishes between open and closed systems defined in a realist sense. It is possible with a closed system - a simple machine, the clockwork universe, an experiment in which closure is achieved by design - to get unchanging regularities that make for successful predictions. In open systems the system is itself capable of changing so the gearing ratios of the machine changes and predictions are now much more difficult. Human systems - here the economy - are capable of self-change so successful prediction is hard. I remember as a beginning postgrad many years ago a seminar debate between Fred Smith who taught Box-Jenkins time series analysis at Southampton and a visiting speaker - Oliver D. Anderson of the Civil Service College. The former expected a time -series approach should be capable of forecasting real change - the latter did not. I side with Anderson as the procedures are black box and given little insight to what is happening in a changing world.
