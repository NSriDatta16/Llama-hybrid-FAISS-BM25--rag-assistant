Memory Validator can do this. There are several different reports that you will find useful: Running Totals. This is presented as a dialog box and provides current, cumulative and total values for each of the main memory allocator (C runtime, HeapAlloc, LocalAlloc, GlobalAlloc, CoTaskMemAlloc, etc). Objects. This is one of the main tabs and displays object type, size, count, cumulative. Also subtabs for per-thread and per-dll values. Sizes. This is one of the main tabs and displays size, count, cumulative. Also subtabs for per-thread and per-dll values. Virtual. This displays a graphical view of memory (one pixel == one page of memory) and has subtabs showing detailed virtual memory data for virtual memory pages and virtual memory paragraphs. Full disclosure: I am part of the Memory Validator team.
