Time series analysis in R

I carried out a log transformation on some data about patient admission in the hospital, aiming to generate an additive model. I went ahead to forecast the same data using: MYFORECAST = forecast.Arima(auto.arima(admission, d=3, D=NA, stationary=FALSE, seasonal=FALSE, ic="aic", trace=TRUE, allowdrift=FALSE, allowmean=TRUE) in R. I got the forecasts but I was left wondering: Should report the forecasts or take exponent of the values?
