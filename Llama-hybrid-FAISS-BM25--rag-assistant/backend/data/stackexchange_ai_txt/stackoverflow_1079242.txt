Formatting with HTML rather than CSS is considered deprecated these days. Anyhow, if you ever have issues with standards compliance rejecting your in-line formatting, follow the following easy search and replace rules: Replace with Replace with Replace with Replace with aka Replace with Keywords for font-size: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large Roughly the same. If you will just follow through with these easy replacements, you will experience...! All the joys of standards compliance! (Bragging rights.) None of the benefits. (This CSS isn't going to get modified from a single .) All the pain of excessive standardization (Wait, which formatting rule does this tag undo again? Shit.) More bandwidth consumption! (The price of progress, as soon as someone clues me in on how this helped anything.) Decreased browser support! (Y'know those folks who still use old browsers or minimalist browsers like LYNX , Links , w3m , OffByOne , etc.? Eh... who cares?) Oh yeah... Addendum : More seriously, because these days many standards purists just have a hard-on for pure CSS. Most of the support behind CSS obviating regular markup generates simply from it being modern so you should get with the times. Other support comes from the notion that CSS is inherently more maintainable and completely overlooks unmaintainable messes like what I suggested above. It's not that I have anything against CSS. The point here is that a lot of people preach the standard excessively and will condone it even when it's used in wildly inappropriate ways. The notion of replacing regular HTML tags with inline formatted CSS as I mentioned is genuinely viewed as progress by far too many advocates of CSS. They seem to view upholding the standard, the pattern, the design rule, as being some kind of inherent good rather than rationally looking at it. Inline formatting has its place, and I think using regular HTML tags for it is fitting and much more readable. Those adherents are like the folks who tell you gotos are evil and you should never, ever use them. The ones who will look at a regular stack-esque wind and unwind and instead use an indented if statement clusterfuck going ten layers of indentation and repeated code deep. And, they will genuinely view their version as more readable and maintainable even though by any sane standard it clearly isn't. For more on that tangent: http://kerneltrap.org/node/553/2131
