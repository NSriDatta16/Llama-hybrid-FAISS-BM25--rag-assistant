Two possible causes come to mind: the shortcut was deleted. It won't be recreated until the user redownloads the application and runs the installation. To do so, have the user clear the java cache via the control panel, and redownload your JNLP. shortcut creation is disabled in the java control panel settings. Turn it back on (Advanced -> Shortcut creation tab). Edit : actually since you're getting an error message, what I said above shouldn't normally apply. Maybe it's simply a Windows Security issue? Does the user have write access to the Desktop?
