Assuming you have three entities: Party (superclass) Person (extends Party) Organization (extends Party) where the last two are the two entities you store with a discriminator column, your JPA-QL query should be as simple as: select p from Person p to get all people. JPA is smart enough to figure it out. Likewise you can do: select p from Party p and get all of them.
