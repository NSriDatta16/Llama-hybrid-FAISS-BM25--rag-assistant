How can I make this visual resource scheduling effect (like this picture) using JQuery and/or JQuery Plugins?

I need to visually represent multiple resources (vertically) and the time of the day (horizontally) as shown in this mockup: I need to be able to drag and drop the colored boxes into different available time slots. I also need to be able to display text in the boxes. We are using JQuery already (and FullCalendar ) for a lot of other scheduling functionality in our website. How can I make this effect with a JQuery PlugIn or JQuery itself?
