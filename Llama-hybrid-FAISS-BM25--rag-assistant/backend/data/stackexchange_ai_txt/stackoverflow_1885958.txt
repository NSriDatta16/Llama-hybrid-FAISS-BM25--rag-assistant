Not sure what kind of answer you're waiting for, but you seem to be right, in both cases. For the second point : the idea is to get code coverage for all your PHP files, even those in which there is no tested code : this way, you get some "real" code-coverage (and not only the code coverage on files that are used by tested code) . and the exclusions are here so you don't have code-coverage for the frameworks -- there is no point in testing the frameworks, and considering the huge amount of code there are made of, it would influence your code coverage a lot.
