Extrapolating from a filtered data set

Imagine the following hypothetical machine learning for classifying benign/malignant cancer tumors. The doctors want to minimize the number of patients they call in for tests. They had an original data set of size 10,000 but based on the features chose only to examine those they expected to have cancer; 1,000 patients. If I train a machine M on the 1,000 data points (out of which only 100 are yes), what do I know about M? what does M tell me about an instance from the original 10,000 data points? how well does M work on new data points that are not chosen by doctors? Is the data set useless?
