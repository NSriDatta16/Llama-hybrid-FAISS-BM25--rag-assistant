Since you quote Joel Spolsky, I take it your aware of his "Law of Leaky Abstractions"? I'll mention it for future readers. http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html Green & Blackwell's Ironies of Abstractions talks a bit about the effort of learning the abstraction. http://homepage.ntlworld.com/greenery/workStuff/Papers/index.html The term "astronaut architecture" is a reaction to over-abstraction. I know I certainly curse abstraction when I haven't touched Java or C# in a while and i want to write to a file, but have to instance a Stream...Writer...Adaptor....Handler.... Also, Patterns, as in Gang Of Four. Seemed great when I first read about them in the mid-90's, but can never remember factory, facade, interface, helper, worker, flyweight....
