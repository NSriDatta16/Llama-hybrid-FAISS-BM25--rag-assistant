Caret retraining of neural network after finding optimal parameters?

I am applying a neural network and logistic regression to a classification problem. In order to evaluate the performance of the two classifiers I'm using 5-fold cross-validation (roughly 800 samples in the test data for each fold). Using caret I am finding the best parameters for my ANN in an inner loop in the cross-validation (roughly 600 samples in test data for each fold). However, I would really like to get a better understanding of how caret handles this. Seeing as neural networks can benefit from retraining in order to avoid local minima I would like to do some retraining. I am not sure whether caret does this after having selected the optimal parameters or simply trains the model once on the larger sample of test data (800 samples) with the found parameters. Can anyone clarify this for me? EDIT: And if it doesn't do any retraining, how can I do this in the best possible way? Code: library(caret) library(nnet) tunGrid Thank you!
