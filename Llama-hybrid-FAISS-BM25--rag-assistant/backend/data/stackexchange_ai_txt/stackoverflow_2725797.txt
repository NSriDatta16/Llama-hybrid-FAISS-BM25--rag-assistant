I believe this blog post describing how read from a PDF file using C# is what you want. This is the example he gives of grabbing text from the PDF: using System; using org.pdfbox.pdmodel; using org.pdfbox.util; namespace PDFReader { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { PDDocument doc = PDDocument.load("lopreacamasa.pdf"); PDFTextStripper pdfStripper = new PDFTextStripper(); Console.Write(pdfStripper.getText(doc)); } } } Here is what looks like an exhaustive and highly organized list of how to read PDFs with C#. If what you need is some form of embedded meta data, as Mark suggested, I'm sure it's also possible with the to fetch using the tools I've linked to.
