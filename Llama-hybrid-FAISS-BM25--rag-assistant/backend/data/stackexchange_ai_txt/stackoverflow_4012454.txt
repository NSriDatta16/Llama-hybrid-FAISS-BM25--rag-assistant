For non-FTP ....Follow the link from D Lambert above for info on installing from within wordpress using a zip file (for non wordpress.org hosted plugins). Basically in plugins menu click Add new / Upload Bear in mind the following though when using zip upload: if the plugin has been zipped at the folder level, not at the lower file level, it will appear to install, but then you may get an invalid plugin header message. it is not invalid.. more details here: http://webdesign.anmari.com/2312/activation-error-plugin-does-not-have-valid-header-still-activates/ Also if upgrading zip file must be named exactly same as existing folder, else a new folder will be created with duplicate plugin.
