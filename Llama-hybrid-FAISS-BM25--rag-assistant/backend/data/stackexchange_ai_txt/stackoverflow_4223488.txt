Memcached and php sessions problem

I have 2 servers running each one instance of repcached. Php is configured to save sessions there. The 2 servers are replicated for redundancy The problem is that I am doing some benchmarks with ab. Running ad -n 10000 -c 500 http://mysite I am getting some errors in the apache error log that failed to write session data Looking at the listen_disabled_num at both servers it is 0, so no connections are not served By the way I have max connections set to 4096 Any ideas? Thanks
