“S3 dictates the CNAME host” Amazon has a CDN service called CloudFront , that uses an S3 bucket for storage. You only pay for S3 data transfer (I think). Your bucket contents are copied to Amazon’s CDN, meaning superfast access from around the world. However, because it’s a CDN, files are automatically cached for a long time (so there’s a delay when re-naming or deleting files). Just using an S3 bucket, and setting up another domain to point to the bucket via a CNAME, might be the best idea.
