Be really careful when using PCA on discrete values such as likert scales. PCA is designed for continuous variables, not for discrete values . There is a high chance that you will discover artifacts from the discrete scale . In fact, the vector looks susceptible much like the frequencies of the 5 answers, or something like this... If you would share more of what you've been doing, it would be easier to help you.
