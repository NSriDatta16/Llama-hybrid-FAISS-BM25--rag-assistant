In principle it's fine, but you are not using the full power of your data though, since you use only the 15 averages and not the rest of the data. You are testing the null hypothesis of whether $ _i = 0$ (with $i$ from 1 to 15), where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are random variables. If you compute not only their means but also their variances, you can compute the total variance using the fact that the variance of the mean is the mean of the variance (and not only the sample variance of your means), the t statistic and the p value yourself. EDIT (after discussion with @whuber): This approach holds as long as the sample sizes do not get widely different, so that the data can be assumed to be identically distributed. This article proposes a paired T test for non iid data.
