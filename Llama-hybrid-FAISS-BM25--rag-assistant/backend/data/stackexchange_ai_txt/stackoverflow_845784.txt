You haven't mentioned the option of using a Model class to fetch the data. That's the "M" in MVC. :-) A Model class is one that has an interface the View can use to request specific fragments of data. Inside the Model class, it may use a mix of using Zend_Db_Table methods, and also custom SQL queries (executed directly through Zend_Db_Adapter 's query() method). Whatever works to get the data. The point is that a Model encapsulates all the logic needed to supply data in a format the View can use. See also " An Introduction to Domain-Driven Design " at Microsoft. " Domain-Driven Design " by Eric Evans.
