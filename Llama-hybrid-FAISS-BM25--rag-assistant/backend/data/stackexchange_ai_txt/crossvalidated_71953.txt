Relative efficiency of Wilcoxon signed rank in small samples

I have seen in published literature (and posted on here) that the asymptotic relative efficiency of the Wilcoxon signed rank test is at least 0.864 when compared to the t test. I have also heard that this only applies to large samples, although some books don't mentioning this (what's with that?). Anyway, my question is, how small do things need to get before the above paragraph no longer applies? In my case I have 4 pairs of data. If all assumptions hold, I know I have at least 90% power to detect an effect size of 2SD under the paired t test if I use an alpha of 0.1 and have moderately correlated data. However, I would like to use the Wilcoxon signed rank test due to the small sample size and inability to check assumptions but I'm concerned the test will have too little power if I do. Thanks!
