Removing duplicate entries from MySQL database

I have a table with 8 columns in, but over time I have picked up numerous duplicates. I have looked at the other question with a similar topic, but it does not solve the issue I am currently having. +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | id | market | agent | report_name | producer_code | report_date | entered_date | sync | +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ What defines a unique entry is based on the market, agent, report_name, producer_code, and report_date fields. What I am looking for is a way to list all the duplicate entries and delete them. Or to just delete the duplicate entries. I have thought about doing it with a script, but the table contains 2.5mil entries, and the time it would take would be unfeasible. Could anybody suggest any alternatives? I have seen people get a list of duplicates using the following query, but not sure on how to adapt it to my situation: SELECT id, count(*) AS n FROM table_name GROUP BY id HAVING n > 1
