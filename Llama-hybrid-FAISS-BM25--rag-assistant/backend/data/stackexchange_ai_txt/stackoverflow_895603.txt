In your situation it can give you at least four additional benefits: 1) It will serve as additional backup storage . 2) If you accidentally add bugs you can easily return to the previous stable version . 3) If you accidentally add a bug or break something - you can see differences between your current source code and last commited source code - the VCS will show you the differences in a very suitable and demonstrative way - and you will easily find the change that caused the bug or the problem. This one is very useful. 4) You can easily review your modifications before committing . Believe me, you can be surprised :) Sometimes you just do something automatically, not thinking very much, or you can be tired. In this case, if you review your modifications later - you can find mistakes or bad code . Good luck!
