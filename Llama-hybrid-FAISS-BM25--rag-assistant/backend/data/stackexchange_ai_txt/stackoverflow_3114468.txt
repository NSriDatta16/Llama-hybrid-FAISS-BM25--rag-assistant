If I force IE 8's Developer Tools to be "Browser Mode: IE 8" and "Document Mode: IE 7 Standards", is it now IE 7 or IE 8?

If I serve a page using using HTML 4.01 strict, and load this page into IE 8, then the IE 8's Developer Tools shows that it is using: Browser Mode: IE 8 Document Mode: IE 7 Standards Well then, is IE 8 using partly IE 8 engine and partly IE 7 engine? Which part is IE 8 and which part is IE 7? HTTP_USER_AGENT is showing as: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) so I'd imagine it is not "totally" IE 7.
