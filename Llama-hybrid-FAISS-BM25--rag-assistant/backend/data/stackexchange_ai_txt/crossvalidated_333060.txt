What is an example of an event for which frequentist probability doesn't apply?

I'm on the hunt for an example to illustrate the difference between frequentist and subjective Bayesian probability. In particular, I'd like a type of event for which frequentist probability doesn't make sense. This is the example I have: What is the probability that it will rain on March 14th, 2018 in London UK? As far as I know, there can be no long-run relative frequency for this event. One could, of course, approximate this by asking "The probability it will rain on any March 14th in London UK", but as far as I can tell that is different. Does this example make sense? Is there a better one?
