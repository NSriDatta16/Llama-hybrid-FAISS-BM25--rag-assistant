The only case i've seen that handles missing values is the case of XGBoost, but then again, if you have samples that have missing values on some features, and in the real-world, you'd expect full inputs , i suggest you omit those samples. Even if you find something that works , generally relying on one feature and neglecting the others for prediction indicates that either you have a bad model or a bad problem formulation.
