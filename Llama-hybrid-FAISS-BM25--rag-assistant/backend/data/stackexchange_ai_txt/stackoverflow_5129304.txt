I don't know if you've tried the library ultimately pointed to in this answer: DOM parser that allows HTML5-style tag Html5lib solved the same issue you're experiencing for me (it was the and tags triggering my issues) I was using this to parse html fragments, and the advantage is that it was a drop-in replacement for DOMDocument, as currently it uses DOMDocument as the output object, so no other functionality was broken in my implementation. There is a note in the documentation that they are looking to move away from DOMDocument in the future. html5lib for PHP can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/downloads/detail?name=html5lib-php-0.1.tar.gz&can=2&q= In the answer linked to above , there are further details on usage.
