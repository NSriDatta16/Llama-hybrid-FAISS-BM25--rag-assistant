In Sutton & Barto, vectors are considered column vectors by default. So if you have this kind of product: $$\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}^T$$ where $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are $d$ dimensional vectors, it does not calculate the scalar product. Instead it treats both vectors as matrices and calculates a matrix product, which will be a $d \times d$ matrix because you are multiplying a $d \times 1$ matrix by a $1 \times d$ matrix. Worthing noting that the scalar product can also be calculated as a $1 \times 1$ matrix if follow the same matrix multiplication rules but with the first vector transposed instead: $$\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{b}$$ which leads to multiplying a $1 \times d$ matrix by a $d \times 1$ matrix. This is why the value function approximation can be written as $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_t$ (there is a small liberty taken of assuming a $1 \times 1$ matrix is the same as a scalar value in terms of notation).
