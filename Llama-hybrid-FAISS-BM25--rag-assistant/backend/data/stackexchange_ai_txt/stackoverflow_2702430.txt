Curl (*nix) upload file to ASP.NET

I have an old redhat 8 box that I need to pragmatically send files to my webserver from. Disregarding the security issues with this, I've come up with the following way. curl -F file=@ http://webhost/reciever.aspx The problem is, no matter what I try, the ASP.NET page is not accepting the file. What am I doing wrong?
