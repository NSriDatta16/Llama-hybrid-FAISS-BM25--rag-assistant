The significance of two categorical variables on students' scores

I am analysing a set of students' scores on a Maths test. My data set includes 41 students. I have the students' marks on each question of the test. I have the gender of each student. I also have whether each student studies Physics or not. The first five rows of my data set: I am particularly interesting in students' performance on question number 9. The question carries a maximum of ten marks. Boys earned on average 2 marks more than girls on this question. Students who study Physics earned on average 1.9 marks more than those who don't study Physics. 20 boys study Physics and 9 girls study Physics. I want to know whether gender had a significant effect on students' scores on question 9, or whether the difference in boys' and girls' average scores is driven by the fact that more boys study Physics. Is there a test that I can perform? (My sample size may be too small at the moment, but more students will be sitting the test in future, so my data set will grow.)
