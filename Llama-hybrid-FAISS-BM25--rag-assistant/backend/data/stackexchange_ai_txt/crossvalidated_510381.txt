What mathematical background do I need to do research in field of deep learning

I am familiar with few deep learning models and I understand how (little bit why) CNN/RNN works. But I still cannot make sense of new research papers. I want to dive deeper into field of deep learning specifically reinforcement learning. How should I approach learning mathematics as a self-learner? My Background: I'm familiar with high school mathematics (basic integration/differentiation/limits etc.). I know just enough of deep learning to understand what different layers/optimization functions means. I have participated in one kaggle competition Deepfake Detection Challenge and got 132th place on leaderboard. I have fairly good grasp on programming. What Do I want to achieve: I want to be able to read research papers and understand what they're trying to convey with intuition. Able to reason about new reinforcement learning algorithms. Design new algorithms Currently What I'm planning to do (in order): calculus from CALCULUS WITH ANALYTIC GEOMETRY Linear algebra book by Gilbert S. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Book by Christopher Bishop Probability (suggestion from comments) Statistics (suggestion from comments) Optimization (suggestion from comments) -> All with help from various MIT OCW and youtube videos I value every suggestion and I'm ready to devote however much time it takes. Also I understand that I'm aiming too high here so I'm open to any advice related.
