Your cast of (T)(object)0 won't work if T is double ... it will throw an InvalidCastException when it tries to unbox a boxed int to double . I suspect what you actually want is default(T) , which gives the default value of whatever T is - so null for a reference type, zero for numeric types etc: return ind == -1 ? default(T) : this.elem[ind].value; As a side-note, I'd encourage you to try to stick to .NET naming conventions, including PascalCase for methods. Three other options: Use Nullable as suggested in other answers Follow the TryXXX approach of returning a Boolean value to indicate whether the element was found, and have an out parameter to receive the value itself Use a modified version of the TryXXX pattern where you return a Tuple instead of using an out parameter
