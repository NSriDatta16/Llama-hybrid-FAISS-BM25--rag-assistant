How do I remove every occurance of a value from a list in haskell using Prelude?

I want to remove every occurance of a certain value from a list. I have written a function to do this: removeall val [] = [] removeall val list = if (head list) == val then removeall val (tail list) else (head list):(removeall val (tail list)) but I would like to use Prelude if possible for reasons of elegance and readability.
