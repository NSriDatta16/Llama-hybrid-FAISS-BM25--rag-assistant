How about you attack this problem in a hierarchical fashion. Say you train one network on the images. It gets around 95%, but you want atleast 98%. Then, what I would try to do, is to take that 5% that was misclassified, and then create a network that is trained on that data alone. Hopefully, this will further cut down on the number of misclassifications (although probably not as good at 95% accuracy). Now, we need a way to tell if the image belongs in the former class or the latter class. There are a few ways to do this, but as a starting point, you could train a third nerual net to find the best allocation of images to maximize accuracy. Note I don't mean to train all 3 simultaneously, as that would probably be very expensive, but to train them sequentially. Or if you can find common features between the classes, you could build something like a bayesian net which determines the best allocation.
