Assuming that you are working in a centralized version control system (such as Subversion), and assuming that you have a concept of "the trunk" (where the latest well-working code lives): If you work on new features in "features branches"/"experimental branches", then it's OK to commit code which is far from finished. (When the feature is done, you commit the well-behaving result into the "trunk".) But you will not win a popularity contest if committing non-compiling/obviously non-working code into the "trunk" or a "release branch". The Pragmatic Programmers have a book called Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion which includes a section with advice about branches.
