This is a similar approach to what I use. The difference comes down whether you want to explain or predict. Time series analysis is great for predicting, but regression is great for explaining. The two provide answers to different questions, i.e., "what" vs "why". Sometimes you can use 1 model to answer both questions, i.e., regression of time series data, although this is inefficient and less accurate. Why use a regression model when time series forecasting will suffice other than to understand the impact of the coefficients on the process?
