Time series with two interdependent variables - is it possible?

I'm undertaking another project in R and I need to run a time series analysis. It's about topics mentioned in media articles and on Twitter. I realized that most probably (and according to past research) the predictive ability goes both ways, just with different lags. I was wondering if there is any way of actually measuring the level of interdependence? From the time series I can see that, indeed, one serves as a predictor of the values of the other and vice versa (on a different time scale) - but how does one see how strong that two-way influence is? And considering that I am not a statistician, is it feasible? Thanks so much for your time.
