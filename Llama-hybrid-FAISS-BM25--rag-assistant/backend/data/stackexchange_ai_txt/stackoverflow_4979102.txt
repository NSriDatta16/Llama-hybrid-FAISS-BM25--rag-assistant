I have been working on touching and moving objects too. I started out making something move in a similar way: changing the top and left padding. Pretty quickly, as I added more moveable objects to the screen, things got a bit confusing. I would touch one spot on the screen and something else would start moving. What was going on was there were multiple overlapping views on the screen. Only the top view would receive the touch events. I found a post that suggested taking a look at the Android Launcher code and seeing how they did drag and drop. I think their approach is really good. You do have to add a ViewGroup to hold your moveable objects, but that works out. The bounds of views match what you see on the screen and you end up with no surprises. Events go to the view you expect. If it turns out you are going to have more than one moveable object, you might want to take a look at my blog post: " Moving Views In Android ". More explanations about the Android Launcher and source code are there.
