Confidence intervals around a centroid with modified Gower similarity

I would like to obtain 95% confidence intervals for centroids based on Gower similarity between some mulivariate samples (community data from sediment cores). I have so far used the vegan{} package in R to obtain modified Gower similarity between cores (based on Anderson 2006; now included in R as part of vegdist() ). Does anyone know how I can calculate 95% confidence intervals for the centroids of, for example, sampling sites, based on modified Gower similarity? Additionally, if possible, I would like to plot these 95% CIs on a PCO that shows the centroids, so it's evident if they're overlapping. To get modified Gower similarity, I used: dat.mgower But as far as I know, you don't get centroids from vegdist() . I need to get centroids, then 95% CIs, then plot them... in R. Help! Anderson, M. J., K. E. Ellingsen, and B. H. McArdle. 2006. Multivariate dispersion as a measure of beta diversity. Ecology Letters 9:683â€“693.
