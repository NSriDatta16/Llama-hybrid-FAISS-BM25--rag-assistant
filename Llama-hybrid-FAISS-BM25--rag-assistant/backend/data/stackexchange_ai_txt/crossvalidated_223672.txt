In using a neural network model, you're solving a non-convex optimization problem by following the gradient down to a local minimum from a (random) starting point in the parameter space. Some solution might be different depending on the initial value of the weight matrices. But you don't know which local minimum would an initial value lead you to. So depending on the topology of the objective function, bias could result from these two sources of randomness.
