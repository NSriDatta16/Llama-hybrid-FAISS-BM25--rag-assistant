Multi-level regression interpretation: questio of statistical significance

I am running (multi-level) logit models on hospital data testing whether the ratio two hospital tariffs has any effect on the probability of being admitted to the hospital. My models are the following: f1 where admit is a binary variable indicating hospital admission, log_ratio is the log-transformed ratio of the two tariffs, Condition2 is the condition for which the patient received treatment and provider_id is the id of the treatment provider. My results are the following: ============================================================================================================ Dependent variable: -------------------------------------------------------------- admit logistic linear mixed-effects (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ log_ratio 0.605*** 1.385* 0.012*** 0.013*** 0.012 (0.058) (0.808) (0.001) (0.002) (0.013) as.factor(Condition2)Brain Disorder 1.392 -0.001 (1.304) (0.021) as.factor(Condition2)Amputation 2.352 0.0002 (2.257) (0.072) as.factor(Condition2)Chronic pain 4.403** -0.026 (2.161) (0.055) as.factor(Condition2)Nervous system 2.391 0.006 (1.551) (0.026) as.factor(Condition2)Organ Disorder 1.114 -0.018 (1.787) (0.043) log_ratio:as.factor(Condition2)Brain Disorder -0.098 0.014*** 0.014 (0.825) (0.002) (0.014) log_ratio:as.factor(Condition2)Amputation -0.067 0.053*** 0.053 (1.741) (0.003) (0.059) log_ratio:as.factor(Condition2)Chronic pain -1.926 0.009*** 0.024 (1.230) (0.001) (0.030) log_ratio:as.factor(Condition2)Nervous system -1.537 0.005*** -0.0003 (1.050) (0.001) (0.018) log_ratio:as.factor(Condition2)Organ Disorder 0.457 0.023*** 0.037 (1.242) (0.001) (0.032) Constant -4.476*** -6.550*** 0.022*** 0.007 0.008 (0.075) (1.293) (0.008) (0.009) (0.023) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Observations 115,376 115,376 115,376 115,376 115,376 Log Likelihood -12,589.260 -12,229.590 56,636.920 56,935.280 56,935.630 Akaike Inf.

Crit. -113,227.200 -113,765.700 -113,708.100 ============================================================================================================ Note: *p My main interest is in log_ratio and whether it has any association with the probability of hospital admission. My secondary interest is whether this correlation is different per condition. Log-ratio is significant in every model (logit or multi-level logit) except for when I do an interaction effect with condition (with all main effects in the model, such as in Models 2 & 5). The variables with log-ratio then lose their significance. My question is which model do I believe? My gut feeling is that log-ratio is in fact significant, but due to small sample size per condition or some other reason it is not showing up as significant in Models 2 & 5. Could this be true? Also, could Model 4 be an acceptable specification of the model? That is, in my case, do I need to have all main effects in the model?
