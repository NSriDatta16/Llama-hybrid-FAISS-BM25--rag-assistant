Your code works fine for your example, but the file http://www.wow-europe.com/realmstatus/index.xml contains at least one item element at the time of writing that does not contain a category element. Because that node is not present, you get the exception. I'm talking about this XML at the top of http://www.wow-europe.com/realmstatus/index.xml .
