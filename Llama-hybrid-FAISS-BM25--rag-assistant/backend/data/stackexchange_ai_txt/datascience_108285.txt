The generator is only trained through the GAN. So you don't need to define an optimizer for the generator nor to compile it. When you train the generator, you actually train the full GAN. Only the discriminator is trained independently. To answer your question, the GAN parameters will be used when you train the GAN, and the discriminator parameters will be used when you train the discriminator. The generator parameters are never used and can be removed.
