importance function from randomForest package output explanation

I've been using the importance() function from the randomForest package in R but I couldn't understand what does the first two variables in the output represent.Currently I'm using the random forest for predicting a binary classification and my output variable's name are 0 and 1. Here's the output of the function: 0 1 MeanDecreaseAccuracy MeanDecreaseGini c_heavi 0.071845686 0.49215788 0.3987539746 0.1841476135 c_meet 1.794639270 0.70902200 1.6953022156 0.3745302757 c_time 0.773390581 0.67278790 0.8795774923 0.8383488173 p_communic -0.684529840 0.29631260 -0.2075788552 0.0910556260 What does the first two column represent ("0" and "1")? Also what is the unit of measure used in "MeanDecreaseAccuracy"? Thanks everybody for the help, and sorry if its a dumb question but I've been searching for a while with no results.
