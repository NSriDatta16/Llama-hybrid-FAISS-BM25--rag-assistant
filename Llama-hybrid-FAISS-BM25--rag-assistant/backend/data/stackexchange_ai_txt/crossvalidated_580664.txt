How many points should be used on time series linear regression if the time series has rapid changing trends

I am studying a time series that has no seasonal patterns and no overall trend. The trend changes rapidly over time and I want to fit a linear regression model to some windows of the series to make short-term predictions. I am aware that for a regression analysis to be meaningful, at least 25-30 points of the past should be used. My question is whether this rule of thumb would also be applicable to this case in the same way, as the trend could have changed in those 30 time steps and only the last two points would be useful. On the other hand, would it be correct to use only the last two or three points even if the errors obtained in this way imply very good results?
