Suggestions for setting up a subversion repository

Our team is just ramping up to use source control through SVN. We are currently using some test repositories for getting used to the process. We're nearly ready to put this into full time use. We build only small to medum/large web apps, most of which share the same core (but differnt on LAMP/Win), but are customized in some way. We will likely have hundreds of projects in the repository. Also, we usually do more than one project for one organization. We have LAMP and Windows developers. ( I think this makes the question somewhat different than Best practice for creating subversion repositories? ) Do you have any suggestions on how to structure the repository?
