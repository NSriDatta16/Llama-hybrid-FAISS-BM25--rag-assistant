Ordinal/continuous vs dummy variable for time series regression/data mining

Let's suppose I have a time series data that I would like to regress $y$ on $x$ and $Time$. See below for the dataset. y x time 12 100 1 14 101 2 16 102 3 18 103 4 20 201 1 22 202 2 24 203 3 26 204 4 Approach 1: One approach is to do a multiple linear regression or neural networks or SVM directly on the dataset above by treating time as an ordinal (?) or continuous variable. I can do a time series regression as follows: $$y = a+\beta_1x+\beta_2 time+\varepsilon$$ where $\varepsilon$ is modeled as ARMA Approach 2: Alternatively I can rearrange data and create dummy variables for time as follows: y x Time_1 Time_2 Time_3 12 100 1 0 0 14 101 0 1 0 16 102 0 0 1 18 103 0 0 0 20 201 1 0 0 22 202 0 1 0 24 203 0 0 1 26 204 0 0 0 and do a time series regression/neural network/SVM. For instance a time series would be $$y = a+\beta_1x+\beta_2 time_1+\beta_3 time_2+\beta_4 time_3+\varepsilon$$ where $\varepsilon$ is modeled as ARMA. Below are my questions: What is the right approach - 1 or 2? If we use the data mining approach such as a neural network or svm does it matter if we use either approach 1 or 2 ? Is approach 1 more parsimonious since we have 1 variable representing time as opposed to approach 2 which has 3 variables?
