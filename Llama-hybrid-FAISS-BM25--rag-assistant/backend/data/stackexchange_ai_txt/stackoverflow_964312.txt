The biggest business benefit of WPF over WinForms as I see it is the massive increase in testability . Because of the ubiquitous Data Binding support in WPF, patterns like Model-View-ViewModel become trivial to implement, and enable the vast majority of the interaction logic of an application to be separated out into ViewModel classes which, being Plain-Old-Clr-Objects, are much easier to test than WinForms controls. The second benefit comes from the composability of the "widgets" in WPF. Customizing the look and feel of items in a ListBox or ComboBox using Data Templates , for example, is a cinch compared with the custom drawing that has to take place in WinFroms. So WPF makes it much easier to create apps with high usability compared with WinForms. Thirdly, the Control Model and Graphics APIs are a vast improvement on WinForms. When I wanted to create a Custom Chart control, with support for rendering several hundred series performantly, it only took me a couple of days to do it - I remember something similar taking weeks in WinForms. As another example, I've blogged about how easy it is to get started with creating a custom Gantt control in WPF.
