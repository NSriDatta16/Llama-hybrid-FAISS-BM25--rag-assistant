Need a storage solution that is scalable, distributed and can read data extremely fast and works with .NET

I currently have a data solution in RDBMS. The load on the server will grow by 10x, and I do not believe it will scale. I believe what I need is a data store that can provide fault tolerant, scalable and that can retrieve data extremely fast. The Stats Records: 200 million Total Data Size (not including indexes): 381 GB New records per day: 200,000 Queries per Sec: 5,000 Query Result: 1 - 2000 records Requirements Very fast reads Scalable Fault tolerant Able to execute complex queries (conditions across many columns) Range Queries Distributed Partition â€“ Is this required for 381 GB of data? Able to Reload from file In-Memory (not sure) Not Required ACID - Transactions The primary purpose of the data store is retrieve data very fast. The queries that will access this data will have conditions across many different columns (30 columns and probably many more). I hope this is enough info. I have read about many different types of data stores that include NoSQL, In-Memory, Distributed Hashed, Key-Value, Information Retrieval Library, Document Store, Structured Storage, Distributed Database, Tabular and others. And then there are over 2 dozen products that implement these database types. This is a lot of stuff to digest and figure out which would provide the best solution. It would be preferred that the solution run on Windows and is compatible with Microsoft .NET. Base on the information above, does any one have any suggestions and why? Thanks
