With respect to the first question. Consider the whole time series through a particular voxel to be a single draw from a multivariate distribution. We can now think of this as a multivariate vector much like any other that we might apply PCA to. The first $p$ columns of $\bf V$ are then the eigen-timecourses which, when linearly combined provide the best approximation to the time course through a particular voxel for the duration $\hat t$ of a stimulus. So $\bf \hat Y$ is an $n \times \hat t$ matrix and therefore $\bf U$ is $n \times n$ while $\bf V$ is $\hat t \times \hat t$. With respect to the second question. The equation given is $\bf J = \bf U^T Y$ We are given that $\bf J$ is a 2 or 3 $ \times t$ matrix. (This involves a small sleight of hand in dropping rows/columns.) Two or three is picked as the dimensionality as this is what can be plotted in figure 6 of the paper. However $t \ne \hat t$ so I expect the separate traces (lines in fig 6) have been obtained by chopping $\bf J$ into the different segments corresponding to presentations of the stimulus. Each of these blocks can then be plotted in 2 or 3 dimensional space by considering each column as a point in that space and then drawing a line between the points defined by adjacent columns giving the trajectories. Following on from the above video 8 appears for each block to add each (column-)point sequentially, join it to the last point, and render this length $\hat t$ sequence as a video. I've not dealt with the colouring methodology before, and it would take a while before I was confident to comment on that aspect. I found the comment on similarity to Fig 4c confusing as the colouring is obtained there by per-voxel regression. Whereas in Fig 6 each trace is a whole-image artefact. Unless I'm put straight I think it's the direction of the stimulus during that time segment as per the comment in the Figure.
