Frequency range of wavelet packets decomposition at each level

I measured turbulent velocity in 1Hz sampling rate. To remove fluctuations with T>900 sec I decompose the time series by wavelet packets, problem is that I don't know which levels should be kept and which levels should be removed. In other words, if the wavelet packet decomposition is imagined as a tree what would be the frequency range at each node?
