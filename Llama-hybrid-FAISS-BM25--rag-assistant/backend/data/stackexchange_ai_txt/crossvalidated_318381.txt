Short answer The support vectors are those points for which the Lagrange multipliers are not zero (there is more than just $b$ in a Support Vector Machine). Long answer Hard Margin For a simple hard-margin SVM , we have to solve the following minimisation problem: $$\min_{\boldsymbol{w}, b} \frac{1}{2} \|\boldsymbol{w}\|^2$$ subject to $$\forall i : y_i (\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b) - 1 \geq 0$$ The solution can be found with help of Lagrange multipliers $\alpha_i$ . In the process of minimising the Lagrange function, it can be found that $$\boldsymbol{w} = \sum_i \alpha_i y_i \boldsymbol{x}_i.$$ Therefore, $\boldsymbol{w}$ only depends on those samples for which $\alpha_i \neq 0$ . Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions require that the solution satisfies $$\alpha_i (y_i (\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b) - 1) = 0.$$ In order to compute $b$ , the constraint for sample $i$ must be tight, i.e. $\alpha_i > 0$ , so that $y_i (\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b) - 1 = 0$ . Hence, $b$ depends only on those samples for which $\alpha_i > 0$ . Therefore, we can conclude that the solution depends on all samples for which $\alpha_i > 0$ . Soft Margin For the C-SVM, which seems to be known as soft-margin SVM , the minimisation problem is given by: $$\min_{\boldsymbol{w}, b} \frac{1}{2} \|\boldsymbol{w}\|^2 + C \sum_i \xi_i$$ subject to $$\forall i : \begin{aligned}y_i (\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b) - 1 + \xi_i & \geq 0 \\ \xi_i &\geq 0\end{aligned}$$ Using Lagrange multipliers $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_i = (C - \alpha_i)$ , the weights are (again) given by $$\boldsymbol{w} = \sum_i \alpha_i y_i \boldsymbol{x}_i,$$ and therefore $\boldsymbol{w}$ does depends only on samples for which $\alpha_i \neq 0$ . Due to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the solution must satisfy $$\begin{align} \alpha_i (y_i (\boldsymbol{w} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_i + b) - 1 + \xi_i) & = 0 \\ (C - \alpha_i) \xi_i & = 0, \end{align}$$ which allows to compute $b$ if $\alpha_i > 0$ and $\xi_i = 0$ . If both constraints are tight, i.e. $\alpha_i , $\xi_i$ must be zero. Therefore, $b$ depends on those samples for which $0 . Therefore, we can conclude that the solution depends on all samples for which $\alpha_i > 0$ . After all, $\boldsymbol{w}$ still depends on those samples for which $\alpha_i = C$ .
