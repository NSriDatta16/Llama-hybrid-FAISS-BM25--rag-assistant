Need advice for creating a good custom loss function for a neural network

I'm trying to solve a regression problem using a neural network. In my problem domain, an underestimation is a lot worse than an overestimation, so I thought I'd create a custom loss function for my network. Currently, I'm thinking about something along the lines of: $$Loss(pred, label) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } pred - label \geq 0\\ x^2 & \text{if } pred - label There's one problem I can already see upfront, and that's that the function is not differenciable for $pred-label = 0$ My question here is two-fold: What can I do to solve the differenciability problem? What other factors are important when choosing/designing loss functions? (My network will be implemented in TensorFlow, in case this is relevant)
