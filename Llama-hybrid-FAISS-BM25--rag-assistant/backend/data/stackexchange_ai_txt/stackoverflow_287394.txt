You probably want to look into Markov Chains - They're probably of more use to you than an evolutionary algorithm to start with, as judging the quality of the output in order to breed the best is going to be a nightmare (subjective and time-consuming), and they're ideal for combining with evolutionary programming. There's a good introduction to them on Coding Horror . The article explains the concept and demonstrates the remarkable results, the comments mention music a lot more (I was lost for hours in the comments and the sites they linked to). There's some more specific details and further reading on Wikipedia . Markov chains have an element of probability to them, so this is where you can combine them with evolutionary programming - by evolving a method of choosing alternatives other than the roll of a dice.
