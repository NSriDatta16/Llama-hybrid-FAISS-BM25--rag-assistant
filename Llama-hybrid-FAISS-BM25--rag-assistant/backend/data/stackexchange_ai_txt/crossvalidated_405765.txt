If your question is around understanding the relationships between your covariates (independent variables) and your responses (dependent variables) then there are probably two approaches that I would use. A classical ANOVA or MANOVA (multivariate ANOVA) would not suffice because having strong collinearity (i.e. >0.7 correlation) will mean that your covariates are trying to explain the same variation in your response variables. Thus I would try one of the following things to combat this: Delete the covariate that has strong collinearity from your model. Since this term is explaining the same variation as another term(s) then you don't really need it and you can infer its effect from the variable it is correlated with. This would allow you to do a regular old MANOVA. This is a very common approach and has a fair bit of support behind it. Try multivariate ridge regression - this is the multivariate analogue to ridge regression which shrinks coefficients and effectively deals with collinearity. The catch is that this approach requires bayesian estimation of the covariance matrix and therefore selection of priors, which comes with its own challenges. Here is an R package that should aid in this. Cross-validation can help estimate the shrinkage parameter, although what type and how many folds depends on your data. If you posted a sample of your data then I might be able to help more.
