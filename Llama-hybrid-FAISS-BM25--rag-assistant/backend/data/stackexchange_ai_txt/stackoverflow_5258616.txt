Run a separate database to which your clients can connect. Your server just pushes data to this database. But, this will not be a request-response based mechanism. Server will have to populate tables before it anticipates client requests. You might have to manage authentication/authorization by creating a db user for each client and then have a table for each db user and restricting db user to only his table. Not that elegant, huh?
