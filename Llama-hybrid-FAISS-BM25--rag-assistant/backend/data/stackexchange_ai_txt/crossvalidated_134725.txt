I think that I cant help you specifically with R, but a common step on verifying the number of factors is to either look at the loadings and retaining as many factors as those ones with a value of 1 or more. This is the most straight way to pick the factors. If you want, you can manage to get the "scree plot", wich gives you a more visual insight on the number of factors but is more subjective. In that plot, when you get a "fall" in the curve plotted might indicate the number of factors. This approach is good when you want to reduce the number of variables of a big dataset with many variables highly correlated. So two is the number of factors to extract in your case. Instead, if you want to really cluster variables and this factor has a meaning on people or economic behavior, you might want to select only the two or three highest loadings, because you will be able to access the Component Plot in Rotated Space, i.e. the graphical representation of the variables in a two-dimensional (or three-dimensional) space, wich gives you clues on interpreting the factor if this is your goal. Since you put the theoretical references for your studies at the end of your work, you will be telling others that you are not doing something sparse - it´s based on proofs stated by others. Statistically speaking, you could run a correlation analysis between the scores obtained from the pca with the response variable, for example. If the PCA was ok and the original variables are also correlated with this response variable, your factor will also be and you´ll have a very solid and understandable number to convince people. Hope this helped you in some way.If I have said anything wrong, anyone please correct me.
