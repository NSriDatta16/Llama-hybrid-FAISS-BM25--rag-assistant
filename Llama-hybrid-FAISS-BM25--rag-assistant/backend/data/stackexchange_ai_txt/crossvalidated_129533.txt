I would create a procedure which does the following: For each unique label: Define positives as texts containing labels Define negatives as text not containing the label Balance negatives and positives by oversampling the minority class Train SVM or Naive Bayes model on trainingset End: You probably also want a test set which you need to extract before running this procedure. There is a lot of literature on multiclass problems, but I dont think your problem is a traditional multiclass problem.
