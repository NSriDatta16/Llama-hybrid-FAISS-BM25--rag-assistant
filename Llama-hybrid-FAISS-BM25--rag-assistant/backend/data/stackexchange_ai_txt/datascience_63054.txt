Predicting Sequence based on Tabular Features

I have a dataset regarding a specific junction on a piece of road and the cars that will cross that junction. I am trying to predict the order that cars will pass the specific junction given a set of tabular features. My dataset looks similar to the following: Target car1_type car2_type car3_type car1_positionId car2_positionId car3_positionId ... 3,1,2 1 2 3 3 6 8 2,1,3 8 4 9 1 4 2 My features inlcude the type of car (car_type) as well as the position of each car (car_positionId). The position represents a region of road that the car is on. Each row above represents an observed case of 3 cars crossing a junction. I am trying to predict the target column (the order that the cars will pass over the junction) based on the features given. There is additional complexity in that I also do not know how many cars there will be. There could be just one (trivial case) or there could be up to 20. My question is what machine learning algorithm could I use to help me predict the order.
