You need to express this relationship server-side, for example by joining the tables together (although IIRC there are more elegant ways to do this in Rails): SELECT p.person_name, v.vehicle_type FROM vehicle v INNER JOIN person p ON p.person_id = v.person_id Then just make sure to include person_name in your jqgrid's colmodel.
