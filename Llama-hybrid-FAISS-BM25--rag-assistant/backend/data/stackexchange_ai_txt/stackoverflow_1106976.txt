Extract a portion of text using RegEx

I would like to extract portion of a text using a regular expression. So for example, I have an address and want to return just the number and streets and exclude the rest: 2222 Main at King Edward Vancouver BC CA But the addresses varies in format most of the time. I tried using Lookbehind Regex and came out with this expression: .*?(?=\w* \w* \w{2}$) The above expressions handles the above example nicely but then it gets way too messy as soon as commas come into the text, postal codes which can be a 6 character string or two 3 character strings with a space in the middle, etc... Is there any more elegant way of extracting a portion of text other than a lookbehind regex? Any suggestion or a point in another direction is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
