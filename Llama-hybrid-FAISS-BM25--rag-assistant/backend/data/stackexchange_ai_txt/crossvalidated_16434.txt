Resources on EFA for scale construction I have a post listing several academic articles that provide guidance on using EFA to the task of scale construction . Is PCA and reliability enough for scale development Scale development done well is a complex task. It generally involves a wide range of techniques. While exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), PCA, and reliability analysis, are relevant, there are other important techniques, such as item generation strategies, expert sorting techniques, and various strategies for seeing the relationship between scale scores and other variables. I prefer EFA to PCA because EFA assumes latent factors (see my previous discussion of the differences ). However, both techniques are exploratory, and thus can be contrasted with CFA. In the early and intermediate stages of scale development, I think EFA is generally more useful than CFA. It's good to let the data speak to you. Cross-loadings, or items that load maximally on the "wrong" factor will typically be more evident in EFA. However, CFA can be applied in both exploratory and confirmatory ways. Thus, in skilled hands, CFA could still be useful to explore the factor structure. I.e., exploratory approaches to CFA make extensive use of modification indices and explore many different possible factor structures. In later stages of scale development, CFA can be more useful. Once the scale is almost finalised, you can check the fit of the proposed scale structure. You can check invariance of the factor structure across groups or over time. You can see whether assuming tau-equivalence is appropriate. CFA is also particularly useful if you want to compare the fits of multiple models of the factor structure of a set of items . Comments on SPSS SPSS provides tools for EFA. see here for some links to tutorials If you want to do CFA, then SPSS has Amos. Of course, there are a wide range of tools for doing SEM.
