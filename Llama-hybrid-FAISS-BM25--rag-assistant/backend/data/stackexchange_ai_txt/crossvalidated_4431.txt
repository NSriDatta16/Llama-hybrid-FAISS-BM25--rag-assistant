Resources to learn about block bootstrap in time series analysis

Way back when, I used to work in finance, and I remember helping a coworker use some kind of block bootstrap. (I believe the application was: we had weekly data on some financial indicator X, along with weekly data on some stock, and we wanted to measure how well X could be used to predict the stock's movements. And I believe we needed to bring in the bootstrap, because we only had a couple months of weekly data, so we didn't really have many datapoints. I might be misremembering all this, though.) In any case, I totally forget now how the block bootstrap worked, and I want to remember/review/learn more, so can anyone suggest a good tutorial on it? I tried googling, but all I found were some random research papers. I also tried looking in my copy of Efron & Tibshirani's "An Introduction to the Bootstrap Book", but didn't find anything (unless it's under a name other than "block bootstrap").
