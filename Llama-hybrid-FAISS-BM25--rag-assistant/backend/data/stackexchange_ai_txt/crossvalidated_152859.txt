1 continuous predictor and a 3 level ordinal outcome

I´m evaluating the impacts of logging in a forest, so my independent variable is the intensity of logging (i.e. trees per area) and my dependent variables are the injuries in the residual trees (the ones that are not logged). I have 3 intensities of injuries and a count data of number of trees with each intensity of injury. I was thinking in doing a logistic regression, but I don´t know if it fits my data nor how to use it in this arrangement of predictor x response.
