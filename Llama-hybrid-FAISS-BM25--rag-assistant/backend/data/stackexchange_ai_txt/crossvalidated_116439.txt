Indicator (dummy) variables typically compare one service with a reference service (D?). So, someone using service A would have a 60% higher odds (of death, being married, entering the hospital wearing a pink tutu, ...) than someone using service D. I would change the unit of AT_START and TOT. The effects of both variables are statistically significant, but the unit is probably too small to give you meaningfull odds ratios. For example, if they are measured in euros, I would divide that variable by 1000, so it now measures whatever it measures in 1000s of euros. I would center the continuous variables and also report the baseline odds. This is a convenient writing trick to remind the readers about the difference between odds and probabilities. You just start with one or two sentences discussing the baseline odds. For example if you centered all continuous variables at the mean and the baseline odds is .4, then you could write something like "For a person who uses service D and with average values on AT_START, ID_SEQ, and TOT the odds of death is .4, that is, we expect to find .4 dead persons for ever living person with those characteristics."
