how to check if object already exists in a list

I have a list List myList and I am adding items to a list and I want to check if that object is already in the list. so before I do this: myList.Add(nextObject); I want to see if nextObject is already in the list. The object "MyObject" has a number of properties but comparison is based on matching on two properties. What is the best way to do a check before I add a new "MyObject" to this list of "MyObject"s. The only solution I thought up was to change from a list to a dictionary and then make the key a concatenated string of the properties (this seems a little unelegant). Any other cleaner solutions using list or LINQ or something else?
