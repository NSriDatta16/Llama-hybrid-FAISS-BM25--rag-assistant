there is a 26% chance that there is no difference between the two distributions the samples came from and 74% that the post-test sample came from a different distribution. Not exactly. This is a Bayesian statement and there is no such statement in frequentist analysis. The real interpretation is: "if the two samples came from the same population, there would be 26% chances to see at least such a difference and 74% chances to see less difference". But honestly, your statement is not so bad for intuitive understanding. Sadly not to derive formulas... Can I say that E[μ1−μ0]=0α+(1−α)(μ1−μ0)=0.74(μ1−μ0) No. There is no distribution of the true parameters in frequentist analysis and hence the expectation E[μ1−μ0] (where I guess these would be the true hidden parameters) can't be defined. You need Bayes to define it. The expression would depend on the prior and kind of data.
