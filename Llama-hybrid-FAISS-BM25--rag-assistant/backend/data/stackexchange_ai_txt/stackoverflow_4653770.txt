How do I handle no results returned from a LINQ query?

The following LINQ query works fine except when there are no results to return. Then an InvalidOperationException is thrown. What is the best way to handle this? How do I test for the existance of a result and move along if there is none? I thought about a try-catch but felt there must be a more elegant solution. In this example, I'm only expecting the Id of the first result. There may be other case where I want the entire object returned. var drId = dcDest.drs.Where(dr => dr.ContactID == contactId) .Select(dr => dr.Id).First(); int xId = drId;
