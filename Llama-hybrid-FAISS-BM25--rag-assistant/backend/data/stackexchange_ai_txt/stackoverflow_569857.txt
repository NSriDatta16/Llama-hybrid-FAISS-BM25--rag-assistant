Those 4 came to my mind: MicroC/OS-II : Its free and simple, but i think there are too few good resources available LibeRTOS : I can recommend that. I used it several times for different projects. It's good it's fast and the dual kernel concept is really well done. RTLinux : Can't tell you much about that one. Only used it once for a very small project and didn't get deep "behind the scenes" But it was fast and reliable. (and very expensive) VxWorks : Awesome OS... From Wikipedia: multitasking kernel with preemptive and round-robin scheduling and fast interrupt response Memory protection to isolate user applications from the kernel SMP support Fast, flexible inter-process communication including TIPC Error handling framework Binary, counting, and mutual exclusion semaphores with priority inheritance Local and distributed message queues Full ANSI C compliance and enhanced C++ features for exception handling and template support POSIX PSE52 certified conformance File system. IPv6 Networking stack VxSim simulator Supports: C/C++/JAVA If money is no problem: Use VxWorks! You can do anything: Upgrade your fridge, built a war machine or fly to Mars ;-) Otherwise check out LibeRTOS...
