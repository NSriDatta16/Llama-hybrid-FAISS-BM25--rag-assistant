Here we are creating data to for a given model. The main advantage with this code snippet is you are able to see how the model performers over various sizes of the training set. The learing_curve_data function can be found in the [6.0-7.1 version of caret][1] . Of course, learning curves are useful in machine learning for several reason which include comparison of algorithms, choosing model parameters, optimization, right data size to use for training. set.seed(1412) class_dat
