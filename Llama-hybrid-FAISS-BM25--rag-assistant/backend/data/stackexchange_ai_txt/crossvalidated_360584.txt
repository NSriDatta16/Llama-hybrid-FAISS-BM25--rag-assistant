Sounds like you are severely overfitting. Basically, you need to use a simpler model than the one you are currently using or collect (a lot) more data. Generally, the more data you have, the more complex a model you can fit without overfitting. I do not think you are going to get meaningful results using a CNN on such a small dataset. Start with a simple decision tree with 1 to 3 levels to establish a benchmark. Maybe try linear models with high regularization. You are looking for poor performance (but better than random) on the training set and similar performance on the validation set. Then you can start trying more complex models that fit the training set better and maybe generalize to the validation set a bit better, too.
