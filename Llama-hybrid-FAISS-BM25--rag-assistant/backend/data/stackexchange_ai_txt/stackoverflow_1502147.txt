Let the style of the button be decided by the operating system. It would be bette not to try modifying this behavior. Most of the times you won't be successful. The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element (with some pointing device), but does not activate it. For example, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the cursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element. User agents not supporting interactive media do not have to support this pseudo-class. Some conforming user agents supporting interactive media may not be able to support this pseudo-class (e.g., a pen device). See Selectors If you want to apply hover effect to a button then better use an anchor tag and use an image inside that. a:hover { }
