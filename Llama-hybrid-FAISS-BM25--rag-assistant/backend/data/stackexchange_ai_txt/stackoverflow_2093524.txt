Flash HTML text not showing

I'm trying to display HTML text in a text field on the stage, but the text formatting doesn't show. I am embedding all font variations in the library (arial bold and arial regular) and I even have dynamic text fields on the stage that embed arial bold and arial regular. Still, this code does not display bold text: myField.htmlText = "Regular and bold "; What am I missing?
