You seem to have the basics of UML. The main differences are that relationship types are different from SQL and that Java (or whatever language) data types don't match SQL data types directly, so you'll need to convert those as you have above. [opinion] Unless you have a UML->code->UML tool I would not get too hung up on drawing the UML. It's mainly a tool for white boarding (IMHO) and trusting those diagrams tends to hurt you in the long run when maintenance changes make that sort of documentation obsolete. I prefer to use a code->UML tool when looking at legacy code rather than outdated UML diagrams from design time. [/opinion] [edit] Since you already have working code you may want to try Amateras UML in Eclipse. You can drag a bunch of classes onto an empty document and it will create the UML diagram for you.
