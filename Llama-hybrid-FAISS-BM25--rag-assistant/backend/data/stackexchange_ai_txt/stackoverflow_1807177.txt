Require help to implement drag from Java Application and drop to Native File System

I have a Java Swing application which shows a list of the files/Folders that have been uploaded to the server. I have a requirement to download selected file(s)/folder(s) to native file system using Drag and Drop . I have searched links but almost every link describes the Drag and Drop within a Java Swing application. My requirement is to Drag the file from the Java Swing application and Drop it to the native file system. I need help to know how I can get the location where user has dropped the selected file(s)/folder(s) to the native file system. For example, let's suppose the user has dragged the file and dropped directly to the C:\Back_Up folder by restore the window of Java Application . How can I identify the location that user has dropped the file to, i.e. C:\Back_Up ?
