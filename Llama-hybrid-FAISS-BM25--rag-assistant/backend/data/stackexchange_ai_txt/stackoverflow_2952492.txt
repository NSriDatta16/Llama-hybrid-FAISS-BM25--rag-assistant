You can use localStorage. This is the Html5 equivalent of cookies. It appears to work on Chrome and Firefox BUT on Firefox, I needed to upload it to a server. That is, testing directly on my home computer didn't work. I'm working up HTML5 examples. Go to http://faculty.purchase.edu/jeanine.meyer/html5/html5explain.html and scroll to the maze one. The information to re-build the maze is stored using localStorage. I came to this article looking for HTML5 JavaScript for loading and working with xml files. Is it the same as older html and JavaScript????
