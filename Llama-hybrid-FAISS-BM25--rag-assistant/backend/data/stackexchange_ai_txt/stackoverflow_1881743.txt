It appears that you're trying to retrieve the information from the $_SESSION array. There are two ways you can do this. As another poster suggested, you can simply hack it out of the $_SESSION superglobal thusly: $logId = $_SESSION['core']['visitor_data']['customer_log_id']; However, this is a bit of a hack to avoid the Magento framework. The better option (from a "correctness" point of view) is to use Magento's session management. So, instead, we have: // we could also skip a step and just use Mage::getSingleton("core/session")->getVisitorData(), // but I wanted to add the datatypes for your reference $session = Mage::getSingleton("core/session"); // Mage_Core_Model_Session $customerData = $session->getVisitorData(); // array $logId = $customerData['customer_log_id']; // int Hope that helps!
