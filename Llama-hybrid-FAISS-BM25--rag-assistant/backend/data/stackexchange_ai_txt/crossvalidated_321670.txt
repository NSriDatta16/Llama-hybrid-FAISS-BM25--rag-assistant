Actually to be simple If you have m training data like this (x(1),y(1)),(x(2),y(2)), . . . (x(m),y(m)) We use loss function L(ycap,y) to find loss between ycap and y of a single training set If we want to find loss between ycap and y of a whole training set we use cost function. Note:- ycap means output from our model And y means expected output Note:- Credit goes Andrew ng Resource: coursera neural network and deep learning
