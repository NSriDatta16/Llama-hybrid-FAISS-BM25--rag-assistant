I don't think this is peculiar and it is not restricted to logistic regression. It can happen with linear regression as well. The least squares estimates of the regression coefficients will depend on which variable you include to fit in the model. This will happen even if covariates $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent or even just uncorrelated.
