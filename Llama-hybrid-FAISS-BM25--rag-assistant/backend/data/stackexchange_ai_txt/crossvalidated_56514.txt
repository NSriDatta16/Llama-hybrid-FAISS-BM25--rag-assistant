You may want to do like: Generate a dummy variable for each season: lets call these as s1, s2, s3, and s4. Regress dependent variable y on dummy variables s2, s3, s4 plus other variables if any [Note we omit one (you can choose any) dummy variable to avoid dummy variable trap ]. Test the significance (using t-test )on the coefficients of s2, s3 , and s4 . If at least one of these is significant, it indicates the seasonal effect. Since your data is time series you may want to use Newey-West standard error which is robust to autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.
