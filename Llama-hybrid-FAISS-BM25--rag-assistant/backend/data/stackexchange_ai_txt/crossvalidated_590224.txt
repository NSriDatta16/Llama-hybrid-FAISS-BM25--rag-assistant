This counts as both a false negative (missing the real object), and a false positive (predicting one where there is nothing). To calculate these, you have to calculate overlapping area, to pair up the predictions and the true instances. A common threshold is to count everything as correct when the overlap is larger than 50% for example. Even with an established overlap threshold, there are still some nuances to take into account when you have multiple predictions for the single true object, you should only count one of them as correct.
