I don't have any experience with the migration tool, but I am involved in a large Forms to Apex migration project. Since we started about 2 years ago, the migration tool wasn't available to us and we kind of built our own. But conversion is really quite hard to automate, except for the easy bit which is basically screen layout and items. So we have a method to generate first cut Apex pages with the correct items in (more or less) the correct layout, but then we still have a big job to do inspecting the Forms triggers and libraries for fragments of PL/SQL and figuring out what to do with them (some are redundant Forms-specific code, some are client-side validations that we need to rewrite in Javascript, some are business logic that shouldn't be in the UI at all and need to be moved into packages). I think the main advantage the migration tool has over what we did ourselves is probably the "pseudo-project management", in that it gives you a list of things that need hand-converting and tracks what you have done. This would pay dividends in a large project like ours, but maybe not so much in small projects. For small projects I'd be inclined to say "let's review what the old Forms app does, redefine the requirements and build from scratch in Apex". You don't really want your Apex apps to look like Forms apps with lipstick on them!
