There's several parts to this question: But I don't really know that how they affect my CV, The cert is like icing on the cake, but nobody just wants to eat icing. If it's the best thing on your CV, then it's a help. For example, if you're fresh out of college and you have zero experience, then these certifications show that you've learned a technology that's new and relevant. Colleges don't teach the same information footprint that these certs cover - college degrees are great for the theory behind what you're doing, and the certs are a little more applicable to what you're doing hands-on as a developer or DBA on that particular technology. It's not as good as real experience, though. If you've got, say, 2 years of hands-on database development or administration, then that probably trumps a cert in most cases. and, of course, my salary. It's not going to matter significantly. If you have the choice between doing four weekends of consulting versus four weekends of studying for the cert, then you're going to make more out of the consulting. In theory, the certs will raise your billable rate, but if you're even asking that question, you're not at the point of your career where this is going to make a difference. Instead, go ask your manager what they wish they could accomplish in the next two months. Tell 'em you're willing to take on their pet project in your side time to help both of you. Deliver some new piece of code, some new utility, clean up a database, save them licensing, whatever it is, and you'll be more likely to get a raise than if you go get a cert. And when you're picking side projects, pick something that you can put on your resume. "Reduced licensing costs by $120k through a successful server consolidation project" says a lot more to employers than "MCITP." Are they truly valuable? Things that are easy to get are not valuable. Some certs (like the Microsoft Certified Master) are valuable. The ones you can get in a few weekends of studying - not so valuable. Do they make differences in your work No, but the studying that you do to PREPARE for these exams will make a difference in your work. In the course of studying, you'll learn tips, tricks and features that you can leverage in your development/DBA work. and your position before and after you get it? If you think you're going to get a raise simply by showing your MCITP, you're on the wrong track. Ask your manager for a frank and honest evaluation of your work. Tell them that you want to make sure your career keeps moving, and that you'd like their advice on what you should do next. If you don't like your manager, ask your mentor - find a programmer who's already doing what you wish you were doing, and ask 'em how they got there. It's probably not by getting a cert.
