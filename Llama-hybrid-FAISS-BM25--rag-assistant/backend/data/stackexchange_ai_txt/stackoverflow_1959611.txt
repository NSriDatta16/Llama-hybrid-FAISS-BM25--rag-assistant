Good tools for analyzing VPS performance (VPS running WordPress blogs)?

What are tools you would recommend for analyzing VPS performance? Specifically I run several Wordpress blogs on a VPS and would like to find some tools to help me find issues worth looking into (so I can address them). I use New Relic for getting some data on where to focus some attention on our Rails applications and find it very useful. I have a feeling there might be issues with memory use. I would love to see something that showed memory use over time so I could see what my memory use looks like. I am considering upgrading the VPS and this would be one useful piece of data.
