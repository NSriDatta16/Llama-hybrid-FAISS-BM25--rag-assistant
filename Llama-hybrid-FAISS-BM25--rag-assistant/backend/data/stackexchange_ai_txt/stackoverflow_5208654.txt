WP7 equivalent of EmptyDataTemplate?

A number of ASP.NET data bound controls expose an EmptyDataTemplate that is rendered when the control is bound to an empty data source. In my WP7 app, I too would like to display a friendly message when the data source that is bound to the ListBox is empty. Is there a reasonably elegant way to achieve this? Preferably integrated/able with caliburn.micro? Thanks!!
