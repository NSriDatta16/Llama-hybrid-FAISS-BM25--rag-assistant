If you have to ask, don't do it. For your specific code, you could do it like this: Public Function SaveOrganization(ByVal organization As rv_o_Organization) As Result Dim result As Result = Result.Empty _Repository.Connection.Open() _Repository.Transaction = _Repository.Connection.BeginTransaction() 'Performs validation then saves it to the database 'using the current transaction result = SaveMasterOrganization(organization.MasterOrganization) 'Performs validation then saves it to the database 'using the current transaction If result.Success Then result = SaveOrganziation(dbOrg, organization) _Repository.Transaction.Commit() _Repository.Connection.Close() Return result End Sub
