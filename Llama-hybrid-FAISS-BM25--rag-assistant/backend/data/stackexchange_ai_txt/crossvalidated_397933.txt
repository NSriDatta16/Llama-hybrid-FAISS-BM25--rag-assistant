I think you describe hierarchical clustering. It cannot be universally said that it's better or worse, and actually, decision trees/random forest kind of are an hierarchical approach anyway. So, if you plan to use random forests anyway, I don't think you will get better results by training a random forest on each category value of a categorical variable and then pooling the results (e.g., by majority vote). However, other methods (e.g., logistic regression as a naive example) may benefit from such a hierarchical approach. Btw. you mention that you can one-hot encode your multi-category variable for e.g., gradient boosting or random forests. If you have multiple variables, and one variable has a lot of categories that's not always a good idea because then you will have a proportionally large number of one-hot encoded features for particular variable. In that case, I would look for random forest implementation based on decision tree algorithms that are implemented without being limited to binary nodes.
