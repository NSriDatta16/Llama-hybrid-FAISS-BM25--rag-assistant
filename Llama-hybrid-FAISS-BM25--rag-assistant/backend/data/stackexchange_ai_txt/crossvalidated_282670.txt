Should I center the data when performing Laplacian Eigenmap or any other manifold learning?

Suppose I have a high dimensional non-stationary non-linear time series, then is it advisable to center the data on the mean when performing laplacian eigenmap? I've heard somewhere that when performing machine learning, the performance and accuracy increases if the data is centered on the mean. If it makes any difference, what could be the potential reason?
