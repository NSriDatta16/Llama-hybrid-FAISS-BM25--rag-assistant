As promised, here you can find an example of how you could apply kfold cross validation for a defined convolutional neural network model, applied to an augmented dataset. You can find the code as a simple gist here It is done as follows: for a subset of the CIFAR10 images dataset, generate 3 augmented images (by applying horizontal_flip) per original image , so we should finally have as the number of final images in the augmented dataset: 'number of images in the original dataset' * 3. check that indeed the built augmented dataset has the new expected number of images . We have just created the augmented dataset, not the fit step yet apply kfold cross validation on the augmented dataset for several hiperparameters combinations; in this example, 3 pairs of 'learning rate-momentum' have been tried. It is made via the usual 'fit' method: display the results in a dataframe This way, we have applied hyperparametrization via kfold cross validation; not a full grid search but only with 3 pairs of hiperparams, but the idea would be the same, not depending on the fit_generator method but making yourself your k folds cross validation on the generated augmented dataset. We could also include other data augmentation strategies in this cross validation.
