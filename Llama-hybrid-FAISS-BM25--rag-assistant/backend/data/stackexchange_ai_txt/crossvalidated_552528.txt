Stationary series gives AR parameters greater than one

I am modelling a series of growth rate in unemployment in the United States with an ARIMA model using auto_arima from pmdarima . This is what the data looks like: Before fitting the model I ran an ADF test and I was able to reject the null of non-stationarity. In order to find the optimal autoregressive and moving average parameters, I used auto_arima and the selected model was ARIMA (5,0,4). However, here is the output of the model fit: ============================================================================== coef std err z P>|z| [0.025 0.975] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ar.L1 1.6614 0.041 40.105 0.000 1.580 1.743 ar.L2 -0.6829 0.074 -9.238 0.000 -0.828 -0.538 ar.L3 0.5717 0.072 7.979 0.000 0.431 0.712 ar.L4 -1.1751 0.069 -17.120 0.000 -1.310 -1.041 ar.L5 0.5859 0.041 14.427 0.000 0.506 0.665 ma.L1 -0.6875 0.027 -25.210 0.000 -0.741 -0.634 ma.L2 0.1827 0.023 7.794 0.000 0.137 0.229 ma.L3 -0.7397 0.023 -31.507 0.000 -0.786 -0.694 ma.L4 0.8748 0.026 33.983 0.000 0.824 0.925 sigma2 22.2571 0.882 25.249 0.000 20.529 23.985 =================================================================================== Ljung-Box (L1) (Q): 0.11 Jarque-Bera (JB): 215.10 Prob(Q): 0.74 Prob(JB): 0.00 Heteroskedasticity (H): 0.29 Skew: 0.37 Prob(H) (two-sided): 0.00 Kurtosis: 5.79 =================================================================================== As you can see, some of the lags' coefficients are bigger than one, which contradicts stationarity. How is this possible? What could be the reason why I am getting such coefficients? Besides, since the Ljung-Box test does not reject the null hypothesis of white noise residuals, is the model fit still good, or have I run into some modelling error?
