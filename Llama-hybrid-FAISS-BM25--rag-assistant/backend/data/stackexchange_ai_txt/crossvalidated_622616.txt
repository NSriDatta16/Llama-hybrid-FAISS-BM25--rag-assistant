One example from tech is p90 of website load speed or service response time. This analysis also comes up in logistics. Here you care about just how bad the worst experience is. Typically this is something you monitor as you make changes, with alerts that fire when that quantile rises above some threshold. Even if, on average, the website loads quickly or purchases arrive the next day, you want to know about the worst scenarios. In education research, you often care about how an intervention like an AI tutor affects different types of students. Does it move up the left tail (low test scores) or the right tail (helping highest-scoring students)? The common theme in many such applications is that you are not interested in the conditional mean or how it changes, but in other parts of the distribution.
