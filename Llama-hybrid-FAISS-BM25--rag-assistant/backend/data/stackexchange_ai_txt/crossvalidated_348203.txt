What are the ways to predict time series with mutiple seasonal component?

I've tried 3 options so far: Linear regressions: fast + 50% accurancy. FB Prophet: fast + 100% accurancy. SARIMAX (ARIMA): slow + 100% accurancy. I can't use FB prophet on my project and SARIMAX is crazy slow. What are the other options to get a reasonable (not 50%) accurancy?
