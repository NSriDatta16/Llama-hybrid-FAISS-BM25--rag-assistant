The perceptron is a binary linear classifier, that is, it can classify n-dimensional data that look like this: but not like this: into two distinct categories. Just like any other neural network, it first needs to be trained on a training set, and then only it can be used to classify new data points. The perceptron can therefore be applied to classify any linearly separable dataset. A Matlab implementation is available in the Neural Network toolbox (see the documentation ). An excellent toolbox for pattern recognition in general, with excellent classifiers, is PRTools, which is kind of the open source variant of the commercial toolbox PRSD Studio .
