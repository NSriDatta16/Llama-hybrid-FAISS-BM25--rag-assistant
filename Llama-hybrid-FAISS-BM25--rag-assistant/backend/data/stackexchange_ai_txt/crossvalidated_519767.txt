What does it mean to "permute" a predictor in the context of random forest?

I am reading the vignette for the R package randomForestExplainer. There the result accuracy_decrease (classification) is defined as mean decrease of prediction accuracy after X_j is permuted What does it mean "permuted" in this context? How is a predictor variable "permuted"?
