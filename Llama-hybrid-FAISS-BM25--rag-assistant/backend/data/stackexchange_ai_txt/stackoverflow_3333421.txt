How do I send parameters to advanced search in Magento?

I have the following search form in Magento: XBox XBox 360 Please note the “platform” field is a product attribute. While "name" field is product name. No matter what I search, the results page always say “No items were found using the following search criteria” I can see that two parameters are being passed: result/?name=Logitech&platform;=5 Even if I change this to following, it doesn’t work: result/?name=Logitech&platform;=XBox Changing this to doesn’t work either: result/?name=Logitech The product is there in database I have checked. What am I doing wrong? Thanks
