What are possible approaches to deal with unseparable data even after PCA?

Greetings data scientists, I am dealing with a complex classification/prediction problem and I am finding very difficult to separate the classes at all. Even after PCA, my data (over the two PCs), look like this: Given this dataset, what approach could be best to accurately predict the classes? Background: I am trying to classifying modelled problems via the best approach/algorithm to solve them. Many thanks,
