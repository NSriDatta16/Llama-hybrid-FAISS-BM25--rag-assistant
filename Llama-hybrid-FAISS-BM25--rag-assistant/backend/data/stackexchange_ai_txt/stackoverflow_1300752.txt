function organize_questions () { if ( $_GET['tab'] == 'newest' ) { print_r( array_reverse( $end_array , true ) ); } else if ( $_GET['tab'] == 'oldest' ) { print_r($end_array); } else { print_r(array_reverse ( $end_array , true ) ); } } I removed the echos and used print_r (assuming that those variables were actually arrays). Additionally unless you're using $tab somewhere else in the function it was unneeded. EDIT: I wouldn't actually use print_r...it's useful for debug and such. Usually you'd want some way to pick the pieces from an array that you actually want to display and use echo or print for the individual pieces. EDIT2: I'm getting both upvoted and downvoted on this. It's rewritten the function in question with correct syntax. Portions of the question are very vague so I'll continue. You seem to also be asking of passing information into functions. the $_GET['tab'] in question is accessing get variables (yoursite.com/index.php?tab=newest). What you seem to be asking with is how to use functions at all. You had it correct going with: function organize_questions( $tab ) { ... } Assuming that you were going to use the variable tab. In order to use this function you would call it as such from another function within the file, or another file that does a php_require or php_include: $mytab = 'bob'; organize_questions( $mytab); And then you would use the original $tab in the function as you created it earlier or as I stated just above with $tab in the parameter list
