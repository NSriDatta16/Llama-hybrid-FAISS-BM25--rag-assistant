I think this http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitFaq#Whywon.27tIseechangesintheremoterepoafter.22gitpush.22.3F basically explains what's going on, although it doesn't exactly explain the mechanism. I found that pulling does what I expect. Also this thread stackoverflow.com/questions/883878/update-website-with-a-single-command-git-push-instead-of-ftp-drag-and-dropping explains you have to do a 'git checkout -f' on the remote when you use push... Thanks
