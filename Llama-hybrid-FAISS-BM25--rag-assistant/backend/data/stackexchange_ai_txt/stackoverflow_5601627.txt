If the CalendarEvents for each entity (User, Organization, and Division) are mutually exclusive, I might start out with three identical tables of events: UserCalendarEvents, OrganizationCalendarEvents, and DivisionCalendarEvents. A better solution, though, may be to define those as three tables of links : UserCalendarEvents user_id calendar_event_id OrganizationCalendarEvents organization_id calendar_event_id DivisionCalendarEvents division_id calendar_event_id
