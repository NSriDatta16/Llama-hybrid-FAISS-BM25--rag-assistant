Getting a substring of text containing HTML tags

Getting a substring of text containing HTML tags Assume that you want the first 10 characters of the following: " this is paragraph 1 this is paragraph 2 " The output would be: " this is" The returned text contains an unclosed P tag. If this is rendered to a page, subsequent content will be affected by the open P tag. Ideally, the preferred output would close any unclosed HTML tags in reverse of when they were opened: " this is " I want a function that returns a subtring of HTML, making sure that no tags are left unclosed
