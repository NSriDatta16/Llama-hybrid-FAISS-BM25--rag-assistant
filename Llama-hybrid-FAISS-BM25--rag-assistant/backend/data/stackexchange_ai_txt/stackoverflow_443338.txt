If I understand correctly you need to check during the execution of your code whether a matrix has changed or not. Well, vectors don't support such functionality. However, what you can do is write a Matrix class of your own, add such functionality to it and use it instead of vectors. An example implementation could be: class Matrix { public: Matrix() : hasChanged(false) {} double setElement(int i, int j, double value) { innerStorage[i][j] = value; hasChanged = true; } double getElement(int i, int j) { return innerStorage[i][j]; } void clearHasChangedFlag() { hasChanged = false; } private: vector > innerStorage; bool hasChanged; }
