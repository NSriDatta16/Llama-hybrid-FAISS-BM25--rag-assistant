If you are writing an OO Application then I find that designing the objects first is the place to start. I'd rather create a good OO Design and then attempt to optimize the database rather than build a database then try to fit objects to the database. ORM tools gives you the freedom to focus your attention on the object design. However, it does not replace good Database Design. You still have to keep an eye on the database. I find that with careful thought, the OR mappings can be done so that the database created is fairly optimized. You can always look at the queries and attempt to optimize them if you find some queries are underperforming. You should not have to build an application that conforms to a database model, the database should be designed to support your applications. And ORM tools do allow you to create optimized databases and queries.
