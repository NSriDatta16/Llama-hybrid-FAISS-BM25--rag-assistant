designing an ASP.NET MVC partial view - showing user choices within a large set of choices

Consider a partial view whose job is to render markup for a pizza order. The desire is to reuse this partial view in the Create, Details, and Update views. It will always be passed an IEnumerable , and output a multitude of checkboxes. There are lots... maybe 40 in all (yes, that might smell). A-OK so far. Problem The question is around how to include the user's choices on the Details and Update views. From the datastore, we've got a List . The goal is to have each checkbox set to true for each chosen topping. What's the easiest to read, or most maintainable way to achieve this? Potential Solutions Create a ViewModel with the List and List. Write out the checkboxes as per normal. While writing each, check whether the ToppingID exists in the list of ChosenTopping . Create a new ViewModel that's a hybrid of both. Perhaps call it DisplayTopping or similar. It would have property ID , Name and IsUserChosen . The respective controller methods for Create, Update, and Details would have to create this new collection with respect to the user's choices as they see fit. The Create controller method would basically set all to false so that it appears to be a blank slate. The real application isn't pizza, and the organization is a bit different from the fakeshot, but the concept is the same. Is it wise to reuse the control for the 3 different scenarios? How better can you display the list of options + the user's current choices? Would you use jQuery instead to show the user selections? Any other thoughts on the potential smell of splashing up a whole bunch of checkboxes?
