Averaging a set of points on a Google Map into a smaller set

I'm displaying a small Google map on a web page using the Google Maps Static API. I have a set of 15 co-ordinates, which I'd like to represent as points on the map. Due to the map being fairly small (184 x 90 pixels) and the upper limit of 2000 characters on a Google Maps URL, I can't represent every point on the map. So instead I'd like to generate a small list of co-ordinates that represents an average of the big list. So instead of having 15 sets, I'd end up with 5 sets, who's positions approximate the positions of the 15. Say there are 3 points that are in closer proximity to each-other than to any other point on the map, those points will be collapsed into 1 point. So I guess I'm looking for an algorithm that can do this. Not asking anyone to spell out every step, but perhaps point me in the direction of a mathematical principle or general-purpose function for this kind of thing? I'm sure a similar function is used in, say, graphics software, when pixellating an image. (If I solve this I'll be sure to post my results.)
