It's generally consecutive but it depends on which JVM you are using. One complication is that runtime in memory structure of Java objects is not enforced by the virtual machine specification, which means that virtual machine providers can implement them as they please. The consequence is that you can write a class, and instances of that class in one VM can occupy a different amount of memory than instances of that same class when run in another VM. As for the specific layout, In order to save some memory, the Sun VM doesn't lay out object's attributes in the same order they are declared. Instead, the attributes are organized in memory in the following order: doubles and longs ints and floats shorts and chars booleans and bytes references (from http://www.codeinstructions.com/2008/12/java-objects-memory-structure.html ) He also includes how inherited classes are handled.
