Interpreting Probability of Logistic Regression

The accepted answer at this post is consistent with my understanding: Intepreting 'one-unit' Change in Logistic Regression Especially where it says: To find the change in terms of the proportions that are modelled you need to: Get the log(odds) estimate. Exponentiate it to get the odds. Get the new proportions as: Prnew=odds1+odds. (This follows from the equality shown above.) My questions is whether you can make a statement about what happens to probability based on a one unit increase of the coeficient. Since prob = e^(bo + b1x1 + b2x2) / ( 1 + e^(bo + b1x1 + b2x2)) it seems that it is not linear, so that you couldn't. In addition, there is this comment on the same post: "Notice that the change to the predicted proportions is not quantized in the same way as the log(odd) transform is not linear." A friend in an analytics course, though, is telling me that perhaps we could, get the change in odds by taking the log, then get the change in probability by evaluating the odds and using odds / (1 + odds) for probability. Is this possible or not?
