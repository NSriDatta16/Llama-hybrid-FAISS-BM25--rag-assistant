Are there any e-Books (or books) covering the iPhone SDK 3.0?

The iPhone SDK 3.0 has been in beta for a few months, so I would think that by now there would be some good reference/tutorial material floating around in the form of e-books (it may be a little too early for print books). So far, I only came across iPhone SDK Development from The Pragmatic Bookshelf. It covers the SDK up to version 3.0, but the book is still in "beta". Are there any others?
