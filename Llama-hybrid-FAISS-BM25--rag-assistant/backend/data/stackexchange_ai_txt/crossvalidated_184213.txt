All depends on what type of data you would like to perform the pattern recognition in time-series: words/expressions on web, imagery or voice recognition. I have more experience in the first, and from what I know, the most popular : structural learning algorithms like CRF , and from the newest - NuPic , that is, apparently, very popular also for imagery and voice recognition too. also check Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks for pattern recognition in time-series, that are actively used by giants like Google
