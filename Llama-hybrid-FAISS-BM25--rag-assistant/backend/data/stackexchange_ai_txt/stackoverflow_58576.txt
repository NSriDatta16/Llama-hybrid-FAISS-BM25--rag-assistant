What about embedding a 'what' string in the executables and libraries. Then you can synchronise the desired list of versions with a manifest. We tend to use CVS id strings as a part of the what string. const char cvsid[] = "@(#)INETOPS_filter_ip_$Revision: 1.9 $"; Entering the command what filter_ip | grep INETOPS returns INETOPS_filter_ip_$Revision: 1.9 $ We do this for all deliverables so we can see if the versions in a bundle of libraries and executables match the list in a associated manifest. HTH. cheers, Rob
