What information can I gain from the fourier transform?

I have acceleration data in 3D vectors ( x , y , z ). For detecting certain patterns within the data stream, I use a fixed moving window to generate many statistic features, like mean, max, kurtosis,... I use these feature vectors to detect key strokes. My results are already quite ok, but I want to improve them. And many papers in this field used the fourier transformation (or fft ) to improve their results. I never worked in the frequency domain, so I don't know what this is used for and what information I could gain from using fft . Most articles I found on this topic are focused on audio stuff. Here a sample plot of the data I capture (only the right graph): These graphs correspond to the sequence of "0123034880". The spikes occur during a tap event Can someone please give me a more general explanation of the fft and what information I can gain from it having a time series of data?
