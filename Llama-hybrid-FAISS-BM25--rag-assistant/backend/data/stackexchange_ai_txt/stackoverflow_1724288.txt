This apparently simple question has been messing up with my mind since yesterday evening! I looked for the topic of simulating distributions with a dependency, and the best I found is this: simulate dependent random variables . The gist of it is, you can easily simulate 2 normals with given correlation, and they outline a method to transform these non-independent normals, but this won't preserve correlation. The correlation of the transform will be correlated, so to speak, but not identical. See the paragraph "Rank correlation coefficents". Edit: from what I gather from the second part of the article, the copula method would allow you to simulate / generate random variables with rank correlation.
