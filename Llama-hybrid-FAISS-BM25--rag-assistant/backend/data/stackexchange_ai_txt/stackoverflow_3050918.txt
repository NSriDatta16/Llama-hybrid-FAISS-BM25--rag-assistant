This isn't your perfect answer, but i needed something similar... adding a remove() handler to the sortable will allow you to clone the element that's about to be removed. Try this: $(function() { $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable', remove: function(event,ui){ ui.item.clone().appendTo('#sortable1'); } }).disableSelection(); }); if you drag an item from sortable1 to sortable2, it will be added to the bottom of sortable1 when you drop it. it would make most sense to clone the item when dragging starts, then delete the clone if the drag is unsuccessful. but I couldn't find the event that fires when you begin a drag.
