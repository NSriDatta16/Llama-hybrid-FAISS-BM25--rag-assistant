Best way to implement a 3-column website using tags?

I'm developing a 3-column website using a layout like this: ... ... ... But, considering the default CSS 'position' property of 's is 'static', my 's were shown one below the other, as expected. So I set the CSS property 'position' to 'relative', and changed the 'top' property of the 'middle' and 'right' 's to -(minus) the height of the preceding . It worked fine, but this approach brought me two problems: 1) Even though Internet Explorer 7 shows three columns properly, it still keeps the vertical scrollbar as if the 's were positioned one below the other, and there is a lot of white space after the content is over. I would'n like to have that. 2) The height of these elements is variable, so I don't really know which value to set for each 's 'top' property; and I wouldn't like to hardcode it. So my question is, what would be the best (simple + elegant) way to implement this layout? I would like to avoid absolute positioning , and I also to keep my design tableless.
