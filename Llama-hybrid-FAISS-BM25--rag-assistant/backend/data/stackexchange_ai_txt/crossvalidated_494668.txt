`glmnet()` variable importance interpretation using `varImp()` and `vi_model()`

I fitted a Lasso Logistic Regression model using glmnet X = data.matrix(mtcars %>% dplyr::select(-vs)) y = mtcars$vs CV_lasso = cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, family = "binomial", type.measure = "class") I was trying to determine variable importance and came across two methods CV_lasso$glmnet.fit %>% varImp(lambda = CV_lasso$lambda.min, scale = F) CV_lasso$glmnet.fit %>% vi_model(s = CV_lasso$lambda.min) What actually is the importance measurement? If a variable has a higher score, does that make it more important? Why does varImp() give me importance as absolute values whilst vi_model gives retains the sign? Which one is a better measurement of variable importance? How can I describe the effects of the most important variables on my outcome variable?
