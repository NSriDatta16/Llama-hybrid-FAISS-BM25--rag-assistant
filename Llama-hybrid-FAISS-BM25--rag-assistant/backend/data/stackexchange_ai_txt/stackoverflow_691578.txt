Yes you can, but it's kinda fragile and not very straightforward. The SplashScreen class looks for an AssemblyName + ".g" resource file. To create it, you need to include a "g.resx" file in your project. The root namespace as set in project properties must be the same as the assembly name. This resource file needs to contain the image as a MemoryStream, NOT a System.Drawing.Bitmap! Perhaps there's an easier way, but I just included the file and then manually changed the entry to look like this: Splash.png;System.IO.MemoryStream, mscorlib, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 Then just include the following lines in your Main method: var splash = new SplashScreen("Splash.png"); splash.Show(true); Hope that helps.
