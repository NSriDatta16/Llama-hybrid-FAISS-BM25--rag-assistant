Ok, it took me some time but now I think that I'm properly able to build the static libs or GEOS for iPhone (x86 and ARM for both the simulator and the real device) : libgeos.a and libgeos_c.a : the implementation and its api. You can get the binaires there (for GEOS version 3.1.1, this is not the very last one) : http://bit.ly/aTKsI6 (there are some other binaries there, the rest is for spatialite) The job has been mostly achieved by understanding the way cross compilation is done via .sh scripts. This blog is a must see for that : http://robertcarlsen.net/2009/07/15/cross-compiling-for-iphone-dev-884
