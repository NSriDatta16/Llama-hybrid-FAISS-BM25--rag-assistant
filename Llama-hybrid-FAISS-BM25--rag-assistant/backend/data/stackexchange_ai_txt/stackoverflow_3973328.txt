There are many truly header-only Boost libraries, but they tend to be very simple (and/or only templates). The bigger libraries accomplish the same effect through some trickery: they have "automatic linking" (you'll see this term used here ). They essentially have a bunch of preprocessor directives in the headers that figure out the appropriate lib file for your platform and use a #pragma to instruct the linker to link it in. So you don't have to explicitly link it, but it is still being linked.
