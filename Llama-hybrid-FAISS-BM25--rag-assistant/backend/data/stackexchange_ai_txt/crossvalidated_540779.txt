I think it is exactly what the two one-sided tests procedure (TOST) does. TOST concedes that there might be some small effect but shows, with some level of confidence, that the effect is below the threshold of causing us to care. Perhaps there is a bit of autocorrelation, but an autocorrelation of $0.01$ might be effectively zero. If you truly want to show the value to be zero, not close to zero, with some confidence (credibility...), I cannot see a way to do it without going Bayesian and using a prior with $P(0)>0$ . If you want to be frequentist, then I think the best you can do is to bound the value in a range. (I do not have enough experience with Bayesian methods to have much of an opinion of using a prior that puts $P(\text{what we want})>0$ , but that sure sounds like rigging the test.) $$\text{TOST}\\ H_0: \vert\theta\vert\ge d\\ H_a: \vert\theta\vert In this way, we flip the null and alternative hypothesis to show that the value of interest, $\theta$ , is less than our tolerance for difference from zero, $d$ . There are equivalences between TOST and power calculations , so I think this satisfies your requirement for controlling power that you mentioned in your comment to Lewian.
