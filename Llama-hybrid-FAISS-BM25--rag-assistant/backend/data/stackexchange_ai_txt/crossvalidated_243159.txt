Look into fractional logistic regression, which I suspect is what you're trying to get at intuitively. You already realize that linear regression can give you predictions that are out of bounds. You might or might not have realized that linear regression is also inefficient, because you can't possibly have constant variance of the error term. For example, How to do logistic regression in R when outcome is fractional (a ratio of two counts)? Beta regression is another possibility. It's always possible that neither is appropriate, because you haven't given much information about the nature of the dependent variable (maybe ordered logit is more appropriate?), so you will have to judge for yourself.
