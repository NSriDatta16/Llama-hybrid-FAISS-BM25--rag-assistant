Union tables by field name? (i.e. columns order cannot be guaranteed)

I'd like to stack tables via UNION, but do it by field name, as the tables have mostly the same fields, but each table may not have all the fields, and the column order may differ. E.g. Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Age Age Age Height Height Height Height Weight Weight Weight Weight Age Race Race Gender Gender --- Gender For instance, the following code may break in the example below: SELECT * FROM TABLE 1 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM TABLE 2 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM TABLE 3 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM TABLE 4 The motivating example is surveys with quarterly or annual waves. Sometimes fields get dropped and others added each year. I'd like to set up a process now that won't require excessive attention to mapping out past changes or break as a result of minor future changes. Languages like SAS will handle that gracefully matching columns by name. Is there a way to do that concisely in SQL, like "UNION ALL BY NAME" or something?
