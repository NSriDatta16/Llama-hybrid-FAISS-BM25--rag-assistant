There's no server-side way to do it. You could work with AJAX, but this will break the site for non-javascript users. The best way would probably be to have server-side content URLs ( index.php?page= ) and rewrite these locally with JavaScript (to # ) and handle the content loading with AJAX then . That way you can have your hash-URLs for JS-enabled devices and everybody else can still use the site. It does however require a bit of redundance because you need to provide the same content twice, once for inclusion via AJAX and once with the proper layout and everything via PHP. If you just want hash URLs for aesthetic reasons, but don't want to rely on JS, you're out of luck. The semantics of URLs are against you: fragment IDs shouldn't really affect the content the URL is referring to, merely the fragment within that content. AJAX URLs are changing those semantics, but there's no good reason to do that if you don't have to.
