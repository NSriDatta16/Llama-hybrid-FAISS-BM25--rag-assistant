Interpretation of logistic regression summary

I'm having trouble understanding how to interpret the results in this particular situation. The research topic is to understand how different cat species (Cats 1-3) get infected by a specific parasite. In the table above, the base category is Cat1. The p-value for the intercept is high, so we cannot conclude Cat1 has a high/low probability of infection. But, we can say that Cat2 has significantly lower odds of infection than Cat1 since the odds ratio is exp(3.52) = 34 (approx.). In this situation what can I say about the odds (or probability) of infection for Cat2? (Although Cat1 has higher odds than Cat2, we can't say if Cat1 has a high/low probability of infection). This part seems confusing to me, so any help would be appreciated.
