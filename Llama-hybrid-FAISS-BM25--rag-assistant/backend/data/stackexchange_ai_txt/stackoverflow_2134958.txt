I asked same question to myself. And unlike answers above there is something I can do about my app increasing max heap JVM size. If app is a web server in cluster mode, I could start a new instance with changed min/max heap size and than shutdown initial instance. That shall be especially simple in GlassFish where you have management instance separated from nodeAgent(app server clustered instance) JVM. Since many JVM applications are web apps, I think it worth to preserve in this blog.
