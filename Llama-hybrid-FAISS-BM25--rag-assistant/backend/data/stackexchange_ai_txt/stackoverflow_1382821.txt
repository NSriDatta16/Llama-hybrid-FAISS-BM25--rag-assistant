I learnt ARM assembly and find it quite easy and powerful. I don't think shofting operands and such things confusing. At least because I learnt ARM asm first and then I read something about x86 asm. I find that most features missing on x86 are points of strenght on ARM, for example multiple register store/read and conditional execution. Pl.us, I find very helpful having so many registers. I think this is the usual 'religion war' RISC vs CISC, ARM vs x86. IMHO is too much subjective to be a universal principle. For example Martin v. LÃ¶wis finds ARM unelegant, while I find it so much more elegant than x86. I also gave a shot at a microcontroller asm (Texas Instruments, can't recall the exact model name) and found it quite unelegant, while many other people may find it the 'perfect' asm.
