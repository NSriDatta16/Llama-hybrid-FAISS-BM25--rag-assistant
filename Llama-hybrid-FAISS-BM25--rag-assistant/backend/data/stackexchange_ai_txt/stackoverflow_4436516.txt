You can check the number for transcription errors (or for a really stupid forger) on your own (see Dennis's answer ). To check the credit card number for actual validity (as in: has the card been issued, has it been declared as stolen, etc.), or to check that the expiration date, name, etc., you need to contact the issuing bank (or credit card organization). You need to open an account with them (or more typically through your own bank acting as a forwarder). This is a service that you pay for. It's usually provided as part of a bigger package including the possibility of issuing credit card payments. Once you have chosen a provider, they will supply a piece of software to contact their service, and more importantly credentials for their service that will remain valid as long as your contract with them runs.
