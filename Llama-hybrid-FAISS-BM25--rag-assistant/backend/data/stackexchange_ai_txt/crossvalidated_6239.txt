Subsetting R time series vectors

I have a time series and I want to subset it while keeping it as a time series, preserving the start, end, and frequency. For example, let's say I have a time series: > qs qs Qtr1 Qtr2 Qtr3 Qtr4 2009 101 102 103 2010 104 105 106 107 2011 108 109 110 Now I will subset it: > qs[time(qs) >= 2010 & time(qs) Notice that I got the correct results, but I lost the "wrappings" from the time series (namely start, end, frequency.) I'm looking for a function for this. Isn't subsetting a time series is a common scenario? Since I haven't found one yet, here is a function I wrote: subset.ts = start & time(data) I'd like to hear about improvements or cleaner ways to do this. In particular, I don't like the way I'm hard-coding start and end. I'd rather let the user specify an arbitrary boolean condition.
