How do I apply a style to multiple selections in Word using VBA?

I created a macro that will apply a particular style to whatever is selected in the document. However, when in draft view, when the user clicks in the style area pane to select a paragraph and then Ctrl + clicks on an additional paragraph, this additional selection is not applied when this macro is run: Sub BodyTextApply() Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Body Text,bt") End Sub What do I need to add to this? Note: The workflow cannot change so that the user selects that actual text in the document; they are set on using the style area pane... The workflow is as follows: alt text http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1994/91231840.png The (undesired) output is as follows: alt text http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/1239/outputt.png
