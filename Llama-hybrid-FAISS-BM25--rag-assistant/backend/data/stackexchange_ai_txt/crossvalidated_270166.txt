This question has already been answered here cell = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_nodes) with tf.variable_scope("LSTM") as vs: # Execute the LSTM cell here in any way, for example: for i in range(num_steps): output[i], state = cell(input_data[i], state) # Retrieve just the LSTM variables. lstm_variables = [v for v in tf.all_variables() if v.name.startswith(vs.name)] # [..] # Initialize the LSTM variables. tf.initialize_variables(lstm_variables)
