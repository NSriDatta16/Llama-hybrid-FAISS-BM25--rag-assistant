You measure the performance for each person multiple times on different days and compare the two groups with the same people in each group. Therefore you should treat the two groups as non-independent, because it is very likely that the performance of one person will correlate on different days. There are several options to test your hypothesis. Some ideas (assuming the requirements are met): A simple method would be to calculate the average performance for each person, separated for week 1 and week 2. Then you compare the two means using a paired t-test. However, this will ignore some information like the size or composition of the workgroup. Another approach is a repeated-measure ANOVA, where you could include the performance of each day, as well as covariates like the group size. Then you test your hypothesis using contrasts. The composition of the workgroup is still ignored. If you have reason to believe the performance is dependent on the composition of the workgroup, you could do a multilevel/mixed-design model and add the day as a random effect.
