Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop does this a bit. It's a tough read, but usually worth it once you make it through. For instance: He discusses Gaussian Processes in the context of Kernel methods (like Support Vector Machines) and briefly discusses their connection to Neural Networks. He starts his discussion of the EM algorithm with an explanation of k-means clustering. He describes Bayesian Networks and Markov Random Fields under the heading of Graphical Models.
