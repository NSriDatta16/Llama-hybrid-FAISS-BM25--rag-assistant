Is it possible to replace the Mac login screen?

Is it possible to replace the Mac OS X login window, /System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app, with a custom login window application? ( See my rational for doing so .) I'm afraid my Cocoa programming skills are rudimentary. I do find it interesting that, when I run probe CGSession (which is a undocumented utility that performs fast user switching) to see what functions it uses, by doing nm -mg /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession that one of the linked function is: (undefined [lazy bound]) external _CGSCreateLoginSession (from ApplicationServices) I haven't found documentation on the ApplicationServices framework. I suspect I'm getting deep into Service Provider Interfaces instead of Application Programmer Interfaces. I did find this really interesting snippet: ( google cache ) ( direct link to down page ; it appears the site is undergoing re-organization) from an application that claims to switch to the login window even if fast user switching is disabled. #include "CGSInternal.h" int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) { // switch to the login window CGSCreateLoginSession(NULL); return 0; } I take CG to mean CoreGraphics, and don't understand what that has to do with logging in (except with perhaps putting a login dialog up over the current user's work). Even if it is not possible to achieve a replacement for the login window, I'd be interested to know what can be done along these lines (by people who don't work for Apple).
