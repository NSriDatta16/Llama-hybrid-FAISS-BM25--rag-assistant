Then the probability of passing the exam becomes 4/100 or 0.04. We say that "out of 100 students" 4 passes the exam. This is only one of several definitions of probability. See for example the How exactly do Bayesians define (or interpret?) probability? thread for another one. Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that follows specific axioms , it does not necessarily need to reflect the relative frequencies in the data. The empirical frequencies in not every case can be even calculated, e.g. “probability that Trump gets re-elected a second time” can either happen or not, you cannot count “how often” it happens. Another thing is probability calibration. Even in cases when you expect the probabilities to reflect the empirical frequencies, some models do it poorly and need to be corrected (see calibration ). So the safest way to think of the predicted probabilities is as of continuous score, “the higher the better”, where the higher score the more “likely” it is.
