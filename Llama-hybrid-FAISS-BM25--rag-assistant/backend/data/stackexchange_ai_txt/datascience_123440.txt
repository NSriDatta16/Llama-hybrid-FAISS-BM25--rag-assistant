How to predict binary values for time series models?

How one can predict 100 new binary values (0s and 1s) if there are 3200 previous values? Note that there is no seasonality, but just a set of numbers. I used Arima, lgbm, Markova but it predicts randomly (about 50 percent accuracy), lstm gives all zeros.
