Time Series is about analysing the way values of a series are dependent on previous values. As SRKX suggested one can difference or de-trend or de-mean a non-stationary series but not unnecessarily!) to create a stationary series. ARMA analysis requires stationarity. $X$ is strictly stationary if the distribution of $(X_{t+1},\ldots,X_{t+k})$ is identical to that of $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ for each $t$ and $k$. From Wiki: a stationary process (or strict(ly) stationary process or strong(ly) stationary process) is a stochastic process whose joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time or space. Consequently, parameters such as the mean and variance, if they exist, also do not change over time or position. In addition as Cardinal has correctly pointed out below the autocorrelation function must be invariant over time (which means that the covariance function is constant over time) converts to parameters of the ARMA model being invariant/constant for all time intervals. The idea of stationarity of the ARMA model is closely tied into the idea of invertibility. Consider a model of the form $y(t)=1.1 \,y(t-1)$. This model is explosive as the polynomial $(1-1.1 B)$ has roots inside the unit circle and thus violates a requirement. A model that has roots inside the unit circle means that "older data" is more important than "newer data" which of course doesn't make sense.
