Inline stretchy button with CSS background image

Anyone know if there's a bullet-proof (standards-compliant to XHTML1.1 strict, cross-browser, non-javascript) way to use CSS and background images to turn an inline link into a visual button that will stretch to accommodate different amounts of text (or text resizing)? I'm thinking I need to use background images as the designer's buttons have rounded corners with a different coloured border. It must work in IE6 (Government job). Im pretty sure the answer is no, but as always thought it worth a check. Amongst other things, I've already tried variations on the sliding doors technique , but can't make it work as the solution needs to work inline (i.e. within a paragraph) and I can't set a fixed width. EDIT: There are several buttons, each of which has a different colour for foreground, border and background. They also have a gradient 'face', but no need for transparency or anything else 'unorthodox'. Unfortunately I can't link to examples as I'm under an NDA.
