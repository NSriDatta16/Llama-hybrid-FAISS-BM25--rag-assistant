Well that depends on a lot of things. Basically, YES, if you know a URL, you can see what is behind. The hacker will be able to do whatever he wants once he/she has the session id. A cookie based session id can also be intercepted by the hacker if he/she has access to the http flow. Nevertheless there are a few additional securities that can be put in place. For example : (session id) should be valid only for a short period (session id) can be valid only for a specific IP (the IP that created the session) (session id) can be valid only for a certain user-agent / flash version / .. signature (session id) can be changed for each new page view, deprecating the previous session_id When handling credit card information, Always use https. It is more secure because the datas are encrypted between at least the browser and the first https proxy on the route to the server The case when you would need to manipulate credit card information yourself are rare. Websites handling credit card by themselves nowadays are more and more forced to respect the PCI/DSS rules which can be quite a burden. You should probably get a contract with a banking solution where the credit card will be submited on their web pages, or use paypal for instance. Never keep credit card information in your database unless you have the necessary security solutions in place, with a regular external audit. The following link may give you further insights on session id best practices. I hope this will help you Jerome WAGNER
