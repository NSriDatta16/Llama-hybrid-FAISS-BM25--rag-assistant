How to give the input of an image to SVM after preprocessing

I got a dataset of images(GRAZ_02 Data set-Cars,Bikes,People) and extracted features from each and every image in the database using a descriptor(SIFT algorithm) that returns a matrix of order :(No. of interest points)X128. Since the number of interest points detected for each image varies from image to image,the output Descriptot Matrix is not uniform.In order to overcome this problem,we are using K-means clustering that gives same sized desriptorl the presence for the purpose of classification(presence/absence of an object). My question is that how is this matrix :(kX128) for each and every image converted into vector so that it can be applied on the SVM classification?
