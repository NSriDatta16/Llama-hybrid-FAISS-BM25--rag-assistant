Wrap words in tags using XSLT

How can I wrap span tags (or any tag) around individual words in XSLT? I'm using XSLT1 but seem to be getting stuck each time I try. Essentially, I want to pass in a paragraph (or string of text): This is my text! and wrap each word like so, preserving the whitespace and punctuation between each word: This is my text! It's mainly for presentational purposes, I'd appreciate any help
