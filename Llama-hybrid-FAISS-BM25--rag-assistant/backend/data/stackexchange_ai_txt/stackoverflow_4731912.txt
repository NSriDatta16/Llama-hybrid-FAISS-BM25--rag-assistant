If your tap is passive, returning NULL will leave the event stream unaffected. From the CGEventTapCallBack reference documentation: "If the event tap is an passive listener, your callback function may return the event that is passed in, or NULL. In either case, the event stream is not affected." However, it looks like your tap is active. Thus your returning NULL should delete the event. Have you considered modifying the event to nullify the action? Also note that the call CGEventTapCreate requires root user permissions to intercept all events. Is your process running as root?
