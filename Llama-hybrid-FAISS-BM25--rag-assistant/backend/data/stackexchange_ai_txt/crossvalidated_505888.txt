How can a stochastic filter be forecasted?

After the covid-19 lockdown, employment (and other economic indicators) were shocked. I want to model a recovery in employment levels. I used an AR(2) model of quarter-on-quarter (q/q) employment growth, which I used to forecast employment after 2020 Q3, by industry. However, the two autoregressive coefficients tended to be negative, so after the positive growth in 2020Q3 and 2020Q4, the growth after that was not high enough. I'm not that experienced at time series analysis, so I haven't learnt about non-stationary analysis yet. I do want to try model an autoregression on the deviations from a stochastic filter of the log employment level, though. I know how to forecast a linear trendline, but I don't yet know how to forecast a stochastic filter. How can a stochastic filter be forecasted?
