The issues involved in using meta-analytic methods with the R glmutil package are discussed in this web page http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:model_selection_with_glmulti by Wolfgan Viechtbauer. It is a substantial document too long to summarise adequately here. This question would perhaps have been more on topic on the R list dedicated to meta-analysis https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-meta-analysis// where questions about coding and statistical methods are welcome.
