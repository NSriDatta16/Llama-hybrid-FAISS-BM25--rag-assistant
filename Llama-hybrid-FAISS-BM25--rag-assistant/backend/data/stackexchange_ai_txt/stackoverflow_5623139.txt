Kohana 3 Auth in IE

Kohana Auth is not validating in IE. I have read some stuff from discussions on v.2 about changing from user_agent to user_ip... presumably in the ORM file in the AUTH module, how ever this is not resolving my issue. Another post on v.2 suggest using this They do not mention where to use this at however. We found this kind of late in testing (where is that thread about the lack of importance of software engineering in school?) and are pretty locked into using AUTH at this point. I have been beating my head against a wall for hours over this and have gotten virtually no where. Please HELP! Thank you, -David
