variable reduction before doing random forest in R

I have a dataset featuring around 50 predictors, some of which are correlated. Now I am trying to fit a random forest model in R for prediction purpose with this dataset. Because there are too many predictors, I want to remove some of the predictors. The only way I can think of is VIF analysis. Is it correct to do VIF to remove variable before doing random forest? Are there other ways to reduce variables for random forests? Is it necessary to remove variables for random forest model?
