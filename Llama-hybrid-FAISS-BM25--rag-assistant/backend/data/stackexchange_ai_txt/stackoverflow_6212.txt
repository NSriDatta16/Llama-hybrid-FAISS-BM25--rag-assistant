Are you just talking about the interface and storage, or the implementation of sending the emails as well? Yes, a SQL table with FROM, TO, Subject, Body should work for storage and, heck, a textbox or even maybe a RichText box should work for editing. Or is this a web interface? For actually sending it, check out the System.Web.Mail namespace, it's pretty self explanatory and easy to use :)
