Are the data in this figure normally distributed?

What kind of distribution is figure 2 in this study? If it's a Gaussian distribution for the LH hormone, I can't make any sense of the data. The article: Aksglaede, L. et al. (2009): Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study.
