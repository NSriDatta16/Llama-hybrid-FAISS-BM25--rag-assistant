Since Ettercap is opensource you can change its source code to do what you want. Running your own C code to rewrite a TCP stream should be relatively easy. The hard work has already been done. Take a look at the etterfilter man page to get started. Search in the source code for the filter engine (apparently it's a JIT interpreter). I would also try to mail this question to the etterfilter authors, maybe they like stackoverflow :-) Note: to use Python instead of C, see http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ext/embedding.html
