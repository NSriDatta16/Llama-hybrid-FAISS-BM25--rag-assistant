If you really want the same model order to fit all the players, you could do the following. Decide the order or integration, I suppose it is I(0). Define the pool of candidate models, e.g. { ARIMA(0,0,0), ARIMA(0,0,1), ARIMA(1,0,0), ARIMA(1,0,1) }. Estimate each model on each player's data (it will take two for loops nested in each other, one across models and the other across players), obtain AIC of each model. See which model order gives the lowest average AIC when averaged over all players. This will be the model order you will choose. But I would also consider allowing for different model orders for different players. Why not try function auto.arima from "forecast" package for each player separately; auto.arima usually works quite well. You could compare both methods (1. the same order for all players, 2. different orders for different players) by splitting your data into a pseudo "in-sample" (e.g. first 33 values for each player) and pseudo "out-of-sample" (e.g. last 5 values for each player) and see which method applied on the "in-sample" data produces better forecasts of the "out-of-sample" data.
