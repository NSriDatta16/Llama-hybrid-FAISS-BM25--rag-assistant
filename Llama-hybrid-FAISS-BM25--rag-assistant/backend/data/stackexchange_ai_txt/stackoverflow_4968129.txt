jquery - drag & drop from container with overflow set

I have a conundrum. I had an issue with dragging from a container with overflow:scroll set as a style. The dragged element would drop ok in the desired position, but as you were dragging it, it would disappear behind elements until you dropped it. I found a solution to this using appendTo:'body' applied to the draggable settings. All was good.... ...until I tested in IE6/7, where I encountered another known issue - of the contents of the container spilling out. The fix this time was to set position:relative to the container. This fixed that issue, but now elements being dragged fall behind other elements again. It seems you cannot have both fixes running concurrently. Or can they? Any ideas?
