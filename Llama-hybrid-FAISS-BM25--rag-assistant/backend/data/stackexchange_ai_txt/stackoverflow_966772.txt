To make maintenance easier you want to keep the number of different programing languages to a minimum. For me the answer is that I use 2-3 in an average project. Currently I use three languages at work: 1. C++ for needed low level programing. 2. C# for application level programing. 3. VB.NET for some VB related functionality and code examples shipped with the application. I've used C# and C++ in many projects and found that it covers most of the project's needs.
