Use the class qualifier twice, eg.: .major.minor { ... } But . It doesn't work in IE6 (or in IE7 either when in Quirks Mode ). When you specify multiple class selectors on the same element, IE only pays attention to the last one. So the above selector would match any element with class="minor" . Workarounds include duplicating multiple classes as a single class: .major-minor { ... } ... Or, if spare elements are available to make it clean, containment: .major .minor { ... } ...
