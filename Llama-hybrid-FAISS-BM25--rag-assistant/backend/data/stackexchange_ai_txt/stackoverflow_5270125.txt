magento custom theme

I am a newbie in magento. I want to have a theme with a black background header with my logo, a dark grey image in the footer with some text on it and in the middle a black coloured area that is blank. Can someone suggest me how should I start. Right now I was using the default theme and changing the styles.css and header and footer html files. But somehowe its not working the way I want it to be and will this be the right way. Please help me out. Thanx in advance.
