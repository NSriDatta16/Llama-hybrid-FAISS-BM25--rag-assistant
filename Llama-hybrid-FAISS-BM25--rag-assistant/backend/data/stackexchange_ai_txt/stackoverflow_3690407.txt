Moving a 3d camera on XNA

Im doing some practices on XNA, and i created a class that represents a Camera. My objective is that when the user press some keys make a translation of the camera (not the target) 90 degrees in the X axys (to see an object that i placed in the scene from different angles). By the moment i move the camera in X, Y, and Z without problems. Actually to set up my camera i use the following lines of code: public void SetUpCamera() { #region ## SET DEFAULTS ## this.FieldOfViewAngle = 45.0f; this.AspectRatio =1f; this.NearPlane = 1.0f; this.FarPlane = 10000.0f; #endregion this.ProjectionMatrix = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.ToRadians(this.FieldOfViewAngle), 16 / 9, this.NearPlane, this.FarPlane); this.ViewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(new Vector3(this.PositionX, this.PositionY, this.PositionZ), new Vector3(this.TargetX, this.TargetY, this.TargetZ), Vector3.Up); } I have this method to move the camera: public void UpdateView() { this.ViewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(new Vector3(this.PositionX, this.PositionY, this.PositionZ), new Vector3(this.TargetX, this.TargetY, this.TargetZ), Vector3.Up); } Then in the game (update event handler i have the following code) if (keyboardstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.NumPad9)) { this.GameCamera.PositionZ -= 1.0f; } if (keyboardstate.IsKeyDown(Keys.NumPad3)) { this.GameCamera.PositionZ += 1.0f; } this.GameCamera.UpdateView(); I would like to know how to make this camera translation of 90 degrees to surround one object that i placed in the screen. To explain my self better about the camera movement here is a video on youtube that uses the exact movement that im trying to describe (see from 14 second) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19mbKZ0I5u4
