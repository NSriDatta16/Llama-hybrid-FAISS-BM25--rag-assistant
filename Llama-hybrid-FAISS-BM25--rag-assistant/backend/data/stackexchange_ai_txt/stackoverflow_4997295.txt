It's pretty simple. Pay attention and you'll get it right away! :) You will create a html array, which will be then sent to php array. Your html code will look like this: Where [1] [2] [3] are the ID s of your messages, meaning that you will echo your $row['Report ID'] in their place. Then, when you submit the form, your PHP array will look like this: print_r($check_list) [1] => checked [3] => checked Depending on which were checked and which were not. I'm sure you can continue from this point forward.
