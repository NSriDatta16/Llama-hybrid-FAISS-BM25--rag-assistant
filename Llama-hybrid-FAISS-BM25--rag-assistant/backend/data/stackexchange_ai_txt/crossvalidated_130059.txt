Social Science Trade Book

I am looking for a book (not textbook) to use in an undergraduate statistics course. I would like to find a book with a clear central thesis relying largely on statistical reasoning and evidence to support the thesis. I would use the book to motivate discussions on measurement, research design, validity, reliability, sampling, statistics etc. In the past, I've used Putnam's Bowling Alone and Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness. I've considered Sunstein & Thaler's Nudge, various Malcom Gladwell books, Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Ideally, I find a book with broad appeal and plenty of social science (perhaps conflicting) to draw upon. A bonus would be a book with supporting, publicly available data set. Ideas?
