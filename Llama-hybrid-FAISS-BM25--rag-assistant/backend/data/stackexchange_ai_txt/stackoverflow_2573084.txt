@iain: Ran out of room in the comment box so posting it here for clarity. The use of if statements isn't a bad idea! I know that if statements in macros may have some pitfalls so I'd have to be especially careful constructing them and using them. For example: if (error) TRACE_DEBUG ...would end up executing do_something_for_success() if an error occurs and debug-level trace statements are disabled because the else statement binds with the inner if-statement. However, most coding styles mandate use of curly braces which would solve the problem. if (error) { TRACE_DEBUG In this code fragment, do_something_for_success() is not erroneously executed if debug-level tracing is disabled.
