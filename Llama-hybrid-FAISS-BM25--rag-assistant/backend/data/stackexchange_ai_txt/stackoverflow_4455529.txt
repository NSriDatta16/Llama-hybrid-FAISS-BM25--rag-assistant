Is this possible in SQL?

I have this homework to do and I have been trying for hours without even knowing if this is possible to be done: For every Client and every month of 2009, find the average transaction before the month the average transaction after the month and show a list of the Client Code and the months where the second average transaction is bigger than the first one. I have tried using while but failed then tried to use one selection but failed then thought of creating views but I would need 12 or 24 depending on how I do it, then thought of creating a table holding dates of each month and then creating 2 views,but I doubt this is gonna work. (The tables I need here and its columns are Clients(Code), Transactions(Date_and_time_of_transaction, Amount_of_transaction) I don't mind not getting the full solution at all. I just need something to help me go on and solve this.Let's say a "guiding light". EDIT:Out of the top of my head when I started I tried this DECLARE @COUNTER as int SET @COUNTER = 0 WHILE @COUNTER = @COUNTER) GROUP BY Clients.Clients_Code END
