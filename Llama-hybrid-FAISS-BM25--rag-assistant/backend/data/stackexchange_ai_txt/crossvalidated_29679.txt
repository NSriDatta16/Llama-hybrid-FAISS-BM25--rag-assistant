Nice question, and nice dataset (+1) Here you have to take decisions. You know where your clusters are intuitively since you are able to describe them. Cluster analysis, or Principal Component Analysis etc. would give you the "natural" segmentation of your dataset, not necessarily the one that you want to impose on it. As I see it, you have to make the jump from "high score on all dimensions" to 5 defined numbers. You can make 4 centroids that correspond to the average 5 scores you expect from each type and assign each company to the type of the nearest centroid (Euclidean distance). An alternative might be to use a trusted subset of the data where you know which class a company belongs to in order to train a model like Linear Discrimnant Analysis . Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the class of the other companies. In R this is really easy. library(MASS) trained
