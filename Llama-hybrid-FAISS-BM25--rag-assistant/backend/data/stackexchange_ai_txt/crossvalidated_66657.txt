Does trigram guarantee to perform more accurately than bigram?

When implementing some NLP project, such as text segmentation, Name Entity Recognition, does using trigram guarantee to perform more accurately than bigram? $$ Trigram: p(s_t\mid s_{t-2}, s_{t-1}) $$ $$ Bigram: p(s_t\mid s_{t-1}) $$ EDIT: I was using an HMM to do NER on citation records(publications). I was using the bigram in my implementation. The accuracy was ok. I see Michael Collins' NLP class on Coursera where he uses a trigram HMM to do POS tagging. So I was wondering if trigram will boost the performance significantly or just a little bit. And I'm also curious if in any case trigram will perform worse than bigram. whuber has already given a very good overview of the advantages and disadvantages of trigram in the comments.
