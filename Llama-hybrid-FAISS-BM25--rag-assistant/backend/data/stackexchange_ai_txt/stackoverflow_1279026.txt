Dealing with Java EE fragmentation

Embarking on a another new server side project (java based) and the question here is whether to stick to pure Java EE based approach or mix and match the best tools based on open source frameworks. After Java EE 1.4 , we are seeing a plethora of technology choices like Spring (borderline as to when it exactly came out but feel that popularity shot up very much after 1.4), SCA which seems to overlap with Java EE and spring, and many many open source java frameworks. Maintaining these new frameworks over long term is going to be difficult. The developers do like the best tools for the best job and always seem to welcome more newer choices.
