Artificial Neural Networks based project for a beginner - a step by step guide

I have just gotten myself into Artificial Neural Networks and I have covered the Multi-Layer Perceptron, feed-forward and Back-propagation algorithm. Now that I want to see it working on a real project. I was thinking to implement them on very simple project so that I can get to understand these things better. I want to work on either of the following topic: Image classification - if I load an image, the system must tell me whether it's a cat or a dog. The challenge I have is I don't know where exactly to get myself started.I have read this example , it shaded light but the example was not in line with what I want to do. I am kindly asking for a step by step guide to work out this project. PS : If you suggest better beginner projects, thanks. Also, I would want to code my project in Java - most preferably, but any other language is fine.
