Metrics for cluster evaluation

I make a set of clusters using some clustering algorithm. Precision, Recall, F Measure, Fallout and RI of individual clusters are calculated for testing the performance. How do I calculate the average precision, recall, f measure, etc.? Is it the average of the different clusters' precisions? How do I get a single precision number for the N total clusters?
