The way you are doing it is correct. The only comment I have to add is to move the copy code down to Rule itself. public class FailedRule extends Rule{ /* *force a down cast from Rule to FailedRule through cloning */ public FailedRule (Rule upcast){ super(upcast); //init FailedRule fields to defaults } } public class Rule { publiic Rule(Rule ruleToCopy) { //or even use the fields themselves. this.setRuleCode( ruleToCopy.getRuleCode()); this.setType(ruleToCopy.getType()); ...
