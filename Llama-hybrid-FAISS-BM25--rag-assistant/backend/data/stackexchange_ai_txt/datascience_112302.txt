From my understanding of your question, you are looking to implement a learning-to-sort algorithm. There are current learning-to-sort machine learning solutions that do not require reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning requires a lot of training data and code complexity that might not be necessary to create a working solution. For example, " The Case for a Learned Sorting Algorithm " by Kristo et al. uses the statistical regularities in the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). If you choose to use reinforcement learning, there has been success with using the Q-learning algorithm for learning-to-sort . Q-learning is easier to implement and debug than Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
