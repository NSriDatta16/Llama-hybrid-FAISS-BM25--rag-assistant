How to organize search architecture on large amount of data about 10 million in .net

I have a table, which store about 10 million records(items), each record have itemtype(it's a reference key to table types). On my site i have a search functionality which based on fulltext search, it was ok, but a few days ago my customer want to show on the site not only all items but the itemtypes too. I try to do two parallel request to different servers(one to repl server and one to main): -- first request - group items by itemtypeid(with using fulltext search) and return list of itemtypeid --second request - search keywords in database(fulltext search) on the web server i aggregate results from these requests and push it to the web browser. Problem: first request run not so fast as i want :) (it's very slow) and after six(eight) month there will be more than 11 million items, so, first request will be slower and slower. Show me, please, the right way.
