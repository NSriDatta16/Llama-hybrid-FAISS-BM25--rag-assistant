Ideas to optimize this query: Make the index on Date_Printed a clustered index. However this may slow other queries and DML down. Explicitly list the columns needed if you don't need all the columns of the table. (And even if you do, it's better form to list the columns.) This will decrease the amount of traffic traveling back to the caller of the query. If you don' create the index on Date_Printed as a clustered index, and you are able to limit the columns needed then create a covering index for this query. A covering index is one where all the columns needed by the query are included in the index. An alternative on SQL Server 2008 is to use the include option to include columns in the index without indexing those columns. In other words index on just date_printed, but include the other columns being returned. Some of the above ideas may involve trade-offs of speed of other DML and increased storage space.
