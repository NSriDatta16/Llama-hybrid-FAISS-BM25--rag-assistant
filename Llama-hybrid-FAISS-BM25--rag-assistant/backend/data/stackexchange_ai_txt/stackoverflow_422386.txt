When your object is created, make it store a reference to itself in a global variable or some other sort of shareable storage location. Then export a function from your COM DLL that will read from that location so you can call it and get a reference to the previously created object. This shared reference should not increase the reference count of the object, or else it will never get destroyed. When your object gets destroyed, make sure you clear that shared reference. If you can have more than one instance of this object in the same process, then you may need to manage a list instead of just a single global variable.
