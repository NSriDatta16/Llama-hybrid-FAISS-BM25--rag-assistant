As far as relational database theory is concerned: The primary key of a table is used to uniquely identify each and every row in the table A NULL value in a column indicates that you don't konw what the value is Therefore, you should never use the value of "I don't know" to uniquely identify a row in a table. Depending upon the data you are modelling, a "made up" value can be used instead of NULL. I've used 0, "N/A", 'Jan 1, 1980', and similar values to represent dummy "known to be missing" data. Most, if not all, DB engines do allow for a UNIQUE constraint or index, which does allow for NULL column values, though (ideally) only one row may be assigned the value null (otherwise it wouldn't be a unique value). This can be used to support the irritatingly pragmatic (but occasionally necessary) situations that don't fit neatly into relational theory.
