Hrm, after reading the docs, I don't think you can. You can either bind to any port, then rebind if it is not acceptable, or repeatedly bind to a port in your range until you succeed. The second method is going to be most "efficient". I am uneasy about this answer, because it is... inelegant, yet I really can't find anything else either :/
