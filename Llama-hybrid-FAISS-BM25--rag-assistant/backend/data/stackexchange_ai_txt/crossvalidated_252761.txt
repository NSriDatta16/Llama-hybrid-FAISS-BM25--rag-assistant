In a logit model, what test does the p-value refer to in the Stata margins command when it reports the marginal standardized probability values?

I understand the output of the margins command gives the weighted average predicted probability at each value of a factor (averaged over the other confounders), but I am not clear what the p-value is referring to, that is, what is the null hypothesis being tested? If it reports 0.06 and 0.09 respectively for a two level factor with a significant p-value for both levels, what does that actually mean? How do these p-values relate to the p-values for the factor coefficients in the actual model? This paper describes what the method used by the margins: http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/3/962.full Specifically, the section that begins "To apply method 1 in practice after performing a logistic regression..." I don't have specific example output, but an example output of this command is on page 12 here: http://www.stata.com/manuals13/rmargins.pdf
