Max, can you clarify what you want to do? Your approach here sounds reasonable, but having the map recalculate the pin's location every time the mouse moves is a bit uneeded. What about something like this?: When the pin goes into drag mode, it's removed from the map and replaced with a draggable pin that only exists in screen space. So the user is dragging the "pin" around in screen-space, not map space. When the user ends the drag you convert the screen position to map position (a Location object), and then add it back to the map.
