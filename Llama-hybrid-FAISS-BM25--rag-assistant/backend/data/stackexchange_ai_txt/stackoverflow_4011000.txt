Nope. You're doing it right. You can get the name of your application at run time by asking the main bundle for its info dictionary and looking for kCFBundleNameKey therein. When you rename your application, change the bundle name in your Info.plist. (Definitely do not use your application's filename , as that's much more fragile.) Be aware that users might not like it if the plug-ins they installed stop working because you renamed your application. Note that your code above will not catch the PlugIns folder inside the application bundle. For that, ask your main bundle for its built-in plug-ins path or URL.
