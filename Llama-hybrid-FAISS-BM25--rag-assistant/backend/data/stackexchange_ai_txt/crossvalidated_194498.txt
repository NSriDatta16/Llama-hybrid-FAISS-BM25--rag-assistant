Estimation of multivariate time-varying cross-sectional data

I want to estimate the following model for each variable $y_{ti}$ : $$ y_{ti} =\alpha_t + \beta_t w_{ti} + \gamma_t u_{ti} + \delta_i x_{ti} + \phi_i z_{ti} + \varepsilon_{ti}, \quad \quad \text{for } i=1,...,k \quad t=1,...,T $$ I can't succeed in writing this in matrix form. Therefore, I have no idea how to estimate this model in MATLAB. My attempt at writing this model in matrix form is below, but obviously I could only include the variables of the first observed time series $y_{11},\dots,y_{T1}$ . How do I include the other variables so I can actually estimate this model? $$ \begin{bmatrix} y_{11} & y_{12} & y_{13} & \dots & y_{1k} \\ y_{21} & y_{22} & y_{23} & \dots & y_{2k} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ y_{T1} & y_{T2} & y_{T3} & \dots & y_{Tk} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & w_{11} & u_{11} & x_{11} & z_{11} \\ 1 & w_{21} & u_{21} & x_{21} & z_{21} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & w_{T1} & u_{T1} & x_{T1} & z_{T1} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_t & \alpha_t & \dots & \alpha_t \\ \beta_t & \beta_t & \dots & \beta_t \\ \gamma_t & \gamma_t & \dots & \gamma_t \\ \delta_1 & \delta_2 & \dots & \delta_k \\ \phi_1 & \phi_2 & \dots & \phi_k \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ Instead of using a multivariate regression, my first intuition was to fit a linear mixed-effects model (see Matlab docs at this link ). However, this does not cover multivariate applications. My current solution is to use a mixed-effects model with a vectorized observation matrix. I would then include a group variable that indicates which observations come from the same cross-section. Therefore, I would basically create $T$ different groups with $T$ different cross-sections. Is this the correct approach to my problem? Is there any other way to estimate above model?
