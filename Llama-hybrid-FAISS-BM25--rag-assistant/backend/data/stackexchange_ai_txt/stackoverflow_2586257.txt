I had not included common-collections jar in my library though there were no errors or exceptions being thrown anywhere in my application because of it. So I was at loss !! I have never seen Java being so dumb before this. Is this the right behavior of java or am I expecting too much from it ? I am also using spring in my application and Spring provides a good and simple way to handle Quartz and Java's TimerTask feature through beans. Few good and elegant tutorials are : http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/1.2.9/reference/scheduling.html http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200711/combining_spring_and_quartz.html Though the restriction in using the bean approach is, you have to hard code the cron values in the spring xml file, and so we will loose the flexibility.
