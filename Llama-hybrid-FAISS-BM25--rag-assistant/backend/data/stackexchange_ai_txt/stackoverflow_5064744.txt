Java characters have a width of 2 bytes per character (regardless of whether itd ASCII or a code point above 255). I think that what you seeing is the Java VM translating the internal class file storage (modified UTF8) version of the string into its internal expanded form as soon as the class is initialized (which is done prior to instance creation)
