R Package for Treatment Effect Analysis?

I could not find a package in R about Treatment Effect Analysis. So is there a R package about Treatment Effect Analysis? This means, estimating the average treatment effect, average treatment effect on the treated using different methods, including algorithms such as k-nearest-neighbour matching, caliper-matching and things like that? I found single packages about k-nearest neighbour matching and matching itself (e.g. matching of FNN ), but I could not find a comprehensive package about treatment effect analysis.
