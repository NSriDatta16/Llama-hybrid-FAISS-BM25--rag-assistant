Checking for outliers in a glmer (lme4 package) with 3 random factors

I have a question relating to the checking for outliers and / or influential points in my dataset using a glmer model with 3 random variables. I'm investigating the detection rate ( SumDetections ) of receivers over increasing distance ( sc.c.distance ), and the effect of environmental influences on this ( depth , temperature and wind ) and how this differs between different transmitters used, controlling for random effects of receiver ID , replicate and area . I found that the influence.ME might be of help, so I checked it out. In the manual I read that this package is only able to delete levels of 1 single grouping factor or 1 data point per time over the whole data set. Unless I read the package info incorrectly, this package cannot do what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a way to check for outliers nested within 4 grouping layers. How my data is organized is as follows: First my data discerns between Areas . Within areas, multiple replicates were done. Each replicate consisted of 5 distances at which the detection rate was tested. For each distance, 20 receivers were tested. My model looks like this: m My questions are: Is it possible to check for outliers of which the data is nested within 3 layers with use of influence.me? If so, how should I specify the command to get what I'm looking for, and how should I interpret the returned data by the Cook's distance or dfbetas? If not, is there another package that allows me to check for outliers?
