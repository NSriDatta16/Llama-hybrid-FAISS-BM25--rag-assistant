Measure how dataset is harmonious or organized

Suppose we have two set of numbers : A = [1,4,9,16,25,49...100] and B = [1,4,7,7,25,49,64...100]. As you seen the first one is consistently growing, elements of it is square of numbers. But although second one can be described as a square of numbers it doesn't strictly follow any rule and there is no fully suitable way to describe it. Is there a way or ways to measure how a dataset is "consistent" or has a pattern ?
