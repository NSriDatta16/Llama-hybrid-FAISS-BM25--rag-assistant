Are you sure you want to compile a bibtex database into something executable? If querying is the only thing you want, than it will make more sense to translate a bibtex database into a relational one, and query it with SQL. Of course you still have to parse bibtex first, and generate a SQL code out of it, and some will call it "compiling", but it is far less complicated than the stuff in the already mentioned Dragon Book. Bibtex syntax is extremely trivial, so you can choose any parsing approach. I would not even bother using parser generators for such a trivial grammar, and will jot a recursive descent parser instead. Depending on the language of your choice, it can be really easy (e.g., if you're using Haskell with Parsec, or even a C#). If your additional goal is to learn the outdated tools like bison and flex, then, of course, they'll do the job too, but it is an overkill. Edit : the best practical reading on the classic lex/yacc approach is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment
