Is there a statistical term for ratio of average for user to average of all users?

I am working on an email application. To determine if an email is important one of the features we are considering is a ratio of avg time to open an email from a particular contact to avg time to open an email from all the contacts . I was just curious to know if there a statistical term for this kind of ratio? Is it just a 'ratio of averages'?
