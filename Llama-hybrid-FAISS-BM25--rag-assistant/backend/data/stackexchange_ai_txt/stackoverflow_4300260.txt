Google App Engine (Java) local datastore elements resurrecting even after deleting local_db.bin and cleaning my project

** GAE/J, Eclipse, Local Datastore: ** I have changed my data model, including the structure of one of my entity classes. In an attempt to start over with my data, I followed the advice of JohnIdol in this SO answer: How to delete all datastore in Google App Engine? Somehow, even after deleting local_db.bin and cleaning, the old structure re-appears. In this screenshot, you can see one of the properties with its old name, "organizationAliasKeys," which should now be "orgAliasKeys:" http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6919071/Captures/2010-11-28_2035.png Where is the old ghost of my data coming from? How do I kill it all the way?
