AJAX.NET Reorderlist Control - "It does not a DataSource and does not implement IList."

I keep getting this error when trying to re-order items in my ReorderList control. "Reorder failed, see details below. Can't access data source. It does not a DataSource and does not implement IList." I'm setting the datasource to a DataTable right now, and am currently trying to use an ArrayList datasource instead, but am discouraged because of this post on the internet elsewhere. The control exists within an update panel, but no other events are subscribed to. Should there be something special with the OnItemReorder event? Just confused as to how it works. My question is, does anyone have any direct experience with this issue?
