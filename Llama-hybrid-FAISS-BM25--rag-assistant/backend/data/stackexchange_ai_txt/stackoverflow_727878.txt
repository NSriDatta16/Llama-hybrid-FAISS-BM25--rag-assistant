Dynamicly load dll in fitnesse fixture

I'm trying to write a FitNesse fixture against an interface (in c#). I want to be able to have the fixture dynamically load the implementation from a dll (so that I can use the same tests against different implementations of the same interface...i.e. mock data, live data, etc.). I have a init method in my fixture that takes 2 strings, a class name and a dll name. I call Assembly.LoadFrom(dllname) in the method. I get the following error with that call: "Invalid Directory on URL". Any ideas? It sounds like the dll name is getting mangled somehow in the translation... The table looks like this: |Init Provider From Dll|SlmLicenseDataErrorProvider|TestModelProvider.dll| Thanks in advance... -Robert
