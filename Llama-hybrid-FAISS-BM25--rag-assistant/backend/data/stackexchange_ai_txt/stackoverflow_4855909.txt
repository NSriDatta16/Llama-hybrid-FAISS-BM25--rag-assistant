Perl: including/embedding a module in a script

I have a script that uses a subclass that I've written of a module from CPAN for presentation. I would ideally like to have the two in the same file, as there isn't much code in the subclassed module. It doesn't make sense to expand either the subclassed module to include the script's code, or to turn the script into a module. How should I include the module code in the script?
