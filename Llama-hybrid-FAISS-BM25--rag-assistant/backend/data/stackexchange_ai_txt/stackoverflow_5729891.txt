redis performance, store json object as a string

I need to save a User model, something like: { "nickname": "alan", "email": ..., "password":..., ...} // and a couple of other fields Today, I use a Set: users In this Set, I have a member like user:alan In this member I have the hash above This is working fine but I was just wondering if instead of the above approach that could make sense to use the following one: Still use users Set (to easily get the users (members) list) In this set only use a key / value storage like: key: alan value : the stringify version of the above user hash Retrieving a record would then be easier (I will then have to Parse it with JSON). I'm very new to redis and I am not sure what could be the best. What do you think ?
