You really don't want to give anyone access to create their own views without a lot of abstraction. I don't think you're going to get the functionality you see with Views only or Organic Groups. You should take a look at how Core's poll module does this. It has similar functionality (allow users to select one or more choices from distinct lists). The short of it is that you're likely going to have to create your own module with its own CRUD. But, instead of Poll functionality, which allows a user to create his or her own choices, you could use the Views API to generate the list of choices and store the view ID with the user's selection.
