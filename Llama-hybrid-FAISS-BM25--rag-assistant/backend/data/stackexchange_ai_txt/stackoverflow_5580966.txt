I think you are already overdoing it. Regions, Cities and Countries as seperate tables is great, as you have the ability to easily manage the entries without creating data inconsistence. But storing address data for each user / organisation in a seperate (locations) table is unnecessary. Add those fields to the user / organisation tables. EDIT: RB illustrated it in much more detail :)
