Can I pass arguments (deferred binding properties) to the GWT compiler?

With the GWT compiler, is it possible set pass in properties as arguments to the GWT compiler? I know you can pass in certain defined parameters such as -war and -style, but this is for passing in property values, such as "user.agents" or "locale". From what I can see of the documentation, the properties can only be set using from within the module descriptor. But I want to be able to control these properties externally, from my build script. I've tried looking for documentation on what arguments are supported by com.google.gwt.dev.Compile, but there doesn't appear to be any reference documentation for that class. The docs are long on how-tos, and distressingy short on detail.
