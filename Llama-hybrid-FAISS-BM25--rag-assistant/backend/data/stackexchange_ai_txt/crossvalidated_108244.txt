Hours of sunlight and daily temperature are usually correlated to seasons. Not to mention that day of the week and hour are cyclic too. This kind of scenarios reminds me of Gaussian Processes, a general-purpose semi-parametric regression approach. So, you may be interested in this: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/ (Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning) and this http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_rasmussen_gp/ (Video lecture) Available software here http://www.gaussianprocess.org/#code and the book comes with some matlab packages too, afaik.
