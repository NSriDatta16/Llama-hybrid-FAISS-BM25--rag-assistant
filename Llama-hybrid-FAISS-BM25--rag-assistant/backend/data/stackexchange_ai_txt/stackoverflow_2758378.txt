Interface Builder error: IBXMLDecoder: The value for key is too large to fit into a 32 bit integer

I'm working with Robert Payne's fork of PSMTabBarControl that works with IB 3.2 (thanks BTW Robert!): http://codaset.com/robertjpayne/psmtabbarcontrol/ . The demo application works fine on 64-bit systems, but when I try to open the XIB file in Interface Builder on a 32-bit system I get: IBXMLDecoder: The value (4654500848) for key (myTrackingRectTag) is too large to fit into a 32 bit integer Building the app as 32 bit works, but then running it gives: PSMTabBarControlDemo[9073:80f] *** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver decodeInt32ForKey:]: value (4654500848) for key (myTrackingRectTag) too large to fit in 32-bit integer Not sure if this is a generic IB issue that can occur when moving between 64 and 32 bit systems, or if this is a more specific issue with this code. Has anyone else run into this?
