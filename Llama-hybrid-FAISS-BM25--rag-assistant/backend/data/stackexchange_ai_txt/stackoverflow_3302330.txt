I have some general advice on this because I have not yet implemented this myself. I am assuming you want to have Hudson run the RFT scripts automatically for you via a build or Hudson process? I want to implement something similar in my organisation as well. I have not yet been able to implement this because of organisational constraints but here is what I have thought out/done so far: Downloaded Windows process viewer, got the command for running the tests. Made shell Script out of it, separated out the variables etc The future plan is to setup a Windows Slave machine which would have all the tools in it that would be required once the Tests are kicked off, for eg. the correct versions of browsers, and environment variables, and other tools that are required. Hudson would kick off a process which runs the shell scripts created which runs all the RFT Scripts and performs necessary operations on the slave machine.
