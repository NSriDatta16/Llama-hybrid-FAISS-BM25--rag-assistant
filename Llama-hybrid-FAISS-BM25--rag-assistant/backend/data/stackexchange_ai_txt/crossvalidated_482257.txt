The interpretation of coefficents from logistic regression is due to the formulation, specifically: $$ ln(\frac{P}{1-P}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$ The log odds is on the left and the linear predictor with your coefficients is on the right. If we exponentiate both sides, we now have exp(linear predictor) related to the odds ratio, or a unit change in exp(linear predictor) gives a unit change in the odds ratio. $$ \frac{P}{1-P} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x} $$ In linear regression, the relationship is simply: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$ Exponentiation of the coefficents here does not give you a directly interpretable relationship to the response variable, Y. Edit to address comment The Poisson Regression formulation is $$ln(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$ Exponentiation of each side gives that the exponentiated coefficients are related to the change in y. Also remember that here, y is assumed to be count data following a Poisson distribution. The various formulations provide the interpretations. For OLS, there is no exponential in the formulation, so the coefficients don't need to be modified for interpretation. Also, if you exponentiate the coefficients from an OLS model, there is not direct relationship to the endpoint any longer.
