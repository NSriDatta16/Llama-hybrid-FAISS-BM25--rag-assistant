Deploying a machine learning algorithm, should I include the validation set?

We have developed, trained, and tuned a random forest algorithm for a certain task. We followed the classic split of training/test/validation and we are satisfied with the performance of the algorithm at the moment. My question is, for production/deployment, should we fit the algorithm on all the data (including the validation set)? We have sufficient self-control that no one will touch that fitted object for any thing other than the production deployment. Please provide pros and cons for your answers (with references if possible).
