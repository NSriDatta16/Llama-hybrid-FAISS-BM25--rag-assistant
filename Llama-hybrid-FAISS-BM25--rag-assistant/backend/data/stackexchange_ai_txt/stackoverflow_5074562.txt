How do the count the number of sentences, words and characters in a file?

I have written the following code to tokenize the input paragraph that comes from the file samp.txt. Can anybody help me out to find and print the number of sentences, words and characters in the file? I have used NLTK in python for this. >>>import nltk.data >>>import nltk.tokenize >>>f=open('samp.txt') >>>raw=f.read() >>>tokenized_sentences=nltk.sent_tokenize(raw) >>>for each_sentence in tokenized_sentences: ... words=nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(each_sentence) ... print each_sentence #prints tokenized sentences from samp.txt >>>tokenized_words=nltk.word_tokenize(raw) >>>for each_word in tokenized_words: ... words=nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(each_word) ... print each_words #prints tokenized words from samp.txt
