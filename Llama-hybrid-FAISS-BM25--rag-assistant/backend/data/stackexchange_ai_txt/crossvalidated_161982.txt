Training set size for neural networks considering curse of dimensionality

I'm learning the ropes of neural networks. Recently, I read stuff about the curse of dimensionality and how it might lead to overfitting (e.g. here ). If I understand correctly, the number of features (dimensions) d of a given dataset with n data points is very important when considering the size t of the training set. QUESTIONS (...not sure if all my questions are really connected to the curse of dimensionality) How do I choose the correct training size t considering d and n ? Is t a function of d and n ? Do I have to consider d for regularization?
