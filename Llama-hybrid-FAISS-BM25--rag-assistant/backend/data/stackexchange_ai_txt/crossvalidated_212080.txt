Yet another unsupervised SVM

In a typical supervised learning problem, one observe $(X,Y)$ where $Y$ is a categorical variable. We confront the such a problem that $Y$ is hidden and instead $(X,Z)$ is observed where both covariates lie in $R^p$. The goal is to find the hyperplanes $w_X,w_Z$ such that $Y=1$ if and only if $(w_X,X) 0\wedge (w_Z,Z)>0$. The objective is to learn $w_X,w_Z$. Any idea on such problem? How to adapt SVM to it?
