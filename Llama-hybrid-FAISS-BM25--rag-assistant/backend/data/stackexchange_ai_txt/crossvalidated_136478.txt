Many dedicated optimization methods exist for hyperparameter tuning. Sequential model based optimization (a Bayesian inspired method) is a particularly popular research topic, for instance here . Metaheuristic approaches like genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing are also common, see for instance here . If you want to model the effect of hyperparameters, random search is a good sampling strategy to start from. You can find implementations of such optimization methods in tuning libraries like Optunity , HyperOpt and Spearmint .
