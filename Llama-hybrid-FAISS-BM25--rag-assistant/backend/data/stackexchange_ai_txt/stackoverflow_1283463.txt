cellForRowAtIndexPath called when table cell is clicked on to edit

When a table is created, cellForRowAtIndexPath is called to populate the cells. Previously when a cell was clicked on to edit, cellForRowAtIndexPath wasn't called, and the cell could have text typed into it using: #pragma mark Text Field Delegate Methods - (void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { self.textFieldBeingEdited = textField; } Now when I click on cells that are below the cell with row = 4, which is where the top of the keyboard is, cellForRowAtIndexPath is called with a row greater than the total number of rows causing a crash. When I click on cells 0 to 4, I can edit the cells and cellForRowAtIndexPath isn't called. cellForRowAtIndexPath wasn't called previously for clicking on any of the cells. I changed something that is causing this, but can't figure out what it is. Does anyone know what can cause cellForRowAtIndexPath to be called when clicking on a cell to edit it? It almost appears like it thinks a new table is being created.
