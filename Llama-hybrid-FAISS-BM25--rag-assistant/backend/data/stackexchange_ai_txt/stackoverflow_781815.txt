Error 400 (Bad Request) with WCF Tutorial?

I began using WCF last night to setup a simple client server that will allow me to send game information to the client at the beginning of a session. I followed the microsoft tutorial on WCF and used the VS2008 "WcfSerivce" template to begin and added my methods. I then copied and pasted the address it gives me into the service reference dialog in my client project and added the code to get data from the server. However the problem is now, no matter what it always returns error 400 when I request data. I googled this error and found many people had a problem with a certain message size limit was exceeded, but I get this error even when the method only returns a single character. The only thing I can think of is that the URI or namespace address is wrong, what value should they be instead? Thanks EDIT: Here is the code I am using in the service and client, I'm not sure what the rule on post huge amounts of text so I put it on Pastebin, but if its allowed here I will edit again http://pastebin.ca/1401443
