You can download the source code for SNMP4JAgent here: http://www.snmp4j.org/html/download.html The source code includes a sample agent -- look in the org.snmp4j.agent.example package for all of the related classes. http://www.snmp4j.org/agent/doc/org/snmp4j/agent/example/SampleAgent.html One way of getting started would be to create an agent using the example code and then modify it to suit your needs. The JavaDoc describing each of the classes is a bit terse, but it's complete.
