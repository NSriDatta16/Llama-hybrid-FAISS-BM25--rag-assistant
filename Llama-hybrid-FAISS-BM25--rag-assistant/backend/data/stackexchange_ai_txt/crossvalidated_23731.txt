C is the slack parameter for SVM, regardless of kernel chosen, it has nothing to do with the kernel. It determines the tradeoff between a wide margin and classifier error. Large C means you are allowing little slack and the model will fit tighter to your data, small C means you are allowing a lot of slack and the model will have more error on the training set, but be less sensitive to noise. Linear Kernel: No parameters Polynomial: (gamma*u'*v + coef0)^degree (using libsvm's nomenclature) Degree is the main parameter here, but you can also vary gamma & coef0 to make the kernel non-symmetric. If you are just starting out, I recommend you stick to varying degree. RBF: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2) Gamma is the main parameter.
