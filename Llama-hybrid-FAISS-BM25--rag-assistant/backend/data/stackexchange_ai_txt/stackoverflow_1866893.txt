NHibernate persist System.Uri

I have a domain object that has a couple of Uri properties that need to be persisted to a Urls table that has several parts of the Uri from which the properties will need to be reassembled after retrieval. I can store the properties well enough, but how do I tell NHibernate how to recreate the Uri property? You can't set most of the Uri object's properties directly. Rather, the url must be assembled and passed to a Uri constructor.
