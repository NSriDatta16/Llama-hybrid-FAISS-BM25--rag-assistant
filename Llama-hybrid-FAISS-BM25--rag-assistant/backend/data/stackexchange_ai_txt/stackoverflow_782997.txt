Google's BigTable and other similar projects (ex: CouchDB , HBase ) are database systems that are oriented so that data is mostly denormalized (ie, duplicated and grouped). The main advantages are: - Join operations are less costly because of the denormalization - Replication/distribution of data is less costly because of data independence (ie, if you want to distribute data across two nodes, you probably won't have the problem of having an entity in one node and other related entity in another node because similar data is grouped) This kind of systems are indicated for applications that need to achieve optimal scale (ie, you add more nodes to the system and performance increases proportionally). In an RDBMS like MySQL or Oracle, when you start adding more nodes if you join two tables that are not in the same node, the join cost is higher. This becomes important when you are dealing with high volumes. RDBMS' are nice because of the richness of the storage model (tables, joins, fks). Distributed databases are nice because of the ease of scale.
