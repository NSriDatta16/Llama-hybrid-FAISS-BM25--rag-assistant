C#: parametrized string with spaces only between "full" parameters?

I want to output a string that welcomes a user to the application. I have the user's first, middle and last name. I would like to write the user's full name, i.e. "Hello {0} {1} {2}" with first, middle and last being the parameters. However, If the middle name is empty, I don't want two spaces between the first and the last name, but rather only one space. I can obviously do it with an "if", but is there a more elegant way to achieve this? Thanks
