Using Ridge Regression to estimate importance of multicollinear variables in python

New to statistical analysis so bear with me. I have a dataset with 1 (say y) dependent variable and 5 independent variables (say x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) which are highly correlated. I know that y depends (linearly) on x5, but want to answer how much it also depends on x1 through x4 (which in theory should have increasing linear dependence). I have done a PCA in python using sklearn and the method PCA().explained_variance_ratio_ gives me some indication as to the relative importance of each independent variable (as far as I understand). How do I do a similar analysis with ridge regression in sklearn? The resources I find online return only the best fit parameters, predict and/or find the coefficient of determination. Also any advice on this problem is much appreciated. Many thanks
