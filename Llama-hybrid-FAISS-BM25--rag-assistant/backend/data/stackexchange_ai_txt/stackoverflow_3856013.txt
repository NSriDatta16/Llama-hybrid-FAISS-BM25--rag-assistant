Get recall (sensitivity) and precision (PPV) values of a multi-class problem in PyML

I am using PyML for SVM classification. However, I noticed that when I evaluate a multi-class classifier using LOO, the results object does not report the sensitivity and PPV values. Instead they are 0.0: from PyML import * from PyML.classifiers import multi mc = multi.OneAgainstRest(SVM()) data = VectorDataSet('iris.data', labelsColumn=-1) result = mc.loo(data) result.getSuccessRate() >>> 0.95333333333333337 result.getPPV() >>> 0.0 result.getSensitivity() >>> 0.0 I have looked at the code but couldn't figure out what is going wrong here. Has somebody a workaround for this?
