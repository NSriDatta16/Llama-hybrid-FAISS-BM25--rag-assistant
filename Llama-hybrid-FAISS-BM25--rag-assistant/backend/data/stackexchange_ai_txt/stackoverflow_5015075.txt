What network simulation model should I use for simulating the behavior of an ad-hoc network in OMNET++

I'm working as a student-intern in a govt organization to complete my major-project at college. My task is to simulate a dynamic-routing protocol for ad-hoc networks. As I've good programming experience in C++ thus I've chosen OMNET++ network simulator. It was easy to adapt to the working environment and I could play around with the samples provide in OMNET IDE. Problem Statement: Now, I need to start working on my task i.e. [ http://www.mediafire.com/?s5ajo8gavhcf6sr ] pls have a look at the paper. Could someone please give me a few general instructions on building an adhoc network model in omnet and then apply a routing protocol to it. I would really appreciate if you could just read the abstract of that paper and provide me deeper insights if possible.
