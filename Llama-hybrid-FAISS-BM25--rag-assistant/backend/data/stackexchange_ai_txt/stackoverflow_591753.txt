Among other things, You can't map complex types at all. ( Update Fixed in EF v4.) You must map every column of a table in the storage schema. Generalizing (2), you don't get a lot of control over the storage schema at all. What you mostly see is the client schema and the mapping to the storage schema. If you delete a type from the diagram, it's difficult to put it back. I wrote some thoughts about the difference in philosophical approaches between the Entity Framework itself and the designer in this post . I think that if you intend to do non-trivial/non-default things in the Entity Framework, you should get used to editing the EDMX. Most other ORMs do require editing XML at some point, for what it's worth.
