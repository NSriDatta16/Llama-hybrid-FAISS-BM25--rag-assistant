I don't know if there are any free Cloud providers - but EC2 isn't going to hurt you. I work with it daily in the office, billed to a corporate card, and I use it for personal projects billed to my own card. Signup to EC2 is free, and if you already have an Amazon account as a purchaser then it's just a couple of clicks. Spinning-up a Micro or Small instance for a few hours to play with it will set you back a few pence. Leave it running and you'll venture into pounds territory - but we're talking £10 or £20 for a months' usage. Fire a Medium or Large (or larger) up, and you'll accrue charges at a higher rate, obviously. Terminate any instances and zap any storage you might have created, and the billing drops to zero. EC2 pricing is here .
