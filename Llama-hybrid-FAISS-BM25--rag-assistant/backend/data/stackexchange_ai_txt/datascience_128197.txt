Intuition behind this bayesian probability?

Original Question - Prevalence of a disease X is 0.1%. You take a test for this disease and it turns out positive. This test is 99% accurate. What is the probability of you having the disease given that the test is positive? Answer - Using the Bayesian model, the posterior probability that we have the disease given that the test is positive is only 9%. This makes sense to me. However, if we change the accuracy of the test to 100%, the posterior probability that one has the disease given that the test is positive comes to a 100%. (Keeping the prevalence of the disease same) Is there a way to intuitively understand how a 1 point increase in Test accuracy, results in the increase of posterior probability from 9% to 100%!
