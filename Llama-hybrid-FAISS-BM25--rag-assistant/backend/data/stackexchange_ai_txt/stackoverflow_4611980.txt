echo "Number of words -total " $countWords+$countWords_ You want this: echo "Number of words -total $((countWords + countWords_))" Edit Here are some optimizations to your script. The while loop seems pointless since count is going to get set for sure inside making this a 1-iteration while loop. Your if check on existence of the file should happen before you ever use that file. You don't need to hardcode the name of your script to the variable itself , you can use $0 for that Since you are using bash I took the liberty to remove the need for cut by using process substitution. Here is the revised script: #!/bin/bash echo -e "request :: please enter file name " echo -e "\n\tfile one : \c" read count if [ ! -e "$count" ] ; then echo "error :: file one $count doesn't exist. can't proceed." exit 1 fi itself="$0" read countWords _
