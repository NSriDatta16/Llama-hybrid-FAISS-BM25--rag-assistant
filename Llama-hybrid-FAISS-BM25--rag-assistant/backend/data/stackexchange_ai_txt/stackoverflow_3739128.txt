Wait, so if you check out trunk you will also get all your developers branches in the same folder? Is that right? Even if you only want the trunk, you have to grab all the branches at the same time? (a bit ill at the moment, hopefully I'm understanding properly) That's horrible! On any decent sized project the checkout procedure suddenly got massively bloated in terms of bandwidth, storage and time. That kills any benefits partial checkout (ie only checking out 1 folder and it's contents) of the repository has! I heard of a games company that used SVN rather than GIT simply because their full repository was many GB in size and they needed partial checkouts so the staff could deal with it. EDIT TO ADD: Also, all tools you get for SVN will expect things to be in the layout you prefer. Sure, you may be able to configure them for your co-workers layout but why go thru that hassle? Also, surely this means that if you want to create a new branch you can't do svn cp .../trunk/ .../branches/mine without doing svn rm .../branches/mine/branches/ afterwards, a bit clumsy no?
