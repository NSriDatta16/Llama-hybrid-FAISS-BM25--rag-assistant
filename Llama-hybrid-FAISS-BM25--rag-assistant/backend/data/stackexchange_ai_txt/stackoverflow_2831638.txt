A client certificate is typically only meaningful in the context a service who trusts it. For example when a windows computer joins a domain, that client workstation generates a key pair (internally), and the domain controller signs it, and that signed pair (now becomes a cert, though not an X509 cert) and is used internally by windows. The cert is only meaningful to the domain controller. Normally large organizations who run their own CA issue client certs to people who wan to use SSL auth to access secure sites. The reason that client certificates are probably rare on the internet at large, is the revocation problem. For Thawte to issue you (personally) a client cert would mean that they would have to be responsible for managing revocation for it. In order for it to be cost effective, there would be a large number of certs out there; and they would constantly be being revoked, since individuals constantly individual security lapses.
