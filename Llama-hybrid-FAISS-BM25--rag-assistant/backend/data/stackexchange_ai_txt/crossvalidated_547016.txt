categories for chi-square test of independence - what if categories are determined by TWO variables?

My categories are the combination of two variables. For example if I have two age bands and two sexes, the categories are old women, young women, old men, and young men So on the one hand there are four categories and I'm looking at how people selected plan A or plan B across those categories. So I can mechanically perform the chi-sq test. But is it valid in a theoretical sense? Is there any theoretical reason why I shouldn't use the test because of how the categories are actually formed by smooshing two variables together (technical term). Is there some other test I should use instead? Edited following initial answer: Great! I'm also doing logistic regression with a number of additional IVs. Am I correct in expecting broad agreement betw chi-square test results and logistic regression results?
