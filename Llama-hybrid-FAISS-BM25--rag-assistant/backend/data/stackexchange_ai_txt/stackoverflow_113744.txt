Well, assuming you don't have any prior experience... You need some kind of persistence storage (for example a database) and a client. For the storage you could use almost anything. For example you could create your DB in MS Access and just ship it as a file, using ADO to access it. Other options are MS SQL Express edition (comes pre-installed on some machines or could be installed for free) and plenty of open source databases like SQLite For the client side you could not go wrong with VBScript and ADO (using OLE DB drivers). They come with every Windows installation since Dark Ages, you will have plenty of references/tutorials/answers online. A drawback: no UI to speak of, so you'll have to build a command line interface (which was for a 'simple' application). If you want to build a UI I would suggest using .NET WinForms. The overhead will be substantially bigger but .NET is now installed on all XP/Vista machines and even if it is not you could always install the framework with you application.
