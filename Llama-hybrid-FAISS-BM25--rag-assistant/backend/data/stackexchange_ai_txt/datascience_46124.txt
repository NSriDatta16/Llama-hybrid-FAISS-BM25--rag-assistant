What do "compile", "fit", and "predict" do in Keras sequential models?

I am a little confused between these two parts of Keras sequential models functions. May someone explains what is exactly the job of each one? I mean compile doing forward pass and calculating cost function then pass it through fit to do backward pass and calculating derivatives and updating weights ? Or what? I have seen in some codes, they only used compile function for some of their LSTM s and fit for some other ones! So I need to know each of these functions do what part of the work(training a neural network). It's also interesting for me to know what exactly do predict function as well. Very thank you in advanced!
