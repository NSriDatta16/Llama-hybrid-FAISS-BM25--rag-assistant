If I understand your question, I don't think you need Bayesian stats here. If $u \sim$ Normal($\mu_u, \sigma^2_u$) and $v \sim$ Normal($\mu_v, \sigma^2_v$) are independent random variables, then $w = u - v \sim$ Normal($\mu_u - \mu_v, \sigma^2_u + \sigma^2_v)$. If you are given that $w \ge 0$ (i.e. $u-v \ge 0 $), what you have is a truncated Normal $(\mu_u - \mu_v, \sigma^2_u + \sigma^2_v)$ from 0 to infinity (using the notation given in the Wiki article $a = 0$ and $b=\infty$).
