That's an interesting proposition ... What would you hope to gain from adding a cyclic component? Various quick answers of my own to this question have lead to existing methods like boosting (ex: xgboost) and ensembling (ex: random forest) which help address bias, variance, smoothing, etc. Maybe you could use a cyclical component to create a reinforcement-esque framework?
