I came across similar situation and I've asked a few questions previously in regards to the similar problem that may help you. The system I did was a configuration driven, rule based dynamic system. All configurations and rules were saved in database. Decision tables were constructed dynamically based on the values and rules retrived from database. Values were then converted and compared in C#. Here's the question I asked about dynamic decision table in C# . And the question regarding dyanmically convert and compare values retrived from databse. So I end up having something simliar to this in terms of the config table (just an example): Conditions IsDecision LHS Operator RHS TTFF False PostCode > 100 TFTF False PostCode The above table in plain English: Condition 1 PostCode > 100 Yes Yes No No Condition 2 PostCode The core parts of the implementation are how to dynamically construct decision table and how to dynamic convert and compare string values, all of which I have provided links to the specific implementations in the above paragraph. I believe you can apply similar concepts in your situations and I hope I've explained the concept in general. Other Resources: Martin Fowler's decision tree article . Luke's post on decision tree .
