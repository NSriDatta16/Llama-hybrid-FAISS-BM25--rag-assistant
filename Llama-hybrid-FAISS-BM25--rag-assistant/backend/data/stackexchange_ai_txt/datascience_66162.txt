How to choose most appropriate Machine Learning model?

I need some help from anyone who are familiar with machine learning area. ID | Mach_1 | Mach_2 | Mach_3 | Mach_4 | Mach_5 | Rejected Unit (%) 127189.11 1 0 1 1 1 0.23 178390.11 0 0 0 1 0 0.10 902817.11 1 0 1 0 1 0.60 Above is the example of my data, for each ID there are several mach that are available and if that particular mach is used for that ID , the value will be 1 and if the mach is not used it is 0. And the rejected unit is the percentage value of rejected unit for that ID. What I want to know is which mach is the most affected to the rejected unit. And what is the percentage for each mach that is affected to rejected unit. Can anyone help me to advise on what machine learning algorithm/model that I can use to analyse this case study ? EDIT: I have done the linear regression and below is my code, however the output has show two warnings as shown in the screenshot below. import statsmodels.api as sm #create model mod = sm.OLS(y_train,X_train) res = mod.fit() print(res.summary())
