AFAIK, there is not much you can do about this. As long as the links do not contain line breaks in the original mails sent by your server, it is up to the receivers mail client to add line breaks for readability, usually based on some user preference settings (Which could explain the difference to your own Entourage client). Also, some clients try to detect links and avoid breaking them, others don't, and some even have plugins for this. A possible workaround would be sending HTML mails instead, but that opens a huge different can of worms concerning mail client compatibility, so I do not recommend it.
