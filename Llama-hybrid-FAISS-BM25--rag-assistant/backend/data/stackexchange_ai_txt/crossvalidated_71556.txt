Predictive accuracy and AUC are quite limited in certain aspects. Try the Bayesian Information Reward (BIR), which addresses all your bullet points. The intuition of BIR is as follows: a bettor is rewarded not just for identifying the ultimate winners and losers (0's and 1's), but more importantly for identifying the appropriate odds. Furthermore, it goes a step ahead and compares all predictions with the prior probabilities. Let's say you have a list of 10 Arsenal games with possible outcomes: Win or Lose . The formula for binary classification rewarding per game is: where, p is your model's prediction for a particular football game, and p' is the prior probability of Arsenal winning the game. As you can see, you treat the correct and incorrect classifications differently. For instance, if I know beforehand that p'=0.6 , and my predictor model produced p =0.6 , it is rewarded 0 since it is not conveying any new information. BIR is not limited to binary classifications but is generalised for multinomial classification problems as well.
