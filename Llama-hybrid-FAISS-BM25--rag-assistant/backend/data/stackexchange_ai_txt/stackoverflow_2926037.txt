Creating a "mountable" File System, where to start?

A friend and I are thinking about creating a simple file system for learning purposes. We're going to write it in C/C++, and try to get it to a mountable state from within linux. We've both been coding or over 16 years (32 combined), so I suppose its just a matter of finding some documentation, and a ton of learning. My question is, where could I find out more information? (Documentation for creating a file system, requirements of mounting a file system in linux, etc) Where do we start? Edit: I should also mention, this would not be a boot-able file system, just a file system used for storage, though I am not too sure if that matters or not.
