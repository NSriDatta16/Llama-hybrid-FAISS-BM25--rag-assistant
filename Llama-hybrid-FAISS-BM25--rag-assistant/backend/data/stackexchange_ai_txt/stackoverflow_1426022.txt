Not sure about C# specialties, but I'd guess that the regular expression is plain wrong. The square brackets are used in a wrong way. They can only define character classes and cannot be used for capturing of subpatterns. All this assuming C# uses regular perl-style regexps. The correct regular expression for this would be (attention, not escaped): \[(global::)?System\.CodeDom\.Compiler\.GeneratedCodeAttribute\("([^"]+)", "([^"]+)"\)\] My advice: go to http://regexpal.com/ to test your regular expressions first, then implement them in your code. Saves a lot of trouble.
