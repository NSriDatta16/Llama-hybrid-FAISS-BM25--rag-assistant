Neither of the strategies above is particularly suitable for multiple optima. A better choice are Differential Evolution MCMC and derived MCMCs such as DREAM. These algorithms work with several MCMC chains that are mixed to generate proposals. If you have at least one chain in each optima, they will be able to jump efficiently between optima. An implementation in R is available here https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/index.html
