With Gingerbread now you have the possibility to create an app just with the NDK using NativeActivity. This release of the NDK includes many new APIs, most of which are introduced to support the development of games and similar applications that make extensive use of native code. Using the APIs, developers have direct native access to events, audio, graphics and window management, assets, and storage. Developers can also implement the Android application lifecycle in native code with help from the new NativeActivity class. For detailed information describing the changes in this release, read the CHANGES.HTML document included in the downloaded NDK package. If you are willing to use web technologies I would recommend you this book: Programming the Mobile .
