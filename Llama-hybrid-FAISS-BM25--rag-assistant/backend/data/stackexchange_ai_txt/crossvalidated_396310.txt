Correct algorithm for string classification

I have a long list of DNA strings (of equal length) made of 4 letters (A,T,G,C). I want to do a binary classification on the strings. I have two basic quetsions: I have a lot of duplicate strings in my dataset. Should I keep them while training? Usually, what is the correct machine learning / deep learning approach to problems like these? The dataset looks like the following: String ----------------------------------------------- Class ATTGCCCGCGCGCCG--------------------------- 1 AGGCGCGCAGCAGCA---------------------------2 GCGCGCAGCAGGACA---------------------------1 I have tried to divide each string into overlapping subsets of length 3,4,5 and then use TFIDF or countvectorizer to find their vector representation.Finally, I have used a classifier to train on these vectors and reported the results. But the accuracy won't go above 63%.
