In the paragraph before the one you quote, they say "Let there be positive constants $M_1$ and $M_2$ ....". I think that implies they are assuming $X_{ij}$ is bounded, but are not assuming $X_{(1)}$ is subgaussian with constant parameter $M_1$ . That is, the boundedness assumption implies $X_{(1)}$ is subgaussian, but with a parameter that will in general grow with $q$ . The $\log q$ and $\sqrt{\log q}$ terms in the bounds come from applying Bernstein's inequality and I think would not be there with a fixed bound on the subgaussian parameter. There's a comment in the proof of Lemma 1, in the paragraph after equation (36) to that effect: (all formulas involving $\varphi_1$ or $\varphi_2$ parameter of $X_k^{(1)}$ replace “ $B$ ” by “ $\sqrt{M_1}$ ” under Condition 3′ hereafter).
