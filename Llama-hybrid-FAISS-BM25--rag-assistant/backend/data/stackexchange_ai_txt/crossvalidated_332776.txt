If I understand correctly, the question is about the E step, in which one has to find the variational distribution Q with minimal KL divergence to the log likelihood. The global minimum of KL divergence is obtained when the two distributions are the same. This is accomplished by setting Q to be the log likelihood itself. However, If the log likelihood is too complicated to be dealt with analytically, one can use approximations. One of the best known approximations is the mean field, when one constrains Q to the family of factorized distributions over the parameters. In any case, it is always possible to use a numerical procedure in either step of the EM algorithm. But if optimization is too involved, it might become computationally unfeasible. In this situation, you would have to use other algorithms such as MCMC methods.
