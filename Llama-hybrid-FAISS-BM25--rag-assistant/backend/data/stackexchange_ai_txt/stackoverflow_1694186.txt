To be honest I can't see anything wrong with the code you've posted. Perhaps an explanation of exactly what causes the error you are seeing might give you some clues you can use. The registration of the Dependancy property is what is important here:- public static readonly DependencyProperty ActiveRatioProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("ActiveRatio", typeof(Double), typeof(ActionButton), new PropertyMetadata(1.0)); This creates and registers an instance of a dependency property against the combination of the string "ActiveRatio" and the Type ActionButton . When Silverlight comes to put the following Xaml into action:- it combines the type specified in the TargetType attribute of the style with the string in the setters Property attribute to find the dependancy property instance. * It can then use the type indicated by the dependency property to convert the string in the setters Value attribute. Finally it can call SetValue on the FrameworkElement on which the style is set passing the DependencyProperty found and the converted value. Now return the * in the previous paragraph. Its at this point that the code has failed. It is failing to find a dependency property registration for the string "ActiveRatio" and the type ActionButton . I can't tell you why its failing, your code clearly registers this name and the type in the style matches the type passed in the registration. I've even written small repro of your code and it works fine. All I can suggest is that you try a complete Rebuild and then run the code. Assuming what you have posted is fairly complete the only other suggestion I have is such a "clutching at straws" exercise I'm not even going to explain my reason. Try adding this to you ActionButton class:- public static ActionButton() { }
