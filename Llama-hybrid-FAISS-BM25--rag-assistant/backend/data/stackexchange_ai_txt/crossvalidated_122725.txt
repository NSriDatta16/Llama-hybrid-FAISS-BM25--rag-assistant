If the bus arrives "every 15 minutes" (i.e. on a schedule) then the (randomly arriving) passenger's average wait is indeed only 7.5 minutes, because it will be uniformly distributed in that 15 minute gap. -- If, on the other hand, the bus arrives randomly at the average rate of 4 per hour (i.e. according to a Poisson process), then the average wait is much longer; indeed you can work it out via the lack of memory property. Take the passenger's arrival as the start, and the time to the next event is exponential with mean 15 minutes. Let me take a discrete time analogy. Imagine I am rolling a die with 15 faces, one of which is labelled "B" (for bus) and 14 labelled "X" for the total absence of bus that minute (fair 30 sided dice exist, so I could label 2 of the faces of a 30-sided die "B"). So once per minute I roll and see if the bus comes. The die has no memory; it doesn't know how many rolls since the last "B" it has been. Now imagine some unconnected event happens - a dog barks, a passenger arrives, I hear a rumble of thunder. From now, how long do I wait (how many rolls) until the next "B"? Because of the lack of memory, on average, I wait the same time for the next "B" as the time between two consecutive "B"s. [Next imagine I have a 60-sided die I roll every fifteen seconds (again, with one "B" face); now imagine I had a 1000-sided die I rolled every 0.9 seconds (with one "B" face; or more realistically, three 10-sided dice each and I call the result a "B" if all 3 come up "10" at the same time)... and so on. In the limit, we get the continuous time Poisson process.] Another way to look at it is this: I am more likely to observe my 'start counting rolls' (i.e. 'the passenger arrives at the bus stop') event during a longer gap than a short one, in just the right way to make the average wait the same as the average time between buses (I mostly wait in long gaps and mostly miss out on the shortest ones; because I arrive at a uniformly distributed time, the chance of me arriving in a gap of length $t$ is proportional to $t$) As a veteran catcher of buses, in practice reality seems to lie somewhere in between 'buses arrive on a schedule' and 'buses arrive at random'. And sometimes (in bad traffic), you wait an hour then 3 arrive all at once (Zach identifies the reason for that in comments below).
