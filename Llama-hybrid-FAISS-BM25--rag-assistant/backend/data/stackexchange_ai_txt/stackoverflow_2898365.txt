Your best bet by far is to leverage the work of someone who's already done this for you, via a validation library and/or input masking library. Don't reinvent the wheel, several nice round ones, with rims to suit just about any car, have already been invented for you. Not linking a specific one here because that's not really the point, a search on "javascript form validation library" will find quite a few. Edit I hadn't looked for a while, I have to say I like the look of this one . Both validation and masking, and not library-specific (though there's a jQuery plug-in available if you like). Again, linking them isn't really the point, but it looked cool enough to shout out.
