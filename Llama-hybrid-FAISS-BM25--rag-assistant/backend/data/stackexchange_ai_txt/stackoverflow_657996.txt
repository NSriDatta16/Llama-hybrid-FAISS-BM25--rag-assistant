I'd say that it depends on what you are looking for. If you're looking for a relatively inexperiences (and therefore presumably cheap) programmer that you can mold to fit your organization, he might be OK. You've just found out that he has no idea how C does things, and that you'll have to explain a whole lot of C concepts to him when they come up. At this point the important thing is to figure out if he's just uneducated (he's never come across the need before) or if he's he kind of guy who never learns ANYTHING he doesn't immediately need, or if he's an idiot. If #1, then you can consider hiring him, if he knows enough to be useful. If #2 then I'd take a pass, but perhaps you can make use of a 9-5er. If #3, show him the door. And I wouldn't take not knowing about C stuff TOO seriously, I've met people who've programmed in C for 15 years who didn't know about __FILE__ and __LINE__ . And they were good, they just never came across it before I showed it to them. This guy could be the same way â€“ he's only ever seen the STL way of doing things, so he doesn't know anything else.
