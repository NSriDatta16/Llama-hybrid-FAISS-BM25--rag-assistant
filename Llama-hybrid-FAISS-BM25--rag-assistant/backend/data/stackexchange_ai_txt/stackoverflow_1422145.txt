How should I organize test cases in my project?

I have a project that looks like this: xdc/ hubactions/ hubconnection.cpp hubconnection.h uiinterface/ readme uiconnection.cpp uiconnection.h ... uiactions/ readme connectaction.cpp connectaction.h quitaction.cpp quitaction.h ... utils/ parser.cpp parser.h ... Now I want to start testing before the project becomes too big. So how should I got about organising my tests? I have come up with two options: Option 1 xdc/ hubactions/ hubconnection.cpp hubconnection.h uiinterface/ readme uiconnection.cpp uiconnection.h ... uiactions/ readme connectaction.cpp connectaction.h quitaction.cpp quitaction.h ... utils/ parser.cpp parser.h ... tests/ utils/ parsertest.cpp uiinterface/ uiconnectiontest.cpp uiactions/ connectactiontest.cpp quitactiontest.cpp hubactions/ fakehubconnection.cpp fakehubconnection.h ... Option 2 xdc/ hubactions/ tests/ fakehubconnection.cpp fakehubconnection.h hubconnection.cpp hubconnection.h uiinterface/ tests/ uiconnectiontest.cpp readme uiconnection.cpp uiconnection.h ... uiactions/ tests/ connectactiontest.cpp quitactiontest.cpp readme connectaction.cpp connectaction.h quitaction.cpp quitaction.h ... utils/ tests/ parsertest.cpp parser.cpp parser.h ... Which method is better? Can I do it in a different/better way? Thanks!
