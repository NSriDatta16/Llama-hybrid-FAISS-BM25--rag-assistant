When most people think of a non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA, they think of the Kruskal-Wallis test . The Kruskal-Wallis test cannot be applied to a factorial structure, however. The first workaround to this is to run all of your conditions as a one-way analysis. This does not let you test your factors individually, but you may be able to get what you need from the main test, possibly combined with post-hoc tests. The Kruskal-Wallis test can be considered a special case of ordinal logistic regression , however. Moreover, OLR can handle a factorial structure, and does not require that your response data are normally distributed, only that they are ordinal. This is likely to be your best option. On UCLA's excellent statistics help website, you can find guides to OLR in both R and Stata .
