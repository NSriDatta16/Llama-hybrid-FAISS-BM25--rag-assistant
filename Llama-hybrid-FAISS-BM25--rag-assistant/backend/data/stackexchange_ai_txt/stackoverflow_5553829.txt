SQL Server Reporting Services 2005; subscriptions

I have an issue with the comments in subscriptions in report manager. No matter what format I create the comment in, format is lost when the report is mailed out and the paragraphs in the comment are removed, leaving just sentences. Since our reporting is new to users, I need to include some instructions and they require paragraphs.
