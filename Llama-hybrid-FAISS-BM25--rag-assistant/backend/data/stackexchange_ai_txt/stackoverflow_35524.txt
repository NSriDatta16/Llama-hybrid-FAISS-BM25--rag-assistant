You will have to tell us the type of data you are given. As per your last question: remember that an average can be calculated in real time by either storing the sum and the number of data points (two numbers), or the current average and the number of data points (again, two numbers). For instance: class Averager { double avg; int n; public: Averager() : avg(0), n(0) {} void addPoint(double v) { avg = (n * avg + v) / (n + 1); n++; } double average() const { return avg; } };
