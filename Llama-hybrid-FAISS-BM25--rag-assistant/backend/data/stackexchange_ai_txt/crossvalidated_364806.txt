Cross Validation in application of clustering on a collection of similarly behaving time series

I'm trying to understand how and at which point can one apply Cross Validation for time series data. If i'm not wrong CV increases generalisation so that our model has less bias in case the data is ordered/distributed in a certain particular way. But time series inherently has a direction (it can only move forward) and if i'm using some unsupervised algorithms on it, how should one apply Cross validation on it if any. I read a related question on it here : ( Cross-validation techniques for time series data ) although as opposed to the question above for supervised learning i'm planning on some unsupervised clustering algorithms to group a set of time series together. So basically i have two doubts : How to approach the problem of CV for my time series problem. majority of questions related to cv and timeseries and cv used supervised algorithms? So an insight taking into account the clustering technique i would be using would be preferable.
