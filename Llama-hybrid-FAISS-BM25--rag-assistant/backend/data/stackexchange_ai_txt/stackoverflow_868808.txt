How does SocketChannel know when reading a file is completed?

I am using socket channel and NIO concept to read data from client. How does Socket Channel knows when reading a file is completed? ByteBuffer byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(BUFSIZE); int nbytes = socketChannel.getChannel().read(byteBuffer); I am reading the data all at once if the data is small, but if the data is large, I read the data in fragments and finally get the same data now I want to know how does channel understood for end of data. Is there any way for me to know when the file reading is completed?
