How to set selected item in combobox in Silverlight 4?

In Silverlight 4, I have a combobox which is binded with a list of State objects( which has StateId, StateCode,StateName properties) and I am showing StateName as the options of combobox. Now I want to select the option "Michigan" which is stored in a string variable called "strSelectedState". How do i do this ? I tried setting SelectedValuePath property as strSelectedState. But doesn't work. How can I proceed?
