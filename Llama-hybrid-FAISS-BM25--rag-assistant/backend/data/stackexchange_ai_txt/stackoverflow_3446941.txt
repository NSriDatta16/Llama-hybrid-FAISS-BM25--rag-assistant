Some frameworks completely eliminate the need for DTOs and encourage users to just use entities directly in their views and controllers. For example this is the natural/recommended approach for developing JSF+Seam applications. I had used the OSIV pattern years ago with WebWork and we didn't encounter any blocking problems back then. Besides, OSIV and DAO patterns can be used together.
