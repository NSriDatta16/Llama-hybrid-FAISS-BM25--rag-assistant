PHP Query Generator/Reporter

I'm in the process of tweaking a web application and so far I've had some really helpful guys from here, explaining things in layman's terms. Thank you. One of the abilities I wanted in my app was the ability to search through records and use the result to generate different kinds of useful reports. In my workplace we use a system like the image below to do just this. Report Generator Aside from searching and generating reports, I will need the ability to save a user's search criteria for easy retrieval of future searches. Is there an easy way to do this?
