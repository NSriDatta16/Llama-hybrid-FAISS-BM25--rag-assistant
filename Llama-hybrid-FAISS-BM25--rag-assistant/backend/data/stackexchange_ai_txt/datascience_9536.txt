How is it possible to process an image with a few neurons?

An 1024*1024 pixel image has around one million pixels. If I would like to connect each pixel to an R,G,B input neuron, then more than 3 million neurons are needed. It would be really hard, to train a neural network, which has millions of inputs. How is it possible, to reduce the number of neurons?
