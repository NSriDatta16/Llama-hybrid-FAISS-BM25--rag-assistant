Can I fit logistic regression over a dataset with only categorical data?

I have a dataset which contains only categorical data i.e. A,B,C,D (like factors) for each predictor. There are 10 predictors and the dependent variable is binary, 0,1 . UPDATE: MY predictors are answers for multiple choice questions for a questionnaire. So each predictor only takes on categorical values, i.e. X_1 can be A,B,C or D , X_2 can be A,B,C,D,E,F,G or H . Is it feasible to fit a logistic regression over this dataset? Ideally, if I can fit a logistic regression the data, I will then use it for prediction over a set of test data, which again contains only categorical data. What are the pitfalls that I should look out for?
