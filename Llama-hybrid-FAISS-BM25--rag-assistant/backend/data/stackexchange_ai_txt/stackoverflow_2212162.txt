Do yourself a favor, and use a JS library that wraps all the ajax magic for you. There's a lot of cross-browser issues and gotchas, and this may just be one of those things. I'd recommend jQuery, it's the easiest and quite powerful. So add this to the top of your html, inside the head tag: And then in your JS do something like this: $.get('/leer/confesiones/', function(data) { console.log(data); }); That should get you started. Look here for more info about jQuery and the $.get function. BTW- I see you're using a POST, but for retrieval of data (no updating or deleting) the convention is GET. Additionally, consider changing your PHP so that it returns JSON formatted data instead of XML. So instead of doing that little dance you have to do with the xml markup, just get an array ready with all the data, and do this: echo json_encode($array); // voila
