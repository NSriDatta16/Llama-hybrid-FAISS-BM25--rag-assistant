the scenario you describe is not unusual. For example you could reference Butler et al. Circ Heart Fail 2017 "It is important to move away from over-reliance on a single primary end point, declaring an entire trial neutral or negative based on it. Thoughtful assessment of numerous important data should allow for the totality of the information to inform subsequent development decisions.” or you could refer to the Medical Research Council guideline on Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions states: “A single primary outcome, and a small number of secondary outcomes, is the most straightforward from the point of view of statistical analysis. However, this may not represent the best use of the data, and may not provide an adequate assessment of the success or otherwise of an intervention which may have effects across a range of domains” there are a few approaches you could take: 1) analyse endpoints separately requiring control of alpha, 2) derive a univariate measure that is a function of the endpoints ie a composite endpoint, or 3) model the endpoints simultaneously allowing for correlations between outcomes ie multivariate modelling for 1) you could consider eg Hochberg which is a common approach. For 2) you could consider the average z-score as per Sun et al. And for 3) you could see eg Mascha et al. or Brown et al. for the multivariate modelling option. Re the most cogent analysis to persuade non-mathematical people, this will likely push you towards a composite outcome. Re the need for a 'traditional' method, all three approaches are tenable, the modelling approach may offer superior power however but comes with additional assumptions.
