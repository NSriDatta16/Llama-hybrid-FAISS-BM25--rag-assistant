Can (G)ARCH models be applied when their is no MA component in the mean equation, or can only ARCH be applied?

My best mean equation was an AR(1) process (based on the Schwarz-Bayesian IC). I now want to model the conditional variance (having confirmed the volatility is not constant). I just want to check whether the G in GARCH can be applied, or whether the ARCH will be all that is required given the mean equation does not having a MA component (and no lagged error term).
