How to forecast time series with the help of other training time series in R?

Consider such a task: I have the figures on last year's bookselling of a certain book store, and the information of the first half of this year too. Now I want to predict the figure at the end of this year. I've checked R's forecast package. But it seems to only work on a single time series each time. How can I integrate the information from last year? Thank you.
