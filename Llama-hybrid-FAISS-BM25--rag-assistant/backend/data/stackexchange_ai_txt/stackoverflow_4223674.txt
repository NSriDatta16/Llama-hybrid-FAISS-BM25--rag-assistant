Has aynyone tried indexing a screwturn wiki, using Lucene-solr?

At our university they have chosen to implement screwturn wiki. I am responsible for the enterprise search solution at this organisation. This solution is based on Solr-Lucene. I have been looking around if people have tried to unlock the pages from this wiki or even better, have done so and indexed them using Lucene-solr. So far I have not found much.
