Additional advantage of using WCF stack is the possibility of exposing all the interfaces needed for CRUD and data exploration in a matter of few mouseclicks using WCF Data Services/ODATA ( spec , demo ), provided you have your data layer implemented using Entity Framework. I'm thinking about combining those basic RAD interfaces with additional layer of more complex, transactional services built using regular MVC. The combination doesn't seem too elegant, but in terms of productivity it may be beneficial.
