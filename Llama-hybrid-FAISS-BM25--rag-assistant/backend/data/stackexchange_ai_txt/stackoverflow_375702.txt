I would try it this way: Why would open-source software be less trustworthy than it's close-sourced equivalent? If anything, the transparency of its code would require that it be even more trustworthy, in terms of private data storage such as passwords, since any attempt to subvert it would be discoverable by examining the source code. This, of course, is only valid if the company compiles the source themselves, and does not trust a binary distribution.
