Big sites as well as big projects in general don't get designed overnight in complete. The architecture as well as appearance (navigation structure) grows and develops over time. There are many adjustments, reorganizations, improvement. Obsolete elements are taken offline. New pages are added. SEO adds a significant imprint on many sites as well. You are free to adjust and reorganize the suggested structure to make it better. Talk to the customer, explain to him, provide arguments and evidence. Some will get it and agree with you, some will not. Each case is individual. I'm not sure there is a special job title for that. It belongs to the developers or better to the analyst or architect (if present) to process the requirements, to analyze the use cases the customer has provided and turn them into the product design. Lots of them. Not sure where to begin.
