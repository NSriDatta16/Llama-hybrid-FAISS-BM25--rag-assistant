Logistic regression or T test?

A group of persons answers one question. The answer can be "yes" or "no". The researcher wants to know whether age is associated with the type of answer. The association was assessed by doing a logistic regression where age is the explanatory variable and type of answer (yes, no) is the dependent variable. It was separately addressed by calculating the mean age of the groups that answered "yes" and "no", respectively, and by conducting a T test to compare means. Both tests were performed following the advice of different persons, and neither of them is sure which is the right way to go. In view of the research question, which would be the better test? For hypothesis testing the p values were not significant (regression) and significant (T test). The sample is less than 20 cases.
