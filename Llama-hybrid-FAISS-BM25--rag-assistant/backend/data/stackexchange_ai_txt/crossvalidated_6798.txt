Objective measure of relaxation time towards equilibrium for a time series

I have several time series (generated from a numerical model) that go through an initial stage of spinup, followed by a period of dynamic equilibrium, that presumably exists for all times beyond the spinup period. See this link for an example. While I can usually estimate the spinup time and the equilibrium by inspection of the curves, I would like to know is if there is some standard method from time series analysis for determining whether a time series has passed through some early deterministic stage and has approached a later stage of noise around some mean value (Something like a AR(1) process, if I am using the terminology correctly). Summary: Is there an objective method to determine the point upon which a time series has approached equilibrium (e.g. phrased as a probability from a hypothesis test for each point) and is there similarly an objective way to state the mean value during this equilibrium period?
