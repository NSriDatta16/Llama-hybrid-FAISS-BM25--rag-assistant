Simple python CGI cookie script, get's data from form

Hello all I am trying to create a very simple python CGI script that takes form data and puts it in a COOKIE. Here is my code. #!/usr/bin/python print "Content-type: text/html" print import Cookie, cgi, os, cgitb, smtplib, sys cgitb.enable() form = cgi.FieldStorage() ID = form.getvalue('ID') name = form.getvalue('name') telephone = form.getvalue('telephone') email = form.getvalue('email') manager = form.getvalue('manager') def set_clientCookie(ID, name, telephone, email, manager): #create object myCookie = Cookie.SmartCookie() #Assign value myCookie['ID'] = ID myCookie['Name'] = name myCookie['Tele'] = telephone myCookie['Email'] = email myCookie['Manager'] = manager #Send back to client print "Content-type: text/html" print print myCookie, "\n\n" set_clientCookie(ID, name, telephone, email, manager) As you can see it is very basic, but I am receiving a "Premature end of script headers error in the logs.
