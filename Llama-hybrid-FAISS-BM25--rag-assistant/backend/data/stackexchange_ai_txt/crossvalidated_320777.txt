Two things come to mind 1) it is silly to try and fit a seasonal ar model of order 52 to 105 obvservations as you only have 2 cycles of data and 2) see I have correlogram ACF and PACF below for a temperature time series. Can I say it is MA(2) from ACF? What about AR? where ignoring the effect of anomalies is discussed causing a flaw in model identification
