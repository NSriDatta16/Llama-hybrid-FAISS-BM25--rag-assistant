Disclaimer: I am not familiar with language identification in the limit. But I can say this: pattern languages are not “above” regular languages in the Chomsky hierarchy – in fact, they are not formal languages at all. Rather, they are structured but informal descriptions in natural language which don’t fit into the Chomsky hierarchy at all. (Pattern languages are generalizations of the description texts used for the Design Patterns by the Gang of Four.)
