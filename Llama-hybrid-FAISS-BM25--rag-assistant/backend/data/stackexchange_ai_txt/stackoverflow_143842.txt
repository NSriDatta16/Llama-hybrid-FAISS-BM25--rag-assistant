In business data processing, the relational model is firmly entrenched, and cannot be removed. It is central and is often highly overused for inappropriate things. Folks will use (abuse) a relational database as a reliable message queue because -- well -- they see every problem as a database problem. The relational model is the backbone of many (almost all) commercial products for every business process. It's hard to find anything that's not fundamentally relational. Indeed, in many cases, the products are closely aligned with the database. Oracle's Financials, Microsoft's Dynamics accounting, etc. For the foreseeable future, relational data stores will be the primary storage for business data processing. Currently, relational databases go without saying. Everyone asks "which database engine" so they can weigh in on the Oracle vs. IBM vs. Microsoft vs. MySQL debate. No one asks "what will the data model be? Object or Relational?" ORM will continue to make inroads. Object-Oriented programming will continue to grow, leading to more and more ORM. Breaking out of this box is hard -- nearly impossible -- because business IT is focused on stability, not innovation. Their goal is almost always "Keep The Lights On". That means to refuse change until it is forced on them by a vendor going out of business or ending support for a product.
