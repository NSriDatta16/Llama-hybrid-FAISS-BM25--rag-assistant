Noting this in case anyone comes across the same issue but I've found a workaround that some may like (and some may not). After some less than helpful answers I've come to the conclusion that (leaving the database schema discussions aside) this can't be done with nhibernate. I therefore decided to create two views in the database and present these as tables to nhibernate in the mapping. i.e. CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_PersonPhoneNumber AS SELECT pn.Id, pn.PersonId, pn.PhoneNumber FROM dbo.PhoneNumber pn INNER JOIN dbo.Person o ON pn.PersonId = o.PersonId and CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_OrganisationPhoneNumber AS SELECT pn.Id, pn.OrganisationId, pn.PhoneNumber FROM dbo.PhoneNumber pn INNER JOIN dbo.Organisation o ON pn.OrganistionId = o.OrganisationId Using these views in the mapping as though they were tables enables all the normal CRUD operations while maintaing the original schema, albeit with two extra views. A compromise certainly but one that I think is probably justifiable when you can't change the table structure of an existing database.
