I'm using a structural break model (threshold model or regime switching model) to examine the dynamics of a time series. The ADF test shows that the series has a unit root. If you indeed have structural breaks, the standard ADF test is not appropriate. It is known that the ADF test may not reject the null of a unit root when there actually are structural breaks (such as level shifts) but no unit root. My question is, with these types of structural break models, do I still need to first difference the series to make it stationary? Differencing addresses the problem of a unit root. If your variable has shifts in mean or variance but no unit root, differencing will not be the appropriate approach. But it is also true we should use stationary series in a model of AR forms, right? Right, but you said you have a threshold model to capture different regimes. If the process is stationary within each particular regime (and the nonstationarity is only due to switching between the regimes), you may use AR models within each regime.
