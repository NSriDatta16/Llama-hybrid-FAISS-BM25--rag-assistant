You cannot say that you choose a wrong model just because the forecasts are converging to a straight line. But it may be due to the fact that you didn't pick up the right order. Note that higher orders are much more difficult to estimate. The search limits for the AR and MA parts most of the time comes from your own knowledge. But in the forecast package in R (that uses different criteria like "aicc","aic", "bic" to find the best model), they set by default max.p=5, max.q=5, max.P=2, max.Q=2, max.order=5, max.d=2, max.D=1, where the capital letters (P, D, Q) refer to seasonal orders. However, as mentioned in the book R Cookbook by Paul Teetor, P. 384, if you think that your models needs more coefficients, then you need to expand the search limit. On the other hand, if you look at the book Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting (2nd Ed.) by Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis, P. 161, the maximum range for both p and q is from 0 to 27. Note that they use AICC rather than AIC. Therefore , to my knowledge, there is no universal agreement on these limits. One last thing, in practice, you normally end up with some competitive models and not just one model based on one criteria. Then at the end of the day, you will again double check those models and pick up one of them to use.
