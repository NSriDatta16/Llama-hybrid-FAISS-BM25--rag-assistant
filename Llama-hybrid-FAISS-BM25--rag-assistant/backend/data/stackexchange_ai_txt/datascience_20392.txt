Non-mutal exclusive classification task examples

I am reading the excellent Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow and in chapter 10, the author says: "For the output layer, the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive). For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all." All classification problems I can think of (binary classification, image classification, etc) generate mutually exclusive classes. Can someone give me a few examples of non-mutual exclusive classification problems?
