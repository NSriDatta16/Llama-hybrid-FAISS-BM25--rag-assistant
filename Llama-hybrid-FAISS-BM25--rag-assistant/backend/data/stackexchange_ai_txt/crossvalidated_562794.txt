There seems to be a major confusion behind the question: MCMC techniques are simulation tools that aim at reproducing generations from a known distribution, e.g., a posterior distribution in a Bayesian setting. They are not inference methods. In the current setting, if the transition matrix $P$ is the quantity of interest and is inferred from the data at hand, an MCMC method such as Metropolis-Hastings would operate on the space of such transitions matrices, provided a prior distribution on the $P$ 's and a sampling distribution on the data, indexed by $P$ , are given .
