Why not follow the principle "look at plots of the data first"? One thing you can do is a 2-D scatterplot of the two class conditional densities for two covariates. If you look at these and see practically no separation, that could indicate a lack of predictability; you can do this with all the pairs of covariates. That gives you some ideas about the ability to use these covariates to predict. If you see some hope that these variables can separate a little then start thinking about linear discriminants, quadratic discriminants, kernel discrimination, regularization, tree classification, SVM etc.
