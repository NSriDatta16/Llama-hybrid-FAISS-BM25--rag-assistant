Use multiple css files or a single file organised by comments

what is regarded as the best approach to organising css. At the moment I am using a single link in the head of my xhtml documents as follows: In this file im importing several different css files i.e. reset.css, structure.css, skin.css I know there is an overhead in doing this as each requires an extra trip to the server but it makes things much more logical and organised in my opinion. Does anyone have an opinion on how best to organise their css. - Would it be better to put all these seperate css funcions into one single file? Also, is it best practice to minify css.
