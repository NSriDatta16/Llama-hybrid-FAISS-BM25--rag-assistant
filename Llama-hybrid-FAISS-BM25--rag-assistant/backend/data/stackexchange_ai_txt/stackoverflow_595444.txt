I think it's reasonable to save time and not write unit tests that you don't think will be particularly helpful. While 100% test coverage is an admirable ideal, at some point you run into diminishing returns where the time you spent writing the test isn't worth the benefit you get out of having it. You can always go back and add more unit tests later if you find situations where you decide they would be useful.
