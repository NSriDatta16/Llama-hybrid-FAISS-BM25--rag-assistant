I would go like this: select i.*, u1.name, u2.name, u3.name from inspections i left join users u1 on (i.inspection_agent_id1 = u1.id) left join users u2 on (i.inspection_agent_id2 = u2.id) left join users u3 on (i.inspection_agent_id3 = u3.id) order by i.inspection_date asc; Then select distinct areas names and remember them or fetch them from area table if you have any: select distinct area from inspections; Then it's just foreach: $day = ""; foreach($inspection in $inspections) { if($day == "" || $inspection["inspection_date"] != $day) { //start new row with date here } //start standard row with user name } It isn't clear if you have to display all users each time ( even if some of them do not do inspection that thay), if you have to you should fetch users once and loop over $users and search for user in $inspection row.
