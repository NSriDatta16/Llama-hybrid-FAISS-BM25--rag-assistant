To what extent is the distinction between correlation and causation relevant to Google?

Context A popular question on this site is " What are common statistical sins? ". One of the sins mentioned is assuming that "correlation implies causation..." link Then, in the comments with 5 upvotes it is suggested that: "Google makes $65B a year not caring about the difference." At the risk of over-analysing a light quip, I thought this might be a useful discussion point for fleshing out the distinction between correlation and causation and the practical relevance of the distinction; and perhaps it could highlight something about the relationship between machine learning and the distinction between correlation and causation. I'm assuming the comment is addressing technologies that underlie the generation of search engine results and advertising display related technologies. Question To what extent is the distinction between correlation and causation relevant to Google's income generation, perhaps focusing particularly on the generation of income through advertising display related technologies and quality search results?
