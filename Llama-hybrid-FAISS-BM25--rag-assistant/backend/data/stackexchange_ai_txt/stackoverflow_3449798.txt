Parsing hierarchical URLs

I'm new to REST and I'm building a service using the WCF REST Starter Kit Preview 2 in C#. Most examples showing how to define a UriTemplate assume that you know the exact format of the URL and can pick out the bits you need to perform the request. But... How do I allow users to enter a URL that defines a hierarchy and how do I process it? e.g. say I want to provide an online file-storage facility that allows user to view the contents of "folders" (all served from a database - not physical folders of course) http://mysite.com/MyService/Folder/root/level1/level2/level3 i.e. the user wants to list the contents of a "Folder" that is specified as "root/level1/level2/level3". I can then take this path and serve data from my DB based on this info. Thanks!
