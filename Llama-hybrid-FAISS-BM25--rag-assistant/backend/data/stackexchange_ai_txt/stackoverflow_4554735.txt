OutOfMemoryError

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError at com.solvoterra.xmlengine.Element. (Element.java:9) at com.solvoterra.xmlengine.XML_Handler_Main.startElement(XML_Handler_Main.java:71) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.startElement(ExpatParser.java:146) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.append(Native Method) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.parseFragment(ExpatParser.java:505) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParser.parseDocument(ExpatParser.java:492) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatReader.parse(ExpatReader.java:308) at org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatReader.parse(ExpatReader.java:264) at com.solvoterra.xmlengine.Project_Man.readXML_File(Project_Man.java:148) at com.solvoterra.xmlengine.Project_Man.run(Project_Man.java:83) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1102) I can see from this the error has occurred whilst running a new process which only contains the function to SAX Parse an XML file into memory (RAM) I don't know all the details as this information has been provided by an anonymous user on the market. Before the function to Parse is called all buffers and memory is cleared of existing data. Q: Is it possible that the user is trying to Parse a HUGE XML database into memory and the RAM allocated by his phone simply isn't enough to handle his database?
