Automate Dual Monitor Setup In Vista

I use a laptop as my primary workstation. Sometimes I work alone on it, but a significant portion of the time, I'm at my office desk and I hook up an external monitor to increase my workspace. Every time I perform this action, I click the same dialog boxes in Windows Vista to setup the dual screen and position the window. It seems like a repeatable task that I could automate. I'd like to be able to plug in my monitor cable, double click a program and have it automatically configure the monitor. What type of program could do this? I haven't found much online that relates. I'm thinking of trying an autohotkey script, or the Windows Accessibility API with PowerShell. Has this problem already been solved? Clarification: I'm specifically looking to automate the steps I use with my mouse that invoke the base functionality in Windows Vista. Right click on desktop Select Personalize in context menu Click display settings Click monitor #2, then click checkbox to "Extend desktop to this monitor" Click and drag monitor #2 to the left of monitor #1 Click OK to close the dialog Click Yes in the subsequent pop up to accept these monitor settings Update: Windows 7 does this automatically I just upgraded to Windows 7 and it remembered my dual monitor settings. I set them once at work as listed above, then unplugged and worked at home over the weekend. I came in on Monday morning, booted up, plugged in and whammo! It just worked. Thanks Windows 7!
