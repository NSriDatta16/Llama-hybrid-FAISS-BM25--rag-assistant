Searching the SAS documentation for ARIMAX (based on Patrick's answer ), I found (in " The ARIMA Procedure: Input Variables and Regression with ARMA Errors ") that they listed the following terms: ARIMAX Box-Tiao Transfer Function Model Dynamic Regression Intervention Model Interrupted Time Series Model Regression Model with ARMA Errors The term ARIMAX was used almost equally as much as the term Transfer Function Model . Intervention Model and Interrupted Time Series Model appear to refer to a different kind of model than the others.
