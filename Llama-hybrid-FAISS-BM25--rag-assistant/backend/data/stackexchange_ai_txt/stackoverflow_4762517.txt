The reason languages have switch statements is to allow the compiler to generate a jump table, which is fast if it's large, because at run-time it can get to the desired code in O(1) rather than O(N) time. It's only helpful speed-wise if there are many cases and the code to execute in each case does not take much time, and the program spends much percentage of time in this code at all. Other than that it's purely a matter of taste. There is no relationship between number of code lines and speed. What matters is the kind of assembly language code that's generated, which I'd encourage you to get familiar with.
