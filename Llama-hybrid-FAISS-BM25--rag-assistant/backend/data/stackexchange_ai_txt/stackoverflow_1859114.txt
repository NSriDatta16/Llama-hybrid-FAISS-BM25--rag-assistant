It's certainly possible to get by without knowing anything about the underlying hardware. However knowing even a little bit about for instance how caches work and which operations are fast/slow on your particular target machine will help you make much better design decisions when designing the software. On a personal note I think there's great satisfaction in knowing how the machine I spend at least 10 hours a day at work ;) And then again why settle for average?
