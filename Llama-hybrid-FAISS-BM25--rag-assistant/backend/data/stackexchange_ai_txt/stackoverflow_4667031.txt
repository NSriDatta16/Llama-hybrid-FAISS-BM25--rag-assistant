If "my system has memory, but it is scattered in different places(fragmented)" means, that heap virtual memory is fragmented, and "declare a character array of size 10" means, that you create character array of size 10 in stack memory : char str[10]; , then array will be successfully created. If "declare a character array of size 10" means, that you allocate memory with malloc() (allocate in heap): char *str2; str2 = (char*) malloc(10 * sizeof(char)); , then malloc() will return NULL.
