I would suggest going with a library like jQuery. It will fail nicley if there is no javascript. however, looking at the stats, there are very few people with javascript turned off and most are organizations. Such organizations have limits as to what websites they can go to anyway, and shouldn't be on your site at work. You would be safe to use javascript, especially since this is a gaming website. I imagine your audience likes cool stuff. We are developing a site that is entirely dependent on javascript. Our analysis shows that practically everyone can view our site fine.
