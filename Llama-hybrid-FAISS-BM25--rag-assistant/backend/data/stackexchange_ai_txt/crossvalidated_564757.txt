There are many possibilities the developers might want to refer to when using the word "singular". First, they could use "singular" in the sense of "really very out of the ordinary", as in "not yet contained in our unit tests". Next, as you already mentioned, your design matrix could be degenerate, i.e. not of maximal rank, and that could be called "singular". Still, a program should be able to work with those situations gracefully. Also, when you do e.g. logistic regression without regularization on perfectly separable data, your model weight vector would run towards infinity, which would be "singular". If you fit a Gaussian mixture without proper regularization, some (or all) of the modes could become "delta functions", i.e. "singular". In general, if you think of a model as a family of pdfs and some members of the family are singular pdfs (e.g. contain point masses in continuous variables), and your optimization converges against such a singular pdf, you would have a "singular" situation. So there are many possibilities, but I think a program should be able to handle each one of them gracefully.
