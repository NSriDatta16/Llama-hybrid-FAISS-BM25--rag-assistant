If your vector contains POD types, it is safe to use memset on it - the storage of a vector is guaranteed to be contiguous. memset(&vec[0], 0, sizeof(vec[0]) * vec.size()); Edit: Sorry to throw an undefined term at you - POD stands for Plain Old Data , i.e. the types that were available in C and the structures built from them. Edit again: As pointed out in the comments, even though bool is a simple data type, vector is an interesting exception and will fail miserably if you try to use memset on it. Adam Rosenfield's answer still works perfectly in that case.
