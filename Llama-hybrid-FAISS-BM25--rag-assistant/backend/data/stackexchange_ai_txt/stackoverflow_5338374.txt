I think this analysis method is flawed/not valid. I think this would be a similar reasoning: I can reconstruct the view from above on a football field by doing PCA on what each football player sees. It just isn't reasonable to expect that. I think the simplest way to analyze the descriptiveness of shape context is to download MNIST or some other databases of written digits, and compute the 10x10 matrix of the shape similarities of 5 ones and 5 twos, and then draw this graph using (say) graphviz.
