How to configure tomahawk and trinidad to work together

I am new to JSF. I want to use inputListOfValues component from Trinidad in my application which also uses Tomahawk. I have added the required jars for Trinidad and before getting inputListOfValues I tried one simple inputText to be printed on browser using Trinidad. I was not getting any configuration errors but it was not printing the corresponding text on browser. So I wonder if I can use tomahawk and trinidad together ? If yes, is there any configuration setting we need to do for this ? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Ganesh.
