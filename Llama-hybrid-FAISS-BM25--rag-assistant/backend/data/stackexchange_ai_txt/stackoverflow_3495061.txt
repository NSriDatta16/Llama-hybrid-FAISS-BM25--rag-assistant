Start with a rough design idea, pick a first test and start coding, going green test after test, letting the design emerge, similar or not to the initial design. How much initial design depends on the problem complexity. One must be attentive and listen to and sniff the code, to detect refactoring opportunities and code smells. Strictly following TDD and the SOLID principles will bring code clean, testable and flexible, so that it can be easily refactored, leveraging on the unit tests as scaffolding to prevent regression.
