handling dependencies to a frequently-changing DLL

we have a number of c# projects that all depend on a common DLL (also c#). this DLL changes somewhat frequency as we're in an environment where we need to be able to build and deploy updated code frequently. the problem with this is, if one of these updates requires a change to the common DLL, we end up with several client apps that all have slightly different versions of the DLL. we're trying to figure out how to improve this setup, so we can guarantee that anyone can check out a project (we use SVN) and be able to build it without issue. it seems like tagging each and every DLL change to a new version is excessive, but I'm not sure what the "right" solution is (or at least something elegant). it would be ideal if any solution allowed a developer to be able to step into the DLL code from visual studio, which only seems to be possible if you have the project itself on your machine (might be wrong there).
