I began to replace Content and Script folders with a folder structure similar to this: Public Css Scripts Images ... fancybox markitup The reason why I put it all in a folder called "Public" is that in contrary to Views or Controller folder there are only directly accessible files in it. I think it makes sense to put third party pugins in its own folders. I do it without some "plugins" folder inside the Public folder mainly to get shorter urls.
