Magento 1.4.2 - Set Address Fields During Registration

I am trying to populate address fields during registration, using data from another system. In my observer, I am able to use $customer = $observer->getCustomer(); $customer->setFirstname($value); $customer->setLastname($value); and the information is saved in the database, but $customer->setStreet($value); $customer->setPostcode($value); $customer->setTelephone($value); do not. How would I set address fields? Thanks!
