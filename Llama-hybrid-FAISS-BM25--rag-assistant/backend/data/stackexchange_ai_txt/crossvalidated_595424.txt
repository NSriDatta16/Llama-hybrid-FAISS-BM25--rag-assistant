Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm. It finds a minimum of a function. It doesn't need any data, the function can be a mathematical function like $f(x) = x^2$ . So, gradient descent does not "learn" anything from the data. A neural network is an algorithm that includes an optimization element (e.g. gradient descent), the loss function, and other elements that together enable it to learn from the data.
