How to move table row in jQuery?

Say I had links with up/down arrows for moving a table row up or down in order. What would be the most straightforward way to move that row up or down one position (using jQuery)? There doesn't seem to be any direct way to do this using jQuery's built in methods, and after selecting the row with jQuery, I haven't found a way to then move it. Also, in my case, making the rows draggable (which I have done with a plugin previously) isn't an option.
