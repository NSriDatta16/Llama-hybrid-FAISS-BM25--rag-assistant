How to accomodate for missingness in column dependent on value of other column

Please run this code in order to create a reproducible example: set.seed(1) n $satisfaction_without_NA satisfaction), 0, dat$satisfaction) (X The data are supposed to be the result of a survey, where the competence of students, denoted y is measured in a test. The following data are recorded for each participant: Has the student started a thesis project already? (Column thesis ) If the student has started a thesis project, how satisfied is with the guidance by his supervisor? (Column satisfaction , NA when the student has not started yet) I am considering the following model: For people who have not started yet: $$ y = \beta_0 + \epsilon $$ For people who have already started: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{satisfaction} + \epsilon $$ With the offset command I can only force coefficients to the value 1 as far as I can see and, furthermore, I was not successful to apply the offset command for pushing to 1 in this case. The following workarounds seem to work: # option 1: lm.fit(X, dat $y)$ coefficients # option 2: new_dat So here are my questions: Does the proposed statistical model make sense? Are there any statistical problems / caveats associated with this approach? Does anyone know a more elegant way how to specify the model in R? Does anyone know pointers to resources that give more information how such a situation can be handled reasonably? Many thanks in advance and best greetings, Sebastian PS: Here a link to the quarto file of this question.
