Correct mathematical notation for subscripts in regression equation

For the first time in a paper I am going to attempt to write out the equation for my model using mathematical notation, but I am a little unclear about how best to do it for the particular model I am using In my experiment I have two groups (let's call them A and B ) of participants and I want to estimate the average level of the outcome variable y in each group. My model is a simple linear regression using level-means coding, with a separate intercept term for each group (see here ). In the draft of the paper I have written the model out like so $y_i = \alpha_Ax_{Ai} + \alpha_Bx_{Bi} + \varepsilon$ and have explained it with the following text "where $y_i$ is participant $i$ 's expected score, $\alpha_A$ is the average score for group A, $x_{Ai}$ is a binary variable indicating whether participant $i$ belongs to group A, $\alpha_B$ is the average score for group B, $x_{Bi}$ is a binary variable indicating whether participant $i$ belongs to group B, and $\varepsilon$ is measurement error." I have several question about this equation. First, in my model I estimate separate variances for group A and group B . Question 1: Should I acknowledge the fact that there are separate estimates of the variance in the regression equation? For example would this equation be more appropriate? $y_i = \alpha_Ax_{Ai} + \alpha_Bx_{Bi} + \varepsilon_{ij}$ where $y_i$ is participant $i$ 's expected score, $\alpha_A$ is the average score for group A, $x_{Ai}$ is a binary variable indicating whether participant $i$ belongs to group A, $\alpha_B$ is the average score for group B, $x_{Bi}$ is a binary variable indicating whether participant $i$ belongs to group B, and $\varepsilon$ is the average amount participant i 's score deviates from the average in group j , the group they were allocated to. Question 2: If this second version is the correct version: is it correct to have the i and j subscripts after $\varepsilon$ to account for the fact that there are separate variances? I am concerned that in this version j only appears after $\varepsilon$ and not after the $x$ 's. is it more correct to describe $\varepsilon$ as measurement error or the amount participant i 's score deviates from their group mean?
