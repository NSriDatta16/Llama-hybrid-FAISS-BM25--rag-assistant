Comparability between Pearson's Correlation and more complex machine learning models

If relationships between two or more variables are found by Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Decision Trees, and/or Extreme Learning Machines, could a simple Pearson's Correlation also detect correlations between those variables? If yes, why? If not, why not? I'd be thankful if you had a source I could quote for my thesis.
