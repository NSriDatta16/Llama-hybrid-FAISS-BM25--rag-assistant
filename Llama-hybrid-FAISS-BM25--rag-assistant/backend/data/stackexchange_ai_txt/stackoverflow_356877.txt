Add overflow: auto; zoom: 1.0; to the 2nd div This is different (and in some sense closer to what was asked) than putting float: left; on the 2nd div because it preserves the width of the 2nd div expanding as far as possible to the right without hard-coding width values. zoom: 1.0; is needed to give the element layout in IE.
