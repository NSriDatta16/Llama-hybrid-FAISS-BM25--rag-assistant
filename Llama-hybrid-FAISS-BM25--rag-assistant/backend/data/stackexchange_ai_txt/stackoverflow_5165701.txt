MongoDB is using something like that for their document-oriented storage. You can get more details directly on BSON website . Unfortunately, BSON does not work with Javascript (as you can see from the implementation list ), so I think it is not a good answer to your question. You could think about using Protocol Buffers ; it has a JS encoder/decoder , but it is still quite experimental. You may try it - lots of times, experimental open source project are already good enough for usage in specific scenarios. Note also that there is some questioning about BSON being more compact than JSON; the same could be true also for other protocols like protbuf - I would strongly suggest you doing some math and check it out if there are actual gains.
