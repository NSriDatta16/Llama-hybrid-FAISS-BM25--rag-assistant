The parameter still decays to a pointer. The important part is that DIM1 and DIM2 specify the size of all but one dimension. So, if we have: double average (double set[][DIM1][DIM2] myset) myset[0][0] is DIM2 * sizeof(double) before myset[0][1]. Together, the two dimensions say that myset[0] is DIM1 * DIM2 * sizeof(double) before myset[1]. You don't need a DIM0 on the left, because the number of rows doesn't affect the pointer arithmetic. You can always leave out the leftmost dimension for this reason.
