WPF user controlled grid column width

I've got a grid, currently with three columns. The first column contains a WrapPanel. The second column takes up whatever space is left, and the third column is a fixed width. I want the user to be able to re-distribute the space between the first and second column - that is, some form of dragable division between the two columns, that will resize them accordingly. Any pointers would be appreciated. I'm not sure where to start!
