There's no way to specify an error function for the standard randomForest implementation. It is possible to supply a custom splitting function to the function rpart which generates a single regression tree, and then to use the ipred package to perform bootstrap aggregation, giving a bagged regression forest, but this is still not a full random forest, as there is no random feature selection taking place. Unfortunately, your best bet here is probably to write your own random forest code, or possibly to modify the existing implementation, if you're happy digging around in C code.
