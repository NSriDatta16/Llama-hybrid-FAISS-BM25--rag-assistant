So there are many ways to denote a series. How are you going to parse the series down to determine the values if you don't know the format? Determining if the label has a series does not get you to the specific numbers in the series. 2,3,5,7 parses out to 4 numbers Is 6 in 1996? I assume that is one number and 1996 != 6 "55,56,57" is series with a 6 but but not the number 6 Does 7-9 parse out to 2 numbers or 3 number Is 6 in 7-9? If 6 is in 7-9 identifying that as a series does not answer that question. How many ways can there be represent a series that regex got out of hand? For each format of series you also need to parse the values. You need to know the format of the series to parse out the numbers. I would have a set of regex mapped to set of parsers. Maybe use machine learning to identity new series formats but you are still going to need to parse out the series.
