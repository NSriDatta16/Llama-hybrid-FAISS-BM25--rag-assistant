What would be the best way to store site preferences?

I'm currently working on a massive revamp of my CMS, and was wondering, what would be the best way to store site preferences... Currently my pereference setup is within database, full of structure fields (each representing it's own preference), but only id 1 is used. And... I somehow don't like this solution. Now I'm thinking of setting preferences within php file, but then there are problems with editing preferences. Well, not problems, but using files as storage is just bad in my opinion. With site preferences I mean "Site title", "Site slogan", "Meta keywords", "Meta description" etc., not database info or other totally static values. So... Are there any other solutions you guys could share? Thanks in advance!
