How can I keep the context of 'this' in jquery

I have something like this: var Something = function(){ this.render = function(){}; $(window).resize(function(){ this.render(); }); } The trouble is that inside the anonymous function 'this' refers to the window object. I know I could do something like: var Something = function(){ this.render = function(){}; var tempThis = this; $(window).resize(function(){ tempThis.render(); }); } but is there a better way? This doesn't look very elegant.
