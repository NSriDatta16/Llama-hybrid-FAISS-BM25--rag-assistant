jQuery UI Droppable : how to make it live?

In this question , draggables are created on the fly, when the mouse enters the element to drag. I'd like to do the same kind of thing, but with droppables : decides whether to make the element droppable only when the dragged element arrives over it. I'm sure it's possible but after a bit of research, I couldn't make it. I tried things like this, but failed: jQuery.fn.liveDroppable = function (opts) { this.live("mouseover", function() { if (!$(this).data("livedropinit")) { $(this).data("livedropinit", true).droppable(opts); $(this).trigger('dropover'); } }); };
