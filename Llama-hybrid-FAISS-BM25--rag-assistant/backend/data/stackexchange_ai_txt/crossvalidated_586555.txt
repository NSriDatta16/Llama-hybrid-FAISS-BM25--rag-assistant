How to embed cost of action in deep reinforcement learning

Suppose you are training RL DQN model for lunar lander with finite fuel amount. Hence in addition to "usual" reward derived from the lunar module position there are different costs in fuel for each action. What is the "correct" way to solve it? Shall I subtract the fuel cost from the reward or shall I introduce additional state variable (eg fuel left)? Or is there another method? My reservations - I feel it won't be easy for the deep learning part to figure out relationship between fuel cost/diminished reward and catastrophic agent failure when fuel is zero.
