According to http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xns/sendmsg.html ... The data from each storage area indicated by msg_iov is sent in turn. My interpretation is that sendmsg() will not concatenate the message data stored in the iovec's; each will be sent as a separate message. [ Edit : My interpretation was not correct; see the other answers for a better explanation.]
