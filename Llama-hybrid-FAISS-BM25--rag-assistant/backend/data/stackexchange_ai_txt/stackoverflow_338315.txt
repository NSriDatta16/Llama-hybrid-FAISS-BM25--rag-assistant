It depends on the design of your software. Suppose you have a job management software and one of your "defaults" is a list of directories in which various items can be saved. For each Job you can have a storagefile member that is a singleton that load up the user preferred locations at startup. Or you could have a Storagefile member of a global variable called User Preferences. Still could be a singleton but doesn't really matter in this case. For me complex defaults (dozens of different types of classes) should reside in their own "space" accessible to model. However there may be preferences that are important to how a Job is setup so those preference need to be stored in the Job Object so when you open it in another user's application it works as intended. Again it depends on your design.
