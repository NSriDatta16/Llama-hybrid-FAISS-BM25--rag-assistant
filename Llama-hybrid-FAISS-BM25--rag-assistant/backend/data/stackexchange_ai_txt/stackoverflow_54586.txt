Solid Config for webdev in emacs under linux AND windows?

I have a windows laptop (thinkpad) and somewhat recently rediscovered emacs and the benefit that all those wacky shortcuts can be when the arrow keys are located somewhere near you right armpit. I was discouraged after php-mode, css-mode, etc, under mmm-mode was inconsistent, buggy, and refused to properly interpret some of my files. (In all fairness, I'm most likely doin' it wrong) So I eventually found the nxhtml package which worked pretty well. However, nxhtml causes weird bugs and actually crashes on certain files (certain combinations of nested modes I supposed) under linux! (using Ubuntu 7.10 and Kubuntu 8.04) I'd like to be able to work on the laptop as well as the home linux pc without having to deal with inconsistent implementations of something that shouldn't be this hard. I've googled and looked around and there's a good chance I'm the only human on the planet having these problems... Anyone got some advice? (in lieu of an emacs solutions, a good enough cross-platform lightweight text editor with the dev features would also work I suppose...)
