I don't think you'll be able to do it in a single query easily/elegantly, but otherwise it's straightforward: var minYear = dbContext.News.Min(x => x.ArticleDate.Year); var maxYear = dbContext.News.Max(x => x.ArticleDate.Year); (There may be a way of doing it within a single query, but only by adding some sort of wrapper query as far as I can think.)
