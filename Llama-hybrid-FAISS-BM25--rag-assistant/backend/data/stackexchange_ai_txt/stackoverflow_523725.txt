My understanding is of the internal session handling process is the following: When session_start is called, PHP is looking for a parameter from the client that was sent via POST, GET, or in a cookie (depending on the configuration; see session.use_cookies , session.use_only_cookies , and session.use_trans_sid ) with the name of the value of session.name to use the session ID of an already started session. If it finds a valid session ID, it tries to retrieve the session data from the storage (see session.save_handler ) to load the data into $_SESSION . If it canâ€™t find an ID or its usage is forbidden, PHP generates a new ID using a hash function (see session.hash_function ) on data of a source that generates random data (see session.entropy_file ). At the end of the runtime or when session_write_close is called, the session data in $_SESSION is stored away into the designated storage.
