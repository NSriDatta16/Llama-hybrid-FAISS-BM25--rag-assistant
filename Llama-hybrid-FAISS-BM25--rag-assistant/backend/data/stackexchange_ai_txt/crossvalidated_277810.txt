How can I quickly detect cheating variables in large data?

Suppose We have a data set with millions rows and thousands columns and the task is binary classification. When we run a logistic regression model, the performance a lot better than expected, e.g, almost perfect classification. We suspect there are some cheating variables in data, how can I quickly detect it? Here cheating variables means a variable that is very indicative to the response and we should not use it. For example, we use if a person make customer service call to predict if a person purchased a product or not.
