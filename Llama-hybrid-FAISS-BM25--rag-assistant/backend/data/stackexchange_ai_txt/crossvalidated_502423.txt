How should I do clustering when I have a mix of single-element and time series features?

I'm trying to cluster together different short audio files based on the zero-crossing rate (an integer) and the energy, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth (time-variant values). I've decided to use these time series as features rather than just taking an average and using that as a feature because one of the goals is, for example, to cluster together the audio files which rise in pitch over time but decay in energy. I'm assuming that K-means clustering might not be the best algorithm here given that it's meant for low-dimensional spaces, and I'll at least need to do some specific preprocessing first (maybe not just because it's a time series but because it's audio). What should I look into using here for what I'm trying to do? Should I look into different features? Cheers and thanks for any help!
