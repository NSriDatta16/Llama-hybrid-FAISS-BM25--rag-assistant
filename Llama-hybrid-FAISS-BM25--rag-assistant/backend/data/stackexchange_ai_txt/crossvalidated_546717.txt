Your intuition is right: machine learning is based on maths, not magic. If you can't give your machine enough examples of $(X,Y)$ pairs (where $X$ is an input vector of customer attributes and past behaviour, say, and $Y$ is 1 if the customer churned and 0 otherwise), there's no way it can learn any function that maps from $X$ to $Y$ . In other words, you can't build a supervised ML model without having data about the target variable. As you also say, I think your best shot is to train a model with the other dataset (which contains both $X$ and $Y$ ). If its performance on the test set is good enough and that data isn't too different from the other data (the one missing $Y$ ), you can then predict on such data and hope for the best. In the best of cases, "hoping for the best" would involve designing an adequate experiment to find out how well your model did on the unlabelled dataset. On a separate but related note, you might also want to explore different techniques besides supervised ML (on your labelled data). For example, churn problems lend themselves quite well to survival-analysis techniques .
