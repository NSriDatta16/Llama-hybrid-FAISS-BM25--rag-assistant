Is he incompetent? Or are you just flushed with the arrogance of youth? He may be incompetent, but perhaps he's just not technically as strong as you. Technical ability is but one factor when considering who to make a team leader. Perhaps he questions your technical ability and professional judgement? Perhaps you should engage with him and discuss your different approaches with him. You may actually learn something new from him, or perhaps you can demonstrate to him your strengths, and he can grow to depend on your advice and opinions - maybe even putting in a good word for you to the higher echelons. I've had some awful team leaders and some great ones. And in each case, I thought I was superior to them, professionally and technically. Sometimes I was, but often I simply didn't appreciate their strengths - which was presumably why they were ahead of me in the pecking order. Ultimately, if the guy is a real turkey, you must grin and bear it or leave. Hanging him out to dry is unlikely to do you any favours - Good team leaders have to demonstrate sound political, personal & business skills and have to be able to work with a wide range of potentially awkward people. [For the record, one of my line managers was that bad that I left; knowing when you are beaten is a worthy skill too!]
