If you are coming from a pure mathematical background, it might be good to read the History section of the Kalman filtering page as the origins in control theory are good to put it in context. Reading the pages for state-space model, state-observer , LQR control and LQG control might be good background if they aren't familiar already. For the difference between smoothing in stochastic processes vs. Other areas, the main issue I think they are getting at is that the data for time series should (probably) be causal , i.e. the present can't depend on the future. On the other hand in spatial problems, for instance, data is free to be related to any other data you like.
