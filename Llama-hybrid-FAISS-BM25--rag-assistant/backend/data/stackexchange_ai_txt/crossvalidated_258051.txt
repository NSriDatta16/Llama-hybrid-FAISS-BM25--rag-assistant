I have been taught the frequentist approach first, then the Bayesian one. I am not a professional statistician. I have to admit I didn't find my prior knowledge of the frequentist approach to be decisively useful in understanding the Bayesian approach. I would dare to say it depends on what concrete applications you will be showing your pupils next, and how much time and effort you will be spending on them. Having said this, I would start with Bayes.
