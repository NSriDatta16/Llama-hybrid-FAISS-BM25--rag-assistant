This is more of a programming question than a data science question and is therefore better suited for the stackoverflow stackexchange page, but the provided code simply splits a string using a regex pattern ( [_] ). The regex pattern used simply finds any underscores ( _ ) in the string, as a result the code simply splits the string on underscore characters: import re text = "test_string" print(re.split(r'[_]' , text)) # ['test', 'string']
