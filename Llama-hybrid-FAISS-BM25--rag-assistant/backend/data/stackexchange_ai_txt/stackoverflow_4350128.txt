In addition to what has already been said by Ken Pespisa and PeterMmm, though, there are a number of forms that are central to some Notes operations, particularly messaging and calendaring and scheduling, all of which are parts of the Notes Mail database, such as the Memo, Appointment, Task and _Special_Link Message forms. You can find a list of all of these common forms by opening a mail database (or the mail template) in Designer: they will be the forms that are not hidden (that is, their names are not parenthesized). Many of these are available everywhere in Notes from the Create menu, regardless of which database you are working in at the time. And note that there won't necessarily be a corresponding form design element for every Form field value you find in Notes. The Form item's position in a data note's storage is privileged (like the UNID and the NoteID), so it is very fast to search on the Form item value as compared to other field values. That means that in "headless" applications (Notes databases that rely on other apps to provide the UI, or perhaps that have no UI) the Form value may just be a way to select documents into views and nothing more. Welcome to the wonderful world of NoSQL, Document Store Edition. Notes was here first, and CouchDB, which is similarly arranged, was developed by the same guy who wrote the current version of the Notes Formula Language engine. It may take some getting used to having no adults around to tell you what to do (no table constraints, etc.) but it means you can build some pretty cool stuff.
