Ratio of Odds Ratios?

How would one compute the ratio of odds ratios for unlinked (but theoretically overlapping samples)? I basically have one dataset that can be considered my "population" or "universe" of data, and another one (newspaper coverage) that should theoretically overlap with the previous dataset, but probably won't due to bias in reporting. So for instance, if I get an exp(B) of 1.24 for black vs white kids killed by handguns in my logistic regression of one dataset, but an exp(B) of 0.45 for the reporting of black vs white kids killed by handguns in my other data set, and I want to compute the ratio of odd ratios, can I simply say 0.45/1.24 = 0.36? What about the confidence intervals? And how exactly should I interpret that figure (0.36) (i.e. does it mean the media under-reports 64% of black child-victim murder?)
