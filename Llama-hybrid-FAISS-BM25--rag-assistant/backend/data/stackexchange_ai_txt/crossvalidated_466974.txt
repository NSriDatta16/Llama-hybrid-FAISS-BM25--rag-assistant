Doubts about the use of Cross-Validation in GLMM

I've recently ask in statckoverflow about some doubts with logistic regression fitted with a GLMM and an user recommend me asking in this forum. So, here it goes. I work with a wild population of a bird species in which we can find two different types of individuals: those with a subordinate status called floaters (birds with no territory which is secretevely moving inside the population) and those with a high status called territorials (birds that defend a territory, a partner and a nest). Our fieldwork procedure let us distinguish through their behavior between these two types of individuals and our currently question is if there are any morphological differences between floaters and territorial individuals. For this aim, we have 7 cohorts of 1-year adults and its morphological data (weight, tarsus length (both to measure condition), length of ornamental feathers, amount spotted plumage... etc) to compare between floaters and territorials (F vs. T). And I've built the following model after exploring and clearing up my data set: a logistic regression using lme4 with year as a random factor. After getting the results on the summary, I've checked the residuals using the package DHARMa and everything is ok. logistic |z|) (Intercept) -1.89970 2.01301 -0.944 0.34532 body_condition -0.51050 0.18749 -2.723 0.00647 ** mot_suma -0.46016 1.10950 -0.415 0.67833 feather_length 0.04145 0.05569 0.744 0.45668 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) condtn mot_sm body_condi 0.179 mot_suma -0.081 -0.057 fethr_lngth -0.991 -0.177 0.064 My question is : after getting my model and check its residuals, is it needed to do any other type of evaluation/checking to present these results in a manuscript? I ask this because I think I've been messing some concepts. I learned about the k-fold cross validation method, but I am not sure that it is indicated for what I am doing since I am not interested in predicting the status of new birds in a feature, I've only wanted to know if there were any morphological differences (but instead of doing a model for each variable, I've built a logistic regression including all together). Could you help me clarify these concepts? Thank you in advance!!
