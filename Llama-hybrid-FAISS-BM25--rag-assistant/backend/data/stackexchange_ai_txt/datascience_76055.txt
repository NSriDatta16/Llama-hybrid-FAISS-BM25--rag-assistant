Information compression for variable input size

Is there a way to compress information of a variable input size? Autoencoder requires standardized input sizes. Although I can add masks on the cost function and add dummy features to standardize input/output size, I am hesitant with the potential drawbacks. The input structures I am interested in are graphs and images. If input sizes and shapes vary too much, padding, resizing and rescaling do not work.
