The logistic regression can lead to an overfit in high dimensions (that is, with many features) if there are rare features that tell you rare events. See Why is logistic regression particularly prone to overfitting in high dimensions? for more. It is strength and weakness at the same time that the logistic regression can deal with unbalanced data like "3 disease observations out of 10000 observations" and still care for that little disease category as much as the rest. See Logistic regression -> Error and significance of fit -> Coefficient significance -> Case-control sampling : Case-control sampling Suppose cases are rare. Then we might wish to sample them more frequently than their prevalence in the population. For example, suppose there is a disease that affects 1 person in 10,000 and to collect our data we need to do a complete physical. It may be too expensive to do thousands of physicals of healthy people in order to obtain data for only a few diseased individuals. Thus, we may evaluate more diseased individuals, perhaps all of the rare outcomes. This is also retrospective sampling, or equivalently it is called unbalanced data. As a rule of thumb, sampling controls at a rate of five times the number of cases will produce sufficient control data.[34] Logistic regression is unique in that it may be estimated on unbalanced data, rather than randomly sampled data, and still yield correct coefficient estimates of the effects of each independent variable on the outcome. ... I also gave this a try at What is the intuition behind the idea that for linear regression, the number of observations should exceed the number of parameters? , where I argued that too many parameters will trouble both: the OLS of a linear regression tries to minimize the distances between independent input and dependent output variables for a best fit. the MLE minimizes the cross-entropy loss function of a an ML model of the logistic regression, which also tries to get a best fit but tends to overfit the rare events (output) with rare features (input). Such rare features only come up if you add many dimensions or features, so that some few tell the story only, while the rest is the mainstream.
