Not sure about using a SqlDataSource, but you can definately do this via the system.data.oracle or the oracle clients. You would do this via an anonymous block in asp.net VAR SYS1 REFCURSOR; VAR SYS2 REFCURSOR; DECLARE FUNCTION CURSORCHOICE(ITEM IN VARCHAR2) RETURN SYS_REFCURSOR IS L_REFCUR SYS_REFCURSOR; returnNum VARCHAR2(50); BEGIN IF upper(item) = 'ALL' THEN OPEN L_REFCUR FOR SELECT level FROM DUAL CONNECT BY LEVEL whereas you would simply create an output param (of type refcursor) -- instead of the var sys# refcursors) and pretty much just amend the above code. I answered a similar question about getting an anonymous block refcuror here How to return a RefCursor from Oracle function?
