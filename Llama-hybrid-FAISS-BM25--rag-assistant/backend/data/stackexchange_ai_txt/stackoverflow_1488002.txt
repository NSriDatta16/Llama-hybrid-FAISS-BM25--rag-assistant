I see you have already accepted Eimantas' answer, saying that "So having id,parent_id,left,right columns is your best bet." I want to explicitly point out the following quote from the cited link (italics mine) : "Adding a Node How do we add a node to the tree? There are two approaches: you can keep the parent column in your table and just rerun the rebuild_tree() function -- a simple but not that elegant function; or you can update the left and right values of all nodes at the right side of the new node. "
