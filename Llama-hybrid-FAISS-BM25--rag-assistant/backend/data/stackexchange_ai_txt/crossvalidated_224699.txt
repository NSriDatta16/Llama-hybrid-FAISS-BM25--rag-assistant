Without aiming for the Math: using non independent and/or unequally distributed variables is possible with ANN. You might trigger some side effects by doing so, like with unequally distributed variables having an overly long training phase, getting stuck in (other) local optima (though this is less of an issue in the application case), or not obtaining the optimal error during minimization from a Math point of view. But technically, it is definitely not a hard requirement for input variables of ANN to fulfil those properties - ANNs work fine with such too. Think e.g. of all the deep learning approaches, where people tend to (more or less) throw in whatever information they get hold of, mostly without sophisticated preprocessing.
