Could you write a c compiler? How about a web browser in c without using the stdlib? Could you write a JavaScript engine in assembly? Or machine code? Libraries, frameworks and languages are there to make our lives easier. In everything we do in computer science, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Don't forget that, and don't be arrogant about it. Cheers!
