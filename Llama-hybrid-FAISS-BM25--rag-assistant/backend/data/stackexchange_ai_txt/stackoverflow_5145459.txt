Assuming you mean you're pre-binning the data, so you have a (ragged) array of heights: heights = {{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}} Fill out the array into a rectangular form with something like: heights = PadRight[#, 5] & /@ heights Figure out what you bin boundaries are in each dimension (lengths will be one more than the number of bins): x = Range[1,6,1] y = Range[1,11,2] Give the heights as a constant function: Histogram3D[{{0, 0}}, {{x}, {y}}, heights &] (The data in the first argument is fake since it's not actually used for anything.)
