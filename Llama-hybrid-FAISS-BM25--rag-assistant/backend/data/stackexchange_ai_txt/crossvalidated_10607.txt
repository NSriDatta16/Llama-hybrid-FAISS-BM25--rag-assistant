How to choose the link function when performing a logistic regression?

I am running a logistic model. In SAS Entreprise Miner, I noticed there's a link function that has three possible options: logit , probit and cll (complementary log-log). Can you please shed light on the following questions: Can we use any of these link function to carry out a logistic regression? Are there situations where one would be better than others? Is it intuitively possible to get some insight about which kind of function could be useful in which situation? (By just looking at the formula, complementary log-log function might be good for normalization of data when data does not depart (too much) from a normal distribution.) Any additional pointers would be greatly appreciated.
