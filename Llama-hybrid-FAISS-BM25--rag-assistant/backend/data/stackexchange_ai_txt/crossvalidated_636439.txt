Low R-squared for binary logistic regression model but all variables are significant

I am currently testing a binary logistic regression model (N=2000), examining the relationship between several independent variables (such as substance use -categorial-, gender-categorial-, self-control-likert-) and a binary/categorical dependent variable related to delinquency (no crime-at least one crime). However, I am facing a challenge with the Nagelkerke R-squared, which appears to be lower than expected... really really low. Despite all the independent variables showing statistical significance, the overall explanatory power of the model seems inadequate. I used five independent variables in my analysis and would appreciate insights into why the Nagelkerke R-squared is low despite the significance of the individual predictors. Additionally, I am curious if there are alternative ways to improve the R-squared or if there are other indicators that could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
