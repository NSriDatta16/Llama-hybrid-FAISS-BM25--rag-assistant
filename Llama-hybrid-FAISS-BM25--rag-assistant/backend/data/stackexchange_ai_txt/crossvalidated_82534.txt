I'll answer your second question first. Yes, there is no variance within the subject level in your situation, so including a random slope makes no difference when you run your analyses. In fact, in your situation, a multi-level model is exactly equivalent to a regression analysis with a difference score as the dependent variable (which, in turn, is equivalent to an ANOVA model with a 2-level within-subjects factor and an individual difference variable as a covariate that is allowed to interact with the within-subjects factor). To demonstrate this, I have simulated some data and analyzed those data using both a multi-level model (using lmer from the lme4 package) and a regression model (using lm ). require(lme4) require(reshape2) require(plyr) # Set the seed set.seed(12315) # Simulate data id Compare the results of the multi-level model to those with lm using the same data that I reshaped into so-called "wide" format so that the data would be compatible with lm : # Reshape the data into wide format for analysis using lm d_wide |t|) (Intercept) -0.01701 0.17948 -0.095 0.92469 personality 0.63373 0.19617 3.231 0.00168 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 Residual standard error: 1.794 on 98 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.09624, Adjusted R-squared: 0.08702 F-statistic: 10.44 on 1 and 98 DF, p-value: 0.001683 Note that I obtained precisely the same coefficient value and $t$-value for the personality by valence interaction using lmer and lm . Although the analyses using lm that I show above do not include the main effect of personality , you can also obtain this effect through lm by predicting the average of high_eval and low_eval from personality . In general, when you only have two levels to your within-subjects variable, you can replicate the coefficient values and $t$-values from a multi-level model using a standard linear model (although this is not necessarily the case for the degrees of freedom and $p$-values; see a discussion by Doug Bates here ). This, I think, answers your second and third questions. There's nothing wrong necessarily with using a multi-level model in your situation, but you don't really gain anything in using it relative to a plain regression analysis of difference scores / averages. Likewise, there's nothing that prevents you from testing interactions between some individual difference variable and your within-subjects manipulation. What multi-level models allow (when you have more than two measurements per participant) is for random variation within multiple levels -- the interaction between the individual difference and the within-subjects manipulation is a fixed effect.
