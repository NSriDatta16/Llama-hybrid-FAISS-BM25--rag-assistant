Yes you can. It depends at what level you want to limit the access. If all you want is to limit embedding from other websites (but don't mind that others can download the video anyway) a solution can be to watch the referer header. Something like this pseudo-code: $headers = getallheaders(); $referer = $headers['Referer']; if( !checkReferer($referer) ){ //don't admit, request coming from other website } else { //allow } Cheers!
