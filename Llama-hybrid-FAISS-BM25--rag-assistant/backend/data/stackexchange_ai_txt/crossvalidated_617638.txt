Spatial correlogram of time series

I have the dataset: df $year station, FUN = rep)) and I would like to create a correlogram to show that the correlation of vla between stations decreases with distance. I thought to calculate the Spearman correlation between each series and plot it against the corresponding distance. Do you have any suggestions?
