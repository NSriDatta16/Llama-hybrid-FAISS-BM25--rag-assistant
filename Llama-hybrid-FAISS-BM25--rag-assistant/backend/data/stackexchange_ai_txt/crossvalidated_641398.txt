Lambda is the average number of events in a fixed interval (time or space). For example the distribution of chewing gums on each tile on the sidewalk - shamelessly stolen from Wikipedia ;) Now what would you do when the tiles were different sizes (as some of them are in this snapshot)? You can associate your counts to a varying interval size via the offset specification. So the offset adjust your counts when the interval associated with your counts changes over your experiment.
