You say "I know a little bit about dynamic time warping, but this doesn't deal with vectors" But a time series is just a vector, right? The constraint you have is just one type of normalization, but and Mueen and Keogh point out, you must normalize for DTW [a]. It is not clear that DTW is needed here, could you use Eucldian distance (which is really a special case of DTW, with a warping window of zero) [a] https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/DTW.pdf
