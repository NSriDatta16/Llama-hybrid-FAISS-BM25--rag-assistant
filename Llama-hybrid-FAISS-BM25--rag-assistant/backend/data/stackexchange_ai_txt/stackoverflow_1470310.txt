resizable Grid Row and Grid Item

I have an mx:Grid component in my flex application. But I would like to resize it by clicking and dragging in the border. This component doesn't allow doing that. Does anybody know any custom component to do this? I want to put a panel in each gridItem of this Grid component and resize it.
