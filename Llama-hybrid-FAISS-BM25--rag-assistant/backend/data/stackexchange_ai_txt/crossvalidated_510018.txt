Statistical significance (rejecting the null hypothesis of zero regression coefficients) involves the observed $R^2$ and the sample size $n$ . Under certain assumptions, for small $R^2$ and large $n$ , the significance approximately depends on the product $R^2 n$ ; this can be seen for the correlation coefficient significance in simple regression and for the $F$ -test in multiple regression . This indicates that even subtle effects (small $R^2$ ) can be measured with significance given a large enough sample. Intuitively, the larger the sample, the more averaging occurs in calculating $R^2$ and the more the "noise" is reduced in comparison to the "signal".
