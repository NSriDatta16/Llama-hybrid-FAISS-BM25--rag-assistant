Why not? The only problem to me, is the User Interface - how you send out the error message elegantly to the user. On another note, your function might not work properly as you did not intake a proper birthday (you are using a fixed birthday). You should change 'March 23, 1988' to $then //Validate for users over 18 only function validateAge($then, $min) { // $then will first be a string-date $then = strtotime($then); //The age to be over, over +18 $min = strtotime('+18 years', $then); echo $min; if(time() Or you can: // validate birthday function validateAge($birthday, $age = 18) { // $birthday can be UNIX_TIMESTAMP or just a string-date. if(is_string($birthday)) { $birthday = strtotime($birthday); } // check // 31536000 is the number of seconds in a 365 days year. if(time() - $birthday
