There are no easy solutions when comparison groups that start an experimental study at different levels. Likely these groups were not randomly formed, so differences other than those measured may also exist further confounding interpretation of results. One option is to use ANCOVA (or regression) and treat the pre-test (first administration) as a covariate to provide adjusted – predicted – second administration scores that show what the scores, and group differences, ‘might’ be if both groups started at the same level for the first administration. Unknown confounding variables represent a serious problem with this approach if groups were not randomly formed; they likely differ in other important ways so any adjustment on the second administration scores are highly suspect and interpretation should be treated with caution. Some use gain scores, but as you realize, again, if groups start at different levels on the pre-test, then gain scores can be affected by floor or ceiling effects, and differential gain is not so easy to interpret. Repeated measures analysis is also possible, but it too suffers from the same shortcomings noted above when unequal groups are studied. Normalized gain, symbolized as g, is one attempt to address the problem with gain score analysis with unequal group starting points on pretests. Normalized gain appears to be used in physics education research. Below is a description on normalized gain that I wrote elsewhere. Normalized gain represents the proportion improvement of what could be improved from pre-assessment to post-assessment. For example, suppose a student scores 40 of 100 correct on a pre-assessment. The amount of improvement possible from the pre-assessment score is 100 - 40 = 60. Suppose further that this student scores 70 on the post-assessment. The increase from pre-assessment to post-assessment is 30 points, and this 30 points represents a 50% increase over the pre-assessment score in terms of what could be gained, i.e., gain of 30 divided by the possible gain of 60 is 30/60 = .50 or 50%. Similarly, a student who obtains a pre-assessment score of 90 has only 10 points of possible improvement on the post-assessment to obtain a maximum score of 100. If this student scores 93 on the post-assessment, that represents a 30% increase over what could have been gained, i.e., a 3 point increase from post-assessment to pre-assessment (93 - 90 = 3) which is divided by the maximum possible gain of 10 points (maximum score minus pre-assessment score is 100 - 90 = 3). Thus, this second student has a normalized gain score of 3 / 10 = .30 or 30%. The formula for normalized gain is provided by Bao (2006): $$ g = \frac{(PostAssessment\ Score) - (PreAssessment\ Score)}{(Maximum\ Score) - (PreAssessment\ Score)} $$ If using percentage scores, the formula presented by Colettaa and Phillips (2005) applies: $$ g = \frac{(PostAssessment\space \% - PreAssessment\space \%)}{(100 \% - PreAssessment\space \%)} $$ where post-assessment % is percentage correct on the post-assessment and pre-assessment % is the percentage correct on the pre-assessment. By using the normalized gain score the focus shifts from absolute test score gains to relative gains. One problem with normalized gain occurs when a post-assessment score is lower than the corresponding pre-assessment score (i.e., post-assessment $$ g = \frac{(PostAssessment\space \% - PreAssessment\space \%)}{ PreAssessment\space \%} $$ This formula provides a change score that presents the proportion loss from the pre-assessment starting position. This interpretation is more consistent with normalized gain, although the focus with this formula is loss from where one started. Another problem occurs when pre-assessment and post-assessment scores are both 100%. In this situation, one has achieved the utmost score for both tests. Therefore, the normalized gain would be 100 for this student. I don’t know whether normalized gain is widely accepted, but it is one approach that could be considered. References Bao, L. (2006).
