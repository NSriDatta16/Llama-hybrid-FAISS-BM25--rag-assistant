I don't know what C++ is up to, but on my calculator the C# values are correct; is this possibly a sign extension problem (the C++ value is negative, and the shifting is dragging the top 1 bit with it??) Also, given that 0xFFF is 4095, there is no way the & operation can return a value larger than that.
