Costs of PCI Compliance?

We're developing a new piece of software (really just a single php script) that collects cardholder information and stores it in a MySQL database. Obviously we're taking every precaution with security (Firewall, Anti-Virus, SELinux, restrictive access to the machines), but we're trying to understand what steps we need to take next before taking it live. As the client is a Level 4 Merchant (no actual transactions, just storage of cardholder information), what scans do we need to go out and find? Obviously we'll need to have the server/IP scanned, but what about the php script collecting the data?
