how do tell if its better to standardize your data matrix first when you do principal component analysis in R?

I'm trying to do principal component analysis in R . There are 2 ways of doing it, I believe. One is doing principal component analysis right away the other way is standardizing the matrix first using s = scale(m) and then applying principal component analysis. How do I tell what result is better? What values, in particular, should I look at? I already managed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the proportion of variance for each eigenvector using both methods. I noticed that the proportion of the variance for the first pca without standardizing had a larger value. Is there a meaning to it? Isn't this always the case? At last, if I am supposed to predict a variable ie weight should I drop the variable ie weight from my data matrix when I do a principal component analysis?
