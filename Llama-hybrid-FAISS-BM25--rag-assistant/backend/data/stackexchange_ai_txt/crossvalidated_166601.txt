The (i,j)'th element of the probability transition matrix is defined as P(in state j after one year | in state i now). I.e. the (i,j) element of the probability transition matrix is the probability of a Markov chain being in state j after one period, given that it is in state i now. In this example, the period is one year. The states 0,1,2,3,4 are the values of i and j. So the probability transition matrix in this case is a 5 by 5 matrix, and each row (i) and column (j) can be considered to be labeled by its corresponding state.
