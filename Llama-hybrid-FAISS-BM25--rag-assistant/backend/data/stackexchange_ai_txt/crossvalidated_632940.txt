Welcome to CrossValidated. You’re right, a “bright line” of statistical “significance” has been proven to distort interpretations and to hurt science. Peer-reviewed journals and regulatory authorities have done damage in this regard. Far better as you said to let the reader decide. Stating the p-value is better than using p 0, effect trivial, |effect| It is wise to be more intentional and use solid designs when doing sequential testing. For example you need to have data comparability over time and no drift in how things are measured. Then you can really take advantage of Bayes with continual learning. Unlike p-values when computed multiple times, Bayesian posterior probabilities are just updates that cause previous probabilities to be obsolete, and no multiplicities are involved. This is detailed here . An important point related to sequential analysis is that a sample size calculation is not required. Most statistical significance-based studies are based on unrealistic sample sizes whose calculations depended on unknown quantities, so the sample size was just a guesstimate.
