Are you really sure? I never got this warning until now. So, double check. Anyway, you can use the #pragma warning( disable: 6386 ) preprocessor directive. I usually push and pop this to the "pragma stack" #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable : 6386 ) // Some code #pragma warning( pop ) as advised here .
