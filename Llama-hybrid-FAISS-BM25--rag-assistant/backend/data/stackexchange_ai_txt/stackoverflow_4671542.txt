If $object is not static then you have a problem. You need to be able to refernce a specific instance of the class. Youll need to pass the actual instance of SocialMedia to its static method or come up with some other shenanigans: public static function someMethod(SocialMedia $instance, $args) { // do stuff with $instance->object and $args } public function methodThatUsesStaticMethod($args) { self::someMethod($this, $args); } If $object is static then you can use the scope resolution operator to access it as others have mentioned: public static $object; public static function someMethod($args) { $object = self::$object; // do stuff with $object and $args } But then you have another issue... What happens if no instance of SocialMedia has been created yet and so SocialMedia::$object is not yet set?
