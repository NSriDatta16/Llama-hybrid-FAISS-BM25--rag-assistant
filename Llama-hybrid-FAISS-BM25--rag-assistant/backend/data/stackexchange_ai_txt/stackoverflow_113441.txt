First of all: keeping backups off-site is as important for individuals as it is for businesses. If you house burns down, you don't want to loose everything. This is especially true because it is so easy to accomplish. Personally, I have an external USB harddisk I keep at my fathers house. Normally, it is hooked up to his internet connections and I backup over the net (using rsync), but when I need to backup really big things, I collect it and copy things over USB. Ideally, I should get another disk, to spread the risk. Other options are free online storage facilities (use encryption!). For security, just use TrueCrypt. It has a good name in the IT world, and seems to work very well.
