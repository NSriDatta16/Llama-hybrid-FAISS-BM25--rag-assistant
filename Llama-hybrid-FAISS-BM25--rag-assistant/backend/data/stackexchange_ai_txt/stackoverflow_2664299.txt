HTML APIs for touch devices?

What HTML APIs are available for touch screen devices (e.g. tablet PCs)? I notice that GMail's iPad interface (and other mobile interfaces) doesn't scroll down in a normal web browser (pretending to be an iPad via a user-agent hack). How can one access this API on a PC? I have a school full of tablet PCs that aren't wonderful in tablet mode due to lack of application support, but there looks to be an increasing number of web-based apps that will fill this gap.
