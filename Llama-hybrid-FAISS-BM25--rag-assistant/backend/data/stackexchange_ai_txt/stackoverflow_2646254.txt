I don't think as a rule Web Developers SHOULD learn Flash. It's much more important in my opinion to focus on creating valid, semantic mark-up that adheres as close as possible to standards. Now that's not to say that they shouldn't learn Flash. Flash is a very useful option available to developers to enhance websites, along with many other frameworks and technologies such as those mentioned in some of the other answers here. It's going to be some time yet before all the major browsers fully support HTML 5 so it's not like it's going to replace Flash and similar technologies any time soon. There are also a huge number of properties on the web that are reliant on Flash so there's not likely to be any quick rush to abandon the technology either. HTML 5 provides some very exciting possibilities for the future in terms of embedding content into websites and applications but that certainly doesn't mean that there's any problem with learning Flash now.
