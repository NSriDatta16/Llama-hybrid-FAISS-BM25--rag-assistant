If you assume that positives and negatives are (on average) equally likely to get a positive or negative predicted label on the two datasets, then what you say is correct. That's the big caveat, of course, unless the balanced dataset was created by stratified random sampling from an imbalanced dataset, usually things other than the class balance change. These other changes could be e.g. in the distribution of the predictors that the classifier uses, or even the relationship between the predictors and the class label (e.g. in part to changes in the distribution in unobserved or unused predictors). Such changes would then change the probability that positive and negative cases get a positive or negative prediction from the classifier. However, the adjustment you describe is a good first approximation for the affect of the changed class balance. How large any other effects would be and in which direction they would go is, of course, very had to say in general.
