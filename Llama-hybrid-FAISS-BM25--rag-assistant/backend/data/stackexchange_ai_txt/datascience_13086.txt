I second @NeilSlater. If your purpose is to study and understand Machine Learning, implementing algorithms would definitely help. On the other had, if you want to implement a ML algorithm to solve a real-life problem (or in Data Science competitions), I would suggest you try out the machine learning libraries in python, spark, R or any other language. The reason as explained by @ahajib is that these libraries have efficient implementations of the popular Machine Learning algorithms. So unless there is a purpose, why re-invent the wheel ?
