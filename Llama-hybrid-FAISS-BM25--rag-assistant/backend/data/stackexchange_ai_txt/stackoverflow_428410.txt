Select either a file or folder from the same dialog in .NET

Is there an "easy" way to select either a file OR a folder from the same dialog? In many apps I create I allow for both files or folders as input. Until now i always end up creating a switch to toggle between file or folder selection dialogs or stick with drag-and-drop functionality only. Since this seems such a basic thing i would imagine this has been created before, but googling does not result in much information. So it looks like i would need to start from scratch and create a custom selection Dialog, but I rather not introduce any problems by reinventing the wheel for such a trivial task. Anybody any tips or existing solutions? To keep the UI consistent it would be nice if it is possible to extend the OpenFileDialog (or the FolderBrowserDialog).
