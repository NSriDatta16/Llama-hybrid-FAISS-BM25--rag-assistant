How to dynamically load image for drag and drop?

I am implementing drag and drop from a DataGrid onto a List in a Flex 3 AIR application. I would like to have the drag image be a photo (jpg) referenced by a String field in the data grid item, named 'imagePath'. I'm having trouble getting the image to show up during dragging. I have triple checked that it is not because of an invalid path to the image. I have tried Image's source() and load() methods in every way I can think of. I am calling this method 'dragCurrentToList(event)' on a mouseDown event. private function dragCurrentToList(event:MouseEvent):void { var current:Object = event.currentTarget.selectedItem; var dragImg:Image = new Image(); dragImg.load(current.imagePath); dragImg.width = 100; dragImg.width = 100; var dsource:DragSource = new DragSource(); dsource.addData(current, 'record'); DragManager.doDrag(event.currentTarget as DataGrid, dsource, event, dragImg); } This works perfectly if I set the image source to the following bindable variable but I don't want to hardcode the image name. [Bindable] [Embed(source='assets/icons/default.jpg')] public var dragIcon:Class; ... dragImg.source = dragIcon ...
