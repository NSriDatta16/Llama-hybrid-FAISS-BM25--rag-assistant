Looking into the IoConnectInterrupt function you can find the ProcessorEnableMask that will select the cpu's that allowed to run the InterruptService routine (ISR). Based on this information i can assume that somewhere in the low level (see Adam's post) it's possible to specify where to route the interrupt. On the side note file operation is not really related to the interrupts and/or dma directly. File operation is file system concept that translated to something low level depend on which bus you filesystem located it might be IDE or SATA disk or it might be even usb storage in this case sector read will be translated to 3 logical operation over usb bus, there will be interrupt served by usb host controller driver, but it's not really related to original file read operation, that was probably split to smaller transaction any way.
