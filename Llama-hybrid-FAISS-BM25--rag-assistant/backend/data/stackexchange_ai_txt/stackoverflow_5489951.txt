Putting SDL surfaces in a map, along with file names

I'm very new to using maps in C++, so I am having some difficulties using it for my SDL surfaces. This is what I've tried (not working): map mSurfaceMap; mSurfaceMap.insert(pair (m_poSurfaceTest, "..//..//gfx//testImage.png")); The idea is to put all surfaces and their corresponding image files in a map to easily initialize them and do IMG_Load() on them, as well as free them when closing the program. If this is a bad solution for it, please point me in the right direction. I first thought of making two arrays, but I wanted to try this instead, as I felt it was a more elegant solution. If the solution is ok, I'd love to hear what I am doing wrong in the code.
