Many features leads to high variance --overfitting occurs. With so many dimensions, the model is bound to find chance associations. Popular methods to reduce overfitting include regularization aka penalizatiom aka shrinkage. Eg lasso, ridge, elastic net. bagging, eg random forest dropout, augmentation boosting, eg adaboost, xgboost These all work either as classifiers (output probabilities) or regressors
