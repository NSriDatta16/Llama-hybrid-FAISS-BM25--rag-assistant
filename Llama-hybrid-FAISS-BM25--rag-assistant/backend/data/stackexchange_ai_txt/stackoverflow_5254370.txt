You will have to develop a data structure to store the point data so that it can be easily queried and manipulated. The Path object may be sufficient for this itself, but consider wrapping it in another object to present a more domain specific interface. You will have to detect mouse events in the Canvas and hit test for all the vertices in the Path. A hit test is a function that gives you a reference to a single point in the path nearest to the coordinate of the mouse or null if the click was too far from any of the points to be considered a "hit". Your hit test function becomes a low level construct from which you can build the more interesting editing operations. For instance, you can store a bool for each point in the path indicating whether the point is selected. When you drag the mouse with the button down, you can drag all the selected points by offsetting their data in the data structure mentioned earlier.
