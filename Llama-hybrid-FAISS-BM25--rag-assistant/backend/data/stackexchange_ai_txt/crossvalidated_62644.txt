Type 1 error Bayesian Stats

Is there anybody who can tell me or explain to me about finding the Type 1 error for a Bayesian clinical trial. Of a 100 patients I need 59 successful patients to exceed my posterior threshold. I have been able to work this through R but now am stuck trying to find the probability Type 1 error for these 59 successes. I know the value should be ~ 0.044, but has to how to find this value I am unsure. Any help please.
