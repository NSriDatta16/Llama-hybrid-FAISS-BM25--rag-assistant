I'm not quite sure what the data looks like and your logic is a little spotty for me to fully understand, but this is basically how I see this working: $result = mysql_query("SELECT *, DAY('date') AS day FROM table WHERE ... yadda, yadda"); // Reorganize the events into an array keyed by day of the month $events = array(); while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { if (!$events[$row['day']]) $events[$row['day']] = array(); $events[$row['day']][] = $row; } // Build calendar for ($day = 1; $day
