I think your best bet for encryption would be to make a encrypted partition on one of your drives, or possibly a virtual encrypted drive, then move the mysql data storage over to the encrypted partition. Note that you would need to enter the password on system boot to mount the partition, but if you automatically entered it the security would be useless. Basically this would protect you from physical intrusion or theft of the machine.
