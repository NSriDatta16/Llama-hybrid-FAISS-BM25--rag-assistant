Adobe Flash - Drag & drop movieClips

I have 5 separate movie clips on stage. I would like to drag and drop 1 movie clip inbetween the other 2 movie clip so I can put the movie clips in order. Basically, its a quiz. Say you have redSquare(movieclip), blueSquare(movieclip), black Square(movieclip), orangeSquare(movieclip) The correct order is: blueSquare,Blacksquare,OrangeSquare,RedSquare. I want the movie clips to be jumbled and then user will drag and drop movie clips in order. I know how to start and stop drag but I don't know how to drag movie clip inbetween 2 movie clips. Any help or suggestion? Thank you
