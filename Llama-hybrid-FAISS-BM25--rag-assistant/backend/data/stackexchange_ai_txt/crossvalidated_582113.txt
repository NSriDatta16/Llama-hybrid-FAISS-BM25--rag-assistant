Bootstrap vs posterior for linear regression

I'm curious if Bootstrapped Frequentist methods are analogous to Bayesian methods with uninformative priors (I know, there's debate to whether this actually exists.) For a simple example, suppose that Model A is Bayesian linear regression of {x,y}. And Model B is a collection models, B[i], where x[i] is the ith bootstrapped sample of x. Both should give a distribution over the values that the intercept and slope could take on. Is model B design done in practice and why or why not?
