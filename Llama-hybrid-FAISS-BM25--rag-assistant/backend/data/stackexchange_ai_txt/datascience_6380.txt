How to avoid overfitting in random forest?

I want to avoid overfitting in random forest. In this regard, I intend to use mtry, nodesize, and maxnodes etc. Could you please help me choose values for these parameters? I am using R. Also, if possible, please tell me how I can use k-fold cross validation for random forest (in R).
