I've been down this road before and ended up with: http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.platformsdk.security/browse_thread/thread/63d884134958cce7?pli=1 I was able to configure User Rights Assignments using the Lsa* functions in advapi32.dll but could never work out how to configure Security Options. This may be of help though: http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/03/15/local_security_policies.html http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=214752 You could customise a template then run regsvr32 %windir%\system32\scecli.dll from inside your code. Not elegant but might be a way.
