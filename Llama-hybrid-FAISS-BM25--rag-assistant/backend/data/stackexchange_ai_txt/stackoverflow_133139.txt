Thanks David and dacracot for your insights. Upon further review and consultation (plus some leveraging) of our IT department, considering that this app and DB would run on their own server, and apparently other areas of the corporation have approved the use of open server technologies like PHP, SQL and Apache, this will likely move to a PHP/SQL build for a few reasons, not the least of them being licensing costs of putting Oracle on a new server and the overall larger availability of PHP/SQL developers in the local dev community. I did adapt some of dacracot's advice however, and convinced admin to send me to some .NET training so I can better assist in managing our intranet. I will also keep the Oracle Application Express site in mind for further dev needs across our intranet. Thanks for your help.
