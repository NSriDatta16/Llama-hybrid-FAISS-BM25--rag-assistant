Position .image-wrap relatively, but without any left/right/top/bottom properties. Then, position the h3 absolutely and move it to where you want it. The problem you're encountering is that absolutely positioned elements have to be contained in a non-statically positioned ancestor element, otherwise it defaults to positioning it relative to the html element (that's probably why it was affected by the following paragraph). Relatively positioned elements are still part of the page flow, so the space relatively positioned elements would originally have taken up is preserved. That's the extra space you're seeing. The w3c has a nice intro to css positioning: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp , as does this page: http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
