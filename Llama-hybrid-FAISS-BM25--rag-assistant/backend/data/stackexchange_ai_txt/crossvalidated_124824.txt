Denote the lifetime of car by $Y$, and the number of car accidents every year by $X$. Given the conditions above, suppose $f_X(x) = \frac{e^{-λ}λ^x}{x!}$, and $f_Y(y)=μe^{-μy} $. Suppose the number of car accidents in each year is $X_i$ for $1 \leq i\leq Y$, $X_i\overset{iid}{\sim} f_X(x)$, and $Z = \sum X_i$. The moment generating function of $X_i$ is $M_{X_i}(t) = E(e^{tx}) = e^{-λ(1+e^t)}$, so $M_Z(t) = \prod M_{X_i}(t) = e^{-λY(1+e^t)}$. Thus, $Z|Y\sim Poi(λY)$, and $f_{Z|Y}(z|y)=\frac{e^{-λy}(λy)^z}{z!}$ Finally, the pdf of z, number of car accidents in a lifetime of the car, is $ f_Z(z) = \int_0^\infty f_{Z,Y}(z,y)dy = \int_0^\infty f_{Z|Y}(z|y) f_Y(y)dy = μλ^z\int_0^\infty \frac{y^{(z+1)-1} e^{-(λ+μ)y}}{z!}dy = \frac{μλ^z}{(λ+μ)^{z+1}} \int_0^\infty \frac{y^{(z+1)-1} e^{-(λ+μ)y}}{\Gamma(z+1)(\frac{1}{λ+μ})^{z+1}}dy = \frac{μλ^z}{(λ+μ)^{z+1}}\int_0^\infty Gamma(y;\alpha =z+1, \beta=\frac{1}{λ+μ})dy = \frac{μλ^z}{(λ+μ)^{z+1}} $ And thank any commenter to point out derivation errors if there are. Edit: Ignore the second and the third paragraphs and the last sentence of the first paragraph. Denote total number of car accidents in a lifetime of the car by $Z$, then $Z|Y\sim ~ Poi(λy)$ and $p(z|y) = \frac{e^{-λy}(λy)^z}{z!}$, and $p(z) = \int_0^\infty p(z|y) f_Y(y)dy = \frac{μλ^z}{(λ+μ)^{z+1}}$
