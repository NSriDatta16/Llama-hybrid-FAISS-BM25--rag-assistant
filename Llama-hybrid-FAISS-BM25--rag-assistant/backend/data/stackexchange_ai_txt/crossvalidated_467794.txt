Krasnodar The data for a region is clearly not realistic in terms of its dispersion. Here's a data on Krasnodar town. The sample average is 34 in May, and the dispersion is 8.7. This is more than Poisson distribution would suggest, where the dispersion is the square root of average, i.e. 5.9. This is overdispersed but the sample size is quite small so it's hard to simply reject Poisson distribution. The town has a population near 1M people. However, when we jump into Kransodar krai with population of 5.5M, all of a sudden the dispersion collapses. In your plot the new cases average around 100, but the dispersion is 1-2. In Poisson you'd expect the dispersion of 10. Why would the capital be overdispersed but the whole region would be severy underdispersed? It doesnt make sense to me. Also where did all the dispersion from the capital of the region go? "It's inconceivable!" (c) to think that the regional incidence is very strongly negatively correlated with its capital. Here's a scatter plot of the cases outside Krasnodar in the region vs Krasnodar town.

The average is 10K but the variance is 756K, with dispersion 870 much higher than Poisson process would suggest. Hence, the overall Russia data supports my claim that Krasnodar Krai data is abnormal. 9623 10633 10581 10102 10559 11231 10699 10817 11012 11656 10899 10028 9974 10598 9200 9709 8926 9263 8764 8849 8894 Source https://yandex.ru/covid19/stat?utm_source=main_title&geoId=225
