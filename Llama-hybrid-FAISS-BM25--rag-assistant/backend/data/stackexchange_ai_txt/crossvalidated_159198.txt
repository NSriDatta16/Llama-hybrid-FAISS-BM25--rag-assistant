Best way to test that one mean is greater than all the others?

Suppose I have $k$ samples of different sizes, each of a different univariate variable. I want to test the significance of the hypothesis that the population of $k_0$ has a mean greater than all of the other means. I know of one-way ANOVA, but my understanding is that it only checks for significant differences across the groups. Is there a statistical test that establishes significance for which mean is greatest? Feel free to give Bayesian or Frequentist solutions (preferably both). Here is my example: I have to compare the heights of 5 different people; however, my tape measure operator has a very unsteady hand, so there is significant variance on measurements. I can measure as many times as I like. Obviously I do not know beforehand which person is tallest, but I would like to give a confidence that a particular person is tallest. Would I perform 5 one-versus-all two-sample $t$ -tests, and quintuple their $p$ -values? What would be the Bayesian approach?
