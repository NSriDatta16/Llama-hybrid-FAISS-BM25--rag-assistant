Firefox extension localStorage events

I am making a Firefox extension to determine when a "storage" event is fired from the localStorage. In Firefox 3, I have this line to bind the storage event in the window to a function in the extension. $(doc, doc).bind('storage', on_store()); This works in Firefox 3. However, this does not seem to get the event when it is tried in Firefox 4.
