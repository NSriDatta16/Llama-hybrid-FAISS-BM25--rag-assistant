As mentioned by your comment, the contrib column holds all the contributions to the principal components. What this means more specifically is explained well by user chl in this answer on PCA an variable contributions : If you have a "PCA" object constructed using FactoMineR::PCA , then variable contribution values are stored in the $var$contrib slot of your object. The contribution is a scaled version of the squared correlation between variables and component axes (or the cosine, from a geometrical point of view) --- this is used to assess the quality of the representation of the variables of the principal component, and it is computed as $\text{cos}(\text{variable}, \text{axis})^2 \times 100$ / total $\text{cos}^2$ of the component. In other words, it shows how much each variable contributes to the creation each principal component. The value is a percentage and all values for each principal component add up to 100%.
