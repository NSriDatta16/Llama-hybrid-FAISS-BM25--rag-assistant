If I understand correctly, you are looking for feature filters and feature wrappers. Feature filters look at the features and target variable without incorporating a model . So they typically do something like selecting features to minimize inter-feature correlation and maximize feature-target-variable correlation. This is similar to what you mentioned in your question if I got that correctly. The advantage with filters is they being relatively fast, as they don't do model training/evaluation. The drawback is that they don't incorporate a model, hence don't look at your actual model performance that results from those features at all. They therefore don't necessarily improve your final performance (similar to e.g. PCA, which might improve or reduce your model performance, depending on which data you use it at). Feature wrappers additionally incorporate a model in the process, so they essentially train and evaluate a model with a subset of your features. There exist e.g. forward- and backward-selection-wrappers, and hybrids of those (they either start with 0 features and add features to improve performance, or start with all features and remove features to improve performance, or do a mix of both). BTW: depending on which software you use, these are likely already pre-implemented (e.g. for R caret, see http://topepo.github.io/caret/featureselection.html )
