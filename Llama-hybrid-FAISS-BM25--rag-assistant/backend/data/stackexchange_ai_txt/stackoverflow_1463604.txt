The optimizer has to think more about which if any of the indexes to use if there are five. That cost is usually not too bad, but it depends on the queries you're asking of it. In principle, once the query is optimized, the time taken to execute it should be about the same. If you are preparing SELECT statements for multiple uses, that won't matter much. If every query is prepared afresh and never reused, then the overhead may become a drag on the system performance - particularly if it turns out that it really doesn't matter which of the indexes is actually used for most queries (a moderately strong danger when five indexes all share the same leading columns). There is also the maintenance cost when the data changes - updating five indexes takes noticably longer than just one index, plus you are using roughly five times as much disk storage for five indexes as for one.
