In your TabItemViewModel implementation, you've defined ErrorHeading two times. At one place you write RaisePropertyChanged("ErrorHeading"); while another place you've written OnPropertyChanged("ErrorHeading"); Looks like there is some serious problem with your code. On the top of it, you've not implemented the interface INotifyPropertyChanged in your TabItemViewModel . So fix these problems first. Maybe, then you would be able to do something more elegant in your code. :-)
