Requests on App Engine are limited to 30 seconds execution time, which makes long polling difficult. Further, you need to keep your average execution time low, or you will very quickly run out of instances to execute your queries - App Engine will only provision new instances if your app is reasonably fast. For those reasons, Long Polling is extremely strongly discouraged on App Engine. If you're prepared to wait a while, however, the roadmap includes "Support for Browser Push (Comet) communication", which is exactly what you're looking for.
