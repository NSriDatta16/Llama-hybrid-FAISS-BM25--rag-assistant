Slow Startup for Java Web Start Application

I'm using the Netbeans IDE to develop a Java Web Start application that will launch from the web and then use the EclipseLink JPA to access a remote MySQL database. I'm using the Swing Application Framework to manage life cycle for my app. When I launch the application from Netbeans it takes about 7 second for my application to load, but when I use the Netbeans IDE to create a Web Start distribution package (with the JAR and JNLP files) it takes about 60 seconds to launch. Also, the "verifying application"/"downloading application" progressbar window seems to run every time I launch the app even though a copy of it has already been cached. From the users point of view, one first sees my splash screen for 1 to 2 seconds, then the "verifying application"/"downloading application" progressbar window for 5 to 20 seconds and then nothing for a good 40 seconds before the application launches. The app code is written such that it should show itself BEFORE the JPA starts loading the persistence unit (so I doubt that's the problem), but I thought I'd mention it just in case. Update: Method createEntityManagerFactory Slow With Web Start Having looked into this further, I've found that the method createEntityManagerFactory--which is necessary for EclipseLink to connect to MySQL--takes aboutn 5 seconds to execute when I run the applicaiton from Netbeans or when I remotely log in to my server to launch the JNLP there, but when I run the application via the web the same line takes 35 seconds (hugely delaying startup). Interestingly, this time gets even worse as my internet connection speed gets worse. Below is a copy of the JNLP file I'm using. Does anyone have any idea what may be causing such a delay?
