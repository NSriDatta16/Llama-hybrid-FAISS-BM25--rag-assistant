VAR(p) Model with difflog data

I'm doing a regression analysis with a VAR model in R. My data is price and position data in the commodity market, since i want to find out (Granger) causality between them. I took the difflog for both time series ( diff(log(y)*100 ). Does this mean, that I neither have trend nor a constant in the VAR model and thus can automatically choose none as the type? I would be really thankful for some help! Thanks in advance!
