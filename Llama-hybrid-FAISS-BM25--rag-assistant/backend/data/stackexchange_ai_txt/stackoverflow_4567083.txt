Security of using files as a proxy database

I've recently come across a website project where the client wants me to dynamically serve up about 200 text snippets (paragraphs) depending on which ones are requested. He's running a fairly simple business and doesn't have any database back-end support with his provider. Are there any blatant reasons (other than speed) why I couldn't just put each of these paragraphs into a text file and serve them from there using a php script? I've done this in the past and it works fine; I'm mostly wondering if there are any obscure security considerations I might not be thinking about.
