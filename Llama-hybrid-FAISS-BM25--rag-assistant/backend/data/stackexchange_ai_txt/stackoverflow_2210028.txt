CoInitialize Failed

We had multi-threaded application. Each thread has to invoke with CoIntialize when it is iniatialized as we use some C++ COM object for our DB operation. The application is working fine for longer time in the production env. But suddently the CoIntialize() API in thread init function failed with below error ThreadInit; HRESULT: 80070008 : Not enough storage is available to process this command. OS : Windows Server 2003 R2 with SP2. I found work a around in stackoverflow to increase heapsize for console application from 512 KB to 1MB in windows registry. I can do that. But I want to know what is the possible reason for this to happen first. The env did not changed recently. There are several other process running in that machine they can invoke Coinitialize without any issue. It failed for only two process. Thanks in advance
