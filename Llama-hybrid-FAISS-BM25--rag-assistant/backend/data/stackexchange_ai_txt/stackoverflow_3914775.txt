You could put shell script output to some storage on server. And use AJAX on the web page to poll the server and get updates from that storage to the page. If you will decide to use JSF for web page creation I can recommend "a4j:poll" component from ajax2jsf library. It is very simple and straightforward. Very easy way to poll server from the web page.
