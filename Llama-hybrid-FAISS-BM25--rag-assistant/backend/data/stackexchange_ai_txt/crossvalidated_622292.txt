I highly suggest reading this answer: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/312787/97124 You want your logistic regression model to accurately represent the probability of getting cancer as a function of your independent variables. Using this model to make a classification decision should be a distinct step. Often it is inappropriate to use the "default" threshold of $0.5$ for your classification step. You need to make an analysis of the consequences of false negatives, false positives, etc. Maybe you could specify a utility function of some sort (what is the utility of a true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative) and optimize the total utility as a function of the threshold?
