Image Comparison in VB.Net

After reading many related posts on this site on the subject of image comparison I'm thinking I'll try implementing a PCA on each image in order to see if an image is 'similar' or not, but I'm not sure how to get the data from my images - is there a VB function that I can use to convert the image into an array of bytes or something in order to compare images? Or a simpler way to compare two images (should be black and white but they'll be scanned, v. small images) Thanks very much, Becky
