I seriously cannot think of 1 advantage of using updatepanels. They are grief and i found that out the hard way. They're usable only for the most trivial ajax effects and if you're going to do any data retrieval or database lookups they have a huge problem in scaling up. UpdatePanels are frustrating and not a long time I have shared the updatepanel grief here , here , here and here . If that's not enough to convince you not to use updatepanel then nothing will.
