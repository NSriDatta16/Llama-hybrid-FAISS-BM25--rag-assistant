Method 1: Install from XCode The Development Provisioning Profile requires you to run the app (initially) from within XCode. This has the side-effect of marking the device as being used for development, but also requires you to connect the iPhone/iPod Touch to the machine running XCode. Once you run the app from XCode, the app is installed on the device and you no longer need to be connected to the machine to run it. (Until you want to update the app.) Method 2: Install from iTunes An Ad-Hoc provisioning profile allows you to give the app to anyone and let them install it themselves using iTunes. You send them: the app, and the Ad-Hoc Provisioning Profile They select these two and drag them onto iTunes. Then sync. Later, you can give them an updated version of the app only (without the Ad-Hoc Provisioning Profile, since they've already installed that on their device) and they can drag the new app onto the iTunes icon to install the new version. One limitation to Ad-Hoc distribution, is that it requires you to enter each Device ID into the iPhone Development Portal. And there is a limit to 100 device IDs per year (you cannot erase any IDs, until your next year begins -- only add them). The 100-ID limit will not be a hindrance for most developers, just keep in mind that you need to get the device ID ahead of time, before you create the Ad-Hoc Provisioning Profile to send to the person you want to install your app.
