Convolutional Neural Networks trained with vital data eg. EKG?

I am wondering if CNN are a right tool for classification of human vital data. My data base consists of vector measurements and has a dimension of $$ \mathsf{3000 \times 1 \times 1 \times numberOfSamples}$$ My concern is that data units are so low dimensional that resourcing to deep learning techniques is pointless. On the other hand our team tried before many other machine learning alorithms but without success. Maybe somebody wants to share their opinion and possibly a suggestion regarding network architecture and hyper parameters.
