How to Stop VS Designer from messing up my already present code

Everytime I move to Designer View my whole designer.cs code is messed up : VS Designer reorganizes code blocks and puts an irritant verbose prefixes like " this.whatever " and fully qualifies objects using " System.Windows.Forms.whatever " I Know that "Designer.cs" is not intended to be edited but I need to do some GUI code customization from time to time and would like these to stay as I changed them. How to avoid that ? (Guess this is too funky for VS to handle) (Actually I am just avoiding the use of the designer and do it all by hand, the good old way) Update : I am surprised to see the herd-like reaction towards this question. Sorry if it is disturbing, but it is interesting to see that, before hitting me on the hand saying "DON'T DO that, it's Bad", NO ONE asked WHY I wanted to do it. IMHO the question is relevant and that's why : Many of the "auto-generated" code is rubbish and of absolutely no use, it does need some enhancement. One example (among soooo many others) : Why generate a Size/Location property when the control's Dock Mode is set to Fill ? I wanted to take advantage of the benefits whithout the drawdowns. Anyway, I'll keep the short answer : You take it ALL (with the rubbish) or leave it ALL.
