with python's win32com and parsing html problem

I'm new to python. I want to extract some text from the CNN website. I want to use python win32com module. EDIT : on [why win32com] Because of javascript in website... I thought of using win32com; I have looked for other solution but without success in regard to my requirement. In fact, I wanted to use mechanize or a similiar solution but this didn't work [for me]. Is it possible to use beautifulsoup or lxml with win32com ? Anyone who knows how to extract some text from cnn webiste, please help me! Specifically I want to extract text in cnn website from ' Sponsored links ' ' Money ' import win32com.client from time import sleep from win32com.client import Dispatch import urllib,urllib2 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup ie = Dispatch("InternetExplorer.Application") ie.Visible = 1 ie.Navigate("http://www.cnn.com") sleep(15) ie.Quit()
