There is another way. Ask yourself - Who or what makes the best possible forecasts of this particular variable?" Does my machine learning algorithm produce better or worse results than the best forecasts? So, for example, if you had a large number of variables associated with different soccer teams and you were trying to forecast who would win, you might look at bookmaker odds or some form of crowd sourced prediction to compare with the results of your machine learning algorithm. If you are better you might be at the limit, if worse then clearly there is room for improvement. Your ability to improve depends (broadly) on two things: Are you using the same data as the best expert at this particular task? Are you using the data as effectively as the best expert at this particular task? It depends on exactly what I'm trying to do, but I tend to use the answers to these questions to drive the direction I go in when building a model, particularly whether to try and extract more data that I can use or to concentrate on trying to refine the model. I agree with Stephan that usually the best way of doing this is to ask a domain expert.
