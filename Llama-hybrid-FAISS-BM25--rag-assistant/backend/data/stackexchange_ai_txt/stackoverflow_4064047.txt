Spring MVC 3.0 + jsp footer

I'm writing Sping MVC based application all my methods inside a controller return ModelAndView objects. What I would like to do is to apply standard HTML footer on each JSP page, like signup/signin/about us/contact use/etc... Is there any way I can do it within a controller? I know that I can use but I'm sure that there should be more elegant way to do that.
