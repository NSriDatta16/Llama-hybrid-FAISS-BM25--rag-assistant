Because neural networks with a sufficiently large hidden layer can approximate arbitrary functions only on compact sets (this is one of the first things you can learn when you try to read some literature about neural networks). Train your neural network on a range from 0 to 100 and then ask the square of 78. The much more interesting problem of learning the algorithm of multiplication is a part of an active research area called algorithm learning , for example check this paper .
