Random Forest variable importance metric for predicted value

Let's say I'm using a random forest in a true/false classification problem. When I produce a score for an observation is it possible to get some sort of metric of variable importance for that particular score? I'd imagine this would be based on the observation's leaf locations across the ensemble.
