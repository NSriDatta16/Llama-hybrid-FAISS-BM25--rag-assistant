To precisely answer the question what does "variational" mean, we first review the origins of variational inference. By this approach, we gain a broader understanding of the term's meaning. Variational inference originated in the 18th century with the work of Euler, Lagrange and others studying the field of calculus. In calculus of variations, a function maps an input value to an output value, and the functionâ€™s derivative describes how the output changes with respect to the input fed into the same function. In the same spirit, imagine defining a functional as a mapping from a function to a value of the functional. The definition of entropy $\mathcal{H}_{P}$ can be used as such an example. The input is a probability distribution $p_{data}(x)$ and the output is the value of the entropy. $\mathcal{H}_{P} \: = \: - \: \int \: p(x) \cdot \log p(x) \: dx$ The derivative, usually referred to as the $\it functional \: derivative$ , is the idea that the value of the $functional$ updates in response to infinitesimal changes to the input function. Logical thinking suggests that if we were to search the input space for all functions, might we discover a set of functions that maximize (or minimize) the functional. By adopting this viewpoint, we've modified and re-framed this idea as an optimization problem, whereby the quantity being optimized is the functional. Then when thinking about the meaning of "variational", it can be regarded to be the refinement of something. And relating back to the topic of variational inference once more, we can think of the method as restricting the set of functions over which the optimization is performed. To the aforementioned examples, a variational autoencoder (VAE) optimizes for a set of functions in the latent space. Variational bayesian methods optimizes the values of distributional parameters and hyperparameters of a bayesian model. In both cases, this is traditionally performed using the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO). The following excerpts are taken from my book on variational inference.
