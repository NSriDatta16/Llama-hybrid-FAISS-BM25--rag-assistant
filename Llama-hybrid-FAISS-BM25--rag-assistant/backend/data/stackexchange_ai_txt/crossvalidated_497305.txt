Measures of correlation / influence for predictors with bounded outcome

I'm doing a systematic review of epidemic models that project "the % reduction in incidence ( $Y$ ) after K years" given a particular simulated intervention. The models include various assumptions ( $X$ ), and I'm trying to determine which assumptions have the largest influence on projected $Y$ . For simplicity we can assume all assumptions $X$ are binary variables. My first thought was to use partial correlation coefficients based on linear regression $Y = BX$ , but the outcome is bounded on 0-100%. Then, I thought maybe logistic regression, but that seems wrong since $Y$ is not binary. So, what would be an appropriate measure of correlation / influence for predictor variables $X$ on a continuous but bounded outcome $Y$ ? Thanks in advance!
