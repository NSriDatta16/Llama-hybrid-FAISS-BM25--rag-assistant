I have no idea how to do it in the YAML but you can just remove the the definition of the ID column from the generated PHP (Base) file. Not the most "elegant" solution but I think Doctrine's convetnion is to always add a Primary Key. BTW, is there anything usefull for you at http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/component-overview/en#views ?
