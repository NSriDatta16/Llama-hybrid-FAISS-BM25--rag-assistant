Time-series regression

Suppose that a typical firm determines its level of stocks $H_t$, in accordance with the following rule: $H_t - H_{t-1} = \lambda (H^*_t - H_{t-1}) + \epsilon _t$ where $\epsilon _t$ is a serially uncorrelated disturbance term with mean zero and constant variance $\sigma^2$. $H^*_t$, the desired level of stocks, is given by the exact linear relationship $H^*_t = \phi S_t$, where St is the current level of sales. Derive an expression for $H_t$ in terms of current and past values of $S_t$, and discuss briefly how you would estimate the parameters $\phi$ and $\lambda$ given time series data on stocks and sales. I have substituted $H^*_t$ but this only gives me an expression with current value of sales. I am not sure how to proceed with this and then estimate?
