BEST approach to share messages between data tier and application tier

I was looking for any suggestion or a good approach to handle messages between the data & application tier, what i mean with this is when using store procedures or even using direct SQL statements in the application, there should be a way the data tier notifies upper layers about statement/operation results in at least an organized way. What i commonly use is two variables in every store procedure: @code INT, @message VARCHAR(1024) I put the DML statements inside a TRY CATCH block and at the end of the try block, set both variables to certain status meaning everything went ok, as you might be thinking i do the opposite on the catch block, set both variables to some failure code if needed perform some error handling. After the TRY CATCH block i return the result using a record: SELECT @code AS code, @message AS message These two variables are used in upper tiers for validation purposes as sending messages to the user, also for committing o rolling back transactions. Perhaps i'm missing important features like RAISERROR or not cosidering better and more optimal and secure approaches. I would appreciate your advices and good practices, not asking for cooks recipes there's no need, just the idea but if you decide to include examples they'd be more than welcome. Thanks
