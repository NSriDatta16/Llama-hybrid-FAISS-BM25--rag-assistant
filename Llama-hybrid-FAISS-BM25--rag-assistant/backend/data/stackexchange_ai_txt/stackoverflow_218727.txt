Not exactly elegant, but the best (and quickest) solution i could find was using OnError. This will be significantly faster than iteration for any medium to large collection. Public Function InCollection(col As Collection, key As String) As Boolean Dim var As Variant Dim errNumber As Long InCollection = False Set var = Nothing Err.Clear On Error Resume Next var = col.Item(key) errNumber = CLng(Err.Number) On Error GoTo 0 '5 is not in, 0 and 438 represent incollection If errNumber = 5 Then ' it is 5 if not in collection InCollection = False Else InCollection = True End If End Function
