It has to do with how you create your vertices and edges in JUNG. For a headstart, I suggest you to refer to createVertices() and createEdges() methods in the JUNG example WorldMapGraphDemo.class in edu.uci.ics.jung.samples package under the jung-samples-2.0.1.jar from your JUNG 2.0 Framework library. The approach used in the methods are clearer compared to other provided examples where it uses the Map objects to store user-defined vertices and edges information. The rest uses random-generated, library-generated or file-generated information. Once it is clear to you, you can refer to PluggableRendererDemo.class to improve your graph (like decorating Transformer and Renderer classes under respective packages edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.decorators and edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.renderers for decorating and rendering vertex, edge, direction arrow, shape, size, etc.)
