I would discourage you from doing that. No matter it is a pre-filled-database-purpose app, or a normal-purpose app, Apple Review Team would treat them with the same procedure, leaving the developer waiting for weeks before that app is finally available on App Store. Besides, as far as I know, communication between apps is still strictly limited. If the data you would like to transfer between your main app and your db app is larger than a few lines of, let's say, NSString, it might be technically un-plausible.
