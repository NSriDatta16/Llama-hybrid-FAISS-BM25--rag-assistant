how I can report the result of binary logistic regression?

We are conducting research to examine a relationship between some triggers and migraine with aura. therefore, we conduct logistic regression for the significant relationships to know the adjusted odd ratio. (odd ratio of diagnosed/undiagnosed) however, the odd ratio is less than 1 so should I report the result as (it is less likely to the patient who is diagnosed to have migraine with aura when he eats hotdog)? or am I misunderstanding the interpretation? second question: how I can report this result thank you so much
