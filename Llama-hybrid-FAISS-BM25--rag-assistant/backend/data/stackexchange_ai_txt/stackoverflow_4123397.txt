Drilldown in Jquery datatable

Is it possible to have drill-down facility in Jquery datatable? For example, I want to show the output like below. Organization Code +Org1 O1 on expanding of Org1, It should display, -Org1 +Department1 D1 When we expand Department1, it should display +EmployeeName1 Emp1 like this.... Any other solutions apart from Jquery datatable like gridview will also be recommended.
