To setup the unit tests I created a configuration file for phpunit (phpunit.xml) and a TestHelper.php in the test directory. The configuration basically says to phpunit which unit test needs to be executed and wich folders and files needs to be skipped in the coverage. In my config it just are all the unit test files in the application and library folder that are going to be executed. The Testhelper needs to be extended by all your unit tests. phpunit.xml ./application ./library ../application/ ../library/App/ ../application/ ../application/database ../application/models/Entities ../application/models/mapping ../application/models/proxy ../application/views ../application/Bootstrap.php ../application/modules/admin/controllers/ErrorController.php TestHelper.php bootstrap = array($application->getBootstrap(), 'bootstrap'); Zend_Session::$_unitTestEnabled = true; parent::setUp(); } public function tearDown() { /* Tear Down Routine */ } } This only covers the initial setup for ZF and PHPunit
