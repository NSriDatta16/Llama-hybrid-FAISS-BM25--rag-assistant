If the people can register for gaming only when the application is active, why to save this information to the database? Serving information from an url doesn't need to load it from the database. It could be a repository of different type (eg. memory). If you have only one application server it is just fine to store the people list in shared memory object, for a application farm different rules may apply - depending of your configuration and session storage used.
