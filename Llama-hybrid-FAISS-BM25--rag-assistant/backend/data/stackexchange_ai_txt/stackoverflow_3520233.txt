How would you plan for merging multiple branches?

I've recently joined a team with a code base which hasn't been under version control. The code has been forked several times by different people in the organisation working on different projects. Now we're going to start using version control and we want to merge the valuable contributions from the different projects. The projects share a common original version, so I've made one branch for each project and plan to start merging. Now I'm wondering what strategy to use when merging. How would you choose the branch to start merging? The one with the least scary changes? The one with the most scary? Would you synchronize all branches with trunk after merging one of the projects into trunk? Is there a best practice to follow when working with many branches that have diverged a lot? Or should I just stop worrying and start merging them one by one?
