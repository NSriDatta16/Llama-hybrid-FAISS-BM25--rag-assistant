WPF using ResizeGrip to resize controls

I want that the user can resize a control by draging a resize-grip on the lower right border. With the ResizeGrip there seems to exists the perfect control for achieving this, but I don't see what is the plan to use this control. It does not derive from Thumb (however in msdn is written that it is an "implementation" of it), and does also not support the routed events of Thumb . What is it correct usage of the ResizeGrip-control. Update: I've played around with ResizeGrip and I have experienced a lot of weird problems using it. The most hard problem was that, using the ResizeGrip in a window that shows also a native ResizeGrip in the bottom right corner (ResizeMode="CanResizeWithGrip"), the window has begun to react really strange on mouse-input. In the end, I have disclaimed to use it. As a simple alternative, you can use the Thumb -control and attach it an appropriate Template.
