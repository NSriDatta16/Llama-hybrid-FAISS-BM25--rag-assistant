Unable to find Log Publisher for project on CCNET

I recently started a project and I'm currently trying to configure the ccnet.config file. The fact is I can't find out why CruiseControl can't find the log file. I guess it is something easy and I'm doing something wrong, after 4 days, I'm able to find a solution. I get the next error message in CCNET: ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CommunicationsException: Request processing has failed on the remote server: Unable to find Log Publisher for project so can't find log file at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CruiseServerClient.ValidateResponse(Response response) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CruiseServerClient.GetMostRecentBuildNames(String projectName, Int32 buildCount) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.ServerConnection.ServerAggregatingCruiseManagerWrapper.GetMostRecentBuildSpecifiers(IProjectSpecifier projectSpecifier, Int32 buildCount, String sessionToken) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.Plugins.ProjectReport.ProjectReportProjectPlugin.Execute(ICruiseRequest cruiseRequest) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.ServerCheckingProxyAction.Execute(ICruiseRequest cruiseRequest) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.ProjectCheckingProxyAction.Execute(ICruiseRequest cruiseRequest) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.CruiseActionProxyAction.Execute(IRequest request) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.ExceptionCatchingActionProxy.Execute(IRequest request) As i told you, i guess something's wrong with my config file, the one is as follows: http://localhost:80/ccnet/ C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Source\ C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Build\Log\ https://localhost/svn/Myproject.com/trunk E:\Repositories\Myproject.com C:\Program Files\VisualSVN Server\bin\svn.exe myusername mypassword 60000 mods.xml 0.1. true 000 C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Binaries\NAnt\bin\nant.exe C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Binaries\NAnt\ -D:svn.executable="C:\Program Files\VisualSVN Server\bin\svn.exe" false C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Source\Myproject.build SourceForge.NAnt.XmlLogger 1200 cruise C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Build C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Build true reports\devenv.log reports\*-nunit.xml reports\*-Coverage.xml My .sln file is located at "Source directory". I was searching but can't find anything about this. Also I'm using nant and svn as you can see.
