Yeah, permutation tests are very slow when having relatively big data. For this reason, the question you've cited answers that boostrapping is an alternative to the permutation test. If you want to do a permutation test, there's code for it in that question. However, some practitioners think that doing cross-validation is a better way to compare models. This paper discusses frequentist and bayesian approaches to model comparison via cross-validation. The main idea is, I compute the cross-validation AUC for my model for 10 different folds. Then I have the AUC of 10 samples for model 1 and the AUC of 10 samples for model 2. Then I perform a test to compare these AUC scores (it can be a permutation test or a t-test).
