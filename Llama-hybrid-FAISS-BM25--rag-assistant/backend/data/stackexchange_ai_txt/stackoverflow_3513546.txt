You've got more backflip potential in the view than the template. So, while it's an inelegant solution, I'd suggest querying the through model in the view directly and then using what you get back to temporarily annotate the items in the rows of your joblist appropriately so that you can definitely, cleanly, do row.foo.bar or item.baz.boof, etc, then pass that manually annotated set of results into the template.
