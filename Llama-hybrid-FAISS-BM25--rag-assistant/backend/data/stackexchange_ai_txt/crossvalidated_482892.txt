Following whuber's suggestion, let's look at a simple example. Say we need to catch 2 fish and we are given 4 days. To begin we denote the two fish we have on day two $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and the minimum denoted by $x$ . On the third day, I release the smallest fish and re-catch if the following holds \begin{align} (1-x^2)\frac{1+x}{2}+x^2\frac{x}{2}-x>0, \end{align} where $1-x^2$ is the probability that in the remaining days I can catch a bigger fish than my current minimum, and $x^2$ is the probability that in the remaining days I will not catch a bigger fish than my current minimum. $(1+x)/2$ and $x/2$ are the conditional expectations in the two cases. The $-x$ is the fish I have to give up in order to re-catch. Solve this inequality on day three, we will release and re-catch if the minimum of the two fish we have on the second day is less than $0.6183$ . Now let's turn to the fourth day. Similarly we have \begin{align} (1-x)\frac{1+x}{2}+x\frac{x}{2}-x>0, \end{align} solving this we will release and re-catch if the minimum of the two fish we have on the third day is less than $0.5$ . This makes sense since we this is our last chance to catch a fish. Under this strategy we notice if the release and re-catch condition is not met on day $k$ , it will not be met on day $k+1$ . this formulation does not depend on the total number fish required, but only depend on the number of days left, and $x$ , the current minimum of course. In general we should release and re-catch if \begin{align} (1-x^k)\frac{1+x}{2}+x^k\frac{x}{2}-x>0, \end{align} where $k$ is the number of days left. So if there are 10 days, we should release and re-catch on the third days if the minimum from the first two days is less than $0.81$ . Following this strategy, what's the expected sum of our fish on the last day? I haven't quite figure it out. Let's come back to the simple example (2 fish, 4 days). On the second day, the expected minimum is $1/3$ , and we will need $1.5$ catches on average to catch a fish bigger than $1/3$ . So If I round it up to $2$ catches, then on the final day, the expected sum would be $4/3$ ... These are very rough ideas.
