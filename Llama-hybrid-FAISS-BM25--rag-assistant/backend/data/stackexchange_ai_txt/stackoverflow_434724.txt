Organizing files of a website powered by PHP, Smarty, JavaScript, MySQL

I am writing an web application powered by PHP, Smarty, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL. There will be some classes, which will be used through out the application. There will be some scripts which will use those classes. Any good article, tutorial, architecture on how to organize files for a web site? P.S. It should contain how to organize all the files (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, template files.)
