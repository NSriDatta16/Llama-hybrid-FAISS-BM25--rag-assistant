Understanding Differences of Mean between Two Groups

I have a variable test score that is measured for an organization consisting of 2050 people. The goal is to test if men outperform women (or vice versa). Unfortunately, only 50 of the 2050 people are women. I was told that in order to run inference when there is such a disproportion of one group within a sample that I should pursue some sort of matching strategy. First, is this true, that if I match on a few characteristics that I can run inference (e.g., ordinary least squares, linear probability models) and be less worried about the fact that there are so few females--since many males will drop out? Second, is there anything I can do to compare the groups before the match even as an anecdote? This is the data: Test Score Test Score N Mean Variance Coef. Var. Gender 2000 26.12 10.89 0.13 Male 50 56.10 25.01 0.09 Female
