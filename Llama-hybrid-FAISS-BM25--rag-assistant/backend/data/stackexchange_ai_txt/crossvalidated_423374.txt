Posterior with a much larger uncertainty than the prior

I have done an MCMC analysis with many variables. One of my nuisance parameters has a Normal prior distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The posterior distribution for this parameter has mean 0 and standard deviation 10. Is there any conflict here? I would think this is an ordinary possible outcome but I have doubts from people who are looking at my results.
