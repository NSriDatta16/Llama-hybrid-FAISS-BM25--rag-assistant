No, this is not enough information to know the average account balance of each member. Consider trying to determine the average account balance over the past year of a customer who has a single transaction, which was a \$100 deposit 6 months ago. If their initial balance was \$0, then their average account balance over the past year was \$50. If their initial balance was \$100, then their average account balance over the past year was \$150. If you don't know the initial balance, you can't really hope to accurately estimate the average balance from transactional data. The best you can do is to lower bound it (in our simple example, they can't have started this year with a negative balance, so their balance for the year was no less than \$50).
