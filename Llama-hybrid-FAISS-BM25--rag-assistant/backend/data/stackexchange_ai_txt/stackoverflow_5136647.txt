Modularizing CSS files

Many people say to keep the number of external CSS and JavaScript files to minimum to reduce round trip time. For example, Google recommends maximum two CSS and JavaScript files per web site, respectively. The problem is, I've broken up CSS code into several files depending on its nature as part of "modularization". For example, I've put CSS code that is only used in a certain part of the application in a separate file. As a result, some files have less than a hundred lines of code. I'm a Java develper, and this is actually a recommended practice in Java, but CSS is a totally different creature and I don't know much about CSS. Here are my questions. Does it make sense to keep as many CSS files as you see fit for readability and maintainability? How many CSS files are manageable in a web project? What's the average number of CSS files in web applications that you've worked on in the past?
