This is often based on human factors rather than objective technical reasoning. 64-bit is the latest and greatest and must be better than 32-bit. If customers want it the customer is always right. Have spoke with windows users saying their goal was to make it such that when they view their process list in windows *32 does not appear next to any of their apps. Often times this is also fueled by confusion on the point of compatibility where people have 64-bit operating systems and just want to make sure the software will work on their computers. Expecting average people to understand the technical demarcation line between 32-bit processes on a 64-bit OS is unrealistic. Unless explicitly stated on the packaging it can be a point of confusion/concern for a customer purchasing new software. Often times you will see 64-bit mentioned for this reason. Typically this really means only 64-bit compatibility. Now there are a few 64-bit applications (flash player and google earth top my list) that can't come soon enough.
