How to detect heteroskedasticity for logit panel regression in Stata?

I am currently conducting research with binary logistic regression of panel data. For now, I am planning to conduct the specification test with linktest , goodness of fit test (Hosmer & Lemeshows test) and multicollinearity test with collin in Stata. Is this correct? Second, how do I check for heteroskedasticity in panel logistic regression in Stata? Once found, how do I correct them?
