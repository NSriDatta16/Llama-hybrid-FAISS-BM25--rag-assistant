Determining whether a change in ranking is statistically significant

I have two populations, A (n=48) and B (n=19) . Both took a pre-test, after which B performed an intervention. Both A and B took a post-test which was not the same as the pre-test. It now appears that, while A were originally performing better than B, B is now performing better than A. I want to determine whether this change in performance is significant. I can do this by ranking the scores on each test (using RANK.AVG in Excel, which gives me a rank with an averaged rank for ties) and comparing the difference in the average ranking of each group. Here's what I found: Average pre-test rank A: 31.9 Average pre-test rank B: 39.7 Average post-test rank A: 34.8 Average post-test rank B: 32.1 This indicates to me that: Average rank change A: -2.8 Average rank change B: +7.7 I take this to mean that, possibly due to the intervention, B have gone up in the rankings across the population (on average) while A have dropped. Is there any better way to be investigating this? How can I tell if this change in ranking is significant?
