Something like: SELECT t1.AccountId, t1.ReferenceId, COUNT(t2.AccountId) FROM Table1 t1 LEFT JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.AccountId = t2.AccountId AND t1.ReferenceId = t2.ReferenceId GROUP BY t1.AccountId, t1.ReferenceId should work. The trick is to group by both key values so you can aggregate over other values. In this case you want to simply count values from other rows (you could also sum or average values from the grouped-by rows.).
