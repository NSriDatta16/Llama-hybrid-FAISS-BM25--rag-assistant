Sharing constants across languages

I have a long list of constants that I need access to in several projects which are in different languages(Verilog, C, C++ and C#). Rather than repeating them in each language, is there a good way to share these? The only thing I could think of would be a text file and a preprocessing script? Is this the best solution or is there something easier/more elegant?
