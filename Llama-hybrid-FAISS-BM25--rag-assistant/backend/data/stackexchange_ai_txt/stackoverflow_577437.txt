does this pattern make sense Not much. Can you elaborate? You create friendship typically among different classes. This is syntactically valid. Why would Peer be a friend of Peer? Private functions can only be used by member functions. Calling them from client code is wrong. As to the question if friendship breaks encapsulation or not, have a look at the FAQ . Sorry Robert, misread the names.
