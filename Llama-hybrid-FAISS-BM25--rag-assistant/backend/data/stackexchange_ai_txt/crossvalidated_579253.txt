Documentation for cor.test in R says "By default, probabilities for method="spearman" and method="kendall" are found by normal theory. If normal=="FALSE", then repetitive calls are made to cor.test. ..." What attention have you given to normality of data based on "(number of characters, number of cuts, IMDB rating etc.)"? From what is said in your Question and in some of the Comments, I would wonder which P-values should be taken seriously which should not.
