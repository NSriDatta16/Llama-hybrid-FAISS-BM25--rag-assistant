What toolbox to use to create multi-output random forest(reggression) with custom spltting function at each node?

I am trying to implement "Real Time Head Pose Estimation fromConsumer Depth Cameras" by Fanelli et al. I need to train a random forest(regression) with the following criterion The predicted output is multivariate(yaw,pitch). The input features is four dimensional float type. The split function at each node is a custom function which needs to be computed at run-time using one of the features that has been randomly selected. The custom function needs to evaluated using a separate user created code snippet which might then be used by the random forest code. My question is what random forest software frame work would support custom split functions and random feature selection for evaluating the custom function. I have checked random forest implementations of scikit-learn, opencv, weka to begin with, but found that they don't satisfy my constraints
