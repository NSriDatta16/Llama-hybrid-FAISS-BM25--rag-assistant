Q1: How many points? All of them. The best way, is to fit a model to the data. If the model is a good one, i.e., if an accurate $T(t)$ can be found, where $T$ is the temperature as a function of $t$ time, then the problem is solved, just choose a $t$, and $T$ is predicted. In a temperature time series this may require one or more delay terms in the auto regressive integrated moving average, ARIMA , sense. However, in general, use of a model is superior to taking averages. Q2: What about outliers? True outliers are rare. If needed outlier testing can be performed. More frequently, when the data is not normally distributed on the $T$-axis, a transformation of variables may be needed to make conditions more normal, among other examples using $\ln(T)$, or using $\dfrac{1}{T}$ or using $\sqrt{T}$ instead of plain old $T$ for the regression equation target.
