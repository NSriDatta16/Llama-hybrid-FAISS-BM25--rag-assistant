Machine learning: use benchmark as a feature

The project I am doing is to predict surgery lengths. The benchmark I am trying to compare is to take the average of most recent 20 cases for the cases with the same ID. What I tested is to use this benchmark as a feature together with some other features like surgeon name, surgery difficulty level, etc. I thought most likely it will outperform the benchmark since it has benchmark as a feature with some addition information. However, both linear regression and tree-based algorithms failed in my case (the MAE is slightly worse). An example is: Let's assume we have 3 types of surgeries with IDs X, Y and Z. One way to predict the lengths for future surgeries is to take the average of most recent 20 actual lengths of X, denoted as $\bar X$ and use $\bar X$ to predict a future case X. Similarly for Y and Z cases. Now I want to build a new ML model to beat the benchmark $\bar X$ . My thought is to use $\bar X$ as a feature, combined with some other features like surgeon name, surgery difficulty level, etc to build a regression problem. I assume this model will at least outperform $\bar X$ since we have addition information (features) besides $\bar X$ . Is my thought "using the benchmark as a feature will most likely outperform the benchmark" correct? If so, any theory to explain why it failed. Some high-level ideas would be very helpful!
