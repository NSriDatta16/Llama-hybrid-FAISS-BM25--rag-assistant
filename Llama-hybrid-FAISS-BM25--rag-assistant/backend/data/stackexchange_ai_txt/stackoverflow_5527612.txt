I thought long on this matter and went with ProtocolBuffer to store metadata for my images. For each image e.g. Image00012.jpg, I store the metadata in Image00012.jpg.pbmd. Once I have my .proto file setup, the Python class and C++ class got auto-generated. It works very well and require me to spend little time on parsing (clearly better than writing custom reader for YAML files). RestRisiko brings up a good point about how I should handle metadata not available. The good thing about ProtocolBuffer is it supports optional/required fields. This solves my problem on this front. The reason I think XML and INI are not good for this purpose is because many of my metadata are complex (color distribution, ...) and require a bit of storage customization. ProtocolBuffer allows me to nest proto declaration. Plus, the size of the metadata file and the parsing speed is clearly superior to my hand-roll XML reading/writing.
