@Community brought this question from the past. Unfortunately the both answers from 2014 do not answer the question. The answer to the question is in @StephanKolassa comment: there are is no meaningful concept of coefficient for RF (except the importance measure of RF). I also must add that I found @MichaelMayer comment that "random forests are not very useful in combining strong learners such as regression trees" very surprising. In my very limited experience with regression, RF is always a competitive algorithm (together with MLP) - I have not yet used GBM or Gaussian Processes for regression.
