I would also suggest to use a plain servlet and would consider Robert Munteanu's answer as right, but you could do this in your JSP also. The Problem isn't the added whitespace, but that the implicit variable "out" is a instance of JSPWriter and a Writer is for characters, not for bytes. Try to use response.getOutputStream() and right on it, that should work. You will get an Exception saying someone else already got the OutputStream, but you can ignore it. But as I said, using a Servlet would be much cleaner.
