I think semi-supervised methods may be what you are looking for, there is quite a lot of litterature on this in Machine learning. There is a good book on this topic, which gives a good idea of recent developments in this area. An E.M.-like algorithm for logistic regression (a discriminative model) is easily implemented as follows: (i) Train a LR model using only the labelled data. (ii) Use the LR model to assign labels to the unlabelled data. (iii) Train a new LR model using both the labelled and unlabelled data (using the predicted labels). (iv) repeat (ii) and (iii) until convergence is reached (i.e. none of the predicted labels for the unlabelled examples change). This works quite well for some problems (e.g. text classification), not so well in others. EM also works well with naieve Bayes. McLachlan's excellent book on discriminant analysis also has some material on basic algorithms. HTH
