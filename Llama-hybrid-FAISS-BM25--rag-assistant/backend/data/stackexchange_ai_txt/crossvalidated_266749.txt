MCMC convergence

I'm trying to fit a Bayesian model. This model has many parameters (about 150). I run MCMC (10000 iters) with a thinning period to avoid correlation problem and with the hope it would save me some time in terms of computation. So I obtain the sample that let me to compute Monte Carlo estimates. I knew that a proper inference implies checking for MCMC convergence. I perform this task with a graphic assessment (I know that there are more formal approaches, this is a first attempt) with trace plot. I realised that there are few parameters that doesn't show at all any convergence. What does It mean? When I try to see what the effective sample size was, I obtain for these parameters very low values (like 6) and this is a sign of correlated samples. I don't know how to go on. UPDATE: This is my model in BUGS. it's a dirichlet regression, with response variable y made up with 4 categories( so K=4). i'm applying this to a dataset related to violent crime in state of usa usa. So my thought was to use a parameter beta for each observation i( the states in usa) Example of data: state violent_crime murder rape robbery aggravated_assault median_income 1 Alabama 20727 276 2005 4701 13745 42917 2 alaska 4684 41 771 629 3243 70898 Model: model { for (i in 1:n) { beta1[i,1:K]~dmnorm(zero[],t[1:K,1:K]) Y[i,1:K] ~ddirich(alpha[i,1:K]) for ( k in 1:4) { xb[i,k]
