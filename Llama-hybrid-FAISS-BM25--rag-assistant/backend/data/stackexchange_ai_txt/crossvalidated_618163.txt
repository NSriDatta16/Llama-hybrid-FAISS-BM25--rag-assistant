One useful way of accomplishing this could be to implement a Bayesian Switchpoint Analysis model using the tensorflow_probability library - which builds on work already done using pymc3. The relevant documentation is available here: Bayesian Switchpoint Analysis In the provided example, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method (a type of Markov chain Monte Carlo method) is being used to generate posterior distributions for the series both before and after the switchpoint. By a posterior distribution, we mean a distribution that is based on an updating of the prior probability after gathering data relevant to the problem at hand. The algorithm can detect whether the mean, variance or periodicity changed significantly at a particular point by creating a posterior distribution for the data before and after the switchpoint - this is done by generating many random samples that account for uncertainty in the posterior distribution. By detecting differences between these distributions, the switchpoint can be more accurately identified.
