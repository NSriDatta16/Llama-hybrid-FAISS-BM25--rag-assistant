Let's just extract the statistical problem at hand. You have $X_1, \dots X_n$ from some distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Consider $Y_i = \log X_i$, where the mean of $Y$ is $\mu_y$ and variance is $\sigma^2_y$. Consider the average of $Y$s: $\bar{Y}_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i/n$. Then due to the CLT, $$ \sqrt{n} (\bar{Y}_n - \mu_y) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2_y)\,.$$ Now consider $e^{\bar{Y}_n}$. \begin{align*} e^{\bar{Y}_n} & = \exp\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{n} \log Y_i \right\}\\ & = \exp\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log Y_i^{1/n} \right\}\\ & = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\exp\left\{ \log Y_i^{1/n}\right\}\\ & = \prod_{i=1}^{n} Y_i^{1/n}\,. \end{align*} Thus, $ e^{\bar{Y}}$ is the geometric mean! So next, we can apply the Delta method to the CLT method. Define $g(x) = e^{x}$, then $g'(x) = e^x$. By the Delta method $$\sqrt{n}(e^{\bar{Y}_n} - e^{\mu_y}) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, e^{2\mu_y}\sigma^2_y).$$ So now you have a tool to make your confidence intervals from. $e^{\mu_y}$ is your true geometric mean, and you want to make a confidence interval for this (this is not a confidence interval for the expected value $\mu$). The first step is estimate $\sigma^2_y$. Since $\sigma^2_y$ is the variance of the $Y$s, $$ s^2_y:= \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \bar{Y}_n)^2 = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\log X_i - \log e^{\bar{Y}_n})^2 = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \left( \dfrac{X_i}{e^{\bar{Y}_n}} \right)\,.$$ To make your $100(1 - \alpha)$% confidence interval for the true geometric mean: $$e^{\bar{Y}_n} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\dfrac{e^{\bar{Y}_n} s_y}{\sqrt{n}}\,.$$
