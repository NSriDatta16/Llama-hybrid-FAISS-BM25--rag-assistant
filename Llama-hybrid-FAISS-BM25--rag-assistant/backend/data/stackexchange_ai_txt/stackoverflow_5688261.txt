sed -e 's/,,/,unknown,/g' will work except if you want to add unknown at the beginning or end of lines too. If you also want to add something if the first is missing (line starts with , ) or the last one is missing (line ends with , ), then you could do: sed -e 's/^,/unknown,/' -e 's/,,/,unknown,/g' -e 's/,$/,unknown/' I'm sure there is a more elegant way, but that works.
