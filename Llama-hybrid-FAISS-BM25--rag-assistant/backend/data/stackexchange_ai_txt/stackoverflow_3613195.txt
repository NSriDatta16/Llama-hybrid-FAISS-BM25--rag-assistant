Using a Python dict is probably the most elegant choice. If you put your keys in a list as such: keys = ("done", "rema", "succ" ... ) somedict = dict(zip(keys, [int(v) for v in values])) That would work. :-) Looks better than 30 lines too :-) EDIT: I think there are dict comphrensions now, so that may look even better too! :-) EDIT Part 2: Also, for the keys collection, you'd want to break that into multpile lines. EDIT Again: fixed buggy part :)
