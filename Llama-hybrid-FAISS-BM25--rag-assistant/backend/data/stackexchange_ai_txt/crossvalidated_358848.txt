No. A hidden markov model is a graphical model - or a bivariate stochastic process - and a markov chain is a stochastic process. They lack many of the properties that a typical RNN would have -- ability to train via backpropagation and ability to model non-markovian processes. A "node" in a hidden markov model is a random variable, while a node in an RNN has no such meaning. Just about the only way they are related is their ability to model sequential data.
