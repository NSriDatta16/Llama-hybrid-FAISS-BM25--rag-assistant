Unfortunately, the Kalman filter methodology is a fairly advanced topic in econometrics, hence it is quite difficult to find simple examples, both because it is a complex topic that requires a deeper knowledge of the maths behind it, and because it is easier to make tutorials of simple things. However, here you can find a quite simple example by Maitra, "State Space Model and Kalman Filter for Prediction" in R on Kalman filter for DLM, that is a generalization of ARIMA with external regressors. Nevertheless, since you are interested in time series forecasting and estimation, I suggest you to look at the forecast package in R by Professor Rob J. Hyndman (there should also be a Python version), that allows to estimate various time series models in state-space forms, and maybe the book "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.
