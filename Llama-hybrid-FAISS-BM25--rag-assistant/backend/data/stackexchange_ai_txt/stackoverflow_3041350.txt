USB includes a set of stock functionality, much like supporting USB flash drives (USB Mass Storage class). The two most interesting for microcontroller interfacing are HID and CDC. CDC is easiest to use as it directly emulates an old fashioned serial port. If you configure the microcontroller to act as a CDC device, Windows will enumerate it as a serial port, and all the old serial APIs will work on it.
