PHP does not natively support error catching like Python does, unless you override the default behavior and set your own error handler . PHP's try - catch was only recently added to the language in version 5, and it can only catch exceptions you explicitly throw . So basically, PHP distinguishes between errors and exceptions. Errors haven't been modularized and made available to the user like they have been in Python. I believe that's related to the fact that PHP began as a collection of dynamic web scripts , grew and gained more features over time, and only more recently offered improved OOP support (i.e., version 5); whereas Python fundamentally supports OOP and other meta-functionality. And exception handling from the beginning . Here's an example usage (again, a throw is necessary, or else nothing will be caught): function oops($a) { if (!$a) { throw new Exception('empty variable'); } return "oops, $a"; } try { print oops($b); } catch (Exception $e) { print "Error occurred: " . $e->getMessage(); }
