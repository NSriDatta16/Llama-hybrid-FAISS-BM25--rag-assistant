I would strongly recommend tying that data together, possibly as a Pair, but more as a specific container. That way you're at liberty to introduce extra functionality related to those two objects. Keeping the two lists separate is going to be a pain. You'll have to pass both around together and keep them in sync. The overhead of creating a new object for this is negligible, and precisely what OOP is designed for (you'll be creaing non-JDK classes just by writing new Java code for your application, don't forget). I create minor classes like this all the time. They enforce strong type safety and provide the scope for enhancement and refactoring. IDEs can more readily identify and perform refactorings.
