Power-law distribution for scale-free newtork

I am studying social network analysis for air travel, and now I am focusing my attention on the power law distribution, $P(k)=ck^{-r}$. I'm trying to estimate $r$ and $c$ with rstudio. [ r=2.913 & c=0.4377 ] The original file is here . Degree of node k [Degree] Frequency [Freq] Degree of Probability [Pk] Degree How I can estimate c and r?
