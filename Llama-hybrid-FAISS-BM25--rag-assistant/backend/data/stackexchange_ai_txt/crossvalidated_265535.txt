A proper random-effects model extension to the standard Mantel-Haenszel procedure is described by van Houwelingen, Zwinderman, and Stijnen (1993). In essence, one can think of the M-H procedure as a model based on the (non-central) hypergeometric distribution (Mantel & Haenszel, 1959). So, using this as the starting point, van Houwelingen and colleagues extend the method by adding a random effect to the model where the 2x2 tables are modeled by non-central hypergeometric distributions. See also Stijnen, Hamza, and Ozdemir (2010). The resulting model can also be thought of as a conditional mixed-effects logistic regression model. The equations get a bit messy, but we can write things pretty compactly if we let $L(\theta_i|a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i)$ denote the likelihood function of a non-central hypergeometric distribution for the $i$th study, where $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ are the 2x2 table counts and $\theta_i$ is the true log odds ratio (see wikipedia for the pmf of the non-central hypergeometric distribution). Now let $f(\theta_i)$ denote the density of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\tau^2$. So the log-likelihood for the random-effects model is given by $$ll = \sum_{i=1}^k \ln \left[\int_{-\infty}^\infty L(\theta_i|a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i) f(\theta_i)d\theta_i\right].$$ There is no closed-form solution to the values of $\mu$ and $\tau^2$ that maximize $ll$, so those values must be obtained numerically.
