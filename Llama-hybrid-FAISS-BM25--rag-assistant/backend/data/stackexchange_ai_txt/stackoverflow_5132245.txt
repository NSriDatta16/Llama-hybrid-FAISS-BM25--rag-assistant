#pragma alloc_text(PAGE, functionname)

#pragma alloc_text(PAGE, foo) void foo() { } This code is usually used in device drivers. The foo function will be swapped whenever system needs. Questions. Does it work in user space code? Will the function be also paged? Without the pragma, I mean by default, are all kernel level functions allocated nonpaged memory? Does PE file loader decide where the functions are allocated?
