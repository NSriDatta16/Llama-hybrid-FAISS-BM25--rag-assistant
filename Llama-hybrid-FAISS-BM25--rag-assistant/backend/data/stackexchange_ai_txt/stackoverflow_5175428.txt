What tools are available to summarize changes to a MediaWiki?

We use a MediaWiki at work and to encourage more use, I want to set up a weekly summary email of recent changes to entries, but I couldn't find anything online. Are there existing tools available to collect the week's changes to a wiki and summarize them? I want to set up a script that collects, say, the top 5 edited pages, the bottom 5 edited pages, and maybe three random pages. The hope is people will see something new they didn't know about or update a page that may not be seeing much care.
