Using WCF programming model for general application development as well?

This may sound weird or funny but I need to ask this question for clarification. Basically I like the WCF programming model. So assuming I don't strictly have requirements for the 'service' based application, can I still go ahead and leverage the WCF infrastructure? I know technically it is possible, however I want to know if there is noticeable penalty in doing so. I know I can improve performance by using appropriate binding (say, NetNamedPipesBinding). So how can I take better care of performance and moreover, besides performance, what are other aspects I should be concerned about?
