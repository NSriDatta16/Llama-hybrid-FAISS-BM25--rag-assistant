Calling Overridden Constructor and Base Constructor in C#

I have two classes, Foo and Bar, that have constructors like this: class Foo { Foo() { // do some stuff } Foo(int arg) { // do some other stuff } } class Bar : Foo { Bar() : base() { // some third thing } } Now I want to introduce a constructor for Bar that takes an int, but I want the stuff that happens in Bar() to run as well as the stuff from Foo(int). Something like this: Bar(int arg) : Bar(), base(arg) { // some fourth thing } Is there any way to do this in C#? The best I have so far is putting the work done by Bar() into a function, that also gets called by Bar(int), but this is pretty inelegant.
