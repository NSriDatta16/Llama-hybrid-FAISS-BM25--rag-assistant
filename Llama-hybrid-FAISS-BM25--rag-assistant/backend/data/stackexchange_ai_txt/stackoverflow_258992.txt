I use myLifeOrganized . The bottom line is you just need to start documenting the next thing you have to do on each task. MLO lets you easily and quickly do that. It has a handy rapid task entry dialog and you can quickly enter data into it. You can document as much or as little as you want. This software, because of the ease of adding stuff to it, has saved my butt many times. It has helped me remember things that I had forgotten. I now wonder how many things I've forgotten over the years and didn't realize it. I run it off a usb stick and I have it on my phone. I even use it to help me outline code.
