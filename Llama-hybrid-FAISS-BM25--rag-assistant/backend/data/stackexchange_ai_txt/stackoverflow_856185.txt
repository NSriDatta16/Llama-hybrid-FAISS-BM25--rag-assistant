iPhone App: How to get data from an API, parse, and store for later use?

I'm new to iPhone app development so excuse me if I use the wrong terminology, or ask the wrong questions. Basically, I'm trying to write an App that includes downloading a dataset, saving it for later, and checking if the dataset has been updated, but I don't know where to begin. When I say dataset, I mean a multi-dimensional array of key/value pairs. I will be creating a site that my App will pull the data from. I think REST is the technology that it will be using (new to REST, too), being served up by a Zend Framework application, using MySQL as the back end database. So the data will be stored in a MySQL database, and I need to be able to download chunks, which I assume will be stored in my App's SQLite database, to be accessed later (when internet access is not present). At some point in my application's life cycle, I want to check if the dataset that I have downloaded is the most recent version. There are a lot of parts to this that I am still confused about. Can anyone please shed some light on any/all of the areas that I have touched upon. Is there any iPhone framework that I should be aware of that would make this process go faster/easier? Thanks! Update: Maybe I should break this up to make it easier to answer: I am assuming that my API will retrieve the data from the database and output the response as XML. Is this the best/only option? In my App, how can I make an API call? How can I parse the response (probably XML) from an API call and store it for later retrieval?
