Is performance an issue? If so, I wouldn't redo anything until I'd profiled the code under a wide variety of conditions and had some hard data in hand to tell me where time was being spent. You might be changing things that have no benefit at all. I'd be concerned about thread safety. How much attention was paid to that? If you're going to refactor, start by writing JUnit tests first. It'll help familiarize the code and provide you with a safety net. Tests must pass before and after your changes. Most importantly, don't undertake a big refactoring just because you consider it a mess. Your team and customer should be on board with what you're doing before you start. Have you communicated your (admittedly good) ideas to others? Software is a team sport; communication is key.
