No. For the average to be a sample of the distribution, it must belong to the support of the distribution. Below are two examples where that is not the case (which is sufficient to show that the statement is not true in general). Discrete The distribution p(x=1) = 0.5; p(x=-1) = 0.5 has support $$S=\{-1,1\}$$ but average $0\notin S$ . Continuous The density function $$p(x) = \frac{1}{2}rect(x-1) + \frac{1}{2}rect(x+1)$$ (two Rectangular functions centered at 1 and -1 respectively) has support $$S = ]-1.5,-0.5[\cap]0.5,1.5[$$ but average $0\notin S$ .
