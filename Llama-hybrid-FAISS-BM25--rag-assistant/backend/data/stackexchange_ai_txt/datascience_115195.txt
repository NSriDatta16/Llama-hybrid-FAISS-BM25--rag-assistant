Does word ordering affect monolingual alignment success

I spent some time reading about both Word2Vec embeddings and alignment between different embeddings (for instance vecmap ) and was wondering whether there is any significance to the word ordering of the different languages and how well the alignment can be made. I haven't found much research in this topic (found quite a bit regarding word ordering in other cross-lingual tasks) and was wondering if the typological feature actually has an effect. Have you seen any papers in the matter?
