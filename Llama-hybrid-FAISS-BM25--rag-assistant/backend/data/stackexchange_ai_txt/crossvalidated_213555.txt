Just so that this question has an answer, I'm going to try to summarize @whuber's comments here: Basically, because these chains are independent and have the same transition matrix $P$, I can just count the number of instances of each possible transition and get the MLE of $P$ from that. It doesn't matter that these counts come from different Markov chains.
