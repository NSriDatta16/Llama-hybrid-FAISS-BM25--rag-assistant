Organisation Details Recognition

I am trying to write a company's details parser that can split text like the following into it's constituent parts: THALES LAND AND JOINT SYSTEMS Total Signature Management Wookey Hole Road Wells Somerset BA5 1AA Tel: +44(0)1749 682384 Fax: +44 (0)1749 682235 The problem I am having is, how I can tell that "Total Signature Management" is not actually part of the address? Normally, a company will display its name "THALES LAND AND JOINT SYSTEM" and line 2 would normally be the first part of the address. In the case above, the company name is followed by a non address part, is there anyway to tell the difference? Thanks
