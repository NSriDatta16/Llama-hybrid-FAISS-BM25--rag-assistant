Are Fisher's linear discriminant and logistic regression related?

I have some experience with both FLD and LR for classification. On most data sets, I get very similar results, which raises the question - are FLD and LR related in some why? An idea, for example, if I assume a normal distribution on the likelihood function instead a of a logistic function, does the maximization come down to the FLD criteria? Please note that I'm asking about FLD and NOT LDA. Also, I'm looking for a mathematical way to show that FLD and LR are equivalent under some constraints. I had some ideas but nothing worked out. I'm sure it holds some way.
