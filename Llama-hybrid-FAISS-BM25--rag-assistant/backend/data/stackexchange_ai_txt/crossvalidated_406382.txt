Is there a PCA quality metric to compare data subsets?

I would like to see if on a subset of the data (selected by a range of a particular feature) 2-component PCA does particularly well. Is there a quality metric - apart from explained variance - which is independent of data size and insensitive to statistical effects of small sample fits ?
