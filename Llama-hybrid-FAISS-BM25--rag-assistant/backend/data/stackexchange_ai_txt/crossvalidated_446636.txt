Effect of Gamma and C on distant points in SVM

(I am aware of the following, already answered questions: this , and this ,as well as others, and IMHO they are not related) I am trying to precisely understand the behavior of SVM's with regards to the gamma hyperparameter. I came across this site in which there are two classes, a blue and a red. One can see that when C = 1, with gamma = 5, any point that is not in the close vicinity of a blue dot is considered red, (blue decides what is, and red takes the rest) but with gamma = 50, the tendency is reversed, and any point that is not in the close vicinity of a red dot is considered blue. (red decides what is red, blue takes the rest). When one fixes gamma to be 0.5 and varies C, one sees a similar pattern: for C =1 or C =100, red takes the "rest", but when C is 10000, then blue takes the "rest". Is there some deep insight that I am missing? Is this completely serendipitous? Is it possible to predict which class would take "the rest"? Can there be several back and forth between the two scenarios (i.e: for C = 20k, red goes back to "taking the rest", and for C=30k, it's blue again, etc.) or is there theoretically just one "flip" possible?
