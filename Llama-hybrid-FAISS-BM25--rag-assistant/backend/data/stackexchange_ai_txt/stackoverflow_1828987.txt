Apache mod-rewrite for shorter urls

Is it possible do do something like this with mod-rewrite? Current url: www.example.com/Departments/dynamicPage.php?DeptID=10&DeptName=HR to set up a rewrite so: www.example.com/hr could redirect to the above (with the arguments)? I know I could create an "hr" folder on the root level and put in an html page with a meta refresh, but I hate the extra clutter. I don't think a .htaccess 301 is possible, but please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm looking for an elegant solution that can be added to for future instances.
