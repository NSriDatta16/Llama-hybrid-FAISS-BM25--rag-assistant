How to refer to AIC model-averaged parameters and confidence intervals

I am writing up results from regression analysis where I used AICc model averaging to arrive at my final parameter estimates. I am wondering how best to refer to these parameters and their 95% confidence intervals. It seems like "significantly different" is taboo in the AIC world, but writing out "the parameter was x.x and its CI does not cross zero" seems much more laborious to me and the reader than saying "x.x was significantly different from zero." This seems like it might be an issue that would not come up if I had just selected the lowest AICc as my best model, which is what many folks do (against Burnham and Anderson repeatedly stating otherwise). Selecting the best model let's you say "the parameter is important b/c it is in the final model." Also, I'm wondering if there is an AIC model averaged equivalent to "marginally significant." I have parameters that have the predicted sign, indicate a fairly sizeable effect, but whose CI creeps over 0.0. Philosophically I like model averaging, and I also have many good models that often only differ by an extra covariate or an interaction. EDIT: This inquiry can probably be summarized by asking "In an AICc model averaging framework how does one interpret parameters whose confidence intervals span zero by only a small amount?"
