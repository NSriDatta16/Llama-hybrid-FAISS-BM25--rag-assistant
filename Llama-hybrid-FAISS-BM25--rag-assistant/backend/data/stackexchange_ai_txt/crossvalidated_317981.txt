So then wouldn't it follow that the only mathematically correct version of statistics is that which refuses to be anything but entirely agnostic with respect to Bayesianism and frequentism? If methods with both classifications are mathematically correct, then isn't it improper practice to prefer some over the others, because that would be prioritizing vague, ill-defined philosophy over precise, well-defined mathematics? No. It does not follow. Individuals who are unable to feel their emotions are biologically incapable of making decisions, including decisions that appear to have only one objective solution. The reason is that rational decision making depends upon our emotional capacity and our preferences both cognitive and emotional. While that is scary, it is the empirical reality. Gupta R, Koscik TR, Bechara A, Tranel D. The amygdala and decision making. Neuropsychologia. 2011;49(4):760-766. doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.029. A person who prefers apples to oranges cannot defend this as it is a preference. Conversely, a person who prefers oranges to apples cannot defend this rationally as it is a preference. People who prefer apples will often eat oranges because the cost of apples is too great compared to the cost of oranges. Much of the Bayesian and Frequentist debate, as well as the Likelihoodist and Frequentist debate, was centered around mistakes of understanding. Nonetheless, if we imagine that we have a person who is well trained in all methods, including minor or no longer used methods such as Carnapian probability or fiducial statistics, then it is only rational for them to prefer some tools over other tools. Rationality only depends upon preferences; the behavior depends upon preferences and costs. It may be the case that from a purely mathematical perspective that one tool is better than the other, where better is defined using some cost or utility function, but unless there is a unique answer where only one tool could work, then both the costs and the preferences are to be weighed. Consider the problem of a bookie considering offering a complex bet. Clearly, the bookie should use Bayesian methods in this case as they are coherent and have other nice properties, but also imagine that the bookie has a calculator only and not even a pencil and paper. It may be the case that the bookie, with the use of his calculator and by keeping track of things in his head can calculate the Frequentist solution and has no chance on Earth to calculate the Bayesian. If he is willing to take the risk of being "Dutch Booked," and also finds the potential cost small enough, then it is rational for him to offer bets using Frequentist methods. It is rational for you to be agnostic because your emotional preferences find that to be better for you. It is not rational for the field to be agnostic unless you believe that all people share your emotional and cognitive preferences, which we know is not the case. In short, I don't understand what the mathematical basis is for the Bayesian versus frequentist debate, and if there is no mathematical basis for the debate (which is what Wikipedia claims), I don't understand why it is tolerated at all in academic discourse. The purpose of academic debate is to bring light to both old and to new ideas. Much of the Bayesian versus Frequentist debate and the Likelihoodist versus Frequentist debate came from misunderstandings and sloppiness of thought. Some came from failing to call out preferences for what they are. A discussion of the virtues of an estimator being unbiased and noisy versus and estimator being biased and accurate is a discussion of emotional preferences, but until someone has it, it is quite likely that the thinking on it will remain muddy throughout the field. I don't like philosophy, but I do like math, and I want to work exclusively within the framework of Kolmogorov's axioms. Why? Because you prefer Kolmogorov's to Cox's, de Finetti's or Savage's? Is that preference sneaking in? Also, probability and statistics are not math, they use math. It is a branch of rhetoric. To understand why this may matter consider your statement: if a method is mathematically correct, then it is valid to use the method when the assumptions of the underlying mathematics hold, otherwise, if it is not mathematically correct or if the assumptions do not hold, then it is invalid to use it. This is not true. There is a nice article on confidence intervals and their abuse its citation is: Morey, Richard ; Hoekstra, Rink ; Rouder, Jeffrey ; Lee, Michael ; Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan, The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 2016, Vol.23(1), pp.103-123 If you read the different potential confidence intervals in the article, each one is mathematically valid, but if you then evaluate their properties, they differ very substantially. Indeed, some of the confidence intervals provided could be thought of as having "bad" properties, though they meet all of the assumptions in the problem. If you drop the Bayesian interval from the list and focus only on the four Frequentist intervals, then if you do a deeper analysis as to when the intervals are wide or narrow, or constant, then you will find that the intervals may not be "equal" though each meets the assumptions and requirements. It is not enough for it to be mathematically valid for it to be useful or, alternatively, as useful as possible. Likewise, it could be mathematically true, but harmful. In the article, there is an interval that is at its most narrow precisely when there is the least amount of information about the true location and widest when perfect knowledge or near perfect knowledge exists about the location of the parameter. Regardless, it meets the coverage requirements and satisfies the assumptions. Math can never be enough.
