whats the minimum number of time periods needed to get a rewasonable statistical power

I'm running multiple regression analysis with 3-7 indep. variables using macroeconomic indicator data from the World Bank. MOST of the World Bank data sets begin no earlier than 1990, which means my time series are at best 1990-2012=22 "observations". I understand measuring statistical power and have seen power tables for multiple regression, correlation, etc. a. do I just pretend my time series is like any other multiple regression when applying power analysis?[i.e. n=22] b. is a time series of only 22 "observation" periods automatically bad[I've seen repeated references to needing 30+ being the preferable number of periods; any source to explain this? Thanks
