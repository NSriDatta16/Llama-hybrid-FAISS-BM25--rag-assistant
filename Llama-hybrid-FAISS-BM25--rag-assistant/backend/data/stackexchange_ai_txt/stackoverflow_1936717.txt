Help with ASP.NET HttpWebRequest

I began to learn ASP.NET and C#, to get more familiar with techniques I want to make plugin for open source BugTracker.Net application. Where I am stacked is that for adding new issue application need to get HttpWebRequest on insert_bug.aspx I did make basic thing working on code like this: string Url = "http://localhost:8090/insert_bug.aspx"; string post_data = "&username=admin" + "&password=admin" + "&short_desc=Description" + "&comment=Comment" + "&projectid=1" byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(post_data); HttpWebResponse res = null; try { HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest) System.Net.WebRequest.Create(Url); req.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; req.PreAuthenticate = req.Method = "POST"; req.ContentType= "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; req.ContentLength=bytes.Length; Stream request_stream = req.GetRequestStream(); request_stream.Write(bytes,0,bytes.Length); request_stream.Close(); res = (HttpWebResponse) req.GetResponse(); } catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine("HttpWebRequest error url=" + Url); Console.WriteLine(e); } I want to insert also CATEGORY into my issues and reading code on insert_bug.aspx i fund part for defining category for opening issue if (Request["$CATEGORY$"] != null && Request["$CATEGORY$"] != "") { categoryid = Convert.ToInt32(Request["$CATEGORY$"]); } Question: What and How I can add "$CATEGORY$" to my request so the issues I added have defined category.
