I believe this is based on the assumption of normal errors. In econometrics, you operate using asymptotics, especially in the time series applications using AIC. As a consequence, the normal assumption should hold asymptotically to justify this (asymptotic) model selection scheme. Recall that the logarithm of the normal likelihood is $ln(L) = -(T/2)ln(2\pi) -(T/2)ln(\sigma^2) - (1/2\sigma^2)\sum(x_i - \mu) $, where we use $\mathbb{E}(X) = \mu$ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2$ if your data is drawn from X. In what follows we neglect the first term, as the observed sample $x_1, ..., x_T$ does not affect it. Simply use the more general (first) formula and plug in $L$ for the normal likelihood. The first term can be ignored (it is a constant regardless of regressor choice). The second term becomes $Tln(\sigma^2)$. The third term becomes $(1/\sigma^2)(T\hat{\sigma}^2)$, where we have used $\hat{\sigma}^2 = T^{-1} \sum(x_i - \bar{x})$. Again, not using a finite sample correction is justified here because this estimator is only valid asymptotically if the errors are not normal. Since we do not know $\sigma^2$, we have to estimate the third term as $(1/\sigma^2)(T\hat{\sigma}^2) = (1/\hat{\sigma}^2)(T\hat{\sigma}^2)$ = T. In summary, this means we get for the normal likelihood that $AIC = 2k + Tln(\sigma^2) + 1$. Needless to say, the minimization is not affected by ignoring the constant $1$. The term is now simply divided by $T$, since it does not change the minimization problem to scale all additive components by $T$. This lands you at the second result, because $AIC$ and $AIC/T$ are identical for the purpose of minimization.
