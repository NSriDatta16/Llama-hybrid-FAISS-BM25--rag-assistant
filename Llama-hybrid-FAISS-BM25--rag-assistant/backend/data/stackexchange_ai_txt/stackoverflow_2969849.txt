Adding a bias neuron to Encog network

I am porting some C code involving an artificial neural network to Java. I have decided to use the Encog framework . I would like my network to have a bias neuron (which uses weighted synapses and always outputs 1.0) connected to hidden layers and the output layer; they are marked with green in this graph . How can I create such a network programmatically? Should every bias neuron have its own layer? I have tried to instantiate a BasicLayer for every bias neuron, but this does not seem to have any effect even though the layer is connected via a WeightedSynapse . Thank you, Martin Wiboe
