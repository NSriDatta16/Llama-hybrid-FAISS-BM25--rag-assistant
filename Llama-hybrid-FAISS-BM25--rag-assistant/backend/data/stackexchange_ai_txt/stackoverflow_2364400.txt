SAN is a Storage Area Network topology incorporated into a physical network topology, it which means that storage is provided for sharing/storing data via the network (usually tcp/ip)...It is similar to NFS (Network File Share), or using the Microsoft specific Server Message Block protocol to designate a share on the server with a drive letter used - Universal Naming Convention where a shared drive is mapped to a drive letter in the form of '\\servername\foo'. Can you please clarify if that is what you are looking for? How to determine if a drive is mapped to the shared drive such as '\\servername\foo'? Have a look at this thread here...on mapping drives and disconnecting mapped drives here . And here to check if a path is on a network here . Edit: Thanks to zombiesheep for the clarification due to my confusion after being told by somebody else during my training for CompTIA Network+ 2009.....duh! Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
