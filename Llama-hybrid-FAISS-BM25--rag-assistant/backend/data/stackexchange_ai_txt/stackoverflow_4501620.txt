Wrapping text to the width of an image that isn't set

I will keep this simple. I have an image that is using the following css: .img-right { float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; } Then I have a caption that lives below the image which is the following css: .img-right p { margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 5px; font-size: 11px; color: #858d93; } I want to have the width of the paragraph tag to adjust to the size of the image I am using. The image(s) vary in width that use that class, so I was told the only way to achieve this is through jQuery. Can anyone assist with making this work? Thanks and Happy Holidays!
