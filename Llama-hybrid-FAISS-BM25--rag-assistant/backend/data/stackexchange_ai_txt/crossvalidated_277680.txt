I'm interested in this because I have a similar problem. However, if your goal is to compare the accuracy of SVM, Naive Bayes and Deep Learning, use a standard dataset that's already labelled. The other question you pose is why bother if the gold standard is semi-supervised learning. My answer would be that if the other methods are faster and-or easier and good (close) enough, I'd like to know that result and save myself the trouble.
