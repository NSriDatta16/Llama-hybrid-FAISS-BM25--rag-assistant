CONTENT is a keyword when defining an XML column with a schema. See here . Edit: The MSDN link is broken (per Champ's comment), so here is the relevant extract: Creating a typed XML column is as simple as adding the name of the schema inside parentheses, as you see here: CREATE TABLE Foo(FooID INT, someXml XML(CONTENT FooSchema)) This statement indicates that the someXml column must adhere to the XML Schema Collection named FooSchema . You can specify that the XML must be a document or that it can contain a fragment by including the appropriate keyword, DOCUMENT or CONTENT , respectively. If omitted, the default is CONTENT .
