The point of the odds ratio interpretation in logistic regression is that logistic regression is a linear model for the log odds of success. So a unit increase in an explanatory variable will result in increase or decrease of the predicted odds by a factor of $\exp(b)$, regardless of where on that explanatory variable you started or what the values of the other explanatory variables are (assuming you did not include interaction effects). You can ofcourse compute odds ratios by converting the predicted probabilities of a probit model to odds and compute the ratio, but these odds ratios will change depending on whether you compared $x=4$ with $x=5$ or $x=40$ with $x=41$, and on the values of the other explanatory variables. So that is much less useful as a summary measure of the effect.
