Incident duration prediction but online with trend

I am currently looking into some papers discussing Incident duration prediction . The dataset consists of ca. 250 monitored events. For all of those incidents are multiple features available and the main goal is the prediction of the incident duration . These durations are right-skewed and log-normal distributed. ANOVA test (and KS) identified 13 binary features to be independent. To predict the durations the researchers compared Multiple linear regression , DT , ANN , SVM / RVM and KNN . Currently, I am looking into a way to transfer the knowledge from this case to another task. Predicting the duration of incidents in an online system (online in the sense of continuous flow of information) and also accounting for trends (e.g. increasing duration of incidents because it is getting darker or colder at the same time throughout different seasons). Unfortunately, there is such a huge amount of methods besides the mentioned methods (non-parametric, hazard models, reliability models, etc) - it seems like a jungle
