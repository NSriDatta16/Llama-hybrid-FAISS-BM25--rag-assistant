Big endian was probably chosen because the majority of computers of that era (what, the late 1960's?) used it. How could they predict the popularity of the 80x86 family and its use of little endian so many years later? According to Wikipedia : An often-cited argument in favor of big-endian is that it is consistent with the ordering commonly used in natural languages.[9] Spoken languages have a wide variety of organizations of numbers: the decimal number 92 is/was spoken in English as ninety-two, in German and Dutch as two and ninety and in French as four-twenty-twelve with a similar system in Danish (two-and-four-and-a-half-times-twenty). However, numbers are written almost universally in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, in which the most significant digits are written first in languages written left-to-right, and last in languages written right-to-left.
