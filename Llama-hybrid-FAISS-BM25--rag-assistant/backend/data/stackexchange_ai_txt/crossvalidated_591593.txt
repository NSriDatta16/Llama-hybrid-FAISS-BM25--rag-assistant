There are plenty out there but here are some of my preferred ones: Robert C.P. (@Xi'an) and Casella G. Monte Carlo Statistical Methods , 2nd edition, Springer, 2010. Liu J.S. Monte Carlo Strategies in Scientific Computing , Springer, 2004. Another one that fills the bill, which stands up in my to-be-read book pile, is: Chopin N. and Papaspiliopoulos O. An Introduction to Sequential Monte Carlo , Springer, 2020.
