Confidence Interval for Proportion: Is my use case appropriate

Suppose I have 1,000,000 customers and exactly 25% of them use my new app. I would like to look at some customer segments and decide if there use of the app is significantly different from this proportion. I'd like to construct a 95% confidence interval. +----------------+------------+ | All Customers | 1000000 | +----------------+------------+ | Use App | 250000 | | Proportion | 0.25 | | Standard Error | 1.875E-07 | | 95% CI Lower | 0.24999963 | | 95% CI Upper | 0.25000037 | +----------------+------------+ The standard error was calculated as (p*(1-p))/n = (0.25*(1-0.25))/1000000 My questions: Assumption for the sampling distribution of p to be normally distributed is that it is a random sample of less than 10% of the population. Here I have the whole population, don't I? What should I do here? On page 275 of Open Intro Statistics (Chapter 6, Inference for Categorical Data) there's a box that states: TIP: Reminder on checking independence of observations. If data come from a simple random sample and consist of less than 10% of the population, then the independence assumption is reasonable. Alternatively, if the data come from a random process, we must evaluate the independence condition more carefully. If I would like to compare segments, e.g. customers with higher avg. spend or younger customers, would these segments be biased by there very nature and thus not comparable? i.e. If I found that their average proportion p was 26% and not 25% and thus outside the 95% confidence interval for all customers, can I say that these two example segments are significantly different or not?
