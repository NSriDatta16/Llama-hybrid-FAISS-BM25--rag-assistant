What's the problem with putting the definition (which also is a declaration) at the front and doing away with the "forward declaration"? static int bigIntArray[5000] = { 0x00, 0x9900, 0xffee, ...}; /* other code using bitIntArray */ Some people say the reason is "readability". The original poster didn't mention that as a motivation. Anyway, I don't think that doing "odd" things justifies "readability". I think creating a new file type (eg, "*.def" below), is odd. It doesn't seem to matter much (to me at least) where things are defined. The cleanest, clearest. simplest thing to do is to move the definition to the top (and not be too concerned about "readability"). Other people say use "extern". The problem with that is that it opens the scope (potentially) of the object name beyond the one module. It's also possible that the original poster doesn't realize that, in this context, "static" is a scope modifier (not a storage modifier.
