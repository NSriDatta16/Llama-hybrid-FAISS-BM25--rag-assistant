Correlated time series

I am trying to solve a problem involving calibration of environmental instrumentation. I have two instruments set up side-by-side, measuring essentially the same condition. There will be a certain degree of randomness in the difference between the two time series, but they will exhibit a very high correlation. The two instruments may have drifted since they were last calibrated and I am wanting to decide if this difference is significant at some pre-determined level. What would be the best statistic for this?
