This argument is focused on the tendency for infinite sets and sequences to behave in unitnuitive ways. This is no more surprising than the Hilbert Hotel . In such a case, you will indeed have taken out an infinite number of balls, but you will have put an infinite number in. Consider the Hilbert Hotel in reverse. You can remove an infinite number of guests from the hotel, and still have an infinite number left. Whether this is physically realizable is another question entirely. As such, I would consider it not necessarily ill formed, but rather put in the wrong book. This sort of counting question belongs in a set theory course, not a probability course.
