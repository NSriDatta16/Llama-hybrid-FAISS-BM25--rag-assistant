I find the following to work quite well: double? val1 = null; double? val2 = 5.7d; var s1 = string.Format("{0:c}", val1); // outputs: "" var s2 = string.Format("{0:c}", val2); // outputs: $5.70 I wouldn't worry too much about performance in this case, and be more concerned with correctness and clarity, myself. I would also suggest you consider using string.Format() or a StringBuilder in lieu of concatenating string fragments individually. Not this this is a huge deal, but it does allocate and discard intermediate strings unnecessarily; which, if you're concerned about performance you'd probably want to eliminate; for example: htmlReceipt += string.Format( " {0} {1} {2} {3:c} ", item.Title, item.Description, item.Volume, item.listPrice );
