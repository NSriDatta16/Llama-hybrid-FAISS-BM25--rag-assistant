Data simulation using make_classification in Python

I have a question about data simulation in Python. I deal with the classification of imbalanced data and want to test the effectiveness of different methods on simulated data. I have seen in various articles and books that the make_classification function is used to generate data. Then the data is generated from a normal distribution, so the data is continuous and not discrete. Are such data correct for classification (SVM, Decision Trees) research?
