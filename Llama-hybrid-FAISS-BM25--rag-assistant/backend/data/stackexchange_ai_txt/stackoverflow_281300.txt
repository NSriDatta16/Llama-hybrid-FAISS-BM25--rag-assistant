Most elegant UI for categorizing items?

I have a collection of items that the user needs to group/categorize in several ways. For the sake of an example, let's say it's a collection of cars and the user wants to categorize them in the following ways: Color (red, silver, blue, black, etc.) Body shape (hatch, sedan, coupe, stationwagon, etc.) Seats (2, 4, 5, 6, etc.) etc. Have you ever come across a particularly elegant way of doing this that allows the user full freedom to define their own categories and values? Obviously, there will many be trade-offs to make in any design. For example, a learnable design might not be efficient, and vice versa. Or some designs may be more demanding of real estate than others. And some will take significantly longer to develop than others. Regardless, if you've seen -- or designed -- a good pattern for this, I'd be interested to hear about it. If you have screenshots, all the better. Attempt at clarification : tags are indeed a great way of categorizing things, but in all implmentations I've seen, there's only ever one level of tagging. The user doesn't generally get to define a category/property and the item's value in that category . To use the example above and StackOverflow's tagging, you'd tag a car as "blue", "sedan", "4", and so on. StackOverflow would have no inherent knowledge that an item couldn't be tagged as both "sedan" and "coupe". The interface I'm thinking of would need to know that kind of thing, so the user-defined attributes suggestion is more along the lines of what I'm thinking. I'm just keen to find a concrete example of how that kind of system could be elegantly implemented (in a desktop app, if that makes a difference). Is that any clearer? If not, leave a comment and I'll try to clarify again. :)
