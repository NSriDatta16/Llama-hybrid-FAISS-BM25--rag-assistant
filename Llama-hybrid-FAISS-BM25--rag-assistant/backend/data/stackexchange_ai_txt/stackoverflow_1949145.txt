There are a couple of ways to link a button to a function in C++ - you can use function pointers (which are somewhat scary), or a signals and slots pattern which provides the functionality of function pointer with more type safety. As far as wiring up the function pointers or signals and slots at run time based on a config file, to do this elegantly will require reflection, which C++ doesn't provide for you. I suspect this will be the ugly part.
