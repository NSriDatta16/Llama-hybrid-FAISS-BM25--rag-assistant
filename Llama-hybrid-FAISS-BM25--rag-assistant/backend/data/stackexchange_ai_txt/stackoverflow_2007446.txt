The 5 MB storage at Heroku is the database, only. For actual hosting of assets (files, videos, ...), they recommend using S3 (see http://docs.heroku.com/constraints#large-static-assets ). You can always upgrade the database itself when you run into limits. The first paid plan is 50 MB for $15 / month, see http://heroku.com/pricing Also, even though Heroku does not offer a "non-profit-plan", I'm pretty sure they would be willing to negotiate some kind of link/free database upgrade-exchange when you get in touch with them directly.
