It sounds like you're talking about telemetry data (time stamps, data points). We don't use SQL databases for this (although we do use SQL databases to organize it); instead, we use binary streaming files to capture the actual data. There are a number of binary file formats that are suitable for this, including HDF5 and CDF. The file format we use here is a proprietary compressible format. But then, we deal with hundreds of megabytes of telemetry data in one go. You might find this article interesting (links directly to Microsoft Word document): http://www.microsoft.com/caseStudies/ServeFileResource.aspx?4000003362 It is a case study from the McClaren group, describing how SQL Server 2008 is used to capture and process telemetry data from formula one race cars. Note that they don't actually store the telemetry data in the database; instead, it is stored in the file system, and the FILESTREAM capability of SQL Server 2008 is used to access it.
