There is the Cochran-Armitage trend test for linear models but along the lines of D.W.s answer you can view the data as a time series. The generalization of exponential smoothing is the ARIMA model structure. The approach to identify trends in ARIMA models is to calculate the estimate of the autocorrelatioon function. If the function is positive and slowly declining that is an indication of trend (informal).
