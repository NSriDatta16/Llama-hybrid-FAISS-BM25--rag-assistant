Variable importance rankings have a definite role in the applied business world whenever there is a need to prioritize the potentially large number of inputs to a process, any process. This information provides direction in terms of a focused strategy for attacking a problem, working down from most to least important, e.g., process cost reduction, given that the variables are leveragable and not fixed or structural factors immune to manipulation.
