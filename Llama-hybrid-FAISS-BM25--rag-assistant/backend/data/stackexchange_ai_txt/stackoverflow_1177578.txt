Don't give up on RAID5. Modern RAID systems can give you 300-350 MB/s in a RAID-5 or RAID-6. I've used pg_largeobject to store files before too. It only led to backup and OID headaches, though that was PostgreSQL 7.2/7.3. I agree with the comments above though that storing the file on the file system and, if you must, putting a function-view frontend on it would be more efficient. An additional advantage of a function-view combo to store-fetch the files could be different storage types such as local file system, a grid file system, cloud, and so on.
