"...usually I was able to ctrl+click and drag to "File's Owner"" After adding additional IBOutlet s to your controller class, you generally set them in Interface Builder by dragging from the controller object to the view item, rather than the other way around. (Here, a controller object is usually File's Owner , 'Application', or an instantiated custom controller object). Less frequently, you might drag from the views themselves to the controller object(s) or to other view objects, to set class-specific IBOutlet s like delegate , and/or dataSource , menu , formatter , etc. For example, NSTextField adds a delegate and a formatter IBOutlet to NSView 's menu and nextKeyView IBOutlet s. So, you may want to double-check that you're dragging in the right direction for the object in question. If you know you are dragging in the correct direction, and Interface Builder doesn't act like it normally should, there are a couple of things you might try. First, if you added additional IBOutlets to your controller class and are trying to hook them up in Interface Builder, double-check that you actually specified the proper class for the view object you want. For example, to add a new IBOutlet, I'll sometimes copy an existing line, say IBOutlet NSTextField *textField; , and then paste it. I'd then change the name to tableView (with the intention of having the IBOutlet be connected to an NSTableView ), but I'll forget to change the NSTextField to NSTableView . So when I would go to Interface Builder and try to "hook up" the IBOutlet by dragging from the controller class to the NSTableView , it wouldn't show a popup menu since a table view and text field are 2 different kind of objects. Second, you might post the contents of your .h file. You might have forgotten a ; , or have otherwise created a possible situation which is causing the parsing of the .h file (by Xcode which then communicates the results to Interface Builder) to fail partway through. When that happens, it can prevent many of the IBOutlets etc. from showing up in IB. You might also try compiling your code as is to help ferret out where the problems lie. I've occasionally done this myself.
