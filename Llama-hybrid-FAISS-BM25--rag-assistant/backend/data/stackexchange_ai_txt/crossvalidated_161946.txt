Have you looked into some of the Financial Time Series Analysis courses/books that Ruey Tsay (UChicago) writes? http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey.tsay/teaching/ Ruey Tsays classes and the textbook provide multiple real world examples in Finance of complex regressions of the type that are created for use in financial markets. Chapter 1 begins with multifactor regression models and expands to Seasonal Autoregressive Time series models by chapter 5 or 6.
