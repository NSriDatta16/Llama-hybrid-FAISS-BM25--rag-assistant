GetHashCode is definitely not a very good choice. How big do you want the identifier to be? If you have persistent storage to remember the "last generated" identifier (e.g. a database) then simply incrementing a number each time would suffice. If you don't have persistent storage, then using a DateTime to get the number of milliseconds since some fixed date would also work. That would obviously limit you to only being able to generate one identifier per millisecond, but depending on your situation, that should be OK. You could combine the timestamp with your process ID or something to avoid duplcates if you've got multiple processes generating identifiers at the same time.
