I'm a total newb. But after a lot of time and with some help from more experience coders, I was able to get ruby working with Sharepoint 2010. The code below requires the 'ntlm/mechanize' gem. I've been able to download the sharepoint xml from lists specified (below) using the List GUID and the List View GUID. Edit (May 23, 2011). I should have pointed out that this code requires the ruby-ntlm gem. Here's a decent link that should help. This definitely works. http://rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-ntlm/0.0.1/file/README.markdown agent = Mechanize.new agent.auth('domain\\USERNAME', 'PASSWORD') page = agent.get('http://URL/DIRECTORY/SITE/LIST/_vti_bin/owssvr.dll?Cmd=Display&List={LIST_GUID}&View={VIEW_GUID}&XMLDATA=TRUE')
