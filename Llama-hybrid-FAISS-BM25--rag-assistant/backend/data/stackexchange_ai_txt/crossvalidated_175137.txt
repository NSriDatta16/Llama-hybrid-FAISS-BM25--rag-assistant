PCA loading vectors and importance of original variables

If $X$ is your data set with columns $x_i$ representing all your variables, then principal component analysis (PCA) of $X$ gives $$T=XW,$$ where $T$ represents scores and $W$ represents loadings (columns $w_i$ of $W$ are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix). Can we say that $w_i$ vector represents the importance of $x_i$? Or is this information only conveyed by the scores? I am confused by the fact that $w_i$'s represent a totally different space than that of $x_i$'s, albeit they being the projection of the $x_i$.
