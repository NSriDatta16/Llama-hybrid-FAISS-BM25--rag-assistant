Conditions on distributions which guarantees smaller average distance

Suppose there are two CDF's $F$ and $G$ whose common support is $[0,1]$, and pdf $f$ and $g$, respectively. If distances are measured in squared differences. What kind of condition would guarantee the following inequality? $$\int^1_0(x-y)^2f(x)dx\leq\int^1_0(x-y)^2g(x)dx,~\forall y\in[0,1].$$
