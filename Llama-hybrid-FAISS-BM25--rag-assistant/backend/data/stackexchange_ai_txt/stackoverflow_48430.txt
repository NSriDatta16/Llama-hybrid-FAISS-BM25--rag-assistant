The mount point is usually "\Storage Card" but can be localized into other languages or modified by OEMs (some devices use "\SD Card" or other mount points, and some devices support mounting multiple storage media). The best way to enumerate the available cards is to use FindFirstFlashCard and FindNextFlashCard. Both functions fill in a WIN32_FIND_DATA structure. The most important field is cFileName, which will contain the path to the card's mount point (e.g. "\Storage Card"). Note that the device's internal memory will also be enumerated by these functions. If you only care about external volumes, ignore the case where cFileName is an empty string (""). Using these functions require you to #include and link with note_prj.lib. Both are included in the Windows Mobile SDKs for WM 2000 and later.
