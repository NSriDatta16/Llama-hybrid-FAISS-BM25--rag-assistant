SQL allows you to persist and do many different relation transactions and always have it readily available for multiple different uses. Essentially one source of truth or place to go. There is over head for sure. However, some analyses can be very complicated and require significant amount of set based operations which can turn even a small data set into a large one very quickly. I have had data processes that have over 2000 queries that process terabytes in less than 5 mins and can score billions of records for a predictive model at the end and python and numpy scored a fraction of the dataset in 10x time as a relational data store and serve it up to a presentation layer. An additional point, if doing this in the cloud make sure you have a dynamical instance that can scale its memory. With SQL it is all about having disc and enough compute to get it done in a timely fashion. I see many ways that they can work in synergy. Many data science jobs are what Pandas was designed to do. Some data science jobs are what RDBs were designed to do. Use both in balance. It is all about the right tool to do the right job.
