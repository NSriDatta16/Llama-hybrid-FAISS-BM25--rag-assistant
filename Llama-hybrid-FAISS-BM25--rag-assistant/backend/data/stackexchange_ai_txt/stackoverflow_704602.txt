I am trying to return a Character Array but, I'm only getting the first letter returned

I'm working on a small little thing here for school. After hours of researching, and a ton of errors and logic reworking I've almost completed my little program here. I'm trying to take user input, store it into the string, get a character array from the string ( dont ask why, I just have to put this into a character array ), then get the reversed order of the phrase that the user entered. Here is my code: #include "stdafx.h" #include #include #include using namespace std; using namespace System; #pragma hdrstop char* getCharArray(string); string reversePhrase( int, char* ); void main(void) { string sPhrase = ""; int sSize = 0; string sReversed = ""; char* cPhrase = NULL; cout When I type in "ownage" into the program, this is what I get returned: It is almost like my Character Array is getting garbage collected before it can use all of the characters. This is probably an easy fix but, I just don't see how I can get around this one.
