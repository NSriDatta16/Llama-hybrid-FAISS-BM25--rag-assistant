Logistic regression with panel data

I am looking for a package/library to run logistic regression on panel data. I already did some research and most of the sources suggest Stata, however, I would like to use R or Python, as I am using one of these for data preparation. I have found this , but this is not a well know package as far as I know. Any suggestions would be welcome.
