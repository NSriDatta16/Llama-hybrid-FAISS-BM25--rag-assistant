The only big reason valid is that a lot of people is still using IE6. Just this. Probably could be a good thing, at the end of 2008, to give no more attention at IE6. But is difficult to ignore IE6. I work as web designer/devolper for a big company in Italy, and many of ours employes or clients, in their work computers, are browsing the internet with IE6 right now. Why? They don't have administrator rights and can't install anithing in their machines, and the system admistrators are always too busy to upgrade the computers of every office. May be this people will upgrade to IE7 (something like Firefox is a dream) when their hard disks will need to be changed. Is possible that this sort of things happens only in Italy. But I would not bet on this.
