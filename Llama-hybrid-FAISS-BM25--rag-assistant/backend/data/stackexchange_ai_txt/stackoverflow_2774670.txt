Moving from CodeRush to ReSharper (or vice-versa). Any resources/help for making the transition?

I've been using CodeRush with Refactor! Pro for a while, but I'm considering moving to ReSharper . Once I uninstalled CodeRush, I immediately began to miss some key features, including: navigating references using the Tab key, renaming variables, methods, etc. with the F2 key, basic refactorings such as Extract Method, etc. I'm sure corresponding features exist in ReSharper. But, aside from having to look through the ReSharper online documentation each and every time I find myself missing something, has anybody built a correspondence table of keyboard shortcuts, etc., to key features in common to each? Or, if you've used both products yourself, could you share some basic equivalents you're aware of? Note: this question is not being asked to debate which is better. I like CodeRush, but I'd like to know first hand if I'd like ReSharper more. Getting up to speed with ReSharper quickly will help me assess it fairly. For the which-is-better debate, please refer to the question ReSharper vs. CodeRush .
