I'd be very wary about buying large, 3rd-party, social-networking add-ons to MOSS 2007 unless you know you're going to be stuck with that version of SharePoint for a long time. Social Networking is going to be a huge emphasis in SP 2010, and you can bet that whatever the 3rd party solutions do, by definition they won't be leveraging the features built into the new product.
