Matrix Normalization for Haar Decomposition

I've implemented the Wavelet transformation described in the paper below for image retrieval. http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/query/ Overall, the system works great but my question doesn't concern the paper at all; rather, the proper way of normalizing the intensity matrix between values of [0, 1]. Normally, I would just loop through the matrix, find the largest value, loop through the matrix again, and then divide by the maximum value. But since I am trying to compare images, shouldn't the divisor be 255 regardless of what the maximum intensity value in the matrix is? For example, if the maximum intensity value is only 200, when normalizing, do I divide by 200 or 255?
