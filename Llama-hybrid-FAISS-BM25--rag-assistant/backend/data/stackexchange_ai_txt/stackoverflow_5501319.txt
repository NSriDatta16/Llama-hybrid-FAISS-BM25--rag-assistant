Sailboat Animation: Turn tiller to left with mouse, boat turns to right & vice versa

I am trying to create an animation that will show the basics of steering a sailboat. The idea is that there will be a top view of the boat with the tiller and rudder very pronounced. I want the learner to be able to click and drag the tiller one direction or the other, while the tiller is dragging I want the rudder and the boat to rotate the proper direction. Example, I want the boat to go left I will push the tiller to starboard and the rudder will rotate clockwise and the boat will turn left. There doesn't need to be forward motion by the boat in my head, I think that as long as the boat rotates it would be fine. Any help or resources would be appreciated.
