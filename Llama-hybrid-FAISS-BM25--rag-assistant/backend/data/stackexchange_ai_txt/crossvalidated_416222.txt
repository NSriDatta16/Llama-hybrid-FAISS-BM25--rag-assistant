I think you should consider a paired experiment to study differences such as the difference between 10.0005 and 10.0007 you mentioned, in order to look just at the effect of 'introducing the variable' of interest. You should obtain several such differences (such as $D_i = 0.0002.$ After you have done this several times $i = 1, 2, \dots, n,$ you can find the average difference $\bar D$ and the standard deviation of the differences $S_D.$ Then you can make a 'confidence interval' to give you an idea how big an effect the 'variable' has. Key formulas are $$\bar D = \frac 1n \sum_{i-1}^n D_i = (D_1 + D_2 + \cdots + D_n)/n$$ and $$S_D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (D_i - \bar D)^2}.$$ If you have at least $n = 30$ differences, a 95% confidence interval would be approximately $$\bar D \pm 2.0 \frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}.$$ If it not feasible to get as many as 30 differences, you might still be able to make a confidence interval, but the factor $2.0$ would be larger. [You can google 't confidence interval', if you don't already know about this.] If your confidence interval doesn't include $0,$ then you can be reasonably sure you have a consistent effect due to your 'variable'. Also, you will have a rough idea how variable the effect is. It wouldn't work nearly as well to collect $n_b$ values before introducing the 'variable' and another $n_a$ values after. You could look at the mean before and the mean after, but you say those measurements are subject to huge variability (between 8 and 12). It crucial to keep track of individual before-after pairs of measurements. This is the difference between 'paired' data and 'two-sample' data. From what you say, I think you need paired data. From your question, it is difficult to know how much you know about statistics. If you have follow-up questions after reading this and can't answer them by googling various phrases, please leave a comment and maybe one of us can help. Example using R statistical software.
