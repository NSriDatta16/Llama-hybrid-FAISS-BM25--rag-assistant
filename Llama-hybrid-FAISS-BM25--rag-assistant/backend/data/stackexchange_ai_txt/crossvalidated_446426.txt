What is the difference between mathematics and statistics? ! Statistics is itself a branch of mathematics where most of the time we deal with mean, median, mode etc, although they require mathematical computation as well. Same way in machine learning statistical models has most of the computation related to mean, median, quantiles etc. Ex- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.
