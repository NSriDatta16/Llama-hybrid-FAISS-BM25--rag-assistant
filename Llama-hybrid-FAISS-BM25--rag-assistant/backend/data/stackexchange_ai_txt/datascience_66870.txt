Built strong base for Unsupervised Learning

I’m am new into machine learning, recently I have put a task upon my shoulders to Detect Outliers in Dataset. The anomaly detection should be done using Unsupervised learning and preferably use Scikit-Learn Can anyone give me any good source or course where I can specific dive into this ? It so saturated that I don’t know where to start, a guidance on how to tackle this problem would be more than appreciated. My dataset is in a form of a dataframe in a csv file
