The t-test is quite robust to departures from the assumption of normality. Intuitively, the reason for this is that the T statistic is based on averages, which are asymptotically normal under mild conditions (Central limit theorem), and typically they converge fast to normality. Alternative nonparametric tests (for equality of distributions or means) include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, permutation tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
