I am not an expert in Hadoop, but AFAIK, there is no explicit limitation on a single file size, though there are implicit factors such as overall storage capacity and maximum namespace size. Also, there might be administrative quotes on number of entities and directory sizes. The HDFS capacity topic is very well described in this document . Quotes are described here and discussed here . I'd recommend paying some extra attention to the Michael G Noll's blog referred by the last link, it covers many hadoop-specific topics.
