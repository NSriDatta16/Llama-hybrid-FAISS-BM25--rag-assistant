There are many exicting opportunities in chemistry. There is a strong Open Source community, much of which is organized under the Blue Obelisk ( http://www.blueobelisk.org ). There have been major contributions in visualisation and algorithms which did not need previous chemical knowledge and the community is very welcoming to anyone who wishes to help. For an example of the standard which has been achieved take a look at Jmol which visualizes molecules and other chemistry in 3D ( http://www.jmol.org ); There is also real opportunity to do porting between platforms/languages. The commonest ones are Java, Python, C++ and we have been working in C#. You don't have to be an ace programmer either - contributions to data standards, data resources, tutorials, packaging, installers, testing, etc. are all highly valued. Some of these projects are within the top 100-500 projects on Sourceforge.
