I do not think that Frequentist's would say that (the 50% probability). Imagine the ridiculousness of the statement if you extend it to ten first sons without color blindness. A Bayesian statement would go something like assigning probabilities to the different cases. And then you have P(mother = Xx) and P(mother = XX) changing from estimates of the odds ratio prior to the experiment, $\frac{P(XX)}{P(xX)} = 1$ , to odds ratio posterior to the experiment $\frac{P(XX|obs)}{P(xX|obs)} = \frac{P(XX)}{P(xX)} \frac{P(obs|XX)}{P(obs|xX)} = 2$ . A frequentist could also make a 95% confidence interval which woudl both include the mother having xX and XX, another not so useful approach in this case. A frequentist would more like create a statement that has a certain success rate. For instance, do not reject the hypothesis that the mother has xX, since the p-value is only 0.5, (which means the approach, if it would have been rejected, fails 50% of the time when the mother has xX after all, this does not mean that the probability for a particular experiment is 50%). In the case of such small numbers, and for a single point estimate, the frequentist approach seems less useful. The frequentist might also do something like create a 95% confidence interval, which would in this case include both the xX and XX, another not so useful approach in this case. Of course this 'a frequentists would...' is a bit ridiculous. No statistician is frequentist or bayesian. Only the methods have this property, and frequentists methods, as this example shows, have a disadvantage for such small experiments, with few observations.
