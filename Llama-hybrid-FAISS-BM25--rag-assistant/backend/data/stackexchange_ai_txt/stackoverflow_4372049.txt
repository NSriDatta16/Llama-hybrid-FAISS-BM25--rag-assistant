I share the same problem and desire to have a clean install. I was not attracted by the merging of WAR files. Instead I use an assembly to maintain a ZIP file of all external properties. As a separate module I can then deploy the contents of the ZIP file to the JETTY environment. In turn, I leverage how Jetty uses the name of the web app to load a complimentary environment file (for webapps/foo.war Jetty uses contexts/foo.xml for configuration). So, whilst it's not as compact as a pure Cargo solution I prefer it since the WAR file is unadulterated in its progress throughout the promotion process. The solution is also a general mechanism to manage all configuration activities. I can point to more details if anyone is interested.
