An average line has the advantage, that every reader understands an average. The problem is that every reader will expect the line to be drawn for the same group of people throughout time. That is not possible if you want to draw the line from x = 0 to x = 35. However, if you drew the average line only from x = 0 to x = 15 only for those people who are not censored within [0, 15] you'd probably get a good representation of what happens to the majority of people and for x > 15 we do not really need an average - we can see what happens to these 7 or so people without data aggregation.
