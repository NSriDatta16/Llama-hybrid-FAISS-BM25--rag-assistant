OK, I try something today and it seems the problem happens because the maximizing activity extends the width to the second monitor before moving the window to top-left corner. Therefore, when you normalize the window, the extended part is still in the second monitor and will not be cleared until you drag the window to the second monitor. To work around this problem, before setting WindowState to Maximized, set Width and Height to zeros first. That will solve the problem. You may want to cache the current Top and Left so that when the window is normalized, it comes back to previous position: Maximized code: _oldTop = Top; _oldHeight = Height; Top = Height = 0; WindowState = WindowState.Maximized; Normalized code: Top = _oldTop; Height = _oldHeight; WindowState = WindowState.Normal;
