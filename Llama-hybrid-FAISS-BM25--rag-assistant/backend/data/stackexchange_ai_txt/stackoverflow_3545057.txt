Numpy for R user?

long-time R and Python user here. I use R for my daily data analysis and Python for tasks heavier on text processing and shell-scripting. I am working with increasingly large data sets, and these files are often in binary or text files when I get them. The type of things I do normally is to apply statistical/machine learning algorithms and create statistical graphics in most cases. I use R with SQLite sometimes and write C for iteration-intensive tasks; before looking into Hadoop, I am considering investing some time in NumPy/Scipy because I've heard it has better memory management [and the transition to Numpy/Scipy for one with my background seems not that big] - I wonder if anyone has experience using the two and could comment on the improvements in this area, and if there are idioms in Numpy that deal with this issue. (I'm also aware of Rpy2 but wondering if Numpy/Scipy can handle most of my needs). Thanks -
