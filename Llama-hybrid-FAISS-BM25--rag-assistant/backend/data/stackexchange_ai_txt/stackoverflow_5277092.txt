It depends on what you need to do with it: view it, store it, analyze it, etc... One thing I can say, however, is that that file will be HUGE at your stated resolution, and you should consider splitting it up into at least a few tiles, even better at 1x1 mile tiles. The list of raster formats supported by GDA L could serve as a good starting point for exploring various formats, keeping in mind that many software packages (GRASS, ArcGIS, etc. use GDAL to read and write most raster formats). Note also that some file formats have maximum sizes which may prevent you from using them with your very large file. For analysis and non-viewable storage, HDF5 format might be of interest.
