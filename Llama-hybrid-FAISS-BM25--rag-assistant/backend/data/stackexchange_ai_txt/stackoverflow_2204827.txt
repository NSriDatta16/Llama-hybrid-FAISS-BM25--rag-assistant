XML to Java Object only using Java5 (no external libs)

normally I would use JaxB, XMLBeans or Simple to convert a XML file to a Java Object. In this case I can however only use Java5 and no external libraries (for several reasons). What is the best way to do that? My XML input is very simple. What is the most flexible and elegant way to get the XML into a Java-Object (I don't really need real JavaBeans, since I just need GETTER). Thanks!
