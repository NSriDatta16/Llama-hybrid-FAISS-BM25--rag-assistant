The quote does not say that if $\theta$ is a random variable, this is not Bayesian scenario. It says that the fact that $\theta$ is a random variable doesn't make it a Bayesian setting by itself. As already noticed in the comments, Bayes theorem is just a theorem in probability theory that lets us get the "reversed" conditional probability from $p(a|b)$ to $p(b|a)$ . As mentioned here , or here , $a$ and $b$ can be any random variables for Bayes theorem to hold. In Bayesian statistics we use Bayes theorem with particular kind of random variables, the ones that are "made up", the prior distributions. When Bayesian wants to estimate the distribution of the parameter of interest $\theta$ for the likelihood function $p(x|\theta)$ , she uses a prior distribution $p(\theta)$ (the distribution that she assumes that the parameter can follow) and applies Bayes theorem, to calculate the posterior $$ p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta)\;p(\theta)}{p(x)} $$ In non-Bayesian setting, you could use some random variables, in this example , they show how can we calculate the probability of having a cancer given the positive test result $p(C|+)$ by applying Bayes theorem to cancer prevalence $p(C)$ and the probability of the test of giving positive results $p(+|C)$ : $$ p(C|+) = \frac{p(+|C)\,p(C)}{p(+)} $$ In here, both probabilities are known to us, contrary to Bayesian setting where the prior is assumed .
