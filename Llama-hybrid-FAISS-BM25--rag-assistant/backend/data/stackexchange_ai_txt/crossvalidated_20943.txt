Natural language processing application in algorithmic trading and sports betting

I'm want to do a PhD in NLP and I'm defining the topic at the moment. I've heard that NLP can be used to track online sentiment which in turn can be used for algorithmic trading on stock markets. See this hedge fund I was wondering if NLP techniques, maybe with online sentiment tracking, could be used to predict sport events on online betting sites? Would that be feasible? If yes, what research has been done on the subject?
