Let us start with the obvious ones. The Independent variable is continuous, and the target is binary. Logistic Regression. Correct? Two interval predictors, one interval target. Linear regression. Correct? Yes, I agree with you here. Advertising platform is a factor. Intent is an interval target. One factor= one-way ANOVA. Correct? Given you cannot use linear regression again by the conditions of the puzzle this is correct too. Two factors, gender and level. Continuous target (salary). Factorial ANOVA. Is there an interaction between the two factors? Factorial ANOVA. (The R output directly shows if the interaction is significant - no post-hocs required.) You run a single command in R. Correct? anova(salary ~ gender * level, data=MyData) Yes, no post hoc testing will be needed since the interaction is estimated separately. Consumer confidence and gender are factors. Spending is the continuous target. Two factors = factorial ANOVA. Correct? Since they are asking about how the effect is moderated by gender they will be thinking you need post hoc testing. I am not convinced this is the best approach but of the options left this is clearly the best. Curvilinear relationship. None of the choices. Correct? This is the one I disagree with depending on what they mean by curvilinear relationship. It is perfectly possible to do this with a linear regression by transforming the predictor. However None of the choices is the only one available.
