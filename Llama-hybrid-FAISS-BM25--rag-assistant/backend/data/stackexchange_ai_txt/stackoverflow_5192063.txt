The basic steps that SQL Server uses to process a single SELECT statement include the following The parser scans the SELECT statement and breaks it into logical units such as keywords, expressions, operators, and identifiers. A query tree, sometimes referred to as a sequence tree, is built describing the logical steps needed to transform the source data into the format required by the result set. The query optimizer analyzes different ways the source tables can be accessed. It then selects the series of steps that returns the results fastest while using fewer resources. The query tree is updated to record this exact series of steps. The final, optimized version of the query tree is called the execution plan. The relational engine starts executing the execution plan. As the steps that require data from the base tables are processed, the relational engine requests that the storage engine pass up data from the rowsets requested from the relational engine. The relational engine processes the data returned from the storage engine into the format defined for the result set and returns the result set to the client. My interpretation of things is that there is no guarantee that your where clause get's evaluated before evaluating the computed column for all rows. You could verify that assumption by changing you query like below and forcing the where clause to be evaluated before the computation. SELECT TotalSize, FreeSpace, (FreeSpace / TotalSize * 100) FROM ( SELECT TotalSize, FreeSpace, FROM tblComputer ...[ couple of joins ]... WHERE SomeCondition = SomeValue ) t
