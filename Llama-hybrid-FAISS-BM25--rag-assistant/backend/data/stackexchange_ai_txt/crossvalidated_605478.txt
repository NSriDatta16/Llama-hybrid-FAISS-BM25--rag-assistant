The principal components you obtain are orthogonal (uncorrelated) among themselves by definition (of PCA), which is already not a great start if you want to assume some kind of dependence among them. Besides that, they do not carry a natural meaning from the perspective of your domain of study (only statistical) except the one you give them. Maybe you can include principal components in a DAG, but in practice you will have to make several assumptions and in general I really do not think is a good idea (I am very much open to counterexamples). On the other hand, you could infer relationships (correlation, non causation) among the original variables computing the correlation coefficient between them and the principal components. From the interpretation of these correlations potentially you could add new nodes (your principal components) in your original DAG as latent variable with arrows into the variables they mostly correlate with. To answer this part of the question: Is the concept of causality dependent on the set of variables chosen as a bases? The concept of causality depends mainly on you and your situation. Causal inference can be very useful, but I think its reasoning is not unique (except in some straightforward cases). As follows a partial and succint explanation of why (in my opinion): First: Can I find a DAG for all situations? The concept of causality is always highly dependable on the researcher knowledge and the data that are available. On top of these two things, building a DAG is dependent on your research question. Unless you are looking into a deterministic problem (for example in physics), you cannot build a "complete" DAG the stands in any possible situation (any research question) involving these variables. The book What If by Hernan and Robins is a simple introduction* to the DAGs world using a perspective from structural causal inference, where you can find some not too complicated mathematical proofs of their reasoning. Second: using my own DAG. The theoretical framework described in the book provides you with some ready-made statistical tools to investigate your data based on the DAG you define, but eventually even in this case I almost always end up using different statistical tools (such as PCA) to back up my reasoning and get new insights. Just so you know, this relationship between correlations and orthogonality is not widely accepted here *There are other views and styles you might like better, but in this book they really take it slow and eventually you get quick comprehensive picture on several topics. On the other hand, if you are more machine learning oriented I recommend this .
