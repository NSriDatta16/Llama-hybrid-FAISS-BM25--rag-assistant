When I tried entering "pkulak.com" into the test OpenID RP at http://nerdbank.org/rp.exp/login.aspx , I got a 404 error. You can try it out yourself and then look at the http://nerdbank.org/rp.exp/tracepage.aspx URL to see the logs of what the RP ran into while trying to "discover" your OpenID. Since a browser has no problem avoiding this 404, I suspect your web server is configured to reject HTTP requests that lack certain HTTP headers that are common to browsers. For example, some RPs don't send a user-agent HTTP header and some web servers reject requests that lack this header. I suggest you start your investigation there.
