jQuery/css: selected amount of stars to light up

I'm working on making a star-voting system. There are 5 stars, those lighted up are showing the current average star voted. When you mouseover a star, lets say number 4 I wish to make the 4 from right lighten up, if you mark over 2, 2 stars should mark up from the right and so on.. if full 5 stars all stars lights up. the stars are in css classes .iconFavorite and the lighten up is .iconFavorite_hover, so my code looks like this when 3: If you check out retardo.dk/videos.php?id=905 you can see the big green stars try mouseover them, the selected amount of stars will light up. How can I do this? Here's a jsfiddle of my current code with no jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/8vzCC/1/
