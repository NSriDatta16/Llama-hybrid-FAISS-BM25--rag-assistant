New mouse plugin file makes jQuery UI 14% smaller on average The mouse plugin isn’t new, but this release moves it to its own file, jquery.ui.mouse.js, where before it was inside the jQuery UI Core. This means that jQuery UI plugins that don’t depend on the mouse plugin but previously included the jQuery UI Core have less unused code to include, with an average overall file size improvement of 14%. That’s just an average. Some improvements will be as high as 36%. from jQuery blog 2010 march In your jQuery Library (like this from google ) you can find it as * jQuery UI Mouse 1.8.11 and more info at jQuery UI Mouse in the JQs website .
