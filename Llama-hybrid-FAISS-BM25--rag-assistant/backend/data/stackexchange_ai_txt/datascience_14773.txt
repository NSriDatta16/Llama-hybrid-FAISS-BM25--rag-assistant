Wow, you must be taking the job I just left behind! Our CEO (and full exec team) was used to Wired article headlines and viewed any test with First, find a baseline. Ask during the interview process what they hope you'll accomplish in the first 3-6 months. If they have a solid list of deliverables, that's a good sign. If that list is something you're comfortable with even better. Ask "why?" a lot. In the interview/early days you're understandably naive, so you can say oh, why is that important? and it's interpreted as I'm trying to learn about our business. If their assumptions show some thought and understanding, even if you don't fully agree, that's a great sign. Ask how those projects will help with their overall goal. What is their overall goal? We want to be a $1B company is a terrible goal. But if your manager-to-be has no good answers to those questions: walk. There are plenty of places hiring. Second, build a plan. You have their list of ideas and some reasons they're important. Put together a rough draft plan of how you'd attack them. Don't get too in the weeds, just list the strategic goal, the data you'll need, the method you'll start with, what you hope to find and a rough time estimate. eg Ok, you're disappointed with mobile conversion. I'll want to implement on-site tracking (eg Segment.io) to start logging a variety of parameters (eg browser, IP locale) as well as getting views on visitor flow. I'll use a basic SQL client (eg Mode) to segment users and see if the problem is confined to any one group (eg Android users). From there, I'll work with the product team to size/prioritize possible split tests, which we'll analyze manually at first. It'll take a few days to get Segment up and verified, ~1-2 weeks for data collection, and a full week to do a deep dive. The earliest we could start experimenting would be two weeks, but realistically after the better part of a month. You're just riffing to see their reaction. Are they nodding reverently like you're speaking Latin, it sounds impressive but they don't follow? Are they pushing for faster turnaround and guaranteed results? Are they asking insightful questions (eg Can you really get an integration up in 2 days?) If they're engaged and interested, then you've found a good partner. Otherwise consider how much you're willing to invest on education/management. Finally, assess how aligned others are Talk to the engineering team and ask what they've worked on in the past year. Push for how they source and prioritize projects. You'll likely be in a very similar boat. Consistency or thrashing? Evidence-based or HiPPO decision making? TL;DR: Go with genuine interest In general, I've been most successful when I screen employers for curiosity over performance. Everyone wants to do well in business, but the people I've loved doing data work for are ones who are eager to learn what's going on with their business and how to please customers better. The ones I've dreaded working for want to brag about KPIs and stock prices. The former will be patient as you get your sea-legs in a new org.
