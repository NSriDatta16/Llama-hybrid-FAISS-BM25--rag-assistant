You could try to install echech's version of VE ( Visual Editor ). You have here another setup procedure to follow if the first does not work It should work with with eclipse3.4 (Ganymede). Or you could download the original version and install it in a eclipse3.2 setup. It is the only Visual Editor I know knew of which is was free and support Swing. Note: it is an archived Eclipse project since June 2011. tehvan mentions a commercial editor: SwingDesigner (now only WBPro for Smalltalk remains)
