Understanding the bound given by Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma

This was a question I asked in the mathematics site. Though no one replied but I have figured it out. But new questions arise. Former Question: Here I choose to use the statement made by S.Dasgupta: For any $0 Then for any set $V$ of $n$ points in $R^d$, there is a linear map $f: R^d \mapsto R^k$, such that for all $u,v \in V$, $$ (1-\epsilon)\|u-v\|^2 \leq \|f(u)-f(v)\|^2 \leq (1+\epsilon)\|u-v\|^2$$ My question is, that I did some easy calculation to test the $k$ given by the lemma, for example, pick $n=2, \epsilon = 0.1$, and now we have $k \geq 595$ according to the lemma. But it is clear that in the 2-points case we can reduce the dimension to simply one. This makes me confused. Could anyone explain this? New Questions The answer to the question above, in my opinion, is the requirement to the map $f$. First, it must be a map from $R^D$ to $R^k$ but not $V$ to some $U \subset R^k$. Second, it is linear. However, the requirement of "linear map" is seen on Wikipedia and in the book Geometric Structure of High-Dimensional Data and Dimensionality Reduction , but not in the original paper of S.Dasgupta. So the first question would be: Is linear map required? And how to prove it? Besides, I found that $k$ is usually much greater than 2 or 3, which makes the visualization very difficult. I do not think it's ordinary. Is it the daily case in DR?
