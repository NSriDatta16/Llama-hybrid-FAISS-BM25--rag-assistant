Confidence Intervals for Mean Difference between Actuals and Forecast

I am trying to assess the influence of a product change compared to a hypothetical forecast. I use a time series model to predict a realistic future and compare it to the observed actuals. I am interested in the mean absolute and percentual difference between the prediction and the actuals. How may I correctly estimate confidence intervals in this scenario and account for the specific time series structure of the data? library(forecast) library(ggplot2) train % autoplot() + autolayer(actuals) # Current Approach: T-Test for Confidence Intervals mean(actuals - fc$mean) #> [1] 60.60125 t.test(actuals, fc$mean) # possibly use paired = TRUE #> #> Welch Two Sample t-test #> #> data: actuals and fc$mean #> t = 5.3794, df = 78.309, p-value = 7.533e-07 #> alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 #> 95 percent confidence interval: #> 38.17509 83.02742 #> sample estimates: #> mean of x mean of y #> 396.4333 335.8321 uplift_pct [1] 0.1767661 t.test(uplift_pct) #> #> One Sample t-test #> #> data: uplift_pct #> t = 7.4578, df = 59, p-value = 4.535e-10 #> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 #> 95 percent confidence interval: #> 0.1293381 0.2241941 #> sample estimates: #> mean of x #> 0.1767661
