jQuery and XHTML layout problems in ie7

I am back again with more layout problems on my up and coming website. I am able to achieve the proper animation, positioning and results with my layout / splash on every modern browser (excluding ie7 or older). I have an image in the center of the page, that is text-align: center'd, and pushed to a vertical center by having a div (#SPLASH_HEAD) set to 50% on the top half of the page. The loading animation changes the height of #SPLASH_HEAD to 0px, to drag the image to the top (and then do other things). In ie7 (or compatability mode), it appears that there is an error in jquery-1.4.2.min.js, line 116 char 165 (which I dont think has anything to do with the actual jQuery file itself). The splash is not centered either vertically (#SPLASH_HEAD does not register at 50% of window height) and is not centered properly with margin-left. Also, none of the other elements are hidden properly (with .hide()) as ie7 does not appear to be loading all of my jQuery / javascript. heres a link: www.voidsync.com/test (it would be easier to view the source on there) thanks!
