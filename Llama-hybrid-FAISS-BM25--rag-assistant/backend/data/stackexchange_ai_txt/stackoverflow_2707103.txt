If your requirements allow, use UITapGestureRecognizer. Otherwise, implement the following UIResponder methods in your custom UIView: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; Track throughout to see how many touches there were and whether or not they moved more than your tap/drag threshold. You must implement all four methods.
