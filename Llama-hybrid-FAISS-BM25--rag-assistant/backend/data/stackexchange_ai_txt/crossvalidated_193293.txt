data normalization after dimension reduction for classification

The classifier is KNN or RBF-SVM. After doing dimension reduction (e.g., PCA, LDA or KPCA, KLDA), does it need to do normalization before classification? In LIBSVM package, it always needs to first use svm-scale to normalize the features using min-max normalization, then takes the normalized features as inputs for svm-train . I'm not sure whether the data normalization would harm the structures of the transformed features by PCA, LDA etc.
