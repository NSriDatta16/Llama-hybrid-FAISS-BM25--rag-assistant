I believe Controller is 'reserved' for the MVC model but I may be wrong. TextHandler and TextManager may be better but at least at the place I work, 'Manager' in a service/class is generally discouraged since it is assumed that every class 'manages' something (this may just be culture-specific, though). I'd vote for TextHandler out of those three. It may also depend slightly on your programming language.
