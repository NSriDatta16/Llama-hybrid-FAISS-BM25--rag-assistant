Machine learning algorithms for panel data

In this question - Is there a method for constructing decision trees that takes account of structured/hierarchical/multilevel predictors? - they mention a panel data method for trees. Are there specific panel data methods for support Vector Machines and Neural Networks? If so, could you cite some papers for the algorithms and (if available) R packages implementing it?
