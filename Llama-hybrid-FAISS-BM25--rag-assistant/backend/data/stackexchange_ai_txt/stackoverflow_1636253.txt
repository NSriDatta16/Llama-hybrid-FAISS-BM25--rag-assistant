Single quotes and backslash have special meaning to SQL and are very likely to be present in an average html page. Make sure you store the page in an nvarchar which is long enough for the biggest page, or, if your pages are really big a CLOB. You probably need to use some sort of EscapeQuotes routine. Or use prepared statements for your insert/update.
