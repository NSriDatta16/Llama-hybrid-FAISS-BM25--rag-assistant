Primiceri (2005) writes on p. 830 bottom that the first 10 years (40 obs.) are used to calibrate the prior distributions. He estimates a constant parameter VAR model on the first 40 obs. and uses these point estimates to calibrate the prior distributions. Note that he calibrates the variance as four times the estimated variance from the constant parameter VAR. Nakajima and Kasuya follow Primiceri (2005) when calibrating their prior distribution. They discuss this in sections 3.2 (p. 228-229) and 4.1 (p. 229-231). The reason for choosing this prior is discussed by both Primiceri (2005) and Nakajima and Kasuya, see section 3.2: " The priors should be carefully chosen because the TVP–VAR model has many state variables and their process is modeled as a non-stationary process. The TVP–VAR model is so flexible that the state variables can capture both gradual and sudden changes of the underlying economic structure. As mentioned by Primiceri (2005), the tight prior for the covariance matrix of the disturbance in the random walk process avoids implausible behaviors of the time-varying parameters. A tighter prior should sometimes be avoided in empirical econometrics for its arbitrary choice, although the TVP–VAR model needs slightly tighter priors to provide reasonable identification. " Nakajima, J. (2011) Time-Varying Parameter VAR Model with Stochastic Volatility: An Overview of Methodology and Empirical Applications and Koop, G. and Korobilis, D. (2009). BAYESIAN MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES METHODS FOR EMPIRICAL MACROECONOMICS provide more details on the TVP-VAR model. There is an improved MCMC algorithm for estimating the TVP-VAR model in Primiceri (2005). A discussion of this is found in TIME VARYING STRUCTURAL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS AND MONETARY POLICY: A CORRIGENDUM .
