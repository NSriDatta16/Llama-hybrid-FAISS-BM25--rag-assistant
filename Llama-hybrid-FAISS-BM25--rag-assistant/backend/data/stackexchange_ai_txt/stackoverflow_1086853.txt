PageSetup problems

In what is hopefully the last problem in the "Print An Individual Range" series of questions, I hereby humbly ask the more knowledgable readers how to copy the PageSetup object from one page to another. Since you can simply Dest.PageSetup = Source.PageSetup I have had to create function that does the same. An abridge form is below: Public Sub CopyPageSetup(ByVal Source As Worksheet, ByRef Dest As Worksheet) With Source.PageSetup Call SetParam(.AlignMarginsHeaderFooter, Dest.PageSetup.AlignMarginsHeaderFooter) ' etc Call SetParam(.Zoom, Dest.PageSetup.Zoom) End With End Sub And SetParam is simply: Public Sub SetParam(ByVal Source As Variant, ByRef Dest As Variant) If Dest <> Source Then Dest = Source End Sub However this does not copy the page setup across - immeadiately after calling this function I call tmp.PrintPreview (where tmp is a temporary worksheet) and the output is the same as if I had never called the function. Is this a mirage (does it work for you?) and if it is not a mirage what do I need to do to correct this?
