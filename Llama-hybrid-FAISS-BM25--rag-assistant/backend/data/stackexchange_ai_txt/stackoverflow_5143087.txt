If you are displaying image from CSS then try to use it from there. For example. Create a style dir, inside style create an image and put all images that are going to be used in CSS. like .div { background-image:url('images/abc.png'); color:#24543F; } For general images, create a folder images in the root and put all images inside that are to be rendered without CSS. Where you need to use those image just drag and drop the image, VS will do the rest. If you need to set it programmatically from Codebehing add runat="server" in the tag. That's all.
