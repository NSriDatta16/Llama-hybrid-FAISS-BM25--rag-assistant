How do I get Outlook to process an event update?

I am trying to create, update and delete an event in Outlook 2007 (but optimally it would work for all versions). Creating and deleting the event is working fine. I followed several threads but for some reason the update action failed. When I double click on the ICS file, Outlook opens a window and the only choice I have is to delete. But the event it wants to delete is not the old one but the new one (even if it's not created yet). So when I click delete the old event remains here. The UID is the same, sequence has been increase by 1, DTSTAMP in newer.
