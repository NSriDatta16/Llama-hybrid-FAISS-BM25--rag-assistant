Typically in such circumstances people use Exponential Smoothing prediction methods such as Holt-Winters prediction. The main advantage is that they are quite easy to calculate in Excel and they offer something akin to nonparametric regression upon which we can make prediction for next few periods of time. It is also important that it is possible to calculate standard error of prediction estimates , but for this you would be better of using specialized procedures, like HoltWinters found in R. Don't be afraid to use R, as it can be easily merged with Excel and is free. See this post as an example. While I totally agree with Nick Adams, that you can do some sort of regression on this data too, be warned that it is a time series, so you violate the fundamental assumption that the data points are independent from each other . So don't be tempted to calculate any sort of standard errors or significance based on regression models.
