You wrote int instead of var . I do that all the time... int iDx=0 should be var iDx=0 . By the way, what editor are you using? int is a "future reserved word" in ES, so a good editor may highlight it in an ugly way (gedit makes it red with a red underline by default) to bring your attention to it.
