I think DataMapper is what you are asking for. Once set up, you'd either use DataMapper.auto_migrate! or DataMapper.auto_upgrade!. The former will drop tables if they exists before creating them, thus destroying any data. That would be bad for production. The latter is how you avoid losing data, and should be just fine for production. Without knowing exactly what its doing, I'd guess it's inspecting tables during startup to determine whether to make database changes. That can drag down start up time, especially with a lot of models/tables. Which is actually one of the good reasons to consider NoSQL - specifically Mongo as mentioned above. It's fast. Really fast, and thus the start up cost is much, much less. MongoMapper is the way to go. The tekpub blog post is a must read. I first heard about DataMapper in reading about Merb, so it makes sense that it's in rails 3. I don't know whether you may be able to get it working in rails 2.x.
