Average Growth Rate for Year 1 across 5 groups

I have a question that pertains to time series or more likely pertains just to simple math. Lets suppose that I am measuring the number of online visitors to 5 websites on a monthly basis, so I have this data for the months of Jan - Dec. What I want to understand is "What is average yearly growth rate for the websites?" That is, imagine I am doing something to these websites and I want to say to someone that these the 5 websites, which are representative of some population, on average will give a website a x% yearly growth rate in visitors in the first year. Since I have measured this for 12 months for each website, finding the growth rate in visitors for one website would be the standard (t(month12) - t(month 1))/t(month 1). If wanted to find the yearly average growth rate across all 5 websites, what would I do? Would it be safe to average the yearly growth rates? I am not looking for an extremely formal method for this. I just wanted to know if there are in dire dangers in doing this when trying to get a genereal reflection of the yearly growth rate across the 5 website. Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks!
