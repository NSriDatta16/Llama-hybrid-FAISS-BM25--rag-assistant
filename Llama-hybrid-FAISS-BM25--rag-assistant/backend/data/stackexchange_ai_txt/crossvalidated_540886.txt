What units are the cumulative response functions of a VAR measured in, and why does orthogonalisation appear to change the scale?

There are quite a few questions on this site regarding the interpretation of the impulse-response-function plots of a VAR, but none answer my query directly. I will attempt to be as concrete as possible. Suppose I run a VAR on three times series in levels: energy intensity( ener_inten ), gross fixed capital formation ( gfcf ) and price of energy ( ener_price ). The time series have been divided by the first observation (i.e. normalised to some base year), and logged. ener_inten gfcf ener_price mean -0.148 0.063 -0.132 std 0.099 0.125 0.159 According to the AIC, a VAR(1) is deemed the best model. I am then able to produce a cumulative impulse-response-function matrix plot that looks like this. Q1. What are the units on the $y$ -axis? It is standard deviations from the mean or something else? Q1a. If standard deviations, is the following description for say the ener_price -> gfcf plot correct? "A one-standard-deviation shock to the energy price produces a long-run 0.8 standard-deviation reduction in gross fixed capital formation." Q1b. This may be trivial, but I don't want to make any mistakes: if the units are standard deviations, I guess this implies that I can transform to the units of the respective variable by simply multiplying by the corresponding standard deviation in the table above, correct? Consider now that I can also produce a plot of the orthogonalised cumulative responses. I am at a loss as to why the scale of the $y$ -axis has changed. A tentative explanation is that we are now in "variable units"; for instance, the table above shows that the standard deviation of gfcf is 0.12: this seems to correspond to the value on the $y$ -axis of the gfcf -> gfcf plot (though this does not hold true for the other plots). Q2. What is going on here? Are orthogonalised response functions just calculated differently, or is this a statsmodels quirk?
