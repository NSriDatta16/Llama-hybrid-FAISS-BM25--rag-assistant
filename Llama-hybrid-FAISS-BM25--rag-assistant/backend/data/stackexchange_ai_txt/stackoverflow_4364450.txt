apache virtual host question

After i 've set a virtual host in httpd.conf, why i still have to set the virtual host in domain registration organization? I'clarify for example , i've set phpmyadmin.mydomain.com as virtual host in httpd conf file, next, i've to go to http://www.dyndns.com/ to add phpmyadmin.mydomain.com as A record, so phpmyadmin.mydomain.com will be accessible.
