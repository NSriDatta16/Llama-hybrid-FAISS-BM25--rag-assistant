Estimating with the geometric mean

I heard about an interesting technique for making ballpark guesses: If you need a variable that you have no idea about (like the average number of pianos per household), you can try to come up with a range instead. So you can say that it must be larger than $min$ and smaller than $max$ Thenyou can take the geometric mean $\sqrt{max\cdot min}$ as an estimation. Is there any justification for using here a geometric mean instead of the simpler arithmetic mean?
