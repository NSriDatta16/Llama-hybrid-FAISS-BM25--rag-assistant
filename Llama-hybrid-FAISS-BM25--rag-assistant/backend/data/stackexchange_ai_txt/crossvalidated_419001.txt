Gaussian process classification / non-Gaussian likelihood / causes for that

according to chapter 3 from 1 -book, in case if there are discrete class labels, then the Gaussian likelihood is inappropriate. What are the exact reason for that and what would I reach if I use Gaussian likelihood despite of it (bad classification or would it be very poor). Thanks! cutout from the book: 1 - C. E.
