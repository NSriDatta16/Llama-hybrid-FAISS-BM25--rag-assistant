I guess I'd describe it as "no-op implementations" or perhaps use the term "adapter". As others have noted, Java provides a MouseAdapter class which does what you want. Strictly speaking, it doesn't quite fall into the definition of the Adapter pattern, which transforms one API into another, but frankly, I tend to be pragmatic about naming such things. Probably the most important thing to do is be clear that you intend for the method to have no implementation. In the specific case of the MouseAdapter , you probably don't want to go around throwing UnsupportedOperationException , but in general, it's probably a good signal that you don't intend to provide an implementation. A comment in the source code (or better, the method documentation) to explain just why you're not implementing the interface fully is usually necessary.
