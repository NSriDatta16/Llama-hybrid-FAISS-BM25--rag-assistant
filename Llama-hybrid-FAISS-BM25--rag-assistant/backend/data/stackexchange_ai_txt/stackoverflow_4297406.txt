Embedding Javascript in html document

I'm trying to implement the following code in a html document: $(function () { $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "/projects/img/Bathurst/PhotoGallery.xml", // location of your gallery's xml file dataType: "xml", success: function(xml) { $(xml).find('img').each(function() { var location = '/projects/img/Bathurst/'; // relative path to the directory that holds your images var url = $(this).attr('src'); var alt = $(this).attr('alt'); $(' ').html(' ').appendTo('#gallery-ul'); }); $(' ').html('Shadowbox.clearCache(); Shadowbox.setup();').appendTo('#photo-gallery'); } }); }); The code works perfectly when I use it in an external .js file, but I cant get it working when i implement it, it just renders with error in the code. II'm I missing something and dos anyone have a suggestion to this? The reason why I need to implement it, in case some one wonderes, is that I'm building a custom webapp and the line "/projects/img/Bathurst/PhotoGallery.xml" and "/projects/img/Bathurst/" is dynamic variables. All answers are very much appreciated! :)
