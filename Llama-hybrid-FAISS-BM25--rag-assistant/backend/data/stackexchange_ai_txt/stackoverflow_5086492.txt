The javac command line compiler will compile every source file given on the command line, and additionally everything on which these depend, if they don't have newer class files. The ant javac task tries to be a bit smarter, to avoid compiling always everything - it recompiles only those files which have changed (i.e. are newer than their respective class files). This does not pay attention to the case that maybe the dependency of some class changed, and thus other classes need to be recompiled too. In my current project, I simply do ant clean whenever I have problems on tests (and of course before any production deployment), which deletes all class files. But as vanza said, there is the depend task whose task is to find and delete all classes who depend on your changed classes - run this before your javac task and you should be good.
