Caching table at startup ASP.NET MVC Application

I have ASP.NET MVC application, where I keep all of drop down values in a table. So on average every page accesses this table 2-3 times. I want to cache (load into memory) this table on application startup. Is there a way to do so? I have googled, but helpful topics found. Thanks in advance.
