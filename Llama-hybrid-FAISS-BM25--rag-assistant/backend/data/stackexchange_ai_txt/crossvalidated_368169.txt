I am a little surprised that the relevant material for this question wasn't covered in the lectures prior to asking this question. If that is the case, it is pretty unreasonable on the part of your university to expect students to answer this question. I would suggest reading Chapter 2 on "Bayesian Decision Theory" in Pattern Classification by Duda, Hart and Stork. On the other hand, these set of slides [A] feel reasonably complete. You can, of course, find more material on Bayesian Decision Theory by doing a quick internet search. For the concept of Bayesian Decision Boundary, just look at the notion of Decision Surfaces in the referenced literature. [A] https://web.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/M2006/Bayesian.pdf
