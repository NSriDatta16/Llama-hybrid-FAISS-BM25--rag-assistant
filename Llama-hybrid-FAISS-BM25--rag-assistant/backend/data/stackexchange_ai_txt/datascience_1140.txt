pre-process your documents (some of the steps may be skipped) tokenize remove stop words stem or lemmatize do normalization (e.g. U.S.A. -> USA, météo -> meteo, etc) and orthographic correction perform phonetic normalization (e.g. with Soundex ) find equivalence classes (using thesauri, e.g. WordNet ) use a Vector Space model to represent documents (you may use TF, aforementioned TF-IDF or other models) do the same with the query: preprocess and represent it in the vector space find the most similar documents by computing the vector similarity (e.g. using the cosine similarity ) That's an outline of the Information Retrieval process Introduction to Information Retrieval by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Schütze is a very good book to get started in IR. Or just use Apache Solr to get everything you need out of the box (or Apache Lucene , that is used by Solr, to build your own application)
