The best treatment of power for logistic regression I have seen was in Breslow and Day's volume 2 of "Statistical Methods In Cancer Research". The starting point is to realize that the simplest case is a binomial test and that the variance depends on N and the case proportion by way of var(t) = N*p*(1-p). Rather delightful is the fact that the publisher now makes the entirety of both volumes available online and the "Design Considerations" chapter is at the link I embedded. See section 5.6
