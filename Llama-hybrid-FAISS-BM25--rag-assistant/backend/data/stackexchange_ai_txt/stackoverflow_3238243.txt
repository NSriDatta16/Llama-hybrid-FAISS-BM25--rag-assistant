Production-ready DTD or XSD for describing restaurant menus?

My current problem could best be solved by an industry standard DTD or XSD describing restaurant menus. I don't think such an industry standard exists. I'm hoping at least one organization has already published such a DTD/XSD, even if it's only for their own proprietary use. My goals are to store a wide range of arbitrary restaurant menus in XML format, with multi-lingual support, multiple-currency support, and various pricing methodologies (per person, per pound, per kilo, etc), among a few other more trivial requirements. Pointing me to related schemas is also welcome (perhaps for order-taking, record keeping, etc).
