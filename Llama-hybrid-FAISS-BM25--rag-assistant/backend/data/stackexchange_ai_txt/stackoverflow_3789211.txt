It would help a lot to see some of your former Apache configuration and current Nginx configuration to see how they're set up to put expiration headers on outbound files. This isn't a foolproof way to enforce caching, as you may know, but it sounds like "good enough" will work for you. Try an Nginx configuration block within your server{} block which reads like this: location ~* \.(mp3)$ { expires max; } That should set a far-future expiration date on your files and encourage the browser to cache them longer.
