Are these two 2D datasets the same and can they be separated with the XOR NN?

I'm a very beginner in the neural network topic. So I ran into a problem. I see on the online lectures: Famous example of a simple non-linearly separable data set, the XOR problem (Minsky 1969) in the right figure. but what about the left ones? is it same? Can we used XOR NN for separate both of them? (is it same or not 2D datasets)? I means with general neuron like as McCulloch is it possible via 3 nodes excepts input?
