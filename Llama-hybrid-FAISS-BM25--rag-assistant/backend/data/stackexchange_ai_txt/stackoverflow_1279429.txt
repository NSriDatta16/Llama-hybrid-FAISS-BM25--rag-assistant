You may have more dependencies on the CRT than you think. It tears down resources like thread local storage, and global class initializers are run by the CRT before main(). Consider linking with a static CRT, as someone said, and if you really really don't want to, use /NODEFAULTLIB and /ENTRY as someone else said. Oh, and instead of reworking memcpy, consider using the super-fast compiler intrinsic for it. You can turn on intrinsics with /Oi.
