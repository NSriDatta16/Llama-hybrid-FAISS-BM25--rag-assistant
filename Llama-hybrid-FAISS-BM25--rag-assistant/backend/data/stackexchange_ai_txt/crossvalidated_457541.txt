From a time series perspective, a unit root is characterized by this equation (1 - B) X(t) = a where B is the backshift operator i.e. B(X(t)) = X(t-1) and a is white noise This equation essentially states that X(t) - X(t-1) = a or X(t) = X(t-1) + a. So the new data is the same as the old data plus some white noise. Hence the unit root implies persistence of shocks (in your words). It implies non-stationarity since the forecast using this equation never settles to the mean even in the long run (unlike an ARMA model).
