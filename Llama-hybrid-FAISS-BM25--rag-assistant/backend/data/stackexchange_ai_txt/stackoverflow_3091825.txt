In my experience with numerous industrial Windows Mobile/Windows CE devices over the years (Symbol/Motorola, Toshiba, Intermec, etc), you can't guarantee much of anything around data integrity on the local storage. After a power failure event, the data will often be partially corrupted or, more frequently, completely gone. This isn't really the fault of Windows Mobile- it's just the way the flash storage subsystems are built. They're "non-volatile" on clean power on/off, but power fail on in-progress writes is usually fatal. Our current Symbol/Moto WM6 devices get bricked and need reflashing every few weeks when someone drains the battery too far. If you have a mostly-available network, I'd suggest offloading or augmenting your local storage with device-specific network storage where possible (eg fileshare, webservice, etc). Bottom line: non-volatile storage on these devices is a convenience and shouldn't be trusted with important long-term storage.
