iphone/cocoa custom ui element

I'm very interested in using the typical mac 'tag' element in an iphone app (see specimen 1 - The Blue round element'). I dont really have any idea of how to implement it except for copying the color and making it a uibutton. I would like to be able to drag this tag from one 'section' to another 'section'. Can someone point me in the right direction of how this would be done. Surely a simple library is available somewhere.
