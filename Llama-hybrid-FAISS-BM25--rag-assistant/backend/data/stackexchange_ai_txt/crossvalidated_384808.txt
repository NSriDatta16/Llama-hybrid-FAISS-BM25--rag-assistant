Conditional logistic regression for calculation odds ratios

I want to calculate the crude and adjusted odds ratios for exposure to occupational risk factors such as aluminum and fossil fuels in my case control study. My cases are 180 demented patients and I have 370 controls. Which type of logistic regression model should I use? When I adjust for age and education the odds ratios get bigger, isn't that wrong?
