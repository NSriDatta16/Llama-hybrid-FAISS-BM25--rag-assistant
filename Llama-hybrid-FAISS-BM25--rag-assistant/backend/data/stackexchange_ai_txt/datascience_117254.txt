How to translate text automatically using Google Translate API (or any other approach) in python

I have a dataset of reviews from TripAdvisor and I would like to translate non-English reviews into English. The reviews are in many different languages: my dataset contains reviews in 44 different languages including English reviews which are around a quarter of the total, followed by Italian, German, Spanish and French reviews which are respectively 14%, 11% 6%, and 5.5% of the reviews. I detect the different languages using the langdetect package . from langdetect import detect language = detect(title) Then I tried to use the package googletrans to translate the text. However, when I tried to perform a small test I get the following error: from googletrans import Translator translator = Translator() translator.translate('Buongiorno mi chiamo Alberto') Does anyone know a way to translate reviews (knowing or not the language ) to English using python for a dataset of around 10k reviews?
