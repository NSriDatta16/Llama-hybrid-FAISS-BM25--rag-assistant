How would one go about developing a curses-based UI?

I'm planning to develop a GUI application that uses curses. The idea is to provide an extra interface for a web interface, so that everything on the web site could also be done via the UI. Basically, it should be platform independent: the user would have to SSH to the server after which the UI would automatically take over. First of all, is this doable? As far as I understand, it would be platform independent as long as the end-user had the proper terminal software installed. Correct me, if I'm wrong. I was planning to use Python for this, as it is the language I'm the most proficient in. Python comes with the ncurses library and Urwid , which I've been told, is quite good. After having a quick test with Urwid, I had some problems. The thing is, I'm quite worried that I won't find answers to the problems that I will encounter down the road because apparently curses UI-s aren't all the rage nowadays. Documentation and examples are thus quite scarce. In conclusion, should really I embark on this and quit my whining or drop the idea altogether? Any other suggestions?
