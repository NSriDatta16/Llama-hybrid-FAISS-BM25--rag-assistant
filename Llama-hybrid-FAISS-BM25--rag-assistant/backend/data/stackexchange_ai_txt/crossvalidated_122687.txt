How to create dummy variables for interaction term between categorical variables?

I'm building a logistic regression model estimating the probability of hospitalization based on several predictor variables, including indicator variables for various diagnosis categories (coded as Yes=1, No=0) and types of medication (coded as Yes=1, No=0). I've included an interaction term for several diagnosis & medication categories, for example (Major_depression)*(Antidepressant), to estimate the odds ratio of hospitalization among patients suffering an illness who take proper medication vs. those who do not take proper medication. As it is, including the term Major_depression x Antidepressant in the model makes a blanket comparison of those who suffer major depression and take medication (Major_depression x Antidepressant = 1 x 1 = 1) vs. all other combinations (Major_depression x Antidepressant = 1 x 0 = 0, or = 0 x 1 = 0, or = 0 x 0 = 0). How do I create a variable specifically comparing those suffering depression who do take medication vs. those suffering depression who do not take medication while ignoring the less interesting cases of people who are not depressed? Would this be the correct contrast coding? x1 = 1 if Major_depression = 1 and Antidepressant = 1, x1 = 0 if Major_depression = 0 and Antidepressant = 1, x1 = 0 if Major_depression = 0 and Antidepressant = 0, x1 = -1 if Major_depression = 1 and Antidepressant = 0.
