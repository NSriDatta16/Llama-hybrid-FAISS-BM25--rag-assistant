Algorithm for data filter

Can you suggest me an algorithm for filtering out data. I am using javascript and trying to write out a filter function which filters an array of data.I have an array of data and an array of filters, so in order to apply each filter on every data, I have written 2 for loops foreach(data) { foreach(filter) { check data with filter } } this is not the proper code, but in short that what my function does, the problem is this takes a huge amount of time, can someone suggest a better method. I am using the Mootools library and the array of data is JSON array Details of data and Filter Data is JSON array of lets say user, so it will be data = [{"name" : "first", "email" : "first@first", "age" : "20"}. {"name" : "second", "email" : "second@second", "age" : "21"} {"name" : "third", "email" : "third@third", "age" : "22"}] Array of filters is basically self define class for different fields of data alFilter[0] = filterName; alFilter[1] = filterEmail; alFilter[2] = filterAge; So when I enter the first for loop, I get a single JSON opbject (first row) in the above case. When I enter the second for loop (filters loop) I have a filter class which extracts the exact field on which the current filter would work and check the filter with the appropriate field of the data. So in my example foreach(data) { foreach(filter) { //loop one - filter name // loop two - filter email // loop three - filter age } } when the second loop ends i set a flag denoting if the data has been filtered or not and depending on it the data is displayed.
