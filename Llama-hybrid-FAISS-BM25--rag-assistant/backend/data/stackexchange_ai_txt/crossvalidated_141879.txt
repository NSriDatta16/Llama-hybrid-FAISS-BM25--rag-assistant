What are the advantages of using a Bayesian neural network

Recently I read some papers about the Bayesian neural network (BNN) [Neal, 1992] , [Neal, 2012] , which gives a probability relation between the input and output in a neural network. Training such a neural network is through MCMC which is different from the traditional back-propagation algorithm. My question are: What is the advantage of using such a neural network? More specifically, could you provide some examples which better fit BNN rather than NN?
