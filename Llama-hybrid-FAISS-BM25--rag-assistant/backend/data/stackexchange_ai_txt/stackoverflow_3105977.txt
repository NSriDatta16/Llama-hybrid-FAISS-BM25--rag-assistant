Which is worse? Depends who you ask. Possibly if you ask the DDD ultra-purist they'll say logic in the database is worse. If you ask pretty much anyone else, IMHO, especially your end users, pragmatic developers and the people who pay for the hardware and the software development, they'll probably say a large performance hit is worse. DDD has much to commend it, as do lots of other design approaches, but they all fall down if you dogmatically follow them to the point of coming up with a "pure" design at the expense of real world considerations, such as performance. If your really are having to perform this sort of query on data, then the database is almost certainly far better at performing the task. Alternatively, have you "missed a trick" here. Is your design, however DDD, actually not right? Overall - use your tools appropriately. By all means strive to keep logic cleanly seperated in your service layer, but not when that logic is doing large amounts of work that a database is designed for.
