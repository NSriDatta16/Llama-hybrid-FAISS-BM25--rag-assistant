In my experience, developers pad numbers due to uncertainty. Are your product owners clear in their business requirements? Are the stories sufficiently small to estimate against? Your 2 choices indicate to me that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of Scrum. The promise of Scrum is not getting the same result, just faster. It is the ability to iterate quickly, respond to feedback and alter course. The foundation of Scrum is the self running team. If you don't have teams you trust, Scrum probably isn't for your organization. As PÃ©ter said in his response, team motivation is key and the quickest way to kill that is to undermine them. If the team feels management doesn't support or believe in them they will have no reason to make aggressive estimates and will simply cover their own butts. It's your job as a manager to help them succeed.
