There are no hard and fast rules. The different forms of positioning are all good at different things. The majority of work is usually best done with static positioning (it is the least fragile option), but absolute positioning is very good on occasion. Relative positioning, on the other hand, is something I've never used except for animation (on elements which are statically positioned until JavaScript gets involved), establishing a containing block for absolute positioning (so the element itself isn't moved at all), and (very very rarely) a one or two pixel nudge of an element.
