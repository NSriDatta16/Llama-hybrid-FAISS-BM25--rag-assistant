Modelling zero-inflated percentage data (vegetation cover) from single predictor variable

I am quite new to regression in R. I would like to analyse the relationship between 'Vegetation Cover'(response variable) and a single predictor variable 'Canopy Openness'. 'Vegetation Cover' is a percentage (sum of 3 microplots per plot) and contains many (true) zeros (> 50 %). 'Canopy Openness' is averaged from 3 measurements inside the same plot and a percentage as well. This is what the data looks like: 'data.frame': 42 obs. of 3 variables: $ Plot_ID: int 1 2 3 5 9 10 12 13 14 17 ... $ VegCover: num 0 38.4667 36.9 5.1 0.0333 ... $ CanOpe: num 12.71 51.04 60.16 6.33 18.41 ... The distribution of the response variable: if [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8WR98.png Am I right to look for zero-inflated beta regression models? If so, which R-package would you recommend to use on this data? gamlss , pscl or brm ? Any advice is greatly appreciated!
