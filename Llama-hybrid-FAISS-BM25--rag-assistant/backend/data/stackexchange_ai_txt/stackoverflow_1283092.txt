How do I get ALL of my product items to show up on the homepage of magento 1.3.2?

I installed Magento v1.3.2.3 and added most of my product inventory. However, I can only get 5 items to display on the homepage. I need all my products to show up there. How? This is currently the code I am using. {{block type="catalog/product_new" name="home.catalog.product.new" alias="product_homepage" template="catalog/product/new.phtml"}} I found this on the magento community forum.
