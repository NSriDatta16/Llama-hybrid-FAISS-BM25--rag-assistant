Is there a way to get a list of all the CSS applied to a HTML fragment or page?

I know it's easy to get the CSS that is applied to a single node in HTML, using tools like the Firebug extension for Firefox, etc. But is there a way to see all the CSS that is in effect on an entire page, or a larger fragment of HTML? Specifically, we are cleaning up our one extremely large CSS file into smaller modules and would like to find out what CSS is used on a certain page, so we can move all the non-used CSS to another module.
