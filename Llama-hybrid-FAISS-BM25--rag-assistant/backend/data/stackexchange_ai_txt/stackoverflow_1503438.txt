(WPF) UI best practices

we are curring analyzing whether to implement a solution for a software application by using either WPF or WinForms. Apart from that decision, I just wanted to ask whether someone of you has good resources in terms of UI design (i.e. layout) (papers, case studies, links, books...), preferably targeted to WPF. I do not necessarily intend usability rules in general (like accessibility etc..), but more specifically on how to organize the UI. Like this: http://healthcare.codeplex.com/ The application is a business application, not an ERP system but it goes in that direction. Thx a lot Juri
