How are PNG files defined as drawable objects resized based on the resolution of the Android phone?

I have a PNG file that is 32x32 pixels. I use 8 of these as drawables in a row for my app. These drawables are not in the hdpi, mdpi, or ldpi folders. I’ve found that when starting any of the 3 standard size emulators, the screen view with all 8 drawables looks pretty much the same. I note that the ldpi emulator I’m using (QVGA) has a resolution of 240x320. 8 x 32 = 256, so since I can see all my drawables (and space in-between) I’m betting something is changing their size. I’ve read the Supporting Multiple Screens document at the Android developers page, but I still don’t understand what is actually happening. Could you put your own words to explain what is happening to the size of my drawables and how the SDK knows to automatically modify them?
