Is there a command line tool for data visualization and analysis?

I'm searching for a command line tool (for linux) to generate plots out of a data file. I tried to play with gnuplot at first but it's curve fitting capabilities aren't that good. Then I tried R but I couldn't find a way to write a vector (little arrow over the sign) or a thermal average (\left \langle \right \rangle in LaTeX). I there some hidden plugin for any of those I couldn't find to complete the task?
