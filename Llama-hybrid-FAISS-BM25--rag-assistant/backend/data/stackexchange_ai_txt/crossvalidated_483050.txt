This is a practitioner not statisticians advice (since I am not the later). There are several ways to approach this. Ideally, but its very difficult in practice, you can try to find out why the model you developed departs from the actual results. It would help greatly to know which time series method you are using in that regard since they will address this differently. ARIMA, ESM, ARDL.....there are many more. There might be outliers, there might be a structural break or process change, and many other things. If you know what is wrong then there are suggested solutions for many of them. Simplest way to do address the problem is to generate a ratio between what you predict and what you get and create a counter weight to address this. So if the answer is consistently 2 and you predict 1 you can multiply future answers by .5 We do that where I work to deal with the problems in the models created by the covid-19 (except we re-estimate each month based on the last month discrepancy because we don't assume the error is consistent). Of course then you have to see if it works with future data (and the process or external reality means it may not). Another option is to change the time series method you are using.
