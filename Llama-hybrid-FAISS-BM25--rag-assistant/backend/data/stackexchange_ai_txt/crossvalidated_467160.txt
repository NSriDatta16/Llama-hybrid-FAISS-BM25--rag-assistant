I don't know of python package that explicitly fits splines, but you should be able to achieve your goal with gradient boosting in the most recent version of scikit-learn ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_0_23_0.html ). Specifically, you can fit a generalized additive model using HistGradienBoostingRegressor and setting max_depth=1 , which ensures that there will be no interactions between features (if that's what you want). You can then use monotonic_cst to specify the monotonicity constraints for each feature. This option also exists in XGBoost .
