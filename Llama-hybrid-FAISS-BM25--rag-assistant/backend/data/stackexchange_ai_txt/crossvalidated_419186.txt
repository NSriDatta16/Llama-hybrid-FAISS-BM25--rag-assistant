Big Sample size, Small coefficients, significant results. What should I do?

I did some quantitative research and I used Rank-Order logistic regression in Stata. The the independent variables have almost 0 p-value which shows they have significant effect on dependent variable. But, since the sample size is big (35000 records) and coefficients are so small (e.g. 0.0001) then it shows that there is no relationship because when sample size is so big everything can get significant. I tested the model with only 5000 records as well and I got the significant result as well. What do you recommend me to do? should I use small sample size then the reviewers of my paper will not point to the problem of big sample size... or is there any other way that I can report my results and show that in fact the variables have significant effect? I will appreciate any help. Thanks
