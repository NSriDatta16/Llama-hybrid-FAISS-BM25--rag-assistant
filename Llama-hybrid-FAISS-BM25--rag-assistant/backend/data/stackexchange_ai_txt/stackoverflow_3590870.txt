where can i find papers/optimization concepts about email server/email storage?

I would like to know about the optimization techniques in email server/storage. Where do i get this information? I understand that gmail and outlook are not open source. But the manner in which they store emails at the server side is a problem that could've been dealt with by researchers or programmers already. Have such things been published somewhere? I am not concerned about how email is sent/received/MTA etc. Just concerned abt the way its stored. Wikipedia talks only about transfer protocols but nothing related to storage. Plz point me to some articles. Thx, Venu
