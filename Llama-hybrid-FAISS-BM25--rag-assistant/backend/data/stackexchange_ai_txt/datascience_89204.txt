Answering your questions, it is important to remember that this kind of transformations, in this case the change in the minority class distribution by oversampling or in the majority class by undersampling , must be only done in the training dataset , so you do not alter the real situation when you want to apply your model (which, at training time, is your test and hold-out set). About dealing with class imbalance, in addition to resampling methods, you can apply balancing weights to the learning algorithm itself, via parameters like class_weight for some classifiers with scikit-learn (for instance in this one ) or via scale_pos_weight with XGBoost (read this )
