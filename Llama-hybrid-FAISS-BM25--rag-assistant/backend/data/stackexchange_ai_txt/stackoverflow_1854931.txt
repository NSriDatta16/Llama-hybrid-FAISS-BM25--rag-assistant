Django FlatPages vs Django-CMS

Without going into too much detail, I'm building a Django site and I wanted to implement a CMS solution, while having a lot of flexibility with page layouts, navigation, and organization. It'd be mainly used for our documentation, and so far I've had a lot of headaches trying to figure out the ins-and-outs of Django CMS. Would an experienced Django developer recommend I use flat-pages with like tiny_mce instead?
