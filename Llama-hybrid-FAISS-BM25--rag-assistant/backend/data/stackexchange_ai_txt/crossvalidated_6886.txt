How to find the best input value for this simple problem?

Suppose I have a neural network, with input variables $a, b, c, d, f, g$ and output variables$ m, n, o, p, q$. Given different input values, the neural network will output corresponding $m, n, o, p, q$. Now I want find out the best input values which can maxmize $m, n$, while minimize $o,p,q$ with different weights as well. So how can I find the best $a, b, c, d, f, g$? Currently I use a simple way, which calculate $x= w_1 m + w_2n+w_3 \frac{1}{o}+w_4 \frac{1}{p}+w_5 \frac{1}{q}$, then find the input to get maxmization of x. However this simple method assume $m, n, o, p, q$ are independent, which is not the case. So how should I solve this problem? Many thanks.
