I'm not sure that a volcano plot is the best way to proceed with only 12 predictors per case. Your model seems to be simply responders versus non-responders as an outcome variable, with the gene-signature scores as predictors. That suggests a logistic regression model that incorporates all of the gene-signature scores into a single model. Volcano plots are often useful when you have hundreds to thousands of multiple individual genes tested for association with an outcome and want to see which genes are most likely to be reliably associated individually with outcome. But now all those individual gene expression values have been reduced to 12 gene-signature scores. A volcano plot on these values would thus only have 12 points. Furthermore, each of the signatures would be evaluated separately. It's quite possible that outcomes are associated with some combination of gene signatures, which the separate tests in a volcano plot would miss. The regression coefficients for the individual gene signatures would indicate which ones are most associated with outcome. By the way, as a practical matter you might want to pre-process the data to set the numerical values that are very close to 0 to 0 exactly. It looks like all your values below 1e-03 are effectively 0.
