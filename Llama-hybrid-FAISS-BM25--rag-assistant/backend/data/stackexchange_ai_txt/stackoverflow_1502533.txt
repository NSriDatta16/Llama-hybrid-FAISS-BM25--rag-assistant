Like Tom E stated, do take caution while considering going down the record/playback path for test automation. See Uncle Bob's article on Ruining your Test Automation Strategy . The main problem is that the record/playback tools couple the tests to the GUI which makes them very fragile. Uncle Bob's article does point out that some testing needs to occur on the GUI...but that he recommends stubbing out the business rule code. Sorry I can't provide you with a specific UI test automation tool...but hopefully this caveat will help you make the best decision on how to employ the tool that you eventually use.
