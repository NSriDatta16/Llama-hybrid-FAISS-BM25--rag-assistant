I had a problem along those lines a few years ago. I installed WinPcap on the server and had it log all of the network activity. Turns out an errant 3rd party control was sending ~1MB of garbage data back to the server every time a client callback of any sort occurred. I removed it and the page load/callback performance shot up about 500%.
