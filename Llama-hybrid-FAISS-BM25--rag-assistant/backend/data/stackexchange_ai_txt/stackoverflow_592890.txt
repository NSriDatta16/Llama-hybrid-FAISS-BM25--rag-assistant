Client Certs on IIS - not sure I get it - experiences please?

Looking for some advice about the use of client certs to retro-fit access control to an existing app. Our company has an existing intranet app (classic ASP/IIS) which we licence to others. Up till now it's been hosted within each organisation that used it and the security consisted of "if you're able to access the intranet you're able the access the application". I'm now looking for a way to host this app externally so that other organisations who don't wish to host it themselves can use it (each new client would have their own installation). All user in the new organisation would have a client cert so what I'd like to do is use the 'Require Client Certificate' stuff in IIS. It allows you to say "if Organisation=BigClientX then pretend they're local userY". What I would prefer is something that says "if Organisation=BigClientX then let them access resources in virtualdirectoryZ otherwise ignore them". I would be very happy to buy an addon (perhaps an ISAPI filter ?) which would do this for me if that was the best approach. Any advice / war stories would be welcomed .
