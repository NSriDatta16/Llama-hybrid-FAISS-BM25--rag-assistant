Edit: If it turns out you are having user agent string problems, you can set the user-agent php uses by creating and running a file with the following code in it: I think you'll have to restart IIS after setting this, but not 100% on that. Note: this is a random user agent string I pulled, there are many out there, you can set it to pretty much anything you want. There are many more at: http://www.useragentstring.com/ To check if allow_url_fopen is on, do this: Create a php file on your server, name it whatever you desire. Put this into your file Execute the script on your server through a web browser or fiddler if you are using that check for all necessary settings. Let us know what it is, then we can walk you through setting it to what you need.
