Assuming that you want to construct a model of the 1x100 vector, based on the 45x100 matrix, I am not convinced that PCA will do what you think. PCA can be used to select variables for model estimation, but this is a somewhat indirect way to gather a set of model features. Anyway, I suggest reading both: Principal Components Analysis and... Putting PCA to Work ...both of which provide code in MATLAB not requiring any Toolboxes.
