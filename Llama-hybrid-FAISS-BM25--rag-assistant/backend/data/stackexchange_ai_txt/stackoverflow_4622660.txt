Thats because there is specific date/time wire format that ASP.NET Ajax expects - its of form of "\/Date(x)\/" , where x is the number of ms elapsed since Jan. 1, 1970 at midnight UTC. So essentially, you need to use some helper function that will convert your JS dates into the needed format while calling the service (and vice versa, date/time json from service to JS date/time object). So, you have to change code fragment such as `'", start:/Date('+ start.getTime()+')/, end...` to '", start:"\\\/Date(' + this.getTime() + ')\\\/", end...'
