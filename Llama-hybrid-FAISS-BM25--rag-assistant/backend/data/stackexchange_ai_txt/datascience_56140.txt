The multiply() function performs element-wise multiplication. For example, let us consider 1D CNN for simplicity and you pass two inputs of batch size b with a tensor length of 5, the output will be (b,5) as it's element-wise multiplication. Let us assume two tensors of length 5 as follows: [1,2,3,4,5] and [6,7,8,9,10] , the result shall be [6,14,24,36,50] as it's just element-wise multiplication. In the case of dot() , it takes the dot product, and the dot product for 1D is mathematically defined as: a.b = sum(a_i * b_i) , where i ranges from 0 to n-1; where n is the number of elements in vector a and b. (For 2-D , you can consider it as matrix multiplication). So the result shall be of length (b,1) where b is the batch size. In case of out example, the results of dot product of [1,2,3,4,5] and [6,7,8,9,10] shall be [130]
