The Drake Equation states that N = R * d * p * e * c * x * y * z where N is the probability that doing this will result in the bankruptcy of your company, leaving you and all your co-workers unemployed and starving. R is the number of hard drives discarded every year without first being erased d is the fraction of those hard drives that are fished out of dumpsters p is the fraction of recovered drives that are ever plugged in and fired up e is the number of such drives that are subsequently listed on eBay because their contents look interesting c is the number of competitors you have who browse eBay looking for trade secrets x is the probability that your discarded drive contains something they can use y is the probability that they do actually use that information z is the probability that their use of such information ruins your company. To estimate the risk that someone will work out it was you and sue/prosecute you for the damage you caused, calculate (N / t) * m where t is the number of people on your team, and m is the number of managers who are paying enough attention to work out who did what. If you can prove that any of the coefficients involved is zero, then your strategy is risk-free. Otherwise there's a very small chance you'll bankrupt your company, starve your colleagues and end up in jail.
