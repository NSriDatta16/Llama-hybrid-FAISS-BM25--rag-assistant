Well, of course it is a matter of taste, but for a windows-only environment i would prefer windows forms ( which you theoretically could try to run on other platforms via Mono ) or WPF (which is a best option for a fat client application as far as i am concerned ). I saw a lot of really ugly Swing applications, which are however cross platform. Indeed, with a little extra work you can get almost native look on each platform. You can use NetBeans for drag/drop with Swing.
