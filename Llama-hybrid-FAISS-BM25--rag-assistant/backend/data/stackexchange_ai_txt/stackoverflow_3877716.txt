You haven't allocated any storage for Base.Name. You're scanning a string into a a pointer that doesn't point to any storage. Allocate some space for the string. The problem is that you don't know how big a string will be copied in using scanf. Suppose you malloc 256 bytes and then scanf loads in a 300 byte string? Either allocate a string sufficiently large to handle all possible results from scanf, or modify your scanf to limit the characters, like: baseStruct.Name = malloc(sizeof(char) * 256); scanf("%256s", baseStruct.Name);
