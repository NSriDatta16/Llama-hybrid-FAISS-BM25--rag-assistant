in such case, you will end up with a 2 dimensional fz(x,y) given that x and y are not independent (2 deg of freedom). you might dicretize and calcualte block by block the xy plane, as no elegant formula might exist. if the dependence realtionshio is polynomic you might apply various convolutional / Fourrier transform tricks.
