Defining Trend as a Linear growth over time . Although some trends are somehow linear (see Apple stock price), and although time series chart looks like a line chart where you can find linear regression, most trends are not linear. There are Step changes like changes when something happened in a specific point in time that changed the measure behavior ( "The bridge collapsed and no cars is going over it since "). Another popular trend is "Buzz" - exponential growth and a similar sharp decline afterward ( "Our marketing campaign was a huge success, but the effect faded after couple of weeks" ). Knowing the right model (Logistic Regression, etc.) of the trend in the time series is crucial in the ability to detect it in the time series data.
