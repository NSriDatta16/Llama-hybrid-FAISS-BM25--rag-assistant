What are the correct edge case values of precision and recall and how to integrate them into cross validation?

I'm doing 10-fold cross validation on a dataset. But in some folds there are edge cases that the denominator in precision-recall calculation is zero (tp + fp =0). What are the correct values for precision and recall in this case? And what is the correct way of doing cross-validation (should I include these results when reporting average precision-recall over 10 folds)? PS: This question is very similar to What are correct values for precision and recall when the denominators equal 0? Thanks in advance : -)
