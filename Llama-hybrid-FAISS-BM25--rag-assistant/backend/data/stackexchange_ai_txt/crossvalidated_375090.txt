Can causal Bayes Nets compute counterfactuals? If so, are they "worse" than structural causal model counterfactuals?

I was under the impression that you couldn't perform counterfactual reasoning on causal Bayes nets using inference algorithms and do-calculus, but I realized recently that this might not be true. Does anyone know conclusively? If causal Bayesian networks can answer counterfactual queries, are they somehow inferior to those computed by structural causal models?
