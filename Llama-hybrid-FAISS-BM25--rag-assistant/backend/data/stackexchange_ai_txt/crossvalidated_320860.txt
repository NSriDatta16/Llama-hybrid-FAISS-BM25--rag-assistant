You can use the "reddit 'best' ranking" strategy, i.e. score each coin using one of the bounds of a confidence/credible interval. Here's a detailed discussion of this strategy: http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html Concretely, the reddit approach here is (or at least was) to treat voting events as bernoulli trials, so a downvote is a failure and an upvote is a success. Then, they calculate a wilson score interval to find the lower bound of the success (upvote) probability of a particular item subject to the amount of evidence they have. As they get more observations, the lower bound will converge on the mean success probability. This way, if they have two items with with similar observed success frequencies (upvotes/votes) but significantly different numbers of votes, they'll favor the item that has more votes.
