I would divide tasks by complexity, smaller tasks for the juniors, bigger tasks for intermediates, etc. But the complete task from mining to interpreting the results of a trained model. How would juniors otherwise be able to 'grow' from data cleansing to model training? Data cleansing and model training are probably too closely related to divide between team members. Where would you normalize data, and how do you assure that both team members use the same assumptions? And the Junior has to learn how to clean data properly for models. I do think that Data Science projects, more than other projects in Engineering, have uncertain outcomes. Setting milestones, S.M.A.R.T. targets, monitoring, supervision, reviews, interpretation should be done on a daily basis by Seniors.
