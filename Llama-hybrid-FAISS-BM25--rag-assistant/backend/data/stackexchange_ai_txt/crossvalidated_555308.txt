I found the terminology for what I am trying to do, it is very close to "maximum entropy bootstrap" ( https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v029i05 ). One difference is that the bootstrap is performed on a larger sample that includes nearby values of the original time series, which solves the problem of repeating adjacent values. This method is actually powerful for bootstrapping time series.
