Define the Lagrangian $$L_C(\beta, \nu) = \frac{1}{2n} \|y-X\beta\|_2^2 + \nu (\|\beta\|_2^2 - C).$$ Notice that the constrained estimator \begin{align*} \tilde\beta_C & = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p \, : \, \|\beta\|_2^2 \leq C} \frac{1}{2n} \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 \\ & = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} \left( \max_{\nu \ge 0} \left\{ \frac{1}{2n} \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 + \nu \left( \|\beta\|_2^2 - C \right) \right\} \right) \\ & = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} \left( \max_{\nu \ge 0} \, L_C(\beta, \nu) \right). \end{align*} Also, notice the penalized estimator $$\hat\beta_\lambda = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} \frac{1}{2n} \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2 = \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p} L_K(\beta, \lambda), \tag{1}$$ for an arbitrary $K$. In particular, it holds for $K=C$. As explained in my answer at Expressing the LASSO regression constraint via the penalty parameter , we have the relationship that $C = \|\hat\beta_\lambda\|_2^2$ and $\lambda = -\frac{\partial \frac{1}{2n} \|y - X \beta\|_2^2}{\partial \|\beta\|_2^2} |_{\tilde\beta_C}$. The above formulations of the estimators shows that the constrained estimator is the first component of a saddle point of the Lagrangian $L_C$ (which is contrary to your comments about joint-minimization following equation $(2)$.) From this, we also see that the dual variable $\nu$ that you seek is the other component of the saddle point. We will leverage this interpretation to provide an answer to your questions. We will assume that $C>0$ so that Slater's condition holds and $C Since $C>0$, Slater's condition holds, so we know that there exists a saddle point of $L_C$, call it $(\tilde\beta_C, \tilde\nu_C)$. This means that $$\tilde\beta_C \in \arg\min_{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^p} L_C(\beta,\tilde\nu_C), \tag{2}$$ as we mentioned above, and $\tilde\nu_C \in \arg\max_{\nu \ge 0} L_C(\tilde\beta_C, \nu).$ (As an aside, it follows from these two relationships (after some algebra) that strong duality holds. Also, this second relationship can be used to determine the relationship between $C$ and $\lambda$.) Since $C 0$ are in bijective correspondence. Since the objective function $L_C(\beta, \tilde\nu_C)$ is strongly convex, it follows that the estimator is unique for each $C$. It also follows that the dual variable $\tilde\nu_C$ is uniquely determined by the estimator $\tilde\beta_C$. Therefore, by $(1)$ and $(2)$, we know that $\tilde\nu_C = \lambda$.
