rails 3 internationalization / localization - embeddings links in translated text

I need to embed links in my translated texts. I followed this post , but it doesn't seem to work in rails 3 anymore as the html tags don't get rendered properly. Anyone knows how to get this done in rails 3? Update: Apparently, the html tags can be escaped by using the html_safe method. But does anyone know if there's another way to solve this problem without using html_safe? I would like to avoid unescaping my html tags if possible, b/c I've encountered a situation where I have to pass in a text field into my translation, and I would like to avoid unescaping any strings that are user inputted.
