You can try to use Adeptia or JitterBit (or any other ETL system) to connect to Magento API. Both offer generic export/import options (files, DB, FTP, webservices) and have plugins to integrate with various 3rd party platforms. That is the way BridgeConnect (eBridge software) worked - they offered ready-made connectors to various platforms. Magento also allows to quite easily extend its API so you can add any webservices that are missing from current core API (eg creating order in Magento)
