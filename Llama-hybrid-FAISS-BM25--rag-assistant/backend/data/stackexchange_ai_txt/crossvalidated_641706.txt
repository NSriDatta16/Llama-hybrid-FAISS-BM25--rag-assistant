Comparison of roc-auc values â€‹through cross-validation for feature selection

Through 10 cv, the roc-auc value was obtained as follows. At first, I tried to select the feature with the highest average roc-auc value, but I had doubts about whether the difference in these scores was statistically significant. What should I do to resolve this question? roc auc value 0.848, 0.847, 0.848,0.848,0.845,0.844,0.844,0.842,0.84,0.835, 0.836 I removed the variable with the lowest variable importance value and then calculated the roc-auc value again.
