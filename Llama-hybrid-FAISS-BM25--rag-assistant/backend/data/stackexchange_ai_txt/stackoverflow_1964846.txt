When I first learnt Java back in 2001, I used TextPad for java programming, for me it was very good, I had write code to develop GUI, no drag and drop option, simple pure code. Then I used JBuilder, Now I am using Netbeans. My suggestion is start with something which will concentrate on pure coding rather than depending on IDE's drag on drop features. When you will comfortable with coding then you can move on to more sophisticated IDE which I mentioned above. Good luck!
