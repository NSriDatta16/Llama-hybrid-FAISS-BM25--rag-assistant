Python Global Variable: sharing between function class then function

I'm trying to get the following global variable storage_i to be accessible to the lvl1 function, I have been able to pass it to other functions inside of the class birdofprey but I can't get it outside of that framework. I have looked around at using global variables between functions, etc, and I have also seen global var usage discouraged. But, basically I am trying to have the value of storage_i summed up from all the threads. So if that could be done without a global variable that would also be great. Any help would be appreciated.
