Windows Form Fonts Questions Part 1

I have some user controls in a windows form. I wonder if i set the Font property of the main form, will its child get a) a copy of the new Font , or b) a reference to the new Font , or c) nothing? Does a font need to be disposed? For example, can I do the following code safely? form.Font = new Font(...); Will a font get disposed automatically when the parent ( Form or UserControl ) is disposed? Thanks, Gilbert
