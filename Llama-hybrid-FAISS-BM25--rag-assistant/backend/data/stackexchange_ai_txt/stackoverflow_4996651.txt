Steganography, coming from greek Steganos(i'm greek :P) is the art of hiding messages. While cryptography is about scrambling a message, steganography is about a person not being able to locate the message. There are many tools that do this procedure for you. Writing a tool like that can be a complicated procedure i think, though i haven't tried to do that. You would need to create a sophisticated approach of correctly using unused or seemingly not important image pixels or data, in order to add your own message, file etc. For some more information, please take a look at : http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/steganography-revealed
