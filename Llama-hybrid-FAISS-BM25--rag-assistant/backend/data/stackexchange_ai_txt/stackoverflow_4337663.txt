The intent of that vendor branch management scheme is to put the releases of the 3rd party product into your repository such that you establish a history between releases. If you simply import release 1.0 to repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0 and import release 1.1 to repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.1 , there will be no history in Subversion between releases 1.0 and 1.1, and you will not be able to view the changes between release 1.0 and 1.1 in Subversion. Sure, you can checkout both and use GNU diff to compare them, but you are not taking advantage of the power of Subversion in that case. The history is important if you are creating your own branch and wish to merge the changes between 1.0 and 1.1 into your branch. The history is also import if you wish to view the changes in Subversion between releases 1.0 and 1.1. Finally, having a history results in a more efficient storage of the data, because only the delta between 1.0 and 1.1 is stored. By importing release 1.0 to repos/vendor/libcomplex/current and then adding release 1.1 to that same directory, you establish a history between 1.0 and 1.1.
