I have seen false negatives with nm so I do not trust it. When I want to check to see if an object file has debug info I run objdump -x on the object file or library and look to see if there are headers that say dbg, stabs, or dwarf. This is not the most elegant solution by any means, but it has never been wrong and it is real easy to see the difference in when you have a debug and release build to compare.
