Typically, I create a separate .cs file per class. In addition, I organize the files to match the class namespace. As the projects get much larger, this simplifies organization, as you always know where to find a class within the project. This becomes more important as more people are working on the solution, as well. One class per file also can be beneficial since the folder structure gives you a sense of a namespace's complexity, which has helped me realize when I need to split namespaces because they've gotten too complex. I see that I have Form1.cs which includes all of the classes relevant to "Form1". Instead of organizing this way, I'd recommend separating these into separate files. If you have quite a few classes relating to a specific operation (performed by, or accessed via, Form1), I'd consider putting these into their own namespace. I'd also strongly recommend renaming "Form1" to something more meaningful, such as "EmployeeForm". This will make it easier to understand and maintain your code going forward.
