Well, I depends on the type of Machine Learning model you will use. If this model is linear, such as Logistic Regression or LDA, it is better to engineer this variable before training the model. If the model is a Decision Tree, Random Forest for example, the initial distribution doesn't affect much the outcome as the splitting technique is optimized by the own model. In the case of a linear model, I suggest you to apply a Yeo-Johnson transformation on this variable. You can find the details in Wikipedia and it is implemented and easy to use in Scipy .
