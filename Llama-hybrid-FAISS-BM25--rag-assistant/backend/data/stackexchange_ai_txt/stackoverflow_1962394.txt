Since you did not mention programming language, I'll give my input on this as from a php perspective - there is a wordpress plugin called bad behavior , which does exactly what you are looking for, it is configurable via a code script listing an array of search agent's strings. And based on what the agent is crawling on your site, the plugin automatically checks the user-agent's string and id, or IP address and based on the array, if there's a match, it either rejects or accepts the agent. It might be worth your while to have a peek at the code to see how is it done from a programmer's perspective of the code. If the language is other than php, and not satisfy what you are looking for, then I apologize for posting this answer. Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
