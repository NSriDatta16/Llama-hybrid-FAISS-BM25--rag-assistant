#pragma pack effect

I was wondering if someone could explain to me what the #pragma pack preprocessor statement does, and more importantly, why one would want to use it. I checked out the MSDN page , which offered some insight, but I was hoping to hear more from people with experience. I've seen it in code before, though I can't seem to find where anymore.
