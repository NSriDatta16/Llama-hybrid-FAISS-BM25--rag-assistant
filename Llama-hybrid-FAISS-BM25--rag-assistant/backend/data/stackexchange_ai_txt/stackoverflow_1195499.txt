If you're using C++, you may want to consider using references instead: int &x = local->position.x; Since you're writing a code generator, it shouldn't be too hard to make sure they exist for the right scope: { int &x = local->position.x; int &y = local->position.y; int &vx = local->velocity.x; int &vy = local->velocity.y; { #line user.input 1234 // user code #line output.c 4567 } } As an added bonus, the additional set of inner braces above allows the user code to shadow x if it intends to use the local pointer directly. If you're not using C++, consider doing do - the biggest source of incompatibility between C and C++ would be the lack of implicit void pointer casts, which I would suspect are rare in your input fragments...
