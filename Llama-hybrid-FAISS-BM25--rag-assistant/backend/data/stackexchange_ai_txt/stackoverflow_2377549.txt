Sqlalchemy file organization

Does anyone has any insight on organizing sqlalchemy based projects? I have many tables and classes with foreign keys, and relations. What is everyone doing in terms of separating classes, tables, and mappers ? I am relatively new to the framework, so any help would be appreciated. Example: classA.py # table definition and class A definition classB.py # table definition and class B definition ### model.py import classA,classB map(classA.classA,clasSA.table) map(classB.classB,clasSB.table) Including mappers inside classA, and classB works, but poses cross import issues when building relations.. Maybe I am missing something :)
