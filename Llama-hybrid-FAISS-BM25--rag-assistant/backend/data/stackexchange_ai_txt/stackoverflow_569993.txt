People are a first-order determinant of project success. Process comes next, tools come last. However, experience suggests that the most effective people are those who have excellent process (or "transverse") knowledge, over domain ("specific") knowledge. Specifically, knowledge of how to collaborate (ability to ask for help when needed, for instance), knowledge of how to communicate (what makes a meeting effective, writing well, using email wisely), and knowledge of how to organize one's work (dividing work into tasks, planning the tasks, executing the plan, tracking divergence from plan). So, always aim for "good people" but be aware of ambiguities in the very phrase "good people".
