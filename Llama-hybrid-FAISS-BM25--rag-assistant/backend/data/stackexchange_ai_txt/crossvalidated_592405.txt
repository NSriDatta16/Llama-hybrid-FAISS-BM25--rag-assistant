Do I need to test for OLS assumptions(autocorrelation and normality) in cross sectional data with 2 time variant control variables?

My dataset consists of 950k unique loan observations over the period of 4 months. The institution is international, so it has some observations from different countries (not panel data). I am studying the relationship between interest rates and a unique independent variable X. However, I want to control for macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rate(monthly data) in each country and bond yield(monthly data). My loan data is cross sectional; however, the addition of these 2 macroeconomic variables may change the nature of data. I used OLS regression with robust errors to account for heteroskedasticity in errors. Do I have to test for autocorrelation and normality? Is it valid? I have read that autocorrelation is not valid in cross sectional data due to an absence of time component. But the addition of these control variables is confusing. Is my data now a time series-cross section data? Would it be acceptable to use an average of 4 months for these macroeconomic variables to remove time varying component? The variation across months aren't large. What test should I use for autocorrelation? If there is autocorrelation, should I use cluster option to remove it?
