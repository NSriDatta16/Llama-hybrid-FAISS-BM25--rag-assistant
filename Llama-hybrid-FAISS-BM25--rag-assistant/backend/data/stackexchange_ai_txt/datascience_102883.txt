Two-level (large category and small category) label classification problem

At present, there is an app classification task, the input is the function description of the app, and the two labels are the major category to which the app belongs and the small categories under the major category. For example, the major category of FIFA online is sports, and the smaller category is football, which is included in sports. These two labels will affect each other, what machine learning model should be used to solve this supervised task? The solution I thought of is to construct two layers of output. The output of the first layer is a large category, and the latter is a small category. The two layers are connected by a multi-layer neural network, but the details including the loss function and the training optimization method are still doubtful. Hope Get answers from everyone, thank you.
