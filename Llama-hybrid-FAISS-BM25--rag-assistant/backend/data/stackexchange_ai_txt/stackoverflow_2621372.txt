I have not worked with puttycm, but my Putty experience tells me that puttyagent that comes with putty is an answer for your question. Putty-agent stores any private keys you provide to it and uses them for automated authorization. Private-key can be added by means of standard ssh-agent tools like ssh-add or can be browsed to with GUI.
