How to average 1000+ regression coefficients?

I am doing OLS regression on 1000's of stocks forward returns against a factor score. All the factor scores are the same model results for each stock at some point in time and vary between 1-5. My original test was to just aggregate all the series and and regress the aggregate. I got a reasonable number but I'm thinking that idea might be flawed. I don't think I can just take the mean of a list of coefficients so what is the best way to find the average slope? I read something about using the fisher transformation but wanted to confirm that fits what I am trying to do. *EDIT May be worth mentioning that the distribution of all the regression coefficients is pretty normally distributed.
