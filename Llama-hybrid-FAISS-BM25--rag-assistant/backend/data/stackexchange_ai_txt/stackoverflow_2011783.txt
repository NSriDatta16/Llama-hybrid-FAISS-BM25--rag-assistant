If you're on Windows, a simple solution would be to use XAMPP , which is basically a pre-packaged installation of Apache, PHP, MySQL plus additional useful tools. You might give it a try :) If you're using Linux, a Google search for "LAMP tutorial" should yield some results useful to you.. Happy hacking! :) Edit: Okay, maybe because it's early in the morning here, I seem to have misunderstood your question. Maybe you can find some further information regarding the Magento installation in the Installation guide . If you could describe your trouble a little more detailed, we could help too.
