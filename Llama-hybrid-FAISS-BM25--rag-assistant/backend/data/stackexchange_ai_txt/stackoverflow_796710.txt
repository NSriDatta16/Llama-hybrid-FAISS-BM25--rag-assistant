I ended up using a timer class I found similar to this one: http://forum.codecall.net/php-tutorials/4254-php-timer-class.html I just started a timer at the beginning of my loop and logged the duration at the end of each iteration. Found out, on average, it was taking between 3 and 4 seconds per email! Five minutes per email blast is a little too much. Time to refactor...
