Why create a whole new method, i.e., time series (ARIMA), instead of using multiple linear regression and adding lagged variables to it (with the order of lags determined using ACF and PACF)? One immediate point is that a linear regression only works with observed variables while ARIMA incorporates unobserved variables in the moving average part; thus, ARIMA is more flexible, or more general, in a way. AR model can be seen as a linear regression model and its coefficients can be estimated using OLS; $\hat\beta_{OLS}=(X'X)^{-1}X'y$ where $X$ consists of lags of the dependent variable that are observed . Meanwhile, MA or ARMA models do not fit into the OLS framework since some of the variables, namely the lagged error terms, are unobserved , and hence the OLS estimator is infeasible. one G-M assumption is that the independent variables should be normally distributed? or just the dependent variable conditional to the independent ones? The normality assumption is sometimes invoked for model errors, not for the independent variables. However, normality is required neither for the consistency and efficiency of the OLS estimator nor for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold. Wikipedia article on the Gauss-Markov theorem states explicitly that "The errors do not need to be normal". multicollinearity between variables may (obviously) arise, so estimates would be wrong. A high degree of multicollinearity means inflated variance of the OLS estimator. However, the OLS estimator is still BLUE as long as the multicollinearity is not perfect. Thus your statement does not look right. It is obvious that even with lagged variables OLS problems arise and it is not efficient nor correct, but when using maximum likelihood, do these problems persist? An AR model can be estimated using both OLS and ML; both of these methods give consistent estimators. MA and ARMA models cannot be estimated by OLS, so ML is the main choice; again, it is consistent. The other interesting property is efficiency, and here I am not completely sure (but clearly the information should be available somewhere as the question is pretty standard). I would try commenting on "correctness", but I am not sure what you mean by that.
