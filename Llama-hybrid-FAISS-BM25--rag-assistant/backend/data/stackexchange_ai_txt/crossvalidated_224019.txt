The Wikipedia article you linked shows that the Q-function is just 1 minus the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. Every distribution has its own CDF. So just use the CDF for the distribution in question. In R, for example, 1 - pcauchy(5) tells you the probability of getting 5 or more from a standard Cauchy distribution.
