MySQL MATCH doesn't work with two characters?

I have a table called 'business' with the following sample data: Street - 150 N Michigan Ave. City - Chicago State - IL Zip - 60601 When I run a query like SELECT business.* WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip) AGAINST('*150*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) -- IT WORKS SELECT business.* WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip) AGAINST('*Chicago*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) -- IT WORKS SELECT business.* WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip) AGAINST('*60601*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) -- IT WORKS SELECT business.* WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip) AGAINST('*IL*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) -- DOESNT WORK!! So what's wrong with the last query? Any ideas?
