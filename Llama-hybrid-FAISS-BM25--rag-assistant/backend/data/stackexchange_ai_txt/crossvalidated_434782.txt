Different point estimates are bound to happen given different data. The entire concept of the sampling distribution for the statistic is one way to resolve this. Given your first example, the confidence interval for the mean would be between approximately 4 and 16. This means that true incidence of lung cancer between approximately 4 and 16 is consistent with the data we observed and can explain variation from sample to sample. If we observed a much larger incidence than what we calculated above, then there are several explanations as to why. Our first sample calculated above could be uncharacteristically healthy, leading to a bias which is undetectable to us, for example. We could pool our estimates of incidence from both out samples to get a different estimate of incidence by leveraging all the data available to us. So far as your question goes, the estimate you should choose should depend on the model you want to build. A simple binomial model is different that a hierarchical bayesian model and thus will need different kinds of data.
