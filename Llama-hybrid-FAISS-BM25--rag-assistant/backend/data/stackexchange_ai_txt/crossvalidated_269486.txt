With the help of Eldioo and Roland , I was able to search around and figure this out. The solution was to use the Hill equation "Fb ~ (1 / ((Ka/L)^n + 1))" to fit this data, rather than the Michaelisâ€“Menten equation . I believe this suggests my data may represent a reaction with more than one substrate. # 1.2 2.5 5.2 10.5 21.1 42.1 73.2 111.3 185.5 256.9 325.7 392.0 binding_data$ligand_uM # 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.15 0.42 0.80 0.97 1.00 1.01 0.99 binding_data$fraction_bound L |t|) #Ka 77.1000 1.7494 44.07 8.69e-13 *** #n 3.4398 0.2516 13.67 8.50e-08 *** nonlinear_model2 %>% summary() # plot nonlinear model lines(log10(binding_data$ligand_uM),predict(nonlinear_model2)) # half_max = 0.505 half_max % summary() %>% coefficients() %>% .[1] Ka_r % summary() %>% coefficients() %>% .[2] abline(h=half_max) abline(v=log10Ka_r) text(x=log10(Ka) - .6,y=half_max + .06,labels = paste("(",log10Ka_r,",",half_max_r,")",sep="")) title(paste("Half-Max = ",half_max_r,", Ka = 10^",log10Ka_r," = ",Ka_r,sep=""))
