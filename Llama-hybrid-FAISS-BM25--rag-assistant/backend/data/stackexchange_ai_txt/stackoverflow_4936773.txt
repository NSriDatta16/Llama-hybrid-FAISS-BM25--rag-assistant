I suggest organizing sources by theme and having separate binary (or object) directories. Header files and source files in the same directory. One directory for each different compiler or platform: Fields |-- src | field_int.hpp | field_int.cpp | |-- obj_linux_gcc | | | |-- debug | | | |-- release | |-- obj_windows_gcc | |-- obj_visual_studio In recent years at various shops, I have found that separating header and source files into separate directories, without regards to theme, is a pain to maintain and also takes a long time to become acquainted with. "That's just my opinion, I could be wrong." -- Dennis Miller, comedian.
