One way to organize this information is to find a good book and look at the table of contents. This is a paradox because you specifically asked about statistics , whereas most introductory graduate level texts on the topic are for statistics and probability theory together. A book I am reading on regression now has the following TOC: Frequentist Inference Bayesian Inference Hypothesis Testing and Variable Selection Linear Models General Regression Models Binary Data Models General Regression Models Preliminaries for Nonparametric Regression [a precursor to...] Spline and Kernel Methods Nonparametric Regression with Multiple Predictors (The remaining sections are supporting mathematics and probability theory) Differentiation of Matrix Expressions Matrix Results Some Linear Algebra Probability Distributions and Generating Functions Functions of Normal Random Variables Some Results from Classical Statistics Basic Large Sample Theory
