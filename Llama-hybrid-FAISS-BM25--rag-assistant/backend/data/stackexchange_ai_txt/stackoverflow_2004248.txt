Here is how you stop him: Mention the costs and risks of data warehousing: Now your competitors have a single target for industrial espionage! You need a bunch of expensive servers ($$$) and a multitier storage system with redundancy in case of failure (more $$$) Hires: you need to hire personnel to manage and maintain the warehouse. Lots of them, probably. Money that might be better spent on your core business. The warehouse may not enable you to do any analytics you couldn't do before (albeit more slowly). It's only worth it if your production system is already bogging down with reporting and analytics.
