Autocorrelation robust standard deviation

I have a time series following an AR(p) structure for which I want to calculate the variance using the usual formula: $$sd = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x-\bar{x})^2$$ However, I know that the usual variance calculation is biased. Is there a way to calculate an autocorrelation robust variance. I have considered the practice based on this unbiased estimation of standard deviation , but in my case I do not known the autocorrelation function; I can only estimate it. So my question is, is there a way to calculate an autocorrelation-robust variance from sample data Witherspoon autocorrelation?
