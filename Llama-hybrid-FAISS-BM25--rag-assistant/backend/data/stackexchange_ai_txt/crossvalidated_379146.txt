I think your entirely understandable confusion might be due to the term "regress them on the country-level predictors" (emphasis mine). Seems like a better choice of words would be "regress them with the country-level predictors." Let's simplify the problem and assume you have data from two countries: Syldavia and Borduria. Furthermore, you have only one economic predictor: average mustache length. You would first fit your within-country regression models $s_{t} \sim \mathbf{\beta} x_{t}$ for each country. This would give you two elements in $\mathbf{\beta}$ , a slope and an intercept term. Your regression software would likely output things like standard errors and p-values, but all you really want are the coefficients or values in $\mathbf{\beta}$ . You then construct a new design matrix with an intercept (the country-level mean for Borduria) and an indicator variable for Syldavia. You also include the slope and intercept values from the first regression and then regress these covariates on sovereign bond spread. Using your notation the final regression would be something like $s_{t} \sim \alpha + \beta x_{\text{Syldavia}} + \gamma x_{\text{intercept}} + \delta x_{\text{slope}}$ . The point is that $s_t$ always stays on the left-hand side of the equation and you just have to build the right-hand side to your liking.
