Organising complex webs of complex articles in large websites

My question relates to how large websites, edited by several hundred people who work in a large organisation (such as a News website) organise their web pages. What form of mechanism works in the background? Does each article represent a row in a table on a database. If so, how are images and embedded videos incorporated. Or is each page an individual web file with "include" tags for sidebars, headers and styling. Certainly on the BBC website, each news page looks like it is an individual ".stm" file, but this doesn't strike me as a very efficient method when lots of people are collaborating. Or is each page one of many files, that are organised by databases but which are not stored in them? I'm sure there are a myriad of methods? What do the largest organisations use?
