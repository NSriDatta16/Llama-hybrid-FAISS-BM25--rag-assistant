I guess you're using a foreach block to find the tab to remove. You cannot modify a collection while iterating through it. So use a for loop instead to remove and cache the tab to remove. Then add it to the new parent. That should work. Not the most elegant, but it'd have to do for now. For some reason, Linq hasn't implemented the Lisp/Ruby/et.all reject operation. (or I haven't found it yet. Closest thing is a List .RemoveAll(predicate) . If it did - you could have done something like... tabControl2.Items.AddRange( tabControl1.Items.Reject(tab => tab.Name = "MarkedOne") );
