WP: redirect users to a certain category using cookies

Basically like cragslist. once you select city on craigslist, nexttime when you go to the site, it redirects you to the city you selected. What I want to achieve: When a person comes to the site and selects a particular category, the next time they come to the site (returning user) - the page will open up on that category section. I would think this would be fairly easy to do via setting a cookie when the visitor clicks on the category link (or when the category page loads). When they return the following time, the cookie is read and then the page redirects accordingly. Unfortunately my knowledge of PHP and cookies is limited, (hence my search for answers) so I need to ask if anyone can help me out! Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!
