Information Modeling

The sensor module in my project consists of a rotating camera , that collects noisy information about moving objects in the surrounding environment. The information consists of distance , angle and relative change of the moving objects.. The limiting view range of the camera makes it essential to rotate the camera periodically to update environment information... I was looking for algorithms / ways to model these information, in order to be able to guess / predict / learn motion properties of these object.. My current proposed idea is to store last n snapshots of each object in a queue. I take weighted average of positions and velocities of moving object, but I think it is a poor method... Can you state some titles that suit this case? Thanks
