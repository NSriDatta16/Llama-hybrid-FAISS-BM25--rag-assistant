It looks like version 0.7.0 added support for this model. As of version 0.7.0, bsts supports having multiple observations at the same time point. In this case the basic model is taken to be $y_{t, j} = Z^T\alpha_t + \beta^Tx_{t, j} + \epsilon_{t, j}$ This is a regression model where all observations with the same time point share a common time series effect.
