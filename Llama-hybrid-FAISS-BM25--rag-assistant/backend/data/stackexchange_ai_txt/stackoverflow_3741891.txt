Magento Api is too slow for lots of products

I need your suggestions please, I'm currently using the Magento API for importing products in Magento admin (magento database), and I have noticed that it's really too slow. It's taking approximately 1 hr to add 1000 products, and I have to add almost 260,000 products. How can I speed up the process? Is there any alternative process to resolve this issue? Thanks for any suggestion or answer! Richa verma
