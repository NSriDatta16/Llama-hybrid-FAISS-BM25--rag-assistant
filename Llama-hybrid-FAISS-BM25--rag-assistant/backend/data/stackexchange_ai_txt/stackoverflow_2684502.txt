jquery click tracking is acting a little strage

On some links on my HTML page I have a special CSS class, that when clicked, I make a ajax call to a click.aspx page and track the click. blah-1 $(".click").bind("click", function() { $.get("/click.aspx?&source=" + $(this).attr("id")); }); So what is happening is the value of source, after clicking a few links (that open in a new window) becomes: source=blah1 then it becomes source=blah1,blah2
