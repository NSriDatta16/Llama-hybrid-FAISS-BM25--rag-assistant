The short answer is not all problems are solvable by machine learning and no one knows which problems are currently solvable. Given that, there are common heuristics that offer clues towards solvability. One heuristic is: Can a human solve it? If a human can do the task, there is a greater chance that there could be a possible machine learning solution. Another heuristic is incremental learning. Does adding more data or more training increase the performance of the machine learning system? If there is an increase in performance then there is a better chance with enough data and training, the task is solvable. Specifically for your problem, there is a good chance it is not solvable. You state that humans are unable to perform above chance - "human level is not very useful because it is close to random for this problem." This limits possible solutions because there will not be enough high-quality training labels that are required for supervised machine learning.
