Well, you are right about the way to make recursive predictions. Maybe there's something wrong with the type of model you've fitted. Neural networks are very complex models (thus, overfitting machines) and, what's worse, they are black-boxes, so very hard to validate (aparte from just measuring its performance) I would strongly suggest you to try an ARIMA approach unless there is a good reason why you shouldn't
