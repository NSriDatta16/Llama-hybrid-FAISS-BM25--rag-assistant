Visualize n-dimensional bayesian optimization results

I am working on a 6-dimensional bayesian optimization problem using (skopt's gp_minimize). After the optimizer ran for j iterations I would like to somehow visualize the "progress/result" of the optimization. As I am new to Bayesian optimization I would like to ask for input on how and what to visualize. What are good parameters to visualize to show the improvement and maybe even the parameter dependency of the optimized parameters?
