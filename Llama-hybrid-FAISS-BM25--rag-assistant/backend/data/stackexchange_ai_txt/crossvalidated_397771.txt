Can CART models be used to select features for a logistic regression?

Can I use the features selected from the CART(Classification and Regression Trees) model and take those features and then model the logistic regression using those selected features? Then interpret their betas as CART doesn't provide betas for interpretation. Although CART can be interpretable in itself?
