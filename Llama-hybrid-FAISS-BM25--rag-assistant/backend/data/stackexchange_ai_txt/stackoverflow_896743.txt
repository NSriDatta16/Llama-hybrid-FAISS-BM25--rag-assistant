Best way to propagate opener variable across page navigation?

Application that I'm working on has multiple modules. Two are of a concern - main module and module that I write. And I have to call a function on window that contains main module and the problem is that I have to call that function not from page that is opened by parent webmodule, but from page to which user navigates from this page. Basically first page presents just some query forms, lets user to make some query, and second holds query results, and I am supposed to update contents of parent page based on these results. Navigation goes like that Main module First page of my module (i have main module page as an window.opener variable. Second page of my module (and I would like to be able to open this page in the same browser window that the first one is opened) And I would like to have as free navigation as possible - like opening query results in new tab, going back changing query parameters, making new query, etc. I would also like to present user query forms on page that displays results and let them to refine this query, and still be able to update main module. I was thinking of following solutions: Using AJAX to load query results to first window, but I would like to have this app as simple as possible, and AJAX is not simple ;) Spawning new window on every request and doing code like var mainModule = opener.mainModule . Which is evil. Embedding query results in a frame or iframe, but I havn'e got the slightest idea on how to inject main module window javascript variable into frame or iframe.
