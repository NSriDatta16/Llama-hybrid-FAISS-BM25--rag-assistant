Statistical test to compare 1-10 ratings between groups

I'm trying to decide on an appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a significant difference in average ratings (out of 10) between two groups. The scale is 1-10 The distribution of ratings is left-skewed Sample size is around 20 in group A and 50 in group B I was initially going to use a T-Test for this given the small sample and the fact that the sample itself is probably not representative of the population , but wasn't sure whether the test should compare means, or whether the ratings should be formulated as proportions (given they're on a bounded scale). Also not sure whether the skewness would make a T-Test inappropriate here... What would a more competent statistician recommend?
