No, you cannot post to multiple friends stream in one call. The best way to do it is probably server side so that the user does not get multiple prompts. Notice this is usually discouraged though since it can be perceived as spam. With your code, you can loop on just the send event part: var publish = { method: 'stream.publish', message: 'Some kind of test', uid: uid, attachment: { name: 'Test', caption: 'Facebook API Test', description: ('Sure hope it worked!'), href: 'http://www.test.com/', media: [ { type: 'image', href: 'http://test.com/', src: 'http://test.com/image.jpg' } ] }, action_links: [ { text: 'Enigma Marketing', href: 'http://www.test.com/' } ], user_prompt_message: 'Share your thoughts about test' }; publish.target_id = friendID; FB.ui(publish); publish.target_id = friendID; FB.ui(publish); return false;
