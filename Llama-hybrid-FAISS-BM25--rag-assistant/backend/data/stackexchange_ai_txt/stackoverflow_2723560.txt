Get list of elements and their values from an untyped xml fragment in T-SQL

Similiar to question: How can I get a list of element names from an XML value in SQL Server How would I also get the values for the list of elements. For example: a1 b1 c1 Would return Element | Value A | a1 B | b1 C | c1 Sorry for the confusion, I didn't know how to do the formatting. I just want the element name and the value and do not care about the hierarchy. Thanks,
