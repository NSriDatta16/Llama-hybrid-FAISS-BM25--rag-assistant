Analysing number of errors with ANOVA in R

I have the following dataset library(car) library(ez) dat My aim is to perform a 2x2 factorial ANOVA. My two factors will be hand and parity and my dependent variable is accuracy where 1 = correct and 0 = error. I am focusing on errors for my ANOVA so I have filtered so only errors (0's) remain. Does anybody know how to perform an ANOVA on differences in the number of errors for my factors? My first attempt produced an error: ezANOVA(dat, dv = accuracy, wid = participant, within = .(parity, hand), type = 3, detailed = TRUE, return_aov = TRUE) Error in ezANOVA_main(data = data, dv = dv, wid = wid, within = within, : One or more cells is missing data. Try using ezDesign() to check your data. I think this is because all of the accuracy values are 0 whereas I want analyse the number of 0's (number of errors) for my factorial ANOVA. Hence I then tried to average across each condition and re-ran the ANOVA however I run into more problems. I'm averaging across subjects so I lose my within subjects variable (thus I cannot use the ezANOVA function). I then try and use the aov() and Anova() functions but generate a new error: dat % dplyr::group_by(parity, hand) %>% dplyr::summarise(acc_num = n()) result Does anybody have any idea how I would analyse this data using an ANOVA in R? Any help is most appreciated!
