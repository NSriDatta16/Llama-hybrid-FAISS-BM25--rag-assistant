The problem is even in English, a-vs-an is not determined by the starting letter , but the starting sound . You can make a pretty good assumption in English based on the starting letter, but there are some exceptions (e.g. "hour", "user"). The best thing to do is have access to a word's pronunciation to be able to choose. Barring that, the next best thing to do is have a list of common exceptions, then guess the rest. From Wikipedia : The choice of "a" or "an" is determined by phonetic rules rather than by spelling convention. "An" is employed in speech to remove the awkward glottal stop (momentary silent pause) that is otherwise required between "a" and a following word e.g. "an X-ray" ... The following paragraphs are spelling rules for "an" which can be used if the phonetic rule is not understood.
