How enable dragging a file on the *.exe and get it as parameter?

What do I have to do to make my program use a file that has been dragged and dropped onto its icon as a parameter? My current main method looks like this: int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if (argc != 2) { cout What I'd really like to be able to do is select 10 (or so) files, drop them onto the EXE, and process them from within my application. EDIT: The incomming parameter is used as filename, constructed in the cunstructor. Converter::Converter(char* file) { // string filename is a global variable filename = file; myfile.open(filename.c_str(), ios_base::in); } The method where the textfile gets read: string Converter::readTextFile() { char c; string txt = ""; if (myfile.is_open()) { while (!myfile.eof()) { myfile.get(c); txt += c; } } else { error("ERROR: can't open file:", filename.c_str()); } return txt; } EDIT2: deleted Update: I got again to this point. Actual Main method: // File path as argument int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { if (argc vector files; for (int g = 1; g Actually the console window apears for maybe 0.5 sec and closes again. It doen't stop on any of my cin.ignore(); Maybe it doesn't get there? Can anyone help?
