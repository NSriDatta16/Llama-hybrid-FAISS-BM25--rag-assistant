I found the answer to this question. This only appears to be a problem when used in the DSOFRAMER sample (Microsoft KB 311765). DSOFramer is a general purpose ActiveX control for embedding MS Office documents. The problem also only happens in a debug build; release builds are fine. I also found a workaround that works on release or debug build: get any cell in the range (using get_Item), then call select on that item, then select again to de-select it. Once that's done, the select can be called on the range. Apparently, select cannot be called on the range if there is a cell already selected (or perhaps if the selection state is undefined).
