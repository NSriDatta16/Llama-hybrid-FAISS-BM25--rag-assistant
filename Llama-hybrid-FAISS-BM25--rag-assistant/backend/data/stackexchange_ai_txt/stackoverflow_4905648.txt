The problem with this design is that it's similar to embedding one button into another. While you may have a valid reason to do it, you should be more careful with the event flow. What happens is the gesture recognizer intercepting touches before they reach subviews (the two buttons in your case). You should implement UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol, namely, gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch: method, and return NO if the touch is inside any of the two buttons. That will prevent the orange view from usurping touches intended for the buttons and the buttons will start to work as expected.
