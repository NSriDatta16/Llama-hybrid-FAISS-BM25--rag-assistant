What are other ways of doing oversampling apart from SMOTE?

I have just begun learning about machine learning techniques and started solving problems on kaggle. I have a few questions about how to handle class imbalance: How to handle imbalance dataset apart from SMOTE? In Kaggle can we balance data by merging train and test csv file and resample? If yes, then How to resample in that case? Are there any other suggestions?
