Appropriate Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for Time series prediction

I am looking forward to the correct ML/algorithm approach for the below issue. My target here is to predict the target day of the incoming time series below for a new time series. Also below you can find the form of the train dataset. My goal is to train an algorithm on the various patterns of train datasets' time series (lets assume that in the train dataset we can find all the possible forms of time series [with trend, stationarity etc.]) in order to predict the target value based on the expected behavior of similar time series in train dataset. Train dataset: TS name Day1 Day2 ... Day50 Target-Day51 TS 1 5 13 ... 16 12 TS 2 8 18 ... 9 16 ... 12 2 ... 13 4 TS 4000 3 7 ... 4 10 Incoming time series: TS name Day1 Day2 ... Day50 Target-Day51 TS 4001 3 22 ... 48 XX Any ideas please? Thank you in advance
