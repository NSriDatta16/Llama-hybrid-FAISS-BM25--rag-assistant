The exact role of a data scientist varies incredibly from organisation to organisation; o the validity of this answer varies on exactly how you define data scientists. But I would say that the output of a data scientist is not a visualization; It is the answer to a question. A data scientist is asked a question like: "why were online sales down in March?" They dive into the data and try and answer it. So a possible answer is: "Our web site was really unresponsive in March, and pages kept timing out" And they will support that, and discour that by looking at and showing visualiations. E.g. that historically when sales have been down it also has corresponded with increased latency, and that this was occuring also in March.
