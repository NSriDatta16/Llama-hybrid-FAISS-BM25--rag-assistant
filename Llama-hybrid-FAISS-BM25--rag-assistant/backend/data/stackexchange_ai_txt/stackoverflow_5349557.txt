Common way is placing of meta data, but you can easily remove them. Let's search hideouts (most of them low-level)! Non-mark text Text under overlapping objects Objects of older versions (doesn't noticed by reader, but there with redundant information) Marks in streams between BX-EX (with weird information from readers point of view) Information before %PDF-X Information above %%EOF Substitution of names for some elements (like font name) Steganography Manipulation from used fonts Whitespacing Images with setganograpy My favorite are steganography and BX-EX block within stream, with proper compression and/or encryption it is hard to find (if do not know, where it is). To make search harder wrap some normal blocks with BX-EX. Some of ways are easy to remove, some harder, but decided attacker will be able to find and sanitize them all. Think about copy-paste of text or print trough PDF-printer.
