Random Forest is one of the few algorithms which will work well for default parameters. If you'd like to get precise I'd recommend using this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03515.pdf . It gives you good pointers on what attributes to use when working with classification or regression algorithms. If its classification you might want to keep max depth as None (i.e grow the tree to its full depth). Random forest aren't prone to overfitting unlike Decisions trees.
