Doubt in understanding GANs

I was going through original GAN paper: Goodfellow, Ian, et al. "Generative adversarial nets." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2014. Link: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf For proving optimal D, eq 2, they have rewritten the objective function in equation 3. It is: So, essentially they have changed $p(z)$ to $p(x)$ and $g(z)$ to $x$ . My question is how can this be done? p.s: Is this the correct place to ask such question? Is there a dedicated place where I can ask questions related to specific sub topics of ML? I also asked at: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3639114/doubt-in-understanding-gans
