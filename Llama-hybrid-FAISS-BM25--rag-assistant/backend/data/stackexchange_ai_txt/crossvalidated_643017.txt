Mathematical rigorous approach to linear regression

I'd like a book or any PDF that teaches about linear regression in a complete way. That is, I want something that, for instance, doesn't use any random variable without stating its domain or the $\sigma$ -algebra associated with it. Or at least tell which assumptions are being made (say which distributions are known and which are not, for example). In other words, I want a mathematical rigorous approach to linear regression (in the context of statistics). If you know any book with these qualities, please tell me its name. Unfortunately, all the material I've found disregards possible divisions by zero or considers that a matrix is invertible even if it has random variables in its coordinates whose images are not known. Thank you for your attention!
