Your question is a duplicate of this one, how can I use non-silverlight assemblies in silverlight . As a work around I would suggest the following for using your itext library. Create a service to do your PDF file modification and then use it via WCF. First upload the PDF file to the server from the Silverlight application. Then call a method on the service using the uploaded path. public void EditPdf(string pdfLocation) { var document = new Document(); PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, new FileStream(pdfLocation,FileMode.CreateNew)); document.Open(); document.Add(new Paragraph("Hello World")); document.Close(); } Then retrieve the PDF for the user via the Silverlight client.
