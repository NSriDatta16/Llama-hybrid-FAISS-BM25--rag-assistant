This is a quick partial response to outline some options and correct some errors. You are implicitly seeking a method of moments estimator . Under your assumptions, letting $f$ be the failure rate and $n$ be the fleet size, the expectations of the $S_i$ (which are governed by a multinomial distribution) are $$\eqalign{ \mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_0] = &f^2 n \cr \mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_1] = &2 f (1-f) n \cr \mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_2] = &(1-f)^2 n. }$$ From the algebraic relation $$\mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_0] = \frac{\mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_1]^2}{4 \mathbb{E}_{f;n}[S_2]}$$ (which implies the failure rate should be about twice your estimate) and assuming $S_2 \ne 0$ you can derive the method of moments estimator $$\hat{S}_0 = \frac{S_1^2}{4 S_2}.$$ This is likely to be biased, especially if $S_2$ is small, which impels us to consider other estimators. More generally, this problem can be thought of as looking for a "good" estimator for $S_0$ of the form $\hat{S}_0 = t(S_1, S_2)$ in an experiment in which the outcomes are the sum of $n$ Binomial($1-f$, $2$) variables and $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the counts of the single and double "successes," respectively. To this end you need to supply a loss function $\Lambda(s,t)$ and analyze the statistical risk $r$, which is the expected loss $$r_t(f,n) = \mathbb{E}_{f;n}[\Lambda(S_0, t(S_1, S_2))].$$ The loss function quantifies the cost of estimating that $S_0$ equals $t(S_1, S_2)$; usually the estimate is not perfect and there is a cost associated with that. The risk for a particular estimator $t$ is the expected loss; it depends on the unknown failure rate $f$ and the unknown fleet size $n$. Thus the exercise comes down to finding procedures with acceptable risk functions. If you have some quantitative information about the likely values of $f$ and $n$ you can exploit that either directly, by limiting the domain of the risk to the likely values, or with a Bayesian analysis in which you compute the expected value of $r_t$ under some assumed prior distribution of $(f,n)$. At this point the risk becomes solely a function of the procedure $t$ and it's "merely" a matter of finding a risk-minimizing procedure. In any event, to make further progress you need to supply a loss function (or some reasonable approximation thereof). I would hesitate to recommend or use the method of moments estimator (derived above) without knowing something about your loss.
