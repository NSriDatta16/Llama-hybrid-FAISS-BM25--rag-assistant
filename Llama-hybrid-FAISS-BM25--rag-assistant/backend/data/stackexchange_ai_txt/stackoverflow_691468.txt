Maybe because output caching is enabled for the page: if the page is cached server-side with VaryByParam=none, all users will get the same copy from the cache. I can only think of two things that can cause this: You're storing user-specific data in a place shared between requests (e.g. in a static(C#)/shared(VB) variable, in the ASP.NET Cache, in the Application object, ...) You have output caching enabled. Check for: OutputCache directives in your aspx and ascx files, system.web/caching element in your web.config file(s), Calls to the HttpCacheability.SetCacheability method. If you can't find the problem: Try creating a simplified version of your application until you get the simplest possible version that still reproduces the undesirable behaviour. During this process of simplification you'll likely discover the problem for yourself. If not, post some code from the simplified version.
