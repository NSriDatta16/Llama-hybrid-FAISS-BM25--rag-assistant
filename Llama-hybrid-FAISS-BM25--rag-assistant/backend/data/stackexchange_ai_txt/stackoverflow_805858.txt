If your CPU were a hot dog stand, the load averages would tell you the average number of people standing in line to get served. A load of less than 1.0 means that the hot dog vendor has some spare time between customers -- 1.0 means that, while a line never piles up, some customer is always talking to the vendor (who knows where all the hot dogs are going...). Having a "low" load average doesn't mean that your computer isn't doing anything though, there could be customers who take a really long time to eat their hot dog before getting in line again (that is to say some process might be waiting on the disk or network to wake them up with some data when it arrives), having a faster disk or net connection could improves your total dog sales. Enjoy.
