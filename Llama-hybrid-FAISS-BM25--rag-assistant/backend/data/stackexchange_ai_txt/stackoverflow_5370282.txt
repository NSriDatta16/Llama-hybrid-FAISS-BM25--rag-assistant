'Users' SQL table out of control. Searching for a better way

I've been programming and using a survey software for more than three years. It began as a simple survey system, with a basic 'users' SQL table, as you can find, for instance, in most CMS's. I initially planned to use the program two or three times, with 30 users or so for each survey. Today, the program has grown and is used for one or two surveys every month. A survey may have hundreds of users, which makes the table awfully long and confusing. I can't find a best way than a classic user list, though. I though of creating a new table for each survey, but I feel it's asking for problems. What I do now is to archive the complete SQL database when a survey is finished, which is convenient enough for now but will turn into a nightmare when I'll have to quickly find the results of an old survey. I'm confident I'm not the first one to encounter this problem and would be happy to know how you solved it. Are there some kind of best practices for it? Thanks!
