I routinely use bnlearn in R on networks of that size and larger. Most likely your network is too highly connected to be solved by bnlearn : the cliques and conditional probability tables are too large. I recommend using your domain knowledge to only impose an ordering on your variables and then learn the full structure and parameters from data. See the bnlearn function node.ordering . (I'm also assuming you have sufficient data.) You can also limit the learned network complexity if need be. Alternatively you can check some of the standard references on building large networks and apply some of the standard tricks to reduce clique size and the conditional probability table size. For example, see this pdf at one of the authors websites Neil, M., N. Fenton and L. Nielson (2000), "Building large-scale Bayesian networks," The Knowledge Engineering Review , Vol. 15 :3, 257-284
