It looks like that because SharpSvn is just a .NET API wrapper around the Subversion command line tool and this does not include a mechanism for managing permissions, this is not doable (see here ). Different Subversion distributions manage permissions in different fashions so approaches to controlling this outside of SharpSvn will differ. Visual SVN server utilises an authz-windows file in the root of the repository for managing AD based permissions. It stores the SID of the user against the repo name all in plain text so Iâ€™ve worked around the API problem by just managing the contents of this file directly. Not as elegant as I was hoping for but the end result is the same.
