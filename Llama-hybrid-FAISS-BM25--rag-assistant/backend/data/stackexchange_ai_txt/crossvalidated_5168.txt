Here are some online ressources I found interesting without going into detail (and I'm not a specialist of this topic): Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes , by Teh et al. (2005) Dirichlet Processes A gentle tutorial , by El-Arini (2008) Bayesian Nonparametrics , by Rosasco (2010) Non-parametric Bayesian Methods , by Ghahramani (2005) The definitive reference seems to be N. Hjort, C. Holmes, P. MÃ¼ller, and S. Walker, editors. Bayesian Nonparametrics . Number 28 in Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, 2010. About R, there seems to be some other packages worth to explore if the DPpackage does not suit your needs, e.g. dpmixsim , BHC , or mbsc found on Rseek.org .
