Create an alias icon for TextMate on the desktop. Drag the file to be opened to the icon. The file should now be opened in TextMate. Set the soft tab with the status bar options. Close TextMate. Repeat step 2 - 5 for each file type you want the soft tab settings to be remembered. Every time you want to open a file type with TextMate drag that file to that desktop icon. Do not open more than one file type at the same time, the second file type opened will get its soft tab settings erased. This is the only way I've been able to get a consistant behavior on the soft tabs settings.
