Java libraries for converting between character encodings

The problem I am looking to solve is converting between unicode storage types. As I understand it, one character in UTF-8 can be represented by 1 to 4 bytes of data whereas a character in UTF-16 can be represented in 1-2, two bytes blocks of data. This variable length means it's a pain to convert between the two and produce something that is sensible in the english language. What I am looking for is a library that would let me specify a language or locale, and a storage mechanism (utf-8 etc.) and have it produce a more sensible result. Am I dreaming in the clouds?
