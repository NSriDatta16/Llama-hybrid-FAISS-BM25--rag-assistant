This can be (is) caused when doing a Database Schema Synchronization -> Database Project . (My environment is VS2010 Enterprise RTM). The generated ALTER DATABASE statements are generated to mirror the source database without taking any substitution values into account (it will also include initial database sizes, etc). The problem does not appear on an Initial Database Import. Edit the files found under... Schema Objects\Database Level Objects\Storage\Files ...and fix them to contain the correct $(DefaultDataPath)$(DatabaseName).mdf / $(DefaultLogPath)$(DatabaseName)_log.ldf values -- or other -- as appropriate. (Now mark them as "Skip" in your Schema Compare :-P) With the above "correction" keeping the values external will once again work and is the preferred method of managing such properties. Happy coding.
