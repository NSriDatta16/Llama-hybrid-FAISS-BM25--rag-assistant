Look into mutable strings, immutable strings, and ropes , and think about how you would implement common operations in a low-level language (say, C). Consider: Concatenation. Slicing. Getting a character at an index. Changing a character at an index. Locating the index of a character. Traversing the string. Coming up with algorithms for these situations will give you a feel for when each type of storage would be appropriate.
