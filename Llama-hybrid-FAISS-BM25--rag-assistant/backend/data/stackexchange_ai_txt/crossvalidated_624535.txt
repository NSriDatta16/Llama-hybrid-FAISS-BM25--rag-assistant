You could look at the problem from the perspective of power analysis. The problem with failing to reject a null hypothesis is that failure to reject by itself might indicate either that 1) you looked very thoroughly and didn't find sufficient evidence to support rejection, or 2) that you didn't look very hard at all and never bothered to collect evidence that would have allowed you to reject in any circumstance (or it could be somewhere between these two extremes). In the first case absence of evidence is indeed evidence of absence (one can reliably conclude they do not have an elephant in their garage upon looking and seeing no elephant), in the second case, it is not (one cannot conclude there is no elephant in their garage if they don't look at all). You should describe the power of your experiment - given the amount of data you have and the effect sizes you're looking for, what is the likelihood that the effect would be deemed significant? If your experiment is appropriately powered, you have grounds to suggest that the lack of rejection of H0 does indeed suggest no effects of the given size. But if your experiment is underpowered, the lack of rejection says much more about the design of your experiment than the significance of the effect.
