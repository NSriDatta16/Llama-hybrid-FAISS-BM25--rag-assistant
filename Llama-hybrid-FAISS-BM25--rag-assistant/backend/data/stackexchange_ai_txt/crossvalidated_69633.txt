What's the Bayesian equivalent of a general goodness of fit test?

I have two data sets, one from a set of physical observations (temperatures), and one from an ensemble of numerical models. I'm doing a perfect-model analysis, assuming the model ensemble represents a true, independent sample, and checking to see if the observations are drawn from that distribution. The statistic I've calculated is normalised, and should theoretically be a standard normal distribution. Of course it's not perfect, so I want to test for goodness of fit. Using frequentist reasoning, I could calculate a Cram√©r-von Mises statistic (or Kolmogorov-Smirnov, etc.), or similar, and look up the value in a table to get a p-value, to help me decide how unlikely the value I see is, given the observations are the same as the model. What would the Bayesian equivalent of this process be? That is, how do I quantify the strength of my belief that these two distributions (my calculated statistic and the standard normal) are different?
