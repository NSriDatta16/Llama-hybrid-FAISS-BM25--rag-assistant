I'm also a Liferay newbie but here's the general structure of Liferay in case someone is interested. Organizations are a portal administrator mandated hierarchy. Organizations may have sub organizations that are administered by organization administrators in each organization. Each organization can have it's own pages. Communities are like organizations but can't have sub communities and non-administrator users may be allowed to create them. Each community can have it's own pages. Users are registered users who may have their own pages and may belong to any number of organizations and/or communities. Pages are web pages that users with certain permissions can edit simply by selecting a predefined layout and adding/removing portlets and sub-pages. Portlet is a web application that usually "runs" as part of a page in it's own window like container.
