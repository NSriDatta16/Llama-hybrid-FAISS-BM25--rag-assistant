Perform PCA on columns of different length

I have about 20-30 columns, all with different lengths. The first column has 25000 rows, the second column has 19000 rows, and it's different for all the columns. All are the survey data with 0 (No),1(Yes), and 666 (for missing data) values. I want to perform PCA on these data. As each column is of unequal length, I am having a hard time doing PCA due to 'NaN' values for most of the columns that are shorter in length. I don't want most of the information to be lost, so I am not willing to delete the rows of longer length columns and make every column equal in length. Please advise me the possible solutions.
