Yes. Use the same types in the same order in both languages Make sure the class doesn't have anything virtual in it (so you don't get a vtable pointer stuck on the front) Depending on the compilers used you may need to adjust the structure packing (usually with pragmas) to ensure compatibility. (edit) Also, you must take care to check the sizeof() the types with your compilers. For example, I've encountered a compiler that stored shorts as 32 bit values (when most will use 16). A more common case is that an int will usually be 32 bits on a 32-bit architecture and 64 bits on a 64-bit architecture.
