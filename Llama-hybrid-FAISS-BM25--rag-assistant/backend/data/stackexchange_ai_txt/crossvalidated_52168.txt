I don't think Grainger is appropriate for concluding whether an event caused another but rather whether a time series caused another (using "caused" very loosely). I don't know of any real litigation cases. But I could imagine something like a time-series of accidents in a factory and another of percent of hiring non union employees. Maybe there's a correlation; but a question might arise: "Do more accidents happen after non-union employees are hired?" or "Do managers hire non-union employees in response to accidents?" Not sure how valid / realistic this is; but that's my 2 cents.
