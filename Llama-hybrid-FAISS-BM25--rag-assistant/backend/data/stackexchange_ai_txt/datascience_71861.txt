Apart from the most important feature in your model which is distance, you might want to add some other information like neighborhood/traffic/time of departure/type of car/ drivers ( if you have any informations about them ) etc.. Example of a feature : you could extract from looking at the departure long/lat nearby points that could cause delay the arrival to destination point. Driver experience might be a contributing factor to the ETA. Also you use Uber 's data to add average travel times from the physical zones you're working on. Distance is an obvious straight line feature that will be the center piece of your model, but adding data about stuff to break down that linearity is what will make your model good enough to be put to test.
