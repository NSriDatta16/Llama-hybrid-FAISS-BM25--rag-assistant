Appropriate model design for lmer and longitudinal environmental data?

I have data consisting of soil measurements taken over 97 days at 6 time points. Soil was treated with 4 amendments (Alfalfa, Compost, Compost+Alfalfa, Control) for 288 samples (12 replications for each treatment and day). My question is, what would be the model design for testing if treatment is significant for inorganic N concentrations? I have tried lmer , I'm looking for a model with treatment and day as fixed effect and replication as a random factor. inc.model.data Is this the correct approach? An image of the experiment, there were 48 of these large jars with 6 microcosms. Adding summary(inc.model.data) output as per comments:
