Ok so I will have to make certain assumptions because there is information missing from your question. Firstly you didn't say what mailformat the message is... HTML would be the easiest, the process will be different for RTF and not possible in plaintext Since you are refering to tables I will assume they are HTML tables and the mail format is HTML. Also it is not clear from your question if you want the table content pasted seperately (1 excel cell per table cell) and the rest of the emails bodytext pasted into 1 cell or several? finally you haven't really said if you want the VBA running from Outlook or Excel (not that important but it affects which intrinsic objects are available. Anyway code sample: Outlook code to access the htmlbody prop Dim mapi As Namespace Set mapi = Application.Session Dim msg As MailItem Set msg = mapi.Folders.Item(1).Folders.Item("Posteingang").Folders.Item(1).Folders.Item(7).Items.Item(526) Dim strHTML as String strHTML = msg.HTMLBody ' There is no object model collection for html tables within the htmlbody (which is a string of html) you will need to parse the html and collect the tables before inserting into Excel.
