How can I model a binary outcomes in time series using logistic regression?

My data has a binary outcome (attack or not attack), day (20 day in repeated measured design) and some covariates (nestling’s movement). The objectives of my experiment are testing the effect of time and other factors and selecting useful variables affecting outcomes. My data look like below subject outcome Day nestling.move 1 A 1 N 2 A 1 Y 3 A 1 Y 4 N 1 Y 5 N 1 Y 6 N 1 Y 7 N 1 Y 8 N 1 N 9 N 1 N . . . . . . . . 1 A 20 N 2 A 20 N First of all, I simply transformed outcomes to ratios(attack rate for each day) and test if there is a correlation between attack rates and days by using Spearman’s rank correlation. But I think it is not a good way to test the effect of time on outcome. I checked other post . and I think I should used an AR1 model with logistic regression since it could be a time-varying processes. However, I don't know how to do this with R or SPSS. Is this the correct syntax to use in R? model
