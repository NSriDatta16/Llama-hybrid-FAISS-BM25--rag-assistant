Most of the 31000 genes are unlikely to differ much in expression among the cell lines (at least when appropriately normalized), so they add no information to the problem. For a practical biological problem like this, it may help to concentrate on genes whose expression levels are relatively high on an absolute basis. That way it will be easier to validate your results on these 29 lines and then apply and test your predictions on cell lines beyond those you are now examining, for example with standard PCR instead of the expensive microarray or RNAseq methods used to examine 31000 genes at once. Start by ( a ) limiting your analysis to highly expressed genes whose normalized expression levels have the greatest variance among cell lines (typically on a log scale in gene expression work) and closest relation to IC50 values, so that your intractable $p \gg n$ problem becomes a less difficult $p > n$ problem. Then ( b ) combine information from different genes whose expression levels co-vary among cell lines. The "supervised principal components" method described in section 18.6 of The Elements of Statistical Learning , second edition, provides a documented way to accomplish this. Genes are rank-ordered with respect to univariate relations to IC50 values (accomplishing goal a , if you limit to highly expressed genes) and PCA is performed on a subset of genes with the highest relations to IC50s (accomplishing goal b ). The number of genes included in the PCA and the number of principal components retained are chosen by cross-validation.
