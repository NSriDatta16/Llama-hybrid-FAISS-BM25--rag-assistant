Your second sentence $A$ and $X$ , $B$ and $Y$ are really almost just two pairs of near-identical time series does not necessarily follow from the first statement. Consider this example in R. I define the four time series that satisfy the conditions on $\rho(A,B)$ , $\rho(X,Y)$ , $\sigma_A=\sigma_X$ , $\sigma_B=\sigma_Y$ . But if you look at what the four time series actually are, they're obviously not identical. $A$ and $B$ are increasing over time, but $X$ and $Y$ are decreasing. Remember that correlation quantifies how one variable changes with another, not absolutely what the variables are doing. A
