The Android Dev Guide explains it nicely : String FILENAME = "hello_file"; String string = "hello world!"; FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); fos.write(string.getBytes()); fos.close(); If you want the files you create to be visible to the outside world, use external storage . But as I said in the comment, make sure you're "being a good citizen". These files stick around even after the user uninstalls your app.
