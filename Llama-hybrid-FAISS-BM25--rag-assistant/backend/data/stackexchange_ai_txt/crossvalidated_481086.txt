Without the data, it's hard to say, but one potential answer could be that these TSs are positively correlated. Let's assume that you have two TSs A and B \begin{align} y_{a,t} = \mu_A + \epsilon_t,\\ y_{b,t} = \mu_B + \nu_t,\\ \end{align} and you test $H_{A,0}: \mu_A = 0$ and $H_{B,0}: \mu_B = 0$ . You can't reject them, maybe your TS are very volatile. Then you construct the third time series $y_{c,t} = y_{a,t} - y_{b,t}$ . Assume that your errors are perfectly correlated $(cor(\epsilon_t, \nu_t) = 1$ ). This implies that $y_{c,t} = \mu_A - \mu_B$ and hence always significant unless $\mu_A = \mu_B$ . Intutition is that by combining two TSs you can gretly reduce the variablility and hence have a new significant TS. I attach the code the show the idea. library(mvtnorm) set.seed(1) data
