In a single classification tree, these groups are coded the same as any other categorical variable. This is often done as either binary coding or just using an integer. There are different arguments for using either. In random forests if you are using binary coding, some groups will be included/excluded for any given tree. So you may have an indicator for country_2 but not country_3 . If you leave the group variable as an integer then the ordering can affect the outcome as well. What does it mean for country > 5 and country ? How does that change if you randomly re-label the countries with new integers? At each step in growing a tree, the algorithm is looking for the split that optimizing the criteria. If there are large differences between groups then the grouping variable will be important, but if it is only moderately important and you prune a tree, then the variable may essentially excluded. Like most other machine learning algorithms, CART and random forests do not necessarily account for dependency between observations within groups the way you would expect in a hierarchical regression model. If there is dependency between observations, it should be captured by the random forest algorithm through the generation of many trees that use the grouping variable. However if other variables demonstrate greater discrimination then the grouping variable may be ignored. In your case, country and population are perfectly collinear. There is no information gained by using both variables in your model. So you can think about how a random forest model would treat these variables in your data.
