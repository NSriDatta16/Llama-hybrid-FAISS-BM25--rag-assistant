I haven't checked everything in your zip file, but the problem seemed to be simple enough based on the JAGS model you have posted. The discrepancy between sd and JAGS output is due to sensitivity to the prior. To test this, you can use data cloning which relies on the same MCMC machinery to get MLE. If posterior mean is different from MLE, it is most likely due to the prior. You shouldn't expect MLE for N=9. You might want to ponder if you really want a Bayesian answer if this discrepancy bothers you.
