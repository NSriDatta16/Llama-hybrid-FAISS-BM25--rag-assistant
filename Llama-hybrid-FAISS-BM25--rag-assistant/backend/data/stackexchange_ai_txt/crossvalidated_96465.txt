The likelihood of action is surely the dependent variable. So one way to do it would be 5 separate ordinal logistic regression models - one for each action. If you wanted to look at all 5 actions at the same time you would need a multivariate ordinal logistic regression, which is something I have not seen done (but it ought to be possible)
