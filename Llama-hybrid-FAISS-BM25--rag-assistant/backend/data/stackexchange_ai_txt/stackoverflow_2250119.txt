The G1 has 256MB of internal storage for applications. Even on the Nexus One there's only 512MB so I think it's unlikely that anyone would want a single application taking up such a high proportion of this storage, so creating a 100MB+ .apk file isn't going to be practical. You are right that stock android phones cannot run applications from the SD Card. (There are custom firmwares that allow this, but this isn't going to help you as only a small minority of users run these.) You say that you cannot run a webserver, but unfortunately, I think that's your only real option here. You could dowload the images as needed and cache them on the SD Card if you had them on a webserver somewhere. Configuring a webserver to serve a whole of images is pretty straightforward, although you may need to do some work to stop people looking at the images using a web browser rather than your app if you're charging for it.
