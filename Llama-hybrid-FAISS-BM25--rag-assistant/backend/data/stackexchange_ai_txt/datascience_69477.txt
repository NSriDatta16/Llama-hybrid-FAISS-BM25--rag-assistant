Use embeddings to find similarity between documents

I need to find cosine similarity between two text documents. I need embeddings that reflect order of the word sequence, so I don't plan to use document vectors built with bag of words or TF/IDF. Ideally I would use pre-trained document embeddings such as doc2vec from Gensim. How to map new documents to pre-trained embeddings ? Otherwise what would be the easiest way to generate document embeddings in Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch?
