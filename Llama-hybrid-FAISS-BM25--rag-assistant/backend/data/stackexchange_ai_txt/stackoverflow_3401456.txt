Since you're using basic web protocol, you could consider using an HTTPS channel and 1) embedding the credentials in the URL - as long as you're using HTTPS this is OK 2) getting a unique identifier back from the service on initial validation of credentials, and then requiring this identifier in all future calls - saves on the db lookup, but you should still stay in https - if you use http, then it's by definition insecure
