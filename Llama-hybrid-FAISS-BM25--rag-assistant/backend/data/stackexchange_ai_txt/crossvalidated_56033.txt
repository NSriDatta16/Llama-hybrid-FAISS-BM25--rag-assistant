how can the probabilities of sampling subset proportions be tested?

Assume we have 10 different jigsaw puzzles. Each puzzle has a different number of pieces, e.g., 1st puzzle = 100 pieces 2nd puzzle = 120 pieces 3rd puzzle = 240 pieces . . . Further, assume we take all the pieces from all the different puzzles and put them together in one pile (n = 100 + 120 + 240 + ...). Now, assuming we take a sample of X pieces from the pile and find that we have picked a certain number of pieces from each puzzle such that: X = 100 3/100 cover 1st puzzle 3/100 23/100 cover 2nd puzzle 23/120 12/100 cover 3rd puzzle 12/240 I am interested in calculating the probability of getting a certain coverage (or proportion) of each puzzle (separately) from sample X. I am not interested in the probability of the proportion distribution (as can be found using chi squared goodness of fit). Essentially, I would like to show that a very high coverage of a small puzzle has a very low probability in a small sample. My questions are: Assuming the sampling is random is it valid to use a one-tailed z-statistic to find the p-value. Assuming the sampling is initially random, but from sample X only those pieces that answer a certain criteria (e.g., colour or wight) are considered in the puzzle coverage calculation, is the z-statistic test still valid? Finally, what test would be appropriate if some pieces fit more than one puzzle? (Just to clarify, this is not homework!)
