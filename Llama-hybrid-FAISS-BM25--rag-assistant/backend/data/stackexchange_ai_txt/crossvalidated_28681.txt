Multivariate normal distribution of regression coefficient?

While reading a textbook on regression I encountered the following paragraph: The least squares estimate of a vector of linear regression coefficients ( $\beta$ ) is $$ \hat{\beta} = (X^{t}X)^{-1}{X^t}y $$ which, when viewed as a function of data $y$ (considering the predictors $X$ as constants), is a linear combination of the data. Using the Central Limit Theorem, it can be shown that the distribution of $\beta$ will be approximately multivariate normal if the sample size is large. I'm definitely missing something from the text, but I don't understand how can a single $\beta$ value have a distribution? How are the multiple $\beta$ values generated to obtain the distribution referred to in the text?
