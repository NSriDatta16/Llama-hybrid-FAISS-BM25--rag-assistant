The reason why logistic regression appears more "stable" than neural networks (I'm assuming you mean multilayer perceptrons) is because of the difference of nature. We can summarize these differences in terms of the decision boundary and flexibility. Logistic regression models are linear models (see the CV thread Why is logistic regression a linear classifier? ), and so their decision boundaries are relatively constrained. NN's are highly nonlinear models (assuming you're using some form of nonlinear activation) that are able to form much more complex decision boundaries. Needless to say that this also leads us to the conclusion that logistic regression is less flexible than NN's are.
