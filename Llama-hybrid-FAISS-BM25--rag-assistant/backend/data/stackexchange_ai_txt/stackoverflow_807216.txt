For slug generation I don't think that generation time should be an issue, unless your slug algorithm is insanely complicated! Similarly, storage space won't be an issue. I would store the slug in the database for the simple reason that slugs usually form part of a permalink and once a permalink is out in the wild it should be considered immutable. Having the ability to change a slug for published data seems like a bad idea.
