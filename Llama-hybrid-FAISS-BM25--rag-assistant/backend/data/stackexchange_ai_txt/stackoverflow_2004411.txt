Embedding a link to google map in the email

In my meeting management application, I am trying to send the meeting location information via mail and in the mail content I would like to place a link to to the google map site, so that the meeting place could be seen on the map. What would be the best way to construct the google map url string (eg. http://maps.google.com/maps?q=address ) , for a particular address. Thanks
