If you are using ASP .NET then you are already 'drinking the Microsoft Kool-Aid', or at least sipping it quite a bit. With A, you are primarily using Visual Studio as a glorified text editor, with all debugging, organization, and other work being done manually. With B, you are able to use all the debugging and editing features in Visual Studio. The downside is that Visual Studio has it's own way of doing some things that is initially pushed upon you; though with some effort you can modify the project settings to act how you want. In any situation you have to compare what you gain vs what you lose. In the case of going from A to B, you are losing a bit of flexibility, but gaining a ton of debugging capability.
