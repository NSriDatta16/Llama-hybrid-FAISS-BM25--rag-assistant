Correct way to add robots.txt and hide it?

I have a secret folder on my hosting, which may not be seen by visitors. I've added a robots.txt to htdocs : User-agent: * Disallow: /super-private/ However, if a visitor goes to http://example.com/robots.txt , he can see the name of the private folder. Is there anything to be done? Htaccess maybe?
