At this point, a Silverlight application is as "cross-platform" as any other web based technology. You can build an application in Silverlight that will work on different platforms ONLY if the Silverlight plug-In is implemented for the platform's slew of browsers. The cross-platform magic of Silverlight is just it being accessible on the web. Editorial: Remember that Silverlight is just a response from Microsoft to Flash. They are trying to leverage the skills of existing .NET developers and give them the ability to deliver a much more rich user experience that was routinely delivered using Flash. Silverlight is a subset of WPF which "makes it less powerful" but WPF is specifically a Windows technology anyway that is simply exposed in web apps through Silverlight's implementation.
