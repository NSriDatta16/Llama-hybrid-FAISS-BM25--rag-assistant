If you agree that a logistic regression is a special case of a neural network, then the answer is D. R. Cox, who invented logistic regression.[1] A neural network with zero hidden layers and a single sigmoid output and trained to maximize the binomial likelihood (equiv. minimize cross-entropy) is logistic regression. Minimizing a binomial cross-entropy is equivalent to maximizing a particular likelihood: the relationship between maximizing the likelihood and minimizing the cross-entropy [1] D. R. Cox.
