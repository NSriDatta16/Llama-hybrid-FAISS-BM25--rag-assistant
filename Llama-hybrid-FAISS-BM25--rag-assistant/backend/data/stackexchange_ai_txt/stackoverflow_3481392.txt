Keeping page changes history. A bit like SO does for revisions

I have a CMS system that stores data across tables like this: Entries Table +----+-------+------+--------+--------+ | id | title | text | index1 | index2 | +----+-------+------+--------+--------+ Entries META Table +----+----------+-------+-------+ | id | entry_id | value | param | +----+----------+-------+-------+ Files Table +----+----------+----------+ | id | entry_id | filename | +----+----------+----------+ Entries-to-Tags Table +----+----------+--------+ | id | entry_id | tag_id | +----+----------+--------+ Tags Table +----+-----+ | id | tag | +----+-----+ I am in trying to implement a revision system, a bit like SO has. If I was just doing it for the Entries Table I was planning to just keep a copy of all changes to that table in a separate table. As I have to do it for at least 4 tables (the TAGS table doesn't need to have revisions) this doesn't seem at all like an elegant solution. How would you guys do it? Please notice that the Meta Tables are modeled in EAV (entity-attribute-value) . Thank you in advance.
