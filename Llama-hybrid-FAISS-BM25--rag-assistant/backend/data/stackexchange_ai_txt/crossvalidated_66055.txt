Holt Winters initialization using backcasting like SPSS

I'm trying to figure out how SPSS is initializing the multiplicative Holt Winters exponential smoothing model using backcasting. Thankfully IBM roughly described their way of doing so .. very roughly. Assuming a seasonal period of 3 and 3 seasons (9 observations) for the sake of simplicity. As far as I understand they fit lines for all corresponding observations of all seasons with intercept. Fitting observations 1,4,7 with intercept $µ_1$ and slope $β_1$ .. fitting observations 2,5,8 with intercept $µ_2$ and slope $β_2$ .. and so on. So the initial trend is the average of all slopes. But how exactly are the seasonal indices computed? And isn't the intercept mostly the first observation on a regression line, is it?? (e.g. observation 1 for the first line) EDIT: I guess it will help me a lot if I know more about how backcasting is performed in general. All I found in literature is that the time series is reversed and smoothed values are generated for the season before $t_1$. But how do I get the initial values used for forecasting when I only have compound backcasts?
