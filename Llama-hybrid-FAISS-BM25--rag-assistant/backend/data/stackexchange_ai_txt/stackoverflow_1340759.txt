Create a composite index on (col, id) if you're using MyISAM for your table. In InnoDB , the PRIMARY KEY is implicitly included into your table as a row pointer, since InnoDB tables are index-organized by design. In case of InnoDB , to make a composite index on (col, id) it is enough to create an index on col and make sure id is the PRIMARY KEY . This index will be used to filter on col and order by id . The index is a B-Tree structure so it can iterate ASC and DESC with same efficiency.
