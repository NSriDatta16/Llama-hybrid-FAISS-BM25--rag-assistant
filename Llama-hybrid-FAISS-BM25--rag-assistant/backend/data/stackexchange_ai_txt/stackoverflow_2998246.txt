Here are some guidelines for allocating memory: Allocate only if necessary. Huge objects should be dynamically allocated. Most implementations don't have enough local storage (stack, global / program memory). Set up ownership rules for the allocated object. Owner should be responsible for deleting. Guidelines for deallocating memory: Delete if allocated, don't delete objects or variables that were not dynamically allocated. Delete when not in use any more. See your object ownership rules. Delete before program exits.
