I strongly recommend you at least learn a bit of Python first, even if you decide stay in C++. One may say C++ is the most powerful program language. However, for a starter, there are too many traps and pitfalls. In your situation, Python is something that can let you know more about programming. Since you have no experience in Python, It's very easy to learn at the beginning. And it will show its effect very quickly. Plus, learning it will help you understand C++ more, like STL and Boost, they all have similarities with Python. Qt even has PyQt as a Python bindings. They have the same API, while the syntax in Python is clean and elegant. Here is a remarkable tutorial for Python: http://diveintopython3.org/ I suggest you just try it a bit, it wouldn't hurt.
