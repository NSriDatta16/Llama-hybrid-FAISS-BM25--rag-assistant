Is there a list of famous software products that do and do not do testing?

I would be interested in looking at a list of projects that did and did not do unit testing, and other forms of regression testing, to see how those companies turned out. All test infected developers know it saves them time, but it would be interesting to what correlation there is between code quality/test coverage and business success. Something objective like: xyz corp, makes operating systems, didnt test, makes $50M 123 corp, makes operating systems, does test, makes $100M Does anyone know of any studies done?
