You must be talking about User-Agent. I'm not sure how you set it in Indy but the User-Agent HTTP header identifies which client is used, so you can set it to pretend you're IE or another browser. Also, try using an HTTP sniffer (Scoop is a good one on OSX) to see exactly what headers are being sent to make sure you behave exactly like the browser.
