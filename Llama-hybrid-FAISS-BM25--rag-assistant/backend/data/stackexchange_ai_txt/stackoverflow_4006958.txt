Can jboss snmp adapter(snmp agent) be extended to support my defined MIB?

I have our own MIB files, and I know in many cases, I have to write snmp agent to support my own MIB. But this time, I think if I can make jboss snmp adapter(JBossSNMPAdapter) to support my MIB, it will be much easier. So that, through jboss snmp adapter, I can query by its oid. I know JBossSNMPAdapter already suppport MIB-II. I wonder if jboss snmp adapter can suppport user defined MIB so that user can query by oid? And how to configure? Are there some materials about this (jboss snmp adapter)? Thanks a lot
