Yes. We can compute exactly (and elegantly) the variance. The variance is the sum of - The average of the variance within each group - The variance of the means (weighted by the number of observations) Notice that a similar result exists for mutual information All the theory is there : http://www.burtonsys.com/climate/composite_standard_deviations.html
