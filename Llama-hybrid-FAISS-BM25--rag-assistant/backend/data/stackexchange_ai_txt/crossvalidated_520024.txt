Since the interval between two observations is not constant, we are left with two options Treat the observations as regular time series with missing data. In this case, we need to impute missing values. There is a list of imputation techniques discussed here : https://towardsdatascience.com/6-different-ways-to-compensate-for-missing-values-data-imputation-with-examples-6022d9ca0779 . Then use any regular time series forecasting method like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM, etc. Treat the observations as irregular as they are and use techniques discussed here : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169207086990047 , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920306739
