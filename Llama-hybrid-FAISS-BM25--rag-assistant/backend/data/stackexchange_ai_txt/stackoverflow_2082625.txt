Is there an "embedded DBMS" to support multiple writer applications (processes) on the same db files?

I need to know if there is any embedded DBMS (preferably in Java and not necessarily relational) which supports multiple writer applications (processes) on the same set of db files. BerkeleyDB supports multiple readers but just one writer. I need multiple writers and multiple readers. UPDATE: It is not a multiple connection issue. I mean I do not need multiple connections to a running DBMS application (process) to write data. I need multiple DBMS applications (processes) to commit on the same storage files. HSQLDB, H2, JavaDB (Derby) and MongoDB do not support this feature. I think that there may be some File System limitations that prohibit this. If so, is there a File System that allows multiple writers on a single file? Use Case: The use case is a high-throughput clustered system that intends to store its high-volume business log entries into a SAN storage. Storing business logs in separate files for each server does not fit because query and indexing capabilities are needed on the whole biz logs. Because "a SAN typically is its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the regular network by regular devices" , I want to use SAN network bandwidth for logging while cluster LAN bandwidth is being used for other server to server and client to server communications.
