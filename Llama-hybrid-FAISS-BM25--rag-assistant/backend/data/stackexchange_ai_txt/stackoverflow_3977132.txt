As S.Lott said, it's S - 3 to insert a number sign (or hash, pound, octothrope). Why do you want to use the meta modifier to insert it? Also, what is M - 3 bound to on your setup? You can get it by doing an C - h - k and then hitting the key combination. Assuming you are referring to Alt properly and that it's setting the Meta modification bit you can shove (global-unset-key (kbd "M-3")) into your .emacs and eval it to disable this from happening. All "normal" keys are bound to self-insert-command . The shift modifier simply upcases the 'key' which is used to call this function so you get a # instead of 3 when you do a S-3. Also, I still don't understand why you're using Alt rather than shift to display the # symbol. What do you do when you want to type a @?
