K-fold crossvalidation: how do MSE average and variance vary with K?

I'd like to get an intuition about how varying k impacts k-fold validation. Is the following right? Average of the OOS MSEs should generally decrease with k Because, a bigger "k" means the training sets are larger, so we have more data to fit the model (assuming we are using the "right" model). Variance of the OOS MSEs should generally increase with k. A bigger "k" means having more validation sets. So we have have more individual MSEs to average out. Since the MSEs of many small folds will be more sparse than MSEs of few large folds, variance will be higher.
