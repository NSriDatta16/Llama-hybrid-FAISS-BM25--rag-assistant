When passing event data directly, the property to use is "events". When naming a source (such as your web service) you use "eventSources". See also: Fullcalendar is not displaying events Also, this line looks like a problem: json.Append("[id:1,title:\"FLEPI01 Agent Office 1\\\\n17-21 London Street SP10 2NU\",start:Date(1300620600000),end:Date(1300624200000),className:\"2\",allDay:false}"); You're opening that JSON chunk with a "[" as opposed to a "{". As for the rest of your ASP and how you're building the JSON, I am clueless--I know nothing of ASP and its mechanisms. That said, there has got to be some sort of JSON serialization method available to you--manually building JSON is very bad practice. Finally, use Firebug to see if the AJAX request is being made. If it is, copy the response body and validate it at http://www.jsonlint.com/ . In your case, you'll find that your object-property names and string-values are not double quoted.
