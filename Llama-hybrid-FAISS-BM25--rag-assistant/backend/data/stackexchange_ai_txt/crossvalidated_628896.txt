Suitability of an F test for proportion data?

I'm reading a paper where the authors have 3 related time series based on proportion data. They test for a change in these proportions by using an F test and state that this allows them to check whether the slopes differ significantly from zero. This doesn't seem right to me because surely you'd want to check whether each proportion is different from zero not whether any do. Am I missing something here.
