Learning R will benefit your career . It’s widely used for analysis in many fields. It’s a great addition to your resumé and shows that you can learn new skills as they’re needed for a project. It will give you more experience with performing different analyses and more insight into work different programming languages work so you can choose the best tool for each job. You should take any opportunity to learn new transferable skills. It is rare to have sufficient time to invest in your professional development . You will be able to use these skills future project and may even seek projects that require more technical skills once you are able to do them. If you go on to mentor students then experience outside your comfort zone, learning a new language will help you understand what they’re going through when they need to use new tools and techniques in their research. R is an open source language so you will be able to use it, even in working environments where you can not access MATLAB. It’s far easier to release you code (as a stand-alone research output) or share it with collaborators. You’ll also have access to a wide array of R packages . With these you can perform analyses specific to different fields without having to implement these methods yourself. The plotting capabilities available in R will also benefit your future projects and make it easier to communicate your research results. While you may have flexibility on this project to produce the results by any means, it’s still worth considering the opportunity to update the tools in your workflow. Using R is encouraged to perform reproducible research . You can document the analysis that you’ve performed and export reports with Rmarkdown so that collaborators can see exactly what you’ve done. This will also be beneficial to you if you need to run it again on new data or after correcting a mistake. When you come to write up the project, a good record of the analysis that you’ve performed and figures you’ve generated will also be useful.
