How do you exclude a property from being persisted in Azure Table storage?

If I have a class like this: public class Facet : TableServiceEntity { public Guid ParentId { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Uri{ get; set; } public Facet Parent { get; set; } } Parent is derived from the ParentId Guid, and that relationship is intended to be filled in by my repository. So how do I tell Azure to leave that field alone? Is there an Ignore attribute of some type, or do I have to create an inherited class that provides those relationships instead?
