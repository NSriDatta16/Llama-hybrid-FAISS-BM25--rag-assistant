The tools in Python are just better than R. Ther R community is pretty stagnant while the Python community is evolving really quick. Especially in tools for Data Science. Also Python works way easier with everything around it. You can easily scrape the web, connect to databases and so on. That makes prototyping really fast. And if you have a working prototype and care to make it faster or integrate it into the company workflow, it gets usually reimplemented in Java. R has a few neat tools and visualization but it is not that great to build new stuff in it.
