Other options worth exploring include Sitemesh , which is built on the idea of page decorators, and Java Server Faces (JSF), which employs web-based UI components. And while we're talking about rapid development with web frameworks on the Java platform, I encourage you to check out Grails . It has the same mission has Django; namely, rapid web app development based on convention over configuration. Hope that's not too many suggestion for one post. :o)
