changing body class based on user's local time

I'm trying to add a body class of 'day' if it's 6am-5pm and 'night' if "else" based on the user's local time. I tried the following but it didn't work. Any ideas? In the head: function setTimesStyles() { var currentTime = new Date().getHours(); if(currentTime > 5 && currentTime In the body: Also, is there a more elegant way to achieve what I need? This site is on Wordpress btw.
