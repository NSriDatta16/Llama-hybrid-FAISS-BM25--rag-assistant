As for Algorithmia and monkeylearn, I don't know if you will find much help for those here due the fact that Python and R / RStudio are the predominant 'data science' open source (read: free) platforms. Otherwise, if Algorithmia or monkeylearn has tutorials go for it. The project you are interested in doing is not trivial (with no experience) but completely within the grasp of a novice given enough time. May I suggest starting with R / RStudio . This is simply my opinion based on my learning path. "Your mileage may vary!" Then find some tutorials such as Towards Data Science and see how it goes.
