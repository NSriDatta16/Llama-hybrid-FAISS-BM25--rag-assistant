Delphi project hierarchy comming from .net background

Comming from a C# background I'm now trying to learn Delphi. There are many similarities, but one of the first road blocks I'm facing now is my project hierarchy. In .net I've got the following Solution |-Project1 (.dll) |-Project2 (.exe) I used to also organise them like that in my folder structure. But I can't find the equivalent in Delphi. What is a Solution called and what are my projects. Is there a translatable concept, or how do you suggest I organise my projects?
