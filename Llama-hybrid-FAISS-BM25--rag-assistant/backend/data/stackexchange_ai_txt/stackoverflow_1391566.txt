Since auto implemented getters takes the same name for the property and the actual private storage variables. How can you change it in the future? I think the point being said is that use the auto implemented instead of field so that you can change it in the future if in case you need to add logic to getter and setter. For example: public string x { get; set; } and for example you already use the x a lot of times and you do not want to break your code. How do you change the auto getter setter... for example for setter you only allow setting a valid telephone number format... how do you change the code so that only the class is to be change? My idea is add a new private variable and add the same x getter and setter. private string _x; public string x { get {return _x}; set { if (Datetime.TryParse(value)) { _x = value; } }; } Is this what you mean by making it flexible?
