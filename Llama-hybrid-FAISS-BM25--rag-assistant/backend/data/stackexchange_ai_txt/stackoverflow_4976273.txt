Filtering SelectListItem using a string array.-mvc

I have tow variables in my mvc application .that is shown below public IEnumerable AvailableAgents { get; set; } public string[] AvailableAgentSelected { get; set; } public IEnumerable AgentsNotselected{ get; set; } The AvailableAgents contains all agent list items. and AvailableAgentSelected is a string array it contains values of selected agents only.. From the above data how can i store the agents who are not selected to AgentsNotselected (means,select all agent list items whose values are not in AvailableAgentSelected ) . I want an efficeiant way to do it .
