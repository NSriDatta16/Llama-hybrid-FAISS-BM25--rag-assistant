I'd go with an inverted index , like a search engine. You've basically got a fixed vocabulary of 64 words. Then similarity is measured by hamming distance, instead of cosine similarity like a search engine would want to use. Constructing the index will be slow, but you ought to be able to query it with normal search enginey speeds. The book Introduction to Information Retrieval covers the efficient construction, storage, compression and querying of inverted indexes.
