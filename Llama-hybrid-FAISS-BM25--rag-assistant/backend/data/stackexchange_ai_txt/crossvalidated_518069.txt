I'm going to disagree with the other answers. Fundamentally, I would say that deep learning is defined by a hierarchy of learned representations , and not by which particular model is used to define these representations. Indeed, this is how Goodfellow et al define it in the introductory section of their text Deep Learning (neural networks are not mentioned until later). In other words, the key with deep learning is that we are effectively learning a series of transformations of our data. Typically, these transformations define a neural network, with the activations of each layer serving as the transformed input data. However, this need not be the case. Deep Gaussian processes , for instance, have been gaining some attention in the research community. However, if I were teaching an introductory class, I would feel perfectly comfortable using your professor's definition: in practice, people overwhelmingly use neural networks for deep learning. You can do deep learning with basically any nonlinear model. PCA, being linear, does not qualify (though nonlinear analogues of PCA, such as kernel PCA, can qualify, see this article ).
