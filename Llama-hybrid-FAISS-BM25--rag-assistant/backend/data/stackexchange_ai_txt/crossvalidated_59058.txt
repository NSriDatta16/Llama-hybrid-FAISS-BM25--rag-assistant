Exogeneous regressors in auto.arima and using them in forecast function in R

I'm trying to forecast a seasonal time series based on its historical values, and also two more time series (that are seasonal themselves.) I'm trying to use an auto.arima , and I'm going to input the other two time series (the exogeneous regressors) as a contatenated list of dummy variables, in auto.arima's xreg parameter. I am having difficulty how to use the forecast function after this point. I've written up the following code, but I don't understand what I should put in the xreg and newxreg parameters of the forecast function. tempfit Also, my data points for these three series were all values per day that had a seven day seasonality. In order to let auto.arima calculate the (p,q,d) for seasonality, I converted them to time series with a frequency of 7. Now, after forecasting is done, the plot shows one unit for every seven days. How can I covert this back to one unit per day? Further, do you happen to know how we can input a set of external regressors to an ETS model? EDIT : I just saw the following page from Dr. Hyndman: Time series modeling with dynamic regressors in SAS vs R Is it safe to assume that I don't need to enter a newxreg parameter for my forecast? Also, I want to know if it's statistically correct to use the two external regressors in xreg , but then also use a number of dummy variables in xreg that will represent the seasonality of these two variables.
