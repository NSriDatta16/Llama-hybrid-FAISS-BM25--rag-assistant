After looking through the headers, no - there are no specific defines for NPTL vs LinuxThreads. If you need such a define, write a little script that produces a header file, or pass a define flag to the compiler. You can get the info by parsing the output of /lib/libc.so.6 (that library can be run direcly as a normal executable). I'll leave the details to you, but the output looks like: LinuxThreads: GNU C Library stable release version 2.3.4, by Roland McGrath et al. Copyright (C) 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
