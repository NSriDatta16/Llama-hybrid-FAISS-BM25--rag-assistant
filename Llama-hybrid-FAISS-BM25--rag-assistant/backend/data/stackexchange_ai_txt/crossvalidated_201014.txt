ANOVA $\chi^2$ test versus coefficient p-values

I try to estimate which of the features I'm using to build my logistic regression model are statistically significant. Why does the answer given by coefficients p-values differ from the one I receive running anova with the Chisq test on the same model? Given significance level equal to 0.05, I would consider significant all of the predictors if the "summary" result is the point of reference, while only some of them (campaign, emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, contactCellular, monthNov, monthApr) if the avona result can be considered reliable... Where's the error I'm making trying to compare these two results. summary(lrModel) Coefficients: Estimate Std.
