Can't you say author = AuthorsData.frank_herbert instead of specifying author_id directly? Other than that, perhaps calling meta.Session.flush() after inserting your AuthorsData would force the id attribute to get the value? That's what I use in my tests when I need the ID to be assigned (I don't use fixture).
