PCA for dimensionality reduction of audio data

I am trying to get spectrogram from audio file, using voicebox tool. My input audio file is audiofile.wav . After spectrogram, I want to apply PCA to my spectrogram matrix, b (to reduce dimensionality). Is it the correct way to apply PCA? [s,fs]=wavread(audiofile.wav); [t,f,b]=spgrambw(s,fs,'gmJcw'); coeff=pca(b); my_features = b*coeff(:,1:50); Any suggestions/hint are welcomed.
