My world looks like this: DB1 Controller : Controls data flow to views, filters/organizes data from views. Implements business rules for the given application . Knows the business rules between Models. Views: Nothing more than templates that display data provided by the Controller. Pass all data to the controller. Has no knowledge of Model1 or Model2 or the the business logic that governs them.
