Help with changing index in javascript/jquery

I have an javascript array, which looks like: var styles = new Array(); styles[0] = { ... Position: 0, ... }; styles[1] = { ... Position: 1, ... }; styles[2] = { ... Position: 2, ... }; ... styles[N] = { ... Position: N, ... }; I use this array to display a list, where each item is a div. The end result is this: ... item 1... ... item 2... ... item 3... Now the "container" div is also jquery sortable. That way I can drag/drop the items and change the position. Now whenever the user drags an item to a different position I update the positions back in the array by looping through the div items, which is pretty bad. It looks more or less like that: var items = $("#container"); for (var i = 0; i Is there a better way to achieve this? Update 1: I need to save the positions in the database, which is why I need change my array after the list has been changed. The list changes depending on other criterias. So I could have a list of 10 items or I could have a list of X items. It depends on which list the users selects. Now if the user changes one list and then wants to see a second list, then I need to make sure that the first list maintains the positions.
