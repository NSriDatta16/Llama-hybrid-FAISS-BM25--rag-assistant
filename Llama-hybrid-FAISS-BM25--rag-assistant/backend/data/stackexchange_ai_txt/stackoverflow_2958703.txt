jquery slider ui question ("slide" vs "change" event..)

have following issue with jquery slider ui: http://mayacove.com/dev/slider/slider2.html slider works only when you drag handle, i.e., when you drag the slider the divs show and hide as expected (divs change as slider slides..) but: if I CLICK on any point on slider instead of dragging, divs change ONLY if I click on a precise spot where a div is supposed to switch, otherwise div does not switch.. how do I fix this please?? ( to make it simpler JS code is in slider2.html..) thank you very much..
