Best practices for php project organization using GIT?

I'm working on releasing a PHP framework I have been using for a few years on github. Been trying to read up on the most correct way a project should be structured, what extra files such as readme's etc should be added. Been coming up with blanks on google. Can anyone point me to a project that's a good example or any good write ups.
