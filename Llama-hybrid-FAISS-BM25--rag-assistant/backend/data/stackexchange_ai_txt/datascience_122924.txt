There are multipe approaches you could try. Here are some (without the claim to completeness): You could try to extract meaningful / helpful features from the time-series. A start might be counts, average values, variances and so on. But - using your understanding of the data - you might come up with better features. Combine these with the features from the tabular data and build a model of your choice over it. Stacked embeddings can combine two or more models. Just train the two base models and build another model that takes the base-model-predictions as features. Neural network architectures can deal with multiple data sources. The architecture would be slightly more complex than a simple layer architecture, but you could build recurrent layers for the time-series, feed-forward layers for the tabular data and combine both with more feed forward layers. You could build an embedding over the time series to bring it down to a fixed feature vector. Although this is related to aboves approaches, it is slightly different. You could enrich each time-steps feature vector with the same features from tabular data and build a model over the time-series.
