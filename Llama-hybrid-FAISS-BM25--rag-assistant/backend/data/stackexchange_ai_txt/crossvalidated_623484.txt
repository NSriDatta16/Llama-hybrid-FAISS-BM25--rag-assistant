Logistic regression uses maximum likelihood methods, and presumably the algorithm stops when the optimisation is "close enough". Your $0.02437628 \approx \frac{1}{41.023}$ , which is close to your desired $\frac1{41}$ . You would find similar results for the other observations. If you converted these into (log-)likelihoods, the actual proportions would give a marginally higher overall likelihood but without a substantial difference. A more relevant issue is the small number of 1st and 2nd class passengers embarking at Queenstown as your table shows, which if this is regarded as a random process means there is considerable uncertainty in the estimated probabilities, far larger than any optimisation errors. The large standard errors reported for some of the coefficients hint at this. (Incidentally, my great-grandmother, great-aunt and great-uncle and others embarked on the Titanic at Southampton and disembarked at Cherbourg - whether they should be included as survivors is another methodological issue.)
