You'll need to persist the user's selection in some manner. Cookies, session variable server-side, URL query parameter, localstorage - these are all options. URL query parameters and SLaks's suggestion of POSTing let you keep different settings for different tabs opened simultaneously, if that matters to you. EDIT: by URL query parameter I mean redirection, using window.location , to something like http://example.com/foo?refresh=30 and later parsing window.location.search yourself or using existing code for it.
