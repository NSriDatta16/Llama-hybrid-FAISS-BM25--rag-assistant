NMF and SVD are both matrix factorization algorithms. Wikipedia has some relevant information on NMF . SVD and PCA are intimately related. For starters, PCA is simply the eigendecomposition of the correlation. SVD is a generalization of eigendecomposition to non-square matrices. The singular values are the square root of the eigenvalues of the matrix multiplied by its transpose (making it square, and amenable to eigendecomposition). Furthermore, if the matrix is normal ($A^*A=A A^*$), the singular values are simply the absolute values of the eigenvalues. In any case, the singular values are non-negative, and losing the sign of the eigenvalues is the price you pay for being able to work with non-square matrices. The other responders have covered LSI/LSA...
