After reviewing your 259,200 record detailing 60 readings per minute for 60 minutes for 72 days .. I suggest that you create two predictor variables for an ARMAX model. The first predictor will be hourly totals. Create a series that has 4,320 hourly values and develop a prediction for the next 24 hours . Use this series and it's future values in the ARMAX model. Now create a series that has daily totals .. thus 72 historical values and a 1 period out forecast. Now construct an ARMA model using these two predictors and detect pulses, level shifts , local time trends and an arma structure. Proceed to estimate this hybrid model and iterate until all coefficients are significant and the error process is white noise. This is the approach i would use with AUTOBOX or any other iterative self-checking time series package.
