If I correctly understand your question, your main problem here is the length of your features which are varying. So I think you need to use Long short-term memory (LSTM ) model or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These types of models are based on Recurrent neural networks(RNN)s architecture which are used widely in deep learning models specially when you need some memory in your model or where your models input sequence length are varying. Here is a good article about Sequence Classification with LSTM .
