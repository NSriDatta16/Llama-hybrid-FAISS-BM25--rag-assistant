Bayesian model averaging when none of the models is well specified

Usually, from what I've read of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), a typical assumption is that one of the models is well specified... However, what will happen when all models are misspecified? What are its implications from a model uncertainty perspective? Edit: If I'm uncertain which model is correctly specified, instead of just using one model, I can average along all the models, and probably obtain better predictions than just sticking to one of the misspecified models... Will it still be able to correct for misspecification if all are misspecified?
