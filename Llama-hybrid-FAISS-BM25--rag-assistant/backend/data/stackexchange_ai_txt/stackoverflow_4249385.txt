plugin to dynamically generate reports from schema

I preface this with: this may have been asked before and I can't find it... Does anyone know of a drag and drop, user control like add-in for a C# .Net web application that allows the user to dynamically build reports off of my SQLServer 2005 database schema? I'm looking for something user-friendly that I can drop in my web application, with a little configuration, that will let the user generate reports for themselves...
