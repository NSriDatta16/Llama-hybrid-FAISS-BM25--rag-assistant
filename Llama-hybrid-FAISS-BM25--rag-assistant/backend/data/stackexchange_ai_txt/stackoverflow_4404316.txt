Some things to consider. First, your not closing the server connection. (cnn.Close();) Eventually, it will get closed by the garbage collector. But until that happens, your creating a brand new connection to the database every time rather than collecting one from the connection pool. Second, Do you have an index set in Sql Server covering the AccountID and Symbol columns? Third, While accountId being and int is nice and fast. The Symbol column being varchar(25) is always going to be much slower. Can you change this to an int flag?
