The first question is your task need to extract analytical features? If answer is yes CAE is not the best choice. NN extract features in unsupervised way, because of that is almost always very hard to interpret this features for human. Second thing what kind of a application of your features you are looking for? If you need some discriminative information you should precise your problem and find what kinds of objects you want to differentiate, or even try to get additional information to transform your problem into supervised domain. Usually in the medical fields features are extracted based on a strong math or medical ground. That features are easier interpreted by human and could improve medical diagnosis or treatments but only by making suggestions. The point is that consequences of decisions on this area are very seriously so they should be done by medical human specialists. Main question is if you expect this features to be global or local. If they are local maybe you can crop or you divide images into smaller overlapping windows? Second thing is if you really need so big resolution? If features could be extracted from smaller images you can try resize your images first, which should allow you to decrease number of hidden layer neurons and often reduce impact of small noises which are encoded/decoded by your network. And last but not least. Your autoencoder will be learning to encode image. If expected features are not directly 'visual' your results could be much worst, for example if your expected feature is number of some objects in the pictures, your autoencoder could disperse this information above whole hidden layer. If PCA or similiar methods seem to be rational approach since you have to do it in unsupervised way. (I can't write it as comment because of cross-validated limitation)
