Even with a non-rooted phone, a user could run a packet sniffer on their gateway to see where they're connecting. To "hide" the URL you could proxy its data through your own server, and provide the app with a URL to that server instead. Edit: Re. your edit, you can check the browser's user agent , but there's no foolproof way to be certain that a user is connecting from your app (it boils down to a DRM problem).
