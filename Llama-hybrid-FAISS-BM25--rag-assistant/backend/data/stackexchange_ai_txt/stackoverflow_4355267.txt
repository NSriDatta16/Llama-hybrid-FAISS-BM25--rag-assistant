One case where this makes a difference is if you use a value type for T. In this case, the value type does not need to be boxed in order to call interface methods, which has a performance impact. It also impacts the way the contents of the class will be stored, so if your class has a T[] internally, you'll get more efficient storage for the value type T than you would for an array of boxed IFoo . Also, you can specify constraints like where T: IEquatable , taking advantage of type-safe generic interfaces.
