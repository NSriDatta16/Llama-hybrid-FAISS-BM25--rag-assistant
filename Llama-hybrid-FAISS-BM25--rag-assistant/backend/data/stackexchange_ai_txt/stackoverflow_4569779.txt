Django: copy and manipulate a QuerySet?

I need to re-order a Django queryset, because I want to put None values at the bottom of an ORDER BY DESC query on a FloatField . Unfortunately, I'm struggling to find an elegant way to manipulate a Django queryset. Here's what I have so far: cities = City.objects.filter(country__id=country.id).order_by('value') if cities.count() > 1: cities_sorted = cities del manors_sorted[:] for city in cities: cities_sorted += city # Add code to cities = cities_sorted Currently, this fails with 'QuerySet' object does not support item deletion . Any idea how I can copy and re-order this QuerySet to put None items last?
