Understanding binary logistic regression as a linear model

I understand that binary logistic regression is applied to binary classification problems where the dependent variable $Y$ has only two possible outcomes. The independent variables are $x$ . The result of logistic regression is assigning a probability $p$ to one of the two outcomes and a probability $p-1$ to the other possible outcome. I am confused on how the linear combination of the independent variables $w_1 x_1 +w_2 x_2 +w_3 x_3 $ , $log \frac {p} {1-p}$ , the probability $p$ , the logistic function $\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}}$ are connected to each other. Can someone help me logically understand how these concepts go together so I can finally appreciate how logistic regression works? Thank you!
