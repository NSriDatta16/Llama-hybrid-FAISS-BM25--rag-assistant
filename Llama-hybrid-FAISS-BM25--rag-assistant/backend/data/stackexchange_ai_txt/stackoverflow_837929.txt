JQuery - what is the best way to fire a MVC controller action via JQuery?

Basically, I have several Radio Buttons in a filtering column. For example, if I am in the \Catalog\Flooring\Harwood section I have Radio Buttons for [Area Rugs], [Carpet] & [Stone & Tile]. So, what I want to do, instead of embedding an tag under the Radio Button I'd like to fire a JQuery event and do a regular post back to the server. I am thinking that $.post() should do it but I've not got it working correctly. PS: Anyway to embed/include the jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc.js file in my JS file so I get full intellisense?
