If you have reason to believe that the standard linear regression assumptions , $y = X\beta + \epsilon$, with $\epsilon$ being IID normal, and etc. Then it doesn't matter that your predictors are continuous or binary. Binary outcomes should generally not be modeled with a linear regression. Instead try a logistic regression.
