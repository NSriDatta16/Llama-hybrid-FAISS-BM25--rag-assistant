How Stochastic Binary Neurons works with rectified linear (or Linear threshold) case?

I'm taking a course in coursera about neural networks. I understand the relation and difference between "Sigmoid Neurons" and "Stochastic Binary Neurons", but I don't how could you adapt "Rectified Linear" to Stochastic. They said you could imaging the output: $$ \texttt{z} = b + \sum_i (x_i * w_i) \\ \text{(where } b \text{ is bias, }x \text{ the i}^{th}\text{ input, a }w \text{ the i}^{th}\text{ weight)}$$ as the rate of spike, and then use this as the lambda parameter of a poisson process. How does this work? If I want to know the probability of having a spike, I need to define $$X \approx P \,(\lambda * \delta t)$$ and calculate $P\,(X=1)$? What would be a correct $\delta t$? 1?
