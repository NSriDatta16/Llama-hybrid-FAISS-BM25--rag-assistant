It depends on the type of question/response in your survey. If they are like "I like", "I dislike", "Don't know", chl answers partially to your question. The first solution is chl's answer. You have to check if "Don't know" doesn't hide anything. You have to analyse separately these values to see if it highlights a specific profile of respondents. I'm not about imputation but... "Frenchy" software do it for MCA, ... often considering MAR assumption. It supposes that these answers are randomly distributed (you pick randomly another modality of response). You can also use a more sophisticated approach : if "Like" is at 30% and "Dislike" at 70% you pick an uniform random number distributed on (0,1) and choose "Like" if your number is at or below 0.3. If you pick a number between 0.3 and 1 you choose "Dislike". A more modern approach is Multiplie imputation (see MI PROC in SAS and mice package in R). Imputation is very efficient... But it can't recreate atypic profiles... If you're working in educational testing or if you need to compute a score, let me know I will complete this answer about scores estimation.
