Modelling regressor of historic data on basic features test set

I am using a historical dataset of sales of items in shops and I need to predict the sales of the next month of the period. I performed feature engineering, and now I have 10 features in the train set - median, avg of sales (prices and quantities). I want to perform Linear Regression, The test set contains only 2 features - Shop_id and Item_id. How can I perform prediction from fitted regressor with 10 coefficients, and the test has only the 2? I am not talking about doing PCA - the historic data has few historic sales features and the test only has the basics Dataset: Competitive data science predict future sales
