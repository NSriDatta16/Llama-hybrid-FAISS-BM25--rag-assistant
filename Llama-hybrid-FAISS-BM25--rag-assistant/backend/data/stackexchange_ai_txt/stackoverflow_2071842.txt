If you control the Javascript library you mention, I would say the easiest way would be to manually trigger the change event every time you change a field's value. I think this is how it's done in JQuery: Events/change Otherwise, a simple document.getElementById('myTextarea').onchange() might work as well. If you have many calls, you could wrap the changing of the value, and the triggering of the event into a changeFormElement(id, value) function. This requires, of course, that you can modify every instance of when a textarea is changed. If that is given, this is probably the most elegant way.
