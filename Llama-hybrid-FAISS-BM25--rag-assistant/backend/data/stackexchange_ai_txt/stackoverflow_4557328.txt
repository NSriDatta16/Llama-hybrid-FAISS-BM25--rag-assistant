Do user events get spawned on separate threads in Cocos2d / Objective C

I have scheduled a repeating callback on every frame: [self schedule:@selector(nextFrame:)]; This forms my main game loop. When a user touches the screen, an event is generated, e.g. - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { ... // Respond to event ... } Is this event generated instantaneously on a new thread? ...or is it queued and occurs when the current frame is finished? ...or something else? If it is 2. then then does this mean there are no multi-threading issues?
