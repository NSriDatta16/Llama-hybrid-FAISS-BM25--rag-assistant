Logistic regression satisfies your requirements -- two parameters controlling the mid-point and the rate of change. But there is no restriction on the domain of predictors. You can just fit a logistic regression using d as it is. However, if d is highly skewed (as it might be with that domain), then taking a log of d may be useful to prevent the fit being dominated by a few observations. If d includes exact zeros, then you obviously can't take logs. In that case, if you still think you need a transformation, then I'd use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation .
