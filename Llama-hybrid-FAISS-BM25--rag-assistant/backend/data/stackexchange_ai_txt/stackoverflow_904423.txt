Yes, GUID's are really bad for clustered indexes, since the GUIDs is by design very random and thus leads to massive fragmentation and thus performance problems. See Kim Tripp's blog - most notably " The CLustered Index Debate continues " and " GUIDs as PRIMARY and/or CLUSTERED key " - for a lot of valuable background info. If you really need to have an index on these TWO columns, I'd suggest a non-clustered index - it can be a primary index - just better not a clustered index. Marc
