This is exactly the problem EF mapping is designed to solve. Your POCO class need to match your 'conceptual model'... Not your 'data model'. If in EF you build your model from the database you simply need to rename your entity properties. Doing this changes the conceptual model - to match your POCO classes - but leaves the storage model unchanged, and sets up the appropriate mappings.
