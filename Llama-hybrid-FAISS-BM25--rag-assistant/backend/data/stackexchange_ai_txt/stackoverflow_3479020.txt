What do various clipboard/drag-and-drop formats mean?

I was playing around with drag and drop. I made a sample application and dropped a file from folder My Music onto my application. Here's what e.Data.GetFormats() returned: Shell IDList Array UsingDefaultDragImage DragImageBits DragContext DragSourceHelperFlags InShellDragLoop FileDrop FileNameW FileName IsShowingLayered DragWindow IsComputingImage DropDescription DisableDragText ComputedDragImage IsShowingText What do each of these mean and how to decode and use them? Googling each of them didn't yield any useful information.
