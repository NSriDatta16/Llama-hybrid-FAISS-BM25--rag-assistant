TFS 2010 Multiple build Agent User Management

With a Windows 2008 Server, that is the Build Server (TFS 2010), that has 2 Build Agents, how do you configure these agents that use the same account, to use multiple workspaces ( or to stop it from using multiple workspaces) with the same paths? Currently, the behavior i am seeing is IT is creating multiple workspaces, with the same user and the same paths. I have to manually delete the duplicate workspaces. a few build attempts later, more workspaces have been auto-created, and then fail to build because there are multiple workspaces with the same paths. Again, this is happening automatically, and having to delete workspaces manually every 10 minutes or so, is not an answer. Thanks. EDIT : uninstalled and reinstalled TFS Build Agent, and this resolved the issue.
