kNN is a classification algorithm, while k-Means is a clustering algorithm, so you're comparing apples and oranges. If you want to compare different types of kNN algorithms (different K or weighting), just use classification measures like % accuracy on a test dataset, F-Measure or area under ROC curve . If you want to compare different versions of k-Means or other clustering algorithms, you may use the V-Measure or the quantization error . For a more comprehensive list, check this paper . For both, speed can be measured by running the algorithms many times and computing the average time for training and, in the case of kNN, for testing. You may also want to check the time complexity for both algorithms, which does not require experimentation. KNN vs k-Means . But if you plan to use k-Means for classification, by storing the correct label for each cluster, just treat it as classification algorithm and use the same measures you'd use for kNN.
