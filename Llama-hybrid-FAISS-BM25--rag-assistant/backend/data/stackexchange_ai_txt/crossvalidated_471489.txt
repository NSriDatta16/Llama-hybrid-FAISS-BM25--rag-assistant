Intuitive explanation of PSIS-LOO cross-validation

I've been using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS-LOO) cross-validation for diagnosis and comparing Bayesian models fitted with Stan/ brms for a while now. From my experience with using it on both synthetic and real data, it seems to perform extremely well. So, naturally, I'd like to properly understand the method. I don't come from a quantitative background, I only got into Bayesian statistics about 1 year ago and I've been playing catch-up ever since then. Anyway, I've tried studying up on importance sampling and read the original Vehtari & Gelman (2015) paper a couple times now, but I still can't really connect the dots. I feel like I have a basic grasp of importance sampling, but I still don't understand how it can be used to evaluate the posterior predictive density. Does anyone have an intuitive explanation of PSIS-LOO? What it does and why it works? Ideally with as few formulas as possible. Thanks!
