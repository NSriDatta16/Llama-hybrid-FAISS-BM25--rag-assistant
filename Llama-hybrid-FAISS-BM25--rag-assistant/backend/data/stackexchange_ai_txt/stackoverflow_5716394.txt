The modulus and the private exponent are the private key, at least in a simplified way. With RSA, it is customary to include a few other parameters in the private key, such as the two (or more) prime factors of the modulus. These extra parameters do not offer more power (the modulus and private exponent are enough to compute signatures and decrypt data) but allow for a faster implementation (by a factor of 3x to 4x). Thus, possibly, the question is about recovering the prime factors of the modulus, given the information above. The generic method is given in the Handbook of Applied Cryptography , chapter 8, section 8.2.2, paragraph (i) ("Relation to factoring"), page 287.
