Adding Zhanxiong's comment as an answer. THE SVM always uses wx+b=0 to do classification (i.e., if wx+b>0 then class A, else class B). The soft margin concept just applies for training, i.e., the algorithm tolerates some misclassification during the training stage. This means that wx+b>=1 and wx+b is only used while training the model and classification on test data is done using wx+b>=0 or wx+b conditions.
