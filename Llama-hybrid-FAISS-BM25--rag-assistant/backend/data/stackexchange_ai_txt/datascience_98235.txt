Extracting features from bounding boxes of CornerNet

I am using the CornerNet model . I want to extract features from specific bounding boxes that have been detected. Unlike Faster RCNN , CornerNet does not use anchors proposals that allow extraction of features for each of the bounding boxes . Rather, it just outputs heatmaps with corner points for each category. I am unsure how I can get features of a particular bbox from these heatmaps . This is almost certainly not the way to go, but I'm thinking of training another feature extractor like the first half of an Autoencoder . I can crop the image according to the boxes detected by CornerNet and feed the cropped image to the feature extractor to get some representations for the required objects. Could anyone suggest a more direct approach or point out something I missed? PS - I have been shooed away from stackoverflow for asking the same question because some people felt it is not relevant there. If anything, please tell me what I can improve in the question before closing it altogether.
