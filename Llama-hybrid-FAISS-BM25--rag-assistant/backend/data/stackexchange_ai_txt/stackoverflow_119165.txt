It's been a while since I used Cocoon, so I can't say I really have a great answer for you. But since this question has been stagnating, a couple of points to suggest;-) Syntax should only matter if you are coding the literal SQL string. I was under the impression that with castor you can bind the variables (and let OQL select the appropriate format). i.e. " where field_date >= ?", myDateVal The CastorTransformer seemed to only make brief appearance in one specific version of Cocoon, and AFAIK its not in the latest. If you have control over the Cocoon version you are running, you might want to look at upgrading and alternatives to the CastorTransformer
