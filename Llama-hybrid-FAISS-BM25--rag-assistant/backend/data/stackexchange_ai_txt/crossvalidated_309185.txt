What is the meaning of the notation $\theta \sim p(\theta)$ and $y \sim p(y|\theta)$?

I've seen this notation pop up in some Bayesian statistics notes but despite my best efforts with Google I've not had any luck discovering the meaning. The only helpful context that I have is that $y$ is the observed data and $\theta$ is some sort of parameter. As for giving an example of this notation in use, I've seen De Finetti's theorem summarized as "$Y_1 , ... , Y_n | \theta$ are i.i.d. and $\theta \sim p(\theta)$ if and only if $Y_1 , ... , Y_n$ are exchangeable for all $n$". EDIT: Note, I'm not asking how something like $Y \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is read, I know exactly what that means. It's the $p$ parts that are confusing me.
