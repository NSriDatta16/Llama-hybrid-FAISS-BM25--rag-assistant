Archives not showing up in Organizer for Xcode 4

I'm trying to create an IPA in Xcode 4, much like the person who asked this question: Xcode 4: create IPA file instead of .xcarchive So--I got my Archive completing successfully--supposedly. It dumps .xcarchive files for the project in its destination folder. But these archives don't show up in my Organizer window. So I can't share them as described in the above question to create the IPA. There are no errors in the archiving process--they seem to be signed OK. So why aren't the archives showing up in the archive panel on the Organizer? Is there some step I'm missing...or obscure setting I need to modify?
