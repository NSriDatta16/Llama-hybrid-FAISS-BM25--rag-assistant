High covariance data for linear model, and PCA in R

I have 4 set of data Y X1 X2 X3 in same length where I need to perform a model selection of linear regression on Y~ X1+X2+X3-1. However, there are significant covariance between X2 and X3. $Cov(X2,X3)=0.98$, and $Cov(X1,X2)=0.7,Cov(X1,X3)=0.2$. I tried to use nls where it gave me something like $Y=0.8X1+0.2X3$, where by using AIC and BIC I obtained the most suitable model by $Y=X3$. My first question was: What's the proper way to determine the (first order) linear model in this case.(high covariance.) I encountered a possible solution called PCA.(principal component analysis) by using commend like prcomp(X,center=TRUE,scale=TRUE) where X=data.frame(X1,X2,X3) I also obtained a 2*2 rotation matrix where it said the column was the eigenvector, and a graph by using the code biplot(prcomp(X2,center=TRUE,scale=TRUE), scale = 0). However, I wasn't sure it this is going to be anyway helpful, specifically, how to use the 3*3 rotation matrix, because I need to regression with respect to all 3 data.(They are in fact independent market data, but with high covariance). Suppose the rotation matrix $=A$, should I use$XA,AX,A^TX$ or $XA^T$?
