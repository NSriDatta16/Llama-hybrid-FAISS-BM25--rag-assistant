Drag and Drop text - What am I missing?

I am trying to add drag-and-drop text to my Doc-View App. I added the COleDropTarget variable to the view class, registered it in OnCreate(). I added OnDragEnter(), OnDragOver(), OnDragLeave() and OnDrop() to that class as virtual overrides, but none of them are ever called. I previously had added m_pMainWnd->DragAcceptFiles(TRUE); to my App class. I tried commenting out that statement, but no affect. I tried using Spy++ to see where the messages go while I do a drag, but it logs nothing at all while I am dragging the text around in the App. What do I need? Or what else can I try, to narrow down the problem? TIA, Harvey
