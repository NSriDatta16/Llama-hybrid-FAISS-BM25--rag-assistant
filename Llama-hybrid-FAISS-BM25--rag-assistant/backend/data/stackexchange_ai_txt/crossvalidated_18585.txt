Time series with same variables but different respondents

I would like to measure the impact of an intervention using a form of time series or some related technique (like segmented regression). I would like to use the Schools and Staffing Survey, which assesses my variable of interest over time, however, the respondents are different at each time point. I assume different respondents would present a problem for this kind of analysis. Can anyone suggest another technique that would allow me to gauge the impact of the intervention?
