Yes, when you start with a stack of two dimensional channels then each successive convolutional layer will use multiple stacks of two dimensional kernels. Those kernels are stacked to the same depth as the number of input channels, and each such stack sums up to produce a single output channel. So typically the kernel weights are stored in a four dimensional array $N_{kwidth} \times N_{kheight}\times N_{input channels} \times N_{output channels}$ The terms "channel" and "feature map" are interchangeable, a CNN treats a 3 colour image and a middle layer with 3 feature maps identically. Although in practice for most image processing tasks 3 feature maps would be quite low number to see in typical hidden layers. In general after the input layer you don't think of the feature maps as being a meaningful image to a human, although you can plot them as images if you want, and the lower layers might be interpretable, looking similar to the input but with certain edges or textures enhanced.
