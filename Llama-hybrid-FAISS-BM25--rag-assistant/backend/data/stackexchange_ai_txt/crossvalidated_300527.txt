How to detect and eliminate outliers in a time series

I need to analyse a data set for my bachelor thesis and I am a little bit lost. The time series consist of measurements which were taken every 5th minutes from November 2016 until July 2017. Firstly I need to eliminate the negative values from the time series which are produced through malfunction in the measurement equipment. Then I need to find a model with which to eliminate double values which happen in a row. Lastly any exteme values ( For example when the previous intervals measurements have a value of 9,10,11,9,8,10 and then suddenly comes an interval with a value of 200 and the next one after is again 10) should also be counted as outliers. Since I have not had a lot of experience with analysing time series, I would gladly hear suggestions how can I at best model the time series and with which program ? Thank you in advance!
