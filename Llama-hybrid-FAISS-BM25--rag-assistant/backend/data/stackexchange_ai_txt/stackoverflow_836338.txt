Normally each view will be a seperate class in a seperate file. The class will then most likely implement some base class like Window or Control. As far as organization, if it's a simple app, put them in the root or in a UI folder. Or perhaps a Window folder and Controls folder. If it's a large app with several views, than break them out into functionality, i.e. an IM folder.
