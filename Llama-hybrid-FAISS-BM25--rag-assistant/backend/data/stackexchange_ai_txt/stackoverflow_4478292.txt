So, the main difference was due to error in my code, pointed out by ring0 (thank you). After repairing the bug, editing the tests to show response in every (n/10)th case out of n iterations and running both tests parallel, results are these: Results for Version 1 (with require): Processed 10000 times It took 4:56.806 [ 1292676882 - 1292677179 ] Average time: 29.681 miliseconds Results for Version 1 (with readfile): Processed 10000 times It took 4:35.242 [ 1292677437 - 1292677712 ] Average time: 27.524 miliseconds Results for Version 2 (with require): Processed 10000 times It took 4:55.760 [ 1292676879 - 1292677175 ] Average time: 29.576 miliseconds Results for Version 2 (with readfile): Processed 10000 times It took 4:32.336 [ 1292677433 - 1292677706 ] Average time: 27.234 miliseconds Graph: So, the new version/version 2 (the one, where the require/readfile is on top) is faster now, although not that significantly. I'll probably use that one, together with readfile enhancement (thanks to Emil ). Thank you all, this is what happens if you do not test properly :) This is what happens
