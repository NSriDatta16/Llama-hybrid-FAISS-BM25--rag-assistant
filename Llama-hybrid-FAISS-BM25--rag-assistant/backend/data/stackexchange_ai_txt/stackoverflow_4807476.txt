I assume you're putting a full width/height div with a higher Z-index than the original page. You then add images to that div element through drag drop? Implementing a hover info box has what you could use as Neil has already shown. Another option would be to find all controls at the Specific X, Y click - even those hidden by divs. Given an x,y coordinate, I need to find all html elements underneath it
