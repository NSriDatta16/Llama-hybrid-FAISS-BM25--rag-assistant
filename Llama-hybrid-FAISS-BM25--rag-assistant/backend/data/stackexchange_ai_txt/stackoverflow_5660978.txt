Using getChildHtml inside included template magento

I am trying to use $this->getChildHtml('head') from inside a page/html/header.phtml file in Magento. Using $this->getChildHtml('head') inside thh page/1column.phtml file works as expected. Can someone point me in the right direction to understand how the magic $this is used within templates? I think this Stack overflow question, Magento - using $this->getPriceHtml on custom page template is on the right lines, but I'm still missing something. Thanks
