Tests to establish correlation

I'm trying to analyze if there exists any correlation between two time series? So far I have not been able to notice any significant correlation. So if I were to assert in my report that these time series are uncorrelated what are the minimum experiments/tests/metrics/results that I must provide to support my claim?
