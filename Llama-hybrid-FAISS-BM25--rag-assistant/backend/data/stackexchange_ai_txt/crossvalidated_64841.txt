Does a median-unbiased estimator minimize mean absolute deviance?

This is a follow-up but also a different question of my previous one . I read on Wikipedia that " A median-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk with respect to the absolute-deviation loss function, as observed by Laplace ." However, my Monte Carlo simulation results does not support this argument. I assume a sample from a log-normal population, $X_1,X_2,...,X_N \sim \mbox{LN}(\mu,\sigma^2)$,where, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the log-mean and log-sd,$\beta = \exp(\mu)=50$ The geometric-mean estimator is a median-unbiased estimator for the population median $\exp(\mu)$, $\hat{\beta}_{\mbox{GM}}= \exp(\hat{\mu})= \exp{(\sum\frac{\log(X_i)}{N})} \sim \mbox{LN}(\mu,\sigma^2/N)$ where, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the log-mean and log-sd, $\hat\mu$ and $\hat\sigma$ are the MLEs for $\mu$ and $\sigma$. While a corrected geometric-mean estimator is a mean-unbiased estimator for the population median. $\hat{\beta}_{\mbox{CG}}= \exp(\hat{\mu}-\hat\sigma^2/2N)$ I generate samples of size 5 repeatedly from the LN$(\log(50),\sqrt{\log(1+2^2)})$. The replication number is 10,000. The average absolute deviations I got are 25.14 for the geometric-mean estimator and 22.92 for corrected geometric-mean. Why? BTW, the estimated median absolute deviations are 18.18 for geometric-mean and 18.58 for corrected geometric-mean estimator. The R script I used are here: #```{r stackexchange} #' Calculate the geomean to estimate the lognormal median. #' #' This function Calculate the geomean to estimate the lognormal #' median. #' #' @param x a vector. require(plyr) GM sumres.mad GM CG CGK SM #25.14202 22.91564 29.65724 31.49275 #> sumres.mse GM CG CGK SM #1368.209 1031.478 2051.540 2407.218 #```
