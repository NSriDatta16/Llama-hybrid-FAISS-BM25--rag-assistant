Recommendations for fitting a classifier on panel data to predict one step head forecasted class

I am predicting the binary class, i.e. if it's in top10 or not, of a security based upon it's performance using predictors from current time. So it's simply a cross sectional classifier. As of now I've used random forest and neural net for this purpose. Now I want to extend it so that I can one step ahead prediction of the class. Please suggest some starting point. I understand it might be open ended question. Thanks for reading. I know how to use time series, but I'm not sure how to go so for a classifier. Also all the predictors are numeric variables, none of them are categorical. I'm doing all in R, so it would be great if I get related pointers, not a strict constraint though.
