I prefer Python over R because Python is a complete programming language so I can do end to end machine learning tasks such as gather data using a HTTP server written in Python, perform advanced ML tasks and then publish the results online. This can all be done in Python. I actually found R to be harder to learn and the payoffs for learning Python are much greater because it can be used for pretty much any programming task.
