Use of pm.Potential in Pymc3 Survival example

I am working through the pymc3 Bayesian Survival Analysis example at the link below and I'm struggling to understand their use of pm.Potential : https://docs.pymc.io/en/stable/pymc-examples/examples/survival_analysis/bayes_param_survival_pymc3.html The heart of the example comes down to the following two snippets of code: y_obs = pm.Gumbel("y_obs", η[~cens_], s, observed=y_std[~cens]) y_cens = pm.Potential("y_cens", gumbel_sf(y_std[cens], η[cens_], s)) Basically what is being done is they are modeling observed survival as a Gumbel distribution and censoring as a Gumbel survival function. In general that sort of makes sense to me. I do think I understand how observed deaths and observed censoring mathematically relate to these distributions. I just don't understand what pm.Potential is doing. In fact, if I take it out it doesn't appear to affect anything. Is it there to just calculate y_cens ? If so, how do I access that value since I don't see it in the trace output. At this moment, I'm thinking the censored values are contributing nothing to this model and the fitted survival data is entirely based on a gumbel distribution fit of observed deaths. However, I also suspect, if I could figure out how to plot y_cens , it would also be able to give me a very similar estimate of survival trends. Can anyone educate me on the function of pm.Potential in the above example?
