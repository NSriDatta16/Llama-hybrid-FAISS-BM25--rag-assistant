I have had the exact same problem with my applications. I had used the same Subclassing technique to have the Master and Detail visible in both Portrait and Landscape modes. Worked great until 4.2 which, unfortunately I didn't test for when the Beta releases were available. I recommend trying the excellent MGSplitViewController ( http://mattgemmell.com/2010/07/31/mgsplitviewcontroller-for-ipad ). It is an open-source implementation of the UISplitViewController. It's only drawback is that it isn't quite as easy to use in Interface Builder, but it includes a sample project. Visually it is identical to UISplitViewController, but adds support for several extras such as dragging the split position at runtime. Just implement it exactly as your UISplitViewController but add the following line somewhere: [splitViewController setShowsMasterInPortrait:YES]; This is very similar to the Private API that Apple prohibits using with their version. //[splitViewController setHidesMasterViewInPortrait:NO]; // Naughty, Naughty, Not allowed by the Apple police
