In one dimension, this sounds like a job for beta regression (with or without variable dispersion). This is a regression model with beta-distributed dependent variable, naturally 0-1 constrained. An R package is betareg and a paper describing its use is here . For more than two proportions the usual extension of the Beta distribution leads to Dirichlet regression. An R package DirichletReg is available, described e.g. here . There are some reasons not to use logit links and multinomial logistic regression for true compositional data, mostly to do with what strong assumptions they imply for the variance. However, if your data are all actually normalised counts (abundances?), those assumptions may be correct and Peter's suggestion would probably be the way to go.
