Marginalisation is a fundamental part of Bayesian statistics. Optimisation can easily lead to over-fitting and integrating over parameters, rather than optimising them, is a good way of avoiding this problem. This is an excellent motivation for acquiring as good an understanding of integral calculus as you can manage (I wish mine were much better than it is!).
