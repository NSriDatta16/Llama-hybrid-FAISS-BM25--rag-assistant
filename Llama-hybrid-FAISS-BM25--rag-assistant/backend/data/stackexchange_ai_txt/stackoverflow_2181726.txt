There's a perfectly usable monthly "data dump" of Stack Overflow under Creative Commons license, see for example here (just the first one "under my thumb" of the many links about this -- at least one per month). For such analysis as my average weekly rep relative to some other poster's, such monthly dollops of data are much more usable than screen-scrapes. If you do want to screen-scrape some (other;-) site, and that doesn't violate their policies or their robots.txt files, Python is one of several excellent choices -- start with scrapy , and you won't have all that much extra work to do, for example.
