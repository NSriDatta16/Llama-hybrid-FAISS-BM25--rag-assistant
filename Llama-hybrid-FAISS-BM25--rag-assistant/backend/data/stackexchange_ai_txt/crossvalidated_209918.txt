Language models are often used to compute the probability of a sentence. This is done by using the chain rule. For example if we want to estimate the probability of observing the sentence $w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4$ we can factorize it like so... $P(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4) = P(w_4|w_3, w_2, w_1) P(w_3|w_2, w_1) P(w_2| w_1) P(w_1) $ Each of those terms is something that can be straightforwardly computed by the language model.
