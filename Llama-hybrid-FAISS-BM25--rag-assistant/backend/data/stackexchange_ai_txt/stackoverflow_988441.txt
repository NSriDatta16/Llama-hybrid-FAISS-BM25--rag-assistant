how to get unique elements?

1 asparagus 7190 2 almonds 7190 3 asparagus 7192 4 asparagus 7193 i would like to get the unique catlogs, so from this list i want to extract only 7190, 7192, and 7193. i have a script that puts it into a dropdownlist by using: DropDownList1.DataSource = dv DropDownList1.DataBind() but i need it to get only the unique values.
