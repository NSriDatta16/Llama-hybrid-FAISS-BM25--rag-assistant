Markov chain transition matrix and state vector order?

The typical way of performing state simulations using matrices is to perform the following kind of calculation: $$x_{(k+1)}=Ax_{(k)}$$ However, When the transition matrix $A$ is defined in the following way for example: $$ \begin{array}{r|lll} & \rlap{\text{next state}} \\ \text{current state} & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline 1 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\ 2 & 0.8 & 0 & 0.2 \\ 3 & 0.9 & 0 & 0.1 \\ \end{array} $$ Then doing the above iteration with e.g. initial $x_0=\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0 \\ \end{bmatrix}^T$, then $$Ax_{(k)}=\begin{bmatrix} 0.5&0.8&0.9 \\ \end{bmatrix}^T$$ which is not the right calculation. The right one should result in $$Ax_{(k)}=\begin{bmatrix} 0.5&0.5&0 \\ \end{bmatrix}^T$$ I.e. what should be calculated is actually $$x_{(k+1)}=\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0 \\ \end{bmatrix} A$$ What should I do in order to perform calculations in the form of $$x_{(k+1)}=Ax_{(k)}$$ Transpose $A$? But isn't this then an unconventional way of expressing the transition matrix? What I could also calculate is $$x_{(k+1)}=x_{(k)}A$$ as given here .
