Hiding your files from the Media Scanner Include an empty file named .nomedia in your external files directory (note the dot prefix in the filename). This will prevent Android's media scanner from reading your media files and including them in apps like Gallery or Music. In http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal You may also consider saving those files as cache files or in the internal memory. More info in that link.
