Get Handle on last worksheet copied by Worksheet.Copy

I'm trying to get a handle to the worksheet that was created by a copy operation. following code used to work: Dim wsTempl As Worksheet, pageCount as Long Set wsTempl = Sheets("Template") For pageCount = 1 To 5 wsTempl.Copy After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count) Set ws = Sheets(Sheets.Count) ws.Name = "p" & pageCount Next But stopped when adding VeryHidden worksheets to the workbook. now my Sheets(Sheets.Count) is getting the VeryHidden sheet instead of the sheet I added last. Of course I could use Set ws = Sheets(wsTempl.Name & " (2)") ws.Name = "p" & pageCount But that seems so ugly, is this really the only way? Can somebody think of another way? to replicate the issue: Open a New workbook, Name the first Sheet 'Template' & delete the other sheets alt-f11 - insert code module & paste the above code F5 should show you that it works. insert a worksheet, using the worksheet tabs drag it to the end of collection set it to VeryHidden in VBA IDE F5 again, the first code listing should fail Reason seems to be that the Copy After:= does not copy after VeryHidden Sheets, thus the part of the code to rename the sheet always renames the VeryHidden Sheet
