How do I interpret the regression coefficients when making comparisons between the change of slope between control and disease?

I have 15 genes and two groups (58 control and 51 disease). I have relative abundances of the genes at two time points (time point 1 and a few years later time point 2, the average age difference is 4.9 years (max 11, min is 1). I have basic line plots to visualise the change in the average expression at time point 1 and timepoint 2 for each group. I would like to compare the change in slope between the second and first time point comparing the two groups. I have subtracted the relative abundances at the first time point from the second for each group, for each gene (TP2-TP1). To make the comparison between the control and disease, I have then used a linear mixed effect model using the TP2-TP1 difference values and taking into consideration certain fixed and random effects. Below is my code; output4 Control is marked as 0, disease is 4. An effect size for gene 1 was -0.027 which was significant. Am I interpreting this correctly if the change in slope between the second and first decreased by this amount in iT2D relative to control? In other words, the negative value suggests that the difference between TP2-TP1 is less in iT2D. ( I calculated the difference with the average TP2-TP1 relative abundance manually for this gene for both groups and this is the case). The age difference coefficient for this is -0.0118. This suggests that for every unit increase in age difference you would expect this gene to decrease. A quick eye ball of the graph for this gene and in each group, the average gene expression of the line graph increases at the second time point, which confuses me. In addition, as I am making the comparisons between the two groups, from this value I donâ€™t believe I can determine the change in direction from TP2 to TP1, for instance, whether there is an increase or a decrease at TP2 compared to TP1 when just considering the disease group, without looking at the line graph? Lastly, in my complete data set I have three groups. Control, Disease 1 and Disease 2. Would a Repeated Measures ANOVA be useful to make the comparison between the change in slope between each group and also between the first and second-time point for each group? I am reading up about this now. I would appreciate any help please.
