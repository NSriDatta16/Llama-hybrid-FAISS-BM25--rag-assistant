Try adding more images , also make sure that your dataset is balanced ie, there arent too many images of a single kind , that would lead to your model overfitting for that particular class. I was facing a similar issue when I trained an emotion classifier , also try transfer learning based on well known CNN architectures such as the VGG16 or RESNET .
