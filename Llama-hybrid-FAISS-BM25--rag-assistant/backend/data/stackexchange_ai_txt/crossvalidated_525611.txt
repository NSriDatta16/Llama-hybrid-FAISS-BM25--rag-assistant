Assuming adding this variable does not introduce multicollinearity, the main thing you need to be concerned about is endogeneity. I encourage you to look at some of the literature on this problem. If in your model this is not a problem then you can add this predictor. Here are some links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(econometrics) http://www.sfu.ca/~pendakur/teaching/buec333/Multicollinearity%20and%20Endogeneity.pdf
