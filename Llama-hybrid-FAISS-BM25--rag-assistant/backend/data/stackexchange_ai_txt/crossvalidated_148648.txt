What goodness of fit tests, for logistic regression models, are available in R?

I'm planning to work on some credit risk models using logistic regresson in R. Binary response. What all goodness of fit tests are to be known and WHAT PACKAGES are required for the same? Thank you. I found some help in this post but it is not exhaustive: What is the difference in what AIC and c-statistic (AUC) actually measure for model fit?
