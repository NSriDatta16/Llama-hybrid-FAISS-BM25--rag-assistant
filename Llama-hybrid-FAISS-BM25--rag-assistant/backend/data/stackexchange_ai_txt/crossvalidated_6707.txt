A "systematic" part of a random time series component?

I've seen at least 3 sources on time series* state that the component of a series that is variously called random, stochastic, or noise (something clearly separate from any deterministic, patterned component) itself consists of 2 parts, a systematic part and an unsystematic part. I can't for the life of me figure out how the random part can in turn have a systematic part. I can see how the series can have unsystematic and systematic parts, but not how the random component of the series could have both of these. *For example, Burns and Grove, The Practice of Nursing Research (2005, p. 475-6).
