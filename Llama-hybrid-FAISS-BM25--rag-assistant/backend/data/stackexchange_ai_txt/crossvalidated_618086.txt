General remarks The truncated normal model (just like the censored normal model) does not belong to the GLM (generalized linear model) family in the classical sense (a la McCullagh & Nelder, 1989, doi:10.1201/9780203753736 ). In GLMs the dispersion parameter (usually denoted $\phi$ ) can be treated as a nuisance parameter and the regression coefficients $\beta$ that affect the expectation $\mu$ via $g(\mu) = x^\top \beta$ can be estimated without the dispersion. So the truncated normal model is similar in spirit but also different because $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not orthogonal and have to be estimated simultaneously. Misspecification of one parameter will lead to inconsistent estimation of the other. That's why for these models not only $\mu$ is often specified as a function of regressors but also $\sigma$ , often in the framework of GAMLSS (generalized additive models of location, scale, and shape). Answers No, the model does not belong to the GLM family. The expectation is $\mathrm{E}(y | x) = \mu + \sigma \cdot \frac{\phi(\mu/\sigma)}{\Phi(\mu/\sigma)}$ where $\phi(\cdot)$ and $\Phi(\cdot)$ are the probability density and cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, respectively. This intrinsically depends on both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ . The model is commonly used in various contexts but it is not a GLM. In econometrics it is often used as one component of the two-part Cragg model, consisting of a binary "hurdle" for 0 vs. greater than 0 and a zero-truncated model. My lecture notes on this might be a useful starting point. The assumption that the mean is approximately linear really only makes sense if the observations are far enough from the truncation point $0$ . But the closer the observations get towards $0$ , the more effect the truncation will have. This means that the marginal effects will go from $\beta$ when you are far away to virtually $0$ when you are close to the truncation point. The figure below (from my notes linked above) shows the relationship between the untruncated mean $\mu$ (dotted) and the truncated mean $\mu + \phi(\mu)/\Phi(\mu)$ (solid, assuming $\sigma = 1$ ). For $\mu$ greater than two standard deviations the truncation has almost no effect, but for $\mu$ around $0$ or below the slope is almost zero. I'm not sure what exactly you mean by this. I would say that we assume a response distribution that fits our observations and then link the parameters of that distribution to the available regressors. And for some distributional families (GLM) it turns out that you can separate effects on the location and the scale nicely (like in the linear regression model). Software For fitting truncated regression models where also the scale parameter can be modeled by regressors, there are various packages available in R: Our crch package for classical parametric maximum likelihood estimation, see doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-012 . The general gamlss package for additive modeling in combination with gamlss.tr for truncated distributions. See also doi:10.18637/jss.v023.i07 . The bamlss for Bayesian estimation of GAMLSS models, supporting the gamlss families. See doi:10.18637/jss.v100.i04 . Of course, there are other packages as well, including general model estimation frameworks, notably brms for Bayesian regression models.
