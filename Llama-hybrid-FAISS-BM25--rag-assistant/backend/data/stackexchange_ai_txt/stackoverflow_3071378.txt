Behavior IS-WHAT-IT-IS. Eric calls a Repository like utility from a Brokerage Account entity called, "QueryService". He mentions that it's not a good design for a real project. So what do you do? public class Clerk { public Clerk() { } //Store Report in Database public void File(Report); { ReportRepository.Add(Report); } } You could do that, but it's probably best to tell the Clerk which Repository to use. public class Clerk { private IReportRepository _reportRepository; public Clerk(IReportRepository ReportRepository) { this._reportRepository = ReportRepository } //Store Report in Database public void File(Report); { this._reportRepository.Add(Report); } }
