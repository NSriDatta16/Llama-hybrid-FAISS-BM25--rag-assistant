What needs to be explicity bundled

When bundling an object for later retrieval do I have to bundle objects within those objects? For example, if I have an object that represents a player in a card game and within that I instantiate an object that represents the player's hand, do I have save the inner object to the bundle or is that automatically included with the outer one?
