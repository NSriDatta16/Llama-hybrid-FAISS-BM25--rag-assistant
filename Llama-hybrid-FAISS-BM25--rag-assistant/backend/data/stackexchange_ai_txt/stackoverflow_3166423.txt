I've had the same issue and I think it is better to go via the route of using the session namespace functionality: $oSession = new Zend_Session_Namespace('myStorage'); $oSession->foo = "bar"; $oSession->baz = 123; And you can recover the data by: $oSession = new Zend_Session_Namespace('myStorage'); $this->view->foo = $oSession->foo; There are some more clues here: Zend_Auth the main message of which is that the storage of Zend_Auth data is actually just a namespace. The default access to this would be similar to : $oSession = new Zend_Session_Namespace('Zend_Auth') ;
