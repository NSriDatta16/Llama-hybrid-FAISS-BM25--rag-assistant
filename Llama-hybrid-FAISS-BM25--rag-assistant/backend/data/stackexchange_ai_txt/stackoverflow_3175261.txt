Possible, but questionable approach: In order to extract only the last names, you'd need to implement a custom token for taxonomy terms that will do the necessary string manipulation. (You'd want to create a variation of the default [cat] token. This example for a custom node title token might also help to understand the process.) However, this approach has some serious downsides: How to decide what's the last name from code? (e.g. Jan van Eyck or Pieter Brueghel the Younger ) What about identical last names? (e.g. Jan van Eyck vs. Hubert van Eyck ) What about chaotic mixtures of the above? (e.g. the whole Brueghel family ;-) Recommended alternative approach: To avoid dealing with the above ambiguity problems, and given that the site you want to replace has a pretty small set of target names so far, I'd just use the standard [cat] token, using the full names for the URLs (Pathauto allows you to specify default replacements for special characters, e.g. spaces to underscores or dashes). Then you can add redirect rules for all the old, 'last name only' URLs to the sites .htaccess files to keep them functional while promoting the new versions: # http://example.com/picasso => http://example.com/pablo_picasso RewriteRule ^picasso $ http://example.com/pablo_picasso [L,R=301] # ... and so on for all old urls that changed (You might also check the Path redirect module as a 'Drupal internal' alternative to the .htaccess manipulation). Additionally, I would recommend splitting the 'Catalog' hierarchy in two separate vocabularies, e.g. 'artists' and 'medium'. While this would result in two separate taxonomy fields on the node entry form, it fits the semantic difference and would give more flexibility for filtering, sorting and grouping the nodes down the road.
