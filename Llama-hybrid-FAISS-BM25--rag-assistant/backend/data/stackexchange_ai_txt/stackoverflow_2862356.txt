MySQL, join one item to multiple items in a single query

Say I've got two tables. One contains a list of items, and one contains pictures of the items. Something like this: Items +----+---------+ | id | name | +----+---------+ | 1 | oranges | | 2 | apples | +----+---------+ Pictures +----+---------+ | id | item_id | +----+---------+ | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | | 3 | 2 | +----+---------+ My question is this: is it possible in a single query to select item 2 from Items and join all the rows in the Pictures table whose item_id references that same id? I am sure I've tried almost everything I can think of, but nothing is coming to mind. I apologize if the answer to this is simple, but It's just escaping me right now. EDIT @Andomar , that works, but it doesn't exactly give me the results I wanted. I guess I should be more clear and ask is it possible to get results that resemble something like this (it's a php array, but the organization is what I'm after): $results = array( [0] => array( 'id' => 1, 'name' => 'oranges', 'images' => array( [0] => ..., ), ), [1] => array( 'id' => 2, 'name' => 'apples', 'images' => array( [0] => ..., [1] => ..., ), ), );
