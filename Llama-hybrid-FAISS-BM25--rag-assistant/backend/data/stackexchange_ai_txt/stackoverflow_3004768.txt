Keep it simple: $("a.subpage").click(function() { $(this).next().toggle(); return false; }); this in an event handler is the source of the event, being the link. Edit: the issue of whether or not next() is appropriate. Of course if the markup is different you use a different chain. There are many ways of achieving the same result, for example: $(this).siblings("ul").toggle(); But what if the link is inside a paragraph? $(this).closest("li").children("ul").toggle(); But what if the list isn't a direct child? Etc etc etc. All of these are reasonable approaches but keep it simple: Write your jQuery code to suit your markup rather than trying to cater for things that don't happen and probably never will.
