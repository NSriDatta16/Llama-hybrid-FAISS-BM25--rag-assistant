It appears the original data are survival times in days, and the author of the example preferred to plot the data in months for simplicity. Because there are approximately 30.5 days in a month (on average), they divided to get a rough number of months. Here are the two plots: matplot(cbind(ptime$fit, ptime$fit + 2*ptime$se.fit, ptime$fit - 2*ptime$se.fit)/30.5, 1-pct, main="With scaling by 30.5", xlab="Months", ylab="Survival", type='l', lty=c(1,2,2), col=1) matplot(cbind(ptime$fit, ptime$fit + 2*ptime$se.fit, ptime$fit - 2*ptime$se.fit), 1-pct, main="Without scaling by 30.5", xlab="Months (actually days)", ylab="Survival", type='l', lty=c(1,2,2), col=1)
