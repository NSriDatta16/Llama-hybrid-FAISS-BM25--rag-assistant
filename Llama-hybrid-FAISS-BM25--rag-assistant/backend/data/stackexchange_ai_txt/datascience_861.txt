Data Science has many different sub-areas as described in my post ). Nearly for each area, scientists and developer has significant contributions. To learn more about what can be done, please look at following websites: Data Mining Algorithms & Machine Learning -> Apache Mahout Statistics -> RHadoop Data Warehousing & Database Querying -> SQL-MapReduce Social Network Analysis -> Article Bio-informatics -> Article - 1 , Article - 2 Also, there are some work on MapReduce + Excel + Cloud combination but I have not found the link. What are the different classes of Data Science problems ... Each "classes" is not purely homogeneous problem domain, i.e. some problem cannot be solved via map and reduce approach due to its communication cost, or algorithm behavior. What I mean by behavior is that some problem wants to have control on all data sets instead of chunks. Thus, I refuse to list type of problem "classes". Do not forget that knowing what MapReduce can do is not enough for Data Science. You should also aware of What MapReduce can't do , too.
