Anomaly detection on text data using one Class SVM

I am working on an Anomaly detection problem that is first of its kind for me. I am able to do data cleansing and train the model however I have no idea on predicting results, as it is new for me and I am running out of time. My notebook and data is available on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeet7/webgateway Any help will be deeply appreciated.
