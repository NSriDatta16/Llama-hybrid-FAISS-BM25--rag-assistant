If you're deciding between two ways of analysing your data, try it both ways and see if it makes a difference. This is useful in many contexts: To transform or not transform Non-parametric or parameteric test Spearman's or Pearson's correlation PCA or factor analysis Whether to use the arithmetic mean or a robust estimate of the mean Whether to include a covariate or not Whether to use list-wise deletion, pair-wise deletion, imputation, or some other method of missing values replacement This shouldn't absolve one from thinking through the issue, but it at least gives a sense of the degree to which substantive findings are robust to the choice.
