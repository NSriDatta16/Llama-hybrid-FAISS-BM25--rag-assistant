I think you may create two divs, one inside another. The outer one should have the following CSS property: overflow : hidden . And it should also have a defined size. The inner one should have position : relative with left and top properties set to 0. Then, you can change the inner one's top property by using Javascript. It's only an idea, I haven't tested it, but it may help you. var currentY=0; var height; function scrollUp () { height=document.getElementById("innerdiv").offsetHeight; if (currentY 0-height) currentY--; document.getElementById("innerdiv").style.height=currentY+"px"; } For this code, you can have two buttons, with scrollUp and scrollDown functions assigned to them. Implementing a dragable scrollbar would be hard. I hope I helped you at least a bit. Maybe there exists a smarter solution than mine, that I don't even know about? Try to look for it. I don't give any warranty for this code to work, maybe there are typos and other mistakes in it. It is just a shape of my idea. EDIT: don't use this code. It is long and complicated.
