It didn't happen in this example, but you have to watch that the loess model doesn't get carried away and produce 'smoothed' probabilities that lie outside of (0,1). Following the example from Brett lprob As a newbie working through Hosmer and Lemeshow, I found it interesting to plot the loess fit (as a probability) against age -- you get a good idea how it is forming a 'weighted average' between the unsmoothed 0's and 1's as age increases. By the way to get pretty close to the graph H+L made, try lfit
