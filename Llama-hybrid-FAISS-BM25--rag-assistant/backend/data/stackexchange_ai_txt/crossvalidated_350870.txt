There are two ways to do approach this: You can aggregate the time series in a more specific way. When you aggregate you don't aggregate up to [product family], but to a combined [product family/client cluster] grouping. You can keep your current hierarchical structure and pass the client cluster as an exogenous feature to your forecasting algorithm. Most forecasting algorithms accept exogenous features along with historical data. In response to the comment: The basic input to time series algorithms is the historical values of the time series. Many time series algorithms can also take in additional explanatory variables (called exogenous variables). You can add your client cluster variable as an input to your model. See here for an example of how that works with ARIMA models.
