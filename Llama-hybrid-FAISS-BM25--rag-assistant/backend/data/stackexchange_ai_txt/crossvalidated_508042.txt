Regression coefficient greater than 1: is it possible?

I was reading an article about the polar motion of the Earth: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241368199_The_Earth's_variable_Chandler_wobble . A regression is performed between observed and modelled complex time series of data - the type of regression is not specified. The regression coefficient is then calculated for different values of the estimated parameter (quality factor); its amplitude and phase are shown in Figure 2 (I don't know if I am allowed to post it directly here). My question is why can the amplitude of the regression coefficient be as high as 2.3? I thought that the absolute value of the regression coefficient, for real series, had to be in the range 0-1. Therefore I was expecting a maximum amplitude of $\sqrt{2}$ for a complex series. The definition of regression coefficient is not mentioned in the article. At first I thought it may be a linear regression since if the model is correct, the modelled and observed series should be very close; however, this seems incompatible with a value of 2.3. Is there a more general definition that I'm missing?
