I am actually doing this right now too! :) I have 3 model classes, logistic, random forest and GP. My design is this (with 5-fold crossvalidation): training data set - optimize parameters and hyperparameters (not sure if we have the same definition of hyperparameters; in my case these are the length-scales for GP covariance matrix). validation data set - cross-validate models and compare them within & between classes using common test statistics I suppose this should be perfectly OK, if you have any ideas why this could be a problem let us discuss it.
