Declaring variables volatile generally has a huge impact on performance. On traditional single-threaded systems, it was relativly easy to know what needed to be volatile; it was those things that accessed hardware. On multi-threaded it can be a little more complex, but I would generally encourage using notifications and event queues to handle passing data between theads in leau of magic variables. In Java it may not matter much; in C/C++ you would get into trouble when those variables cannot be set atomically by the underlying hardware.
