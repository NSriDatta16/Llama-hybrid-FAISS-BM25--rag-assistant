There is no way you can decide whether a given RMSE (or other forecast accuracy measure) is high or low as such . You will need to compare this RMSE to the forecast accuracy that is reasonably achievable for a given time series. This has been called "forecastability" , and Sean Schubert has written a series of articles on the concept for Foresight , the practitioner-oriented publication of the International Institute of Forecasters . I'd recommend that you look at these papers (full disclosure: I am an Associate Editor of Foresight ).
