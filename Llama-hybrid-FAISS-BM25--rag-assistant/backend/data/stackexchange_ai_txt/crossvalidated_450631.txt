What's wrong with my binomial logistic regression model please? (SPSS)

I am running a binary logistic regression in SPSS (standard, no stepwise) containing 20 predictors (binary and continuous) and have the following problems: 1) it correctly classifies ~the same % as the null model (87.2% null vs 87.1% full model) 2) Sensitivity was 6.8%!!! Specificity was 98.9%, positive predictive value was 47.6% and negative predictive value was 87.8%. The sample size is just over N=9,000. There were 427 standardized residual with values over 2.5 standard deviations, which were retained in the analysis. The logistic regression model was statistically significant, Ï‡2(22) = 906.74, p I have run a Pearson's correlation matrix and not detected anything strange (all values below r=0.7). I tried removing some of the variables to see whether I could improve the model but it remained the same. Any advice on what the problem might be/what I should do next would be great. I'm a newbie to stats so apologies if I have missed anything obvious!
