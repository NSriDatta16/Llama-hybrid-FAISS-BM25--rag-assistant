How do I populate my VS2008 Data Sources window with a LINQ query table?

I´m (professionally) creating a SQL Server database client by using Visual Studio 2008, C# -> Windows Form(s). And I´m using all the built in stuff, provided by my friend VS Studio, dragging and dropping, creating SQL query tables in DataSet.xsd, and so on... I like that. But! I would like to try out LINQ, as I would like to have something that to me is more intuitive than pure SQL... And (here comes the newbie-problem to be solved)! I don´t know where to put the LINQ code to make a table "pop up" in the Data Sources window - meaning I´m completely stuck! How should I do it?
