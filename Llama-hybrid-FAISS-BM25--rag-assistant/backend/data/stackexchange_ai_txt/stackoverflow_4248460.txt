@Oded, @khachik, Try checking his desired output for well-formedness . It is indeed well-formed XML. ("Valid" is not even a question here, as there is no schema.) It is a common misconception that ">" is not legal in well-formed XML. In most contexts, " " is legal everywhere with one rare exception. The relevant paragraph of the spec: The ampersand character (&) and the left angle bracket ( right angle bracket (>) may be represented using the string " &gt; ", and MUST, for compatibility, be escaped using either " &gt; " or a character reference when it appears in the string " ]]> " in content, when that string is not marking the end of a CDATA section. With XSLT 2.0, the "right" way to do what you want is to use . With XSLT 1.0, I think the only way to force the use of ">" in the output is to use disable-output-escaping , as @khachik suggested. Note however that XSLT processors are not required to honor DOE or character maps , and some can't (e.g. if they're in a pipeline and are not connected to serialization). But you probably know by now whether yours can, and if it can't, you'll need to handle serialization issues at the end of the pipeline. However, it is worth asking, why do you want the ">" serialized as ">"? As seen in the spec, &gt; is a perfectly acceptable way to express exactly the same information as far as XML is concerned. No downstream XML consumer should know the difference or care. Do you want it for aesthetic reasons? Update: the OP wants that because the output needs to be not only well-formed XML, it also needs to be well-formed Literate Haskell.
