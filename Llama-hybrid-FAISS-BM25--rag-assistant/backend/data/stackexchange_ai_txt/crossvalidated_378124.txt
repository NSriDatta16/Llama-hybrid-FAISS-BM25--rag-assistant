The answer given by @Sycorax is correct. However, it is worth mentioning that using (binary) cross-entropy in a regression task where the output values are in the range [0,1] is a valid and reasonable thing to do. Actually, it is used in image autoencoders (e.g. here and this paper ). You might be interested to see a simple mathematical proof of why it works in this case in this answer .
