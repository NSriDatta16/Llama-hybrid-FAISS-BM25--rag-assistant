How to include only true positives and false positives, that is ignore false negative classifications in a confusion matrix?

I have performed a 10 fold cross validation on my data set using binary decision trees . I've got 6 trees (to detect one of the six basic human emotions from facial data points) trained for each fold. I used these trees to classify my test set in each fold. I was asked to provide average cross validation results that includes a single 6x6 confusion matrix including only the true positives and the false positives, that is, ignoring false negative classifications and then from this matrix calculate average recall, precision rates and F1-measure (I don't have a problem doing this). I've tried to "manually" create a confusion matrix not including any false positives, however I always get the exact same confusion matrix returned by the built-in MATLAB confusionmat function. Can anyone please put me in the right direction?
