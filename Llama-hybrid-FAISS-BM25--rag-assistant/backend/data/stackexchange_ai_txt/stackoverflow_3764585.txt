WordML templating with XML Schema and OpenXML SDK

I'm trying to use a docx read in via the OpenXML SDK as template in a .Net web app for form letters (essentially). I have a docx with the formatting I want, marked up with XML Schema tags defined from a xsd (whatever they're called, the help is exceedingly useless on this). The only thing similar I found on Google was what seemed to be replacing the CustomXmlBlock elements with text elements with the desired data. This seems... messy and fragile. I also have the added complication that some of the data is hierarchical, with elements for sections, and then items in that section. This would seem to completely break the above method. So, can someone point me in the right direction for doing this, or suggest a better way to handle templating form letters?
