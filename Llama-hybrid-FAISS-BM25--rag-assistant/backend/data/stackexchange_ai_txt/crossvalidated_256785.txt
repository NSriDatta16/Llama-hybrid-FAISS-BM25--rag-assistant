The MASE compares "your" forecast against a naive benchmark forecast calculated in-sample. The original paper by Hyndman & Kohler (2006) chose the one-step ahead random walk forecast as this benchmark, but this is not set in stone. For instance, if you have an obviously seasonal time series, then the random walk makes little sense as a benchmark, and it would be better to use a seasonal naive forecast (i.e., the value from one season back), like Hyndman does in this paper mentioned in this earlier CV question about the MASE . Rob Hyndman doesn't write so explicitly in his online textbook , but he has repeatedly made this point in discussions about the MASE. In your case, I'd use a naive 20-step-ahead forecast as the benchmark, i.e., your $hMASE$. Just make it clear in your writeup what the benchmark is that you are comparing "your" forecast against.
