I'm using the ManagedFusion Url Rewriter and a custom 404 error page on my blog . The ManagedFusion Url Rewriter requires a file called ManagedFusion.Rewriter.rules that mimics .htaccess, I had to play around with it quite a bit to get it right so I'll include what I currently have in mine: # Managed Fusion Url Rewriter # http://managedfusion.com/products/url-rewriter/ # # Developed by: Nick Berardi # Support: support@managedfusion.com # RewriteEngine on # # Place Rules Below # # misc WordPress rewrites RewriteRule ^/wp-login\.php$ /wp-login.php [L] RewriteRule ^/wp-comments-post\.php$ /wp-comments-post.php [L] RewriteRule ^/wp-admin/(.*)$ /wp-admin/$1 [L] # deny access to evil robots site rippers offline browsers and other nasty scum RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Anarchie [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^ASPSeek [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^attach [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^autoemailspider [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Xaldon\ WebSpider [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Xenu [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Zeus.*Webster [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Zeus RewriteRule ^.* - [F,L] # remove www RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.robboek\.com$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://robboek.com$1 [R=301] # redirect old urls RewriteRule ^/2008/12/blog-on-hold.html$ /2008/12/12/blog-on-hold/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/2008/11/google-chrome-wont-start-in-vista-x64\.html$ /2008/11/16/google-chrome-wont-start-in-vista-x64/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/2008/11/pass-community-summit-2008-events.html$ /2008/11/14/pass-community-summit-2008-events-calendar/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/2008/11/fort-stevens-camping-trip.html$ /2008/11/14/fort-stevens-camping-trip/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/2008/10/first-post.html$ /2008/10/10/first-post/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/blog/CommentView,guid,1d8cba50-0814-4c89-86df-eca669973e8e.aspx$ /2006/09/29/junctions-in-windows-vista/ [R=301] RewriteRule ^/blog/2006/09/29/JunctionsInWindowsVista.aspx$ /2006/09/29/junctions-in-windows-vista/ [R=301] # rewrite all nonexistent files and directories to use index.php for WordPress RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php$1 The rules handle the pretty urls, remove the www, and redirect several old urls from a previous blog. I also have a file "404.php" that I have setup as my custom 404 error page. This is not needed for the pretty urls, but will allow you to use the wordpress 404 page in custom themes. Here are the contents: I hope that helps. It has been working very well for me so far. -Rob Update: I just posted a blog article on my experience using WordPress on IIS7
