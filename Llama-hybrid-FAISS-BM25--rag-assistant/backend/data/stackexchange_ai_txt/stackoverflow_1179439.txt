Best way to generate order numbers for an online store?

Every order in my online store has a user-facing order number. I'm wondering the best way to generate them. Criteria include: Short Easy to say over the phone (e.g., "m" and "n" are ambiguous) Unique Checksum (overkill? Useful?) Edit: Doesn't reveal how many total orders there have been (a customer might find it unnerving to make your 3rd order) Right now I'm using the following method (no checksum): def generate_number possible_values = 'abfhijlqrstuxy'.upcase.split('') | '123456789'.split('') record = true while record random = Array.new(5){possible_values[rand(possible_values.size)]}.join record = Order.find(:first, :conditions => ["number = ?", random]) end self.number = random end
