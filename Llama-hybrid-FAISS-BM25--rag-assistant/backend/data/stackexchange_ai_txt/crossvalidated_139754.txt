Which distribution to use for a probability problem?

In a food processing plant, on average, 2 packaging machines breakdown per week. I let x be the number of processing machine breakdowns in a week. So x is Poisson(2), but one part of the question says: in a random sample of 26 machines what is the probability of no machine breakdowns in at least one of them in a week. I know, mean = 2 and solve 2=26*p to get p=1/13. Then I say x is Binomial(26, 1/13). But now I do not know where to go from there. Any suggestions please? I am not interested in the final answer, I just need to be pointed on the right track from where I am.
