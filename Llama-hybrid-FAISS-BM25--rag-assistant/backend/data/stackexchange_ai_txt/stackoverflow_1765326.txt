Creating 64 bit CLR C++ projects in VS2008

I am creating a wrapper around a native lib, which comes in both 32 & 64 bit flavors. I have a fairly complex C++/CLR project that includes a number of header files from the native libs. I got it to work fine on x32, but now I'm not sure how to provide an alternative x64 build. Can someone outline the steps to create such project? Various defines depend on _WIN32 / _WIN64, so must be multiple projects? Both x32/x64 native libs have identical file names. Currently the lib ref is done with #pragma comment (lib, "xxxxxx.lib") . How should this be changed? Lastly - VS2008 has only Win32 platform listed, not Win64 (I do have x64 VS2008 component installed). Thanks!
