Ideally, the monitors will have the same RGB pattern. Some monitors (e.g., Viewsonic 201b) have a "BGR" layout of the pixels on screen. If you are using Windows with ClearType font rendering, it is important to have all monitors with the same pixel pattern -- otherwise the ClearType both looks funny, and causes a slowdown as you drag a window from one screen to the other. I realize you might not use Windows, as you stated, but thought I would through this out to you. There could someday be similar issues with non-Windows OS. Also, I'm not sure if it matters for OSX at present, it might.
