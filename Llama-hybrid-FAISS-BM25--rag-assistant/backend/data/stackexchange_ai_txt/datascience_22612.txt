TensorFlow is a general purpose library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It is primarily used for neural networks but can be used for any mathematical operations on multidimensional data arrays (tensors). Thus, TensorFlow can be used to estimate binary logistic regression with explanatory categorical variables. An example can be found in the TensorFlow tutorials here .
