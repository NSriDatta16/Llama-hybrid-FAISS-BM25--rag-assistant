I'm not from the US so the W-2 and 1099 part is beyond me but I'll address the rest as those issues are pretty universal. Generally speaking, a rule of thumb is that if you earn $100k per year you should be charging $100/hour or pretty close to it. This is to cover some or all of: No personal/sick leave; No paid annual leave; No bonuses; No training; Insurances (health, public liability, professional indemnity, etc); If you are not contracted to a certain number of hours per week, there is variability in income; The employer can get rid you much more easily than a full-time employee. Now this is my experience in Australia and Europe where you actually have quite significant public health care. I might imagine that since you don't in the US, the health insurance costs might drive this even higher so perhaps you should be asking for $120+/hour. Note: if you're not paying things like professional indemnity insurance or you don't have some sort of legal protection (like operating through a limited liability company) you are playing with fire and I strongly urge you to seek professional advice on setting up a structure and/or obtaining relevant insurances to adequately protect you, your assets and your family if you have one. Of course you have to balance this all out against the current market conditions, which aren't all that great (but vary from locale to locale). I like the hourly rate scenario because it's "fair". By that I mean if you work 80 hours one week to get something out then you get paid for it. You just get paid for what you do and that's it. It's simple. Now employers often don't like it because they can't necessarily predict (and thus budget) the costs. The next step is to get paid a daily rate. I typically try and resist this but I will go for it in certain situations. If so, you need to define exactly what a day is. If you work at all do you get paid for a half day? A full day? Do you need to work a certain number of hours to get paid for the day? Do you only ever get paid for a full day no matter how many hours you work in that day? Can you get paid for more than 5 days a week? Generally for this sort of situation I'll mutliply my hourly rate by 9 basing it on an 8 hour day. You're taking on some of the risk so you need to get paid for that. Beyond that you can go to weekly and then monthly. They too have the issue of having to define what constitutes a week or month. There are on average 20 or 21 working days a month so multiply your daily rate by 21-25 to get a monthly rate. As for a negotiation strategy, pretty much use the points listed above. If $120/hour sounds like a lot (to them) point out all the costs involved, which are also costs they're saving. Use your proven track record to your advantage because I can guarantee you that there are few things more catastrophic to a company than incompetent software development.
