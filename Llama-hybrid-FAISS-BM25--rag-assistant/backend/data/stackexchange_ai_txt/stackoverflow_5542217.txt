How can I provide a telnet interface to my Java application?

I want to provide a telnet interface to my Java application, primarily so that developers can interact with the app, view debugging information, etc - before we've implemented our full end-user facing GUI. Can anyone recommend an easy and effective way to do this? I've looked at embedding the scala interpreter, but it doesn't seem to be accessible via telnet. Ditto for Beanshell (which I'm not too keen on anyway as I believe its unmaintained).
