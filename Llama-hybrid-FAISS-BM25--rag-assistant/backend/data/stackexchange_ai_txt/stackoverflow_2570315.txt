blackberry deployment and release process

So I'm building a blackberry app and was wondering if there is any good documentation on deployment/release best practices? Blackberry's "A70 â€“ How to Deploy and Distribute Applications" document is kind of lacking. I guess I'm looking for answers for the following question (Specifically for Over-The-Air aka OTA): I'm building an app for OS 4.5 and up. Do I need to compile a separate COD/JAD for each version? (i.e. 4.5, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.7, and 5.0) How do I detect OS version from the user-agent? What's the best way to compile COD/JAD files? anything else that might be good to know :) Thanks in advance!
