Assuming that you are essentially embedding the contents of a remote form in a frame/iframe, the you should be able to use some javascript to set values for the fields - field.value = "xxxx". That solution of course depends on the form remaining the same - any changes to the remote form will require you to update your script. If you are "handing off" to a remote site (redirect) that post's back to your site when payment is complete, then unless the remote site offers an API / a way of passing request parameters through, then you are going to be out of luck,
