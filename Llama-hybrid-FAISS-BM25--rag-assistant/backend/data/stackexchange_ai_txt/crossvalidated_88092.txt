I have elaborated an example (below) of how to do this manually. You could technically do something similar using prcomp by setting your tolerances high enough to retain only the dominant PCs. In the example, the projection uses only a subset of principal components loadings defined by the keep vector. The suggestion of @cbeleites is an important one, but for prediction of PCs it's important that the centering and scaling values come from the original data set - not the new data set. This is because you are projecting your data onto the weightings provided by your original PCA.
