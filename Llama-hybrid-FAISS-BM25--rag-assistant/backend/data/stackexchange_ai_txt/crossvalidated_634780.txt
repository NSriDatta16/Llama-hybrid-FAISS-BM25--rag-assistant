How to use RFE for RF and SVM

Considering I have a big data (lots of OTUs and clinical), which I will be using to input into RF and SVM for prediction (classification), will it make sense to perform RFE as a feature selection step? What method for RFE should I apply for RF and SVM? Since I believe that RF and SVM can be used as methods for RFE but would applying RF-RFE to RF (and the same for SVM) be redundant? I am unsure how exactly to perform RFE for RF/SVM (i.e., workflow).
