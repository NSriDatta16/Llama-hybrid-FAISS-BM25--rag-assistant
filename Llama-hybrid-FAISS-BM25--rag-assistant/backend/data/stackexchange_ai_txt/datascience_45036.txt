What does the below phrase in the lstm blog mean? - Data Science

I am a newbie to data science. I was reading this blog When I was half way through, I came into this sentence Further, each series of data has been partitioned into overlapping windows of 2.56 seconds of data, or 128 time steps. These windows of data correspond to the windows of engineered features (rows) in the previous section. What does 'series' means here and what is window partitioning? Further I would like to ask all the data science enthusiasts there,What do I lack here.Is it comprehension or logical skills needed .What can I do to improve upon this.I encounter such doubts often and what I do is search for the terms I dont understand or leave it and get ahead.When I search for the terms I get broad answers leaving me more confused.If i leave it like that I dont understand the rest.What should I do here?I cant post every small doubts in stack exchange. It would be great If you could share some light on this as well.
