Time estimate for ABAP development

I'm looking for a table or list of standard time estimations for developments in ABAP, something customizable in some variables according to the development team, complexity of project, etc... Something similar to: Simple Module Pool -> 10 hours Complex Module Pool -> 30 hours Definition of Dictionary -> (0,4 * number_of_tables * average_fields ) hours ALV Report -> (2 * number_of_parameters) hours I've searched but haven't found anything yet. I found AboveSoft Adaptive Estimator, what looks like a software tool to do what I need, but I prefer something... manual, an official or standard table. Do you know anything like that? Thank you in advance. Updated, as requested in comments by Rob S., to provide more information for future similar questions: What I'm looking for is a bunch of formulas, any metric system that can be applicable to (or even created for) time estimations on SAP development. I'm looking for a technic/tool/method to estimate SAP work, duration, cost, something similar to COCOMO II, FP, ESTIMACS or SLIM for SAP development.
