Another way of thinking about this, which might lend itself to an adaptation for $\ell_1$ is that choice of the mean comes from the fact that the mean is the point that minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances. If you're using $\ell_1$ to measure the distance between time series, then you should be using a center that minimizes the sum of squared $\ell_1$ distances.
