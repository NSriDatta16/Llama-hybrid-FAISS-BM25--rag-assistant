I think your problem is probably well-described as a Poisson process. You can describe the Poisson process in two ways: based on the number of events that occur in a certain time interval, or alternatively using waiting times $\Delta t$ between events. If car accidents are following Poissonian statistics, and they probably are, then it doesn't matter when you start your clock, i.e. when the police arrive. However, if the presence of the police officer has an effect on the occurrence of accidents, then what you estimate won't be just the accidents per day, but the accidents per day given that a police officer is present (and these two probably differ). The distribution of waiting times between events for a Poisson process is $P(\Delta t) = \nu \exp(-\nu\Delta t)$ , where $\nu$ is the frequency of accidents, i.e. the average number of accidents per unit of time. If you want to give the average number in a day, just multiply by the corresponding factor. As I said, if the process is Poissonian it doesn't matter when you start your clock, the interval you measure will follow that distribution. Also, it doesn't matter if you observe just one accident and quit. If the value of $\nu$ is the same for every day (warning, it might not!) then you can pool $\Delta t$ from different days together. You could gather your waiting times and make a histogram, and check whether they follow an exponential distribution or not. If they do, you can get the frequency just as $\nu = 1/\langle \Delta t \rangle$ . The assumptions underlying the Poisson process are (just copied from Wikipedia): The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability that a second event will occur. That is, events occur independently. The average rate at which events occur is independent of any occurrences. For simplicity, this is usually assumed to be constant, but may in practice vary with time. Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval exactly one event either occurs or does not occur. It seems to me that your problem fulfills these conditions reasonably. Actually, the fact that you don't measure continuously in the same place helps fulfill these conditions, because if an accident occurred in a certain place in a certain time, then shortly after this accident it will be less likely that a new one occurs since some sort of signalization or whatever might be present. But if you stop the observation after the accident, you will probably get observations that better fulfill the conditions of independence between events. Regarding your bonus question: this can be described by a zero-inflated Poisson process. In a Poisson process, it could occur that in a certain time interval you don't make any observation. A zero-inflated Poisson process includes another source of zero observations, which are due not just by chance but by another process that leads to no observations. You can see it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-inflated_model#Zero-inflated_Poisson , and the reference therein. In this case, the expression for the frequency based on the observation of waiting times might not be easy to get analitically.
