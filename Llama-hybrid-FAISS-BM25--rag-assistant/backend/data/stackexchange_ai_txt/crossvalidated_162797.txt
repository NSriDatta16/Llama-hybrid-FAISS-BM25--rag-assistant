I would recommend plotting the lines as you have them for the median and the quartiles, or as many percentiles as you would like for that matter. The median could remain thicker/more discernible than than other percentile lines. This would help preserve the ability to see how the data behave across the distribution without compromising the simplicity and familiarity of the plot that is currently used in your field. Also, with such a high sample size, the mean or median trend with error bars would likely be sufficient since you would so thoroughly be enjoying the central limit theorem. The biomedical field also relies on those paired line plots, but this is often the case because the sample size could be on the order of 10-20, so it is important to visualise potential leverage points.
