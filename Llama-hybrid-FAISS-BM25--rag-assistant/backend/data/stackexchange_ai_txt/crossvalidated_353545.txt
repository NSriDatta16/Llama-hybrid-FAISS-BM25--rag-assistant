Your understanding of hypothesis testing (NHST) is in error, and you really need to do some study! What you describe is closer to bayesian thinking. You could search this site or better, read an introductory book. As for your approaches A and B, you need to explain us why you want to do B, it is not very clear. For a better answer we need to know more context, describe your data, what does it measure? and what is your research hypothesis, in simple english.
