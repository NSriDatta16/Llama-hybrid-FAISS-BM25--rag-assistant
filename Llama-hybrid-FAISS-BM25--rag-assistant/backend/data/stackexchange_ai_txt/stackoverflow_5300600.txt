It is indeed possible without removing and adding the annotation off-course. You'll need to observe your MKAnnotation's coordinate and update the MKAnnotationView's position when it changes. Alternatively you can (and this is probably the more elegant way of doing it) derive your own MKAnnotation and MKAnnotationView and make them "movable". See Moving-MKAnnotationView for a detailed example which also animates the position of the annotation.
