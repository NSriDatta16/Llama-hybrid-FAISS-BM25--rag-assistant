I wish you to recommend the following function: function getLocalStorage(){ if (typeof localStorage == “object”){ return localStorage; } else if (typeof globalStorage == “object”){ return globalStorage[location.host]; } else { throw new Error(“Local storage not available.”); } } First check will be enough to make sure localStorage is availabe Some browsers still don't support local storage, but global storage. It has the same function set, but has some differences comparing with localStorga If none of storages is supported, throw exception. If you want to read about global storage, compare it with local storage, Look at "JavaScript for Web Developers", chapter 19. It describes client local storages, comparing it with cookies.
