Google Map event bounds_changed triggered multiple times when dragging

I have a google map with markers. I want my markers to be refreshed when the map is moved/zoomed... Google recommend to use the event bounds_changed for that, but when I move the map, the event is triggered for each pixel that I move the map . I want the map to be refreshed only when the user stopped moving the map, i.e. when he released the mouse button after dragging. How can I do that ?
