C# - Modify what IntPtr is pointing to (replace a string)

Code: ... IntPtr buff ... buff can be pointing to something pretty large. This buff will contain a string, lets say "XYZ123", that I want to replace with "ABC456". Unfortunately, the remainder of data is not a string. This is preventing me from doing something like the following: ..Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(buff) //do string replace here ..Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi(..) As it would screw up the other "non-string" binary data. Given the large size and my inability to do the conversion above, what is the best way to go about doing this? Do a Marshal.Copy into a byte[] in a loop, looking for a character sequence? Thanks!
