From Wiki: The graph shows the probability of passing the exam versus the number of hours studying, with the logistic regression curve fitted to the data. The probability curve is the output of the LR, not the input. Typically during training, the output class (or target class) will be discrete class labels with 1 or 0. During inferencing, the output will be a continuous value between 0 and 1. To generate the probability curve, just feed in different values of "hours studying" into the trained model.
