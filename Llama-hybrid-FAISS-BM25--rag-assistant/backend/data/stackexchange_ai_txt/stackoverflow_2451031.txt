Plugins bound to the same phase should be executed in the same order as they are listed in the POM but... there is an open issue about this ( MNG-2258 ). Also have a look at a the related issue MNG-3719 (pay a special attention to this comment ). Since I don't think that the "cheat" of MNG-3719 is possible in your case, my suggestion is to try with Maven 2.0.8 :( And cross your fingers to not face any regression.
