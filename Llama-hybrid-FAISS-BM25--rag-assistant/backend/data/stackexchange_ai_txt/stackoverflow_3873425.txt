First of all, ask yourself if you have a really good reason for packaging your application and all of its dependencies in to a single jar. I haven't found a very many good reason for this at all (with most reasons being related to organizational policy foolishness or just plain ignorance). The way to go is to keep libraries in their own jars and supplying a .zip/.tar.gz containing all of your libraries and your application with either An executable .jar with the classpath setup appropriately in your MANFIEST.MF file a .bat/.sh script that invokes java and builds an appropriate classpath based on your deps Conversely, use JNLP (better known as Java Web Start). If you really want to have maven bundle all of your dependencies and your application under a single jar, what you want to use is the "jar-with-dependencies" predefined assembly . The maven assembly plugin usage page also shows how you might this up as well.
