Try multiform, but be careful as it is still in dev state. If you want to do it on your own, have a storage variable called step in the form which represents the current step, and increment it everytime this function is called. // if **step** is not set, make it 0, else increment it by 1. $step = isset($form_state['values']) ? (int)$form_state['storage']['step'] : 0; $form_state['storage']['step'] = $step + 1; Use a switch case to render the form elements for the current step. If it is not last step dispaly next button, else submit button. Move the values from $form_state['values'] to $form_state['storage'] In the submit function, perform the database insertion if it is the last step else just return.
