Has anyone succeeded at downloading orders from Amazon Seller Central using PHP?

It looks like this question has been asked before, here and in other places on the web, but I have yet to find any solid documentation on how it's done. We need a way to pragmatically "suck" orders out of Amazon Seller Central on a regular basis, and insert the data into a database on our server for processing. There's hints that you can create a nuSOAP client that does this, but Amazon's documentation is weak to non-existent. Has anyone actually got this to work? Is there a good resource that I may have overlooked? Amazon turned my reports into XML format, but this still isn't working. I get the response: Which is supposed to be a list of available documents (orders). But it looks like a bunch of nothing to me! I've found a sample written in PHP, here . Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It (quite literally) does nothing. I sent an email to their support department, and got a one-line RTM pointing to this less than thorough documentation . I'm still going to try and get this working, and I'll post back with update. Amazon's Documentation Says: Although Amazon.com developed this initial version, we have no intent to support, maintain, or otherwise revise it in the future. Our hope is that someone in the Open Source community will step forward as the package maintainer, and later release new versions pursuant to the applicable licensing requirements.
