Linear regression is one of the core topics in statistics and hence should get some coverage in any introductory statistics textbook. Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a well-respected textbook on regression that includes an early chapter with an overview of more basic statistical concepts. That chapter may not be enough if you have no background in statistics at all, though.
