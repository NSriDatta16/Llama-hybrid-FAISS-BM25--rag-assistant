SVM - Predict the response of one of the observations

I apply k fold cross validation using svms ( classification or regression, it doesn't matter) and I optimize my parameters based on the mean testing error. If I want to predict the value of one of my samples what do I do? I choose randomly one of the (perhaps best) k fold realizations where this sample happened to be on the testing set and predict its value?Or is it better if I apply the leave one out methodology in order to have one "testing phase" prediction for each sample?
