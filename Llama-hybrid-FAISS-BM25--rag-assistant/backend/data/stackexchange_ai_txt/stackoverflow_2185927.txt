As Darin Dimitrov said, String.Contains(string, StringComparison) does not exist as a method for the String type. System.Linq.Enumerable however does contain such a signature. And a string is also an IEnumerable , that's why the compiler gets confused. You would actually be able to leverage Linq and compile if you replaced the StringCompar- ison with an ICompar- er of Char : if (myString.Contains(strVar, Comparer .Default)) { // Code here }
