Hash tables in prolog

I was solving a puzzle in prolog the other day and realized that were I using another programming language, I would have made use of a hash table/dictionary, but as far as I know this isn't really possible in prolog. So my first question is are there any prologs that support a dictionary-like data structure with the performance characteristics of a hash table? Secondly, it occurred to me that since most prologs use a hash table to store predicates, I could write a wrapper predicate to assert and retract facts, creating a dictionary interface which would leverage the underlying hash table of predicates. But would I get the performance characteristics of a hash table, or would the the interface add overheads that would reduce the performance?
