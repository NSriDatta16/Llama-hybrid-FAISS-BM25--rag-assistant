Note that Benjamini-Hochberg controls the false discovery rate to be less than or equal to the specified level, which has been satisfied by all of your scenarios. In terms of the procedure you have followed, there are no faults there. However, it is worth pointing out that for real gene expression data you may get better results using a specific method such as Storey, John D., and Robert Tibshirani. "Statistical significance for genomewide studies." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 100, no. 16 (2003): 9440-9445. This particular method exploits the fact that in such studies it is virtually impossible that the number of significant genes is zero.
