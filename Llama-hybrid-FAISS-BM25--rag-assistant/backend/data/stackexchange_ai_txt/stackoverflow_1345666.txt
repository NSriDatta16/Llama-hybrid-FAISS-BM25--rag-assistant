Your first (non-working) code fragment will be testing :visible while slideToggle is mid-transition (more precisely, it tests it just after the transition starts.) Regardless of whether you're opening or closing, the mid-transition state will be :visible - so you always get true . Try checking .is(":visible") before calling slideToggle
