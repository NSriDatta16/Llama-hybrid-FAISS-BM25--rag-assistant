There are lots of nice plugins for features like radar graphs (spider graphs), Gantt charts, cluster graphs, 3D effects, gradients effects and lots more in Flot. Flot is also open source and under the MIT license, which gives you complete freedom in using it (even commercially) without having to apply a similar license.
