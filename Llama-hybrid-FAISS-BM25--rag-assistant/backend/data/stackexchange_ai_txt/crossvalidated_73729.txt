How should I approach modeling these subjective probability estimates?

In my data about 1000 people have made estimates of the probability of 100 unique events. On average people forecast on about 50 events, but some forecast on all of events and some on only a few. About 500 of these people are working in teams of 15. They see each others forecasts and communicate with each other, but each individual still offers their own estimates). One question I'd like to answer is how much of the variance in these forecasts is explained by which team people were (randomly) assigned to. But I also suspect that the share of the variance explained by team will vary by event. So I'd like to examine that variation as well. I have a bit of experience with mixed models with lmer, but its not immediately obvious to me how to approach this.
