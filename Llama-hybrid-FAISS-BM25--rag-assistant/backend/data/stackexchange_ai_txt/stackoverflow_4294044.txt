Looks like (I may be mistaken, but it really looks like) you don't catch the purpose of those classes - SimpleAdapter , ArrayAdapter or CursorAdapter . They are expected to work with ListView inside of an Activity (or even better - inside of a ListActivity ). If you don't use ListView then those adapers are most likely useless for you. I assume you have your data persisted in some way ( SharedPreferences or file). So if you start any of your Activities, then it just reads the data to populate the views. In this case nothing extra is needed. In case if you need to reload data for a currently visible Activity, then just reread the data from persistent storage and repopulate the views.
