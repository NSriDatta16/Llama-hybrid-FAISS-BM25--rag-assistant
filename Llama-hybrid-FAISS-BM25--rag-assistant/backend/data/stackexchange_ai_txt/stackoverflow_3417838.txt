Can I retrieve the user selected text in a text form input?

I'm trying to get only the selected part of an input string that was selected by the user. Let's say I have this input : And the user selects the "Enter" word by clicking and dragging in the text field. Can I retrieve that text with jQuery? I know I can get the whole value this way : $("#first_name").val(); But so far, I didn't find anyway to get only the selected "Enter" part. Anyone is able to point me in the right direction? Thanks! EDIT I tried document.getSelection and it's working great in Firefox on a static text element such as a "p". It's not working for me so far on a text input. In IE, window.selection.createRange().text is working both on a "p" and in a text input.
