Adobe Flex / as3: How to implement custom drag-and-drop cursors

Our product team has requested custom cursors during drag/drop operations. They have provided me with three images to implement: Open-Hand-Grabber.png : displays when a user hovers over an item that they can drag Closed-Hand-Grabber.png : item is being dragged Closed-Hand-Grabber-No-Drop : item dragged over an area where it cannot be dropped I have embedded these images into the Flex application and I am now trying to implement the desired behavior. My first thought was to listen to the drag/drop events and set the cursors using the CursorManager.setCursor() method. This solution seems very code intensive and I feel that there must be an easier way to skin the various drag/drop cursor states. Any ideas?
