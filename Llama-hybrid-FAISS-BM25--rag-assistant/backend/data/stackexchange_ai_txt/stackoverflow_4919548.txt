Web forms, if eval() is 0

I have a problem in a Web Forms project. I have a gridview bound to a SqlDataSource. In my gridview's ItemTemplate I have following code: '> The problem with this is, that my li html tag also is shown when Eval("countsCallEingang") is 0 and displayed as empty. So I have to make the 0 check before the li tag and show the li tag only when it is not 0. How do I form a If-Clause or something similar in this case?
