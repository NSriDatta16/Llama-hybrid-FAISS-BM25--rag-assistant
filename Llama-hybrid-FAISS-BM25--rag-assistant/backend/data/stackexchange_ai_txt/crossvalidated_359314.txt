It usually makes little sense to include lags at $t-4$, $t-15$ and $t-22$ without also including lags of lower orders. This would be equivalent to setting a lot of AR (or MA) coefficients to zero. The only case where this does make sense is a seasonal time series. For instance, I am currently working with data where the ACF shows clear peaks at lags 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Yes, these are daily data with weekly autoregressive behavior. In such a situation, the classical approach is to use seasonal differencing and fit a SARIMA model.
