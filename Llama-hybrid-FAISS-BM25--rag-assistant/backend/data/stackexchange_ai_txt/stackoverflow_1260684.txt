Per the spec, AroundInvoke is not supported for timeout methods (business interface, component interface, and webservice endpoint only). Searching Google, AroundTimeout appears to be coming in EJB 3.1 (pages 12 and 22): http://www.ow2.org/xwiki/bin/download/Events2009AnnualConference/Program/JavaEE6-EasyBeans-F-Benoit.pdf In the meantime, you can workaround the issue by injecting a reference to the same bean into itself. In other words inject (or lookup) another "A" from within "A", and then create and invoke a new "doTimeout" method from your "doSomething" method.
