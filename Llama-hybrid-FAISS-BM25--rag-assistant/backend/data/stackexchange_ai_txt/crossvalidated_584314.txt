In the beginning, that is, at the Bayesian modelling stage, there are two random entities, $\mathcal D$ and $\theta$ , with a joint distribution with density $p(\theta,\mathcal D)$ . Then comes the observation of the data , which is a realisation $d$ of the random variable $\mathcal D$ . The random variable $\theta$ remains random since it is not observed but the realisation $d$ brings some degree of information about $\theta$ , which is one considers its distribution conditional on the realisation $d$ of $\mathcal D$ , with density $p(\theta|\mathcal D=d)$ . Note that in standard statistical modelling, the data is usually considered as the observed realisation of the random variable , rather than as a random variable. To quote Wikipedia, It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution induced by the process that generates the observed data. Now, when considering Bayes' theorem, $$\operatorname{p}(\theta|\mathcal{D}) = \frac{{\operatorname{p}(\mathcal{D}, \theta)}}{\operatorname{p}(\mathcal{D})} = \frac{{\operatorname{p}(\mathcal{D}|\theta)}{\operatorname{p}(\theta)}}{\operatorname{p}(\mathcal{D})}$$ it is a mere mathematical (functional) identity linking the five density functions involved in it and should better be written $$\operatorname{p}(\theta|d) = \frac{{\operatorname{p}(d, \theta)}}{\operatorname{p}(d)} = \frac{{\operatorname{p}(d|\theta)}{\operatorname{p}(\theta)}}{\operatorname{p}(d)}\qquad\forall\,\theta,d$$ as it holds for all possible entries $\theta,d$ . From a mathematical perspective, $\operatorname{p}(\theta|d)$ is a function of both $\theta$ and $d$ since changing the value of $\theta$ or the value of $d$ modifies (in general) the value of $\operatorname{p}(\theta|d)$ . The same remark applies to the likelihood function . What may be confusing to the OP is the use of the notation $d$ in this paragraph as a generic data realisation, varying in a sample space, $\mathfrak D$ say, as opposed to the actual observed data realisation also denoted $d$ in the first paragraph. Which is why the observed data is sometimes denoted otherwise, $d^o$ for instance. With such notations, $\operatorname{p}(\theta|d)$ is a function of both $\theta$ and $d$ , while $\operatorname{p}(\theta|d^o)$ is a function of $\theta$ only.
