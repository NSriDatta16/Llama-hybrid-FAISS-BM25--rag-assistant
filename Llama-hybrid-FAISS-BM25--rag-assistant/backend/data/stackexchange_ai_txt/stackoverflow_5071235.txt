Short answer as some pros and cons have been named: It is a matter of personal or organisational style. None is functionally better than the other. You (or your project) will have to make your own decisions about whether to use checked or unchecked exceptions, or both. Oracle's Java Tutorial advices you to use checked exceptions for all errors the application can recover from, and unchecked exceptions for the errors the application cannot recover from. But from my experience most applications may recover from most (maybe not during startup) exceptions. The action that failed will be aborted but the application stays alive. I would rather only use either checked exceptions or unchecked exceptions. Mixing may result in confusion and inconsistent use. Be pragmatic. Do what makes sense in your situation.
