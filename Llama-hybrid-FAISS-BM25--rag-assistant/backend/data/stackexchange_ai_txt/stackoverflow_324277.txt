Subversion... practical with a PHP framework app or not?

I am developing a website using CodeIgniter and PHP. Some of my friends suggest I start using Subversion to take care of my organization. Could someone give me a basic explanation of what SVN is without the jargon and also if it is practical for a framework where 5 files are needed to run a single page?
