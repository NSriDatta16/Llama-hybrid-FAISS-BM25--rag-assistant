The answer is 11. Given that the size of the first group is 10 times the size of the second, 11 is the smallest possible sample size that includes at least one observation. Now, you might say that this is ridiculous, but it turns out that a single observation is adequate for updating your prior beliefs, supposing that you are a Bayesian . Given that you are almost certainly not a Bayesian, one might ask the following type of question: What is the smallest sample size needed to reject the null hypothesis at least $x\%$ of the time if we assume that the true difference between groups is at least $y$ and we assume that the distribution of the response variable is $z$? Specifying $x$, $y$, and $z$ is the first step towards getting the answer you seem to be seeking.
