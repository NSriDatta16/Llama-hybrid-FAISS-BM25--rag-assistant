I would say no. Principal components analysis is a form of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and does not develop a formal scale for research purposes. The end-goal of EFA typically is to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) which tests a specific structure rather than one that is merely optimal in a given dataset. To avoid this mess, a pragmatic research approach that is well received in the research community is parceling. Parceling is done by taking a sum-score of appropriately transformed data. An important aspect to parceling is that the researcher must specify a priori how many such scales, which indicators are used for them, and what representation thereof are included in a parcel. With 40 measures, this is easily done and precludes machine learning. PCA is capable of ranking features in terms of their factor loading. If you select the top $k
