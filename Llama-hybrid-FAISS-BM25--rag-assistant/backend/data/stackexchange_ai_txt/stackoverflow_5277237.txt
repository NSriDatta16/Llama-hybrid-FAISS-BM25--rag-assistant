You can do this by overriding the draw() method in a ListView subclass, but if the change is minor, it actually may be easiest to simply apply a rotation animation such as this one: RotateAnimation anim = new RotateAnimation(0f, 3,0f, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.5f, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.5f); anim.setFillAfter(true); getListView().startAnimation(anim); Note that this uses the 2.3-and-below compatible animation framework (not the newer 3.0+ only framework), which means that the view isn't really rotated, it only looks rotated -- this means clicks still register as if the list was in its original position, which for changes more than a few degrees will noticeably mess up drag/scroll/click interactions (in which case you'll want to go with actually overriding draw(Canvas canvas) in a custom ListView subclass and apply the necessary transformations).
