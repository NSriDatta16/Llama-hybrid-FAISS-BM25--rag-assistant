The accept option on the droppable widget: All draggables that match the selector will be accepted. If a function is specified, the function will be called for each draggable on the page (passed as the first argument to the function), to provide a custom filter. The function should return true if the draggable should be accepted. combined with the revert option on draggable should get you what you need: $(".draggable").draggable({ revert: 'invalid' }); $("#droppable").droppable({ accept: function(el) { /* This is a filter function, you can perform logic here depending on the element being filtered: */ return el.hasClass('acceptable'); } }); Note that in this specific example, you could also write accept: ".acceptable" , which would make the droppable only accept elements with class acceptable . So another option is when your custom event happens, just apply or remove the acceptable class as necessary. Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/rUgJF/3/ The bottom has a link toggling "acceptability" on an off.
