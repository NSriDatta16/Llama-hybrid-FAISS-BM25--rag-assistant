Sorry for the late comment, but isn't it the formula above provided by Joel Coehoorn rewritten wrongly? I mean, the basic formula is right: Given: A = current avg C = count of items V = next value in the sequence The next average (A1) is: A1 = ( (C * A) + V ) / ( C + 1 ) But instead of: A1 = C/(C+1) * A/(C+1) + V/(C+1) shouldn't we have: A1 = C/(C+1) * A + V/(C+1) That would explain kastermester's post: "My math ticks off here - You have C, which you say "go towards infinity" or at least, a really big number, then: C/(C+1) goes towards 1. A /(C+1) goes towards 0. V/(C+1) goes towards 0. All in all: A1 = 1 * 0 + 0 So put shortly A1 goes towards 0 - seems a bit off. â€“ kastermester" Because we would have A1 = 1 * A + 0, i.e., A1 goes towards A, which it's right. I've been using such method for calculating averages for a long time and the aforementioned precision problems have never been an issue for me.
