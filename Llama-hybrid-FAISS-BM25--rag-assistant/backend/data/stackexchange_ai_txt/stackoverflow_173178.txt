Well, it's strange isn't it? There is such a push towards domain driven design as the zenith of object orientated analysis and design, and there are enterprise patterns out there to leverage ORM systems to persist our objects. It just makes total sense to me that if your application DESIGN is object orientated and domain focussed at heart, that an OODB will greatly benefit your application. Aside from the issues around maturity and uptake, from a philosophical perspective an OODB would appear beneficial or an OO application. not having to maintain that mapping layer for starters;) But look, if you aren't doing domain drive design and use objects as data objects and like your stored procs, then you're not really going to get it;)
