Sampling using PCA and maximizing variance

In 6 forests, I've 3 variables that I know the values for all trees: $height$, $diameter$ and $density$. I can only cut some trees to know their $mass$. The question is how to choose the trees to cut? As I supposed a linear model such as: $Mass = a_1 Diameter + a_2 Height + a_3 Density + a_4$ (or as mention in an answer $log(Mass) = a_1 log(Diameter) + a_2 log(Height) + a_3 log(Density) + a_4$), I thought to maximize the variance of the sampling to have the best fitting afterward. Is it correct to use a Principal Component Analysis over the 3 variables and then choose in the 2 first axes of the PCA the most spread out sampling ? Is there another method to choose sampling by maximizing the variance over variables that I already know ? Thank you.
