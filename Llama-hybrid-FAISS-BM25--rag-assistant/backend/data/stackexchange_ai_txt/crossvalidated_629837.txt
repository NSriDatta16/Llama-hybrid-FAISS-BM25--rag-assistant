In theory to properly model time series $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_T$ you need to estimate the joint distribution $F(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_T)$ . Note, that each observation $x_t$ is a sample of the random variable $X_t$ . So, we're dealing with a single sample from a set of $T$ random variables. This is an impossible construct to deal with. Hence, we hope that in fact we don't need this joint distribution, and instead we want to work with auto covariance function (ACF) $\gamma_h$ where $\gamma_h=cov[x_t,x_{t+h}]$ . Note, that it doesn't depend on $t$ anymore. That's the kind of stationarity we're talking about, that auto covariance function exists and depends only on the distance in time between observations, but not the time itself. Full joint distribution $F$ is impossible to estimate, because we literally have one sample from it. In contrast, ACF can be estimated at least partially, because we can treat $x_1, x_2$ and $x_2,x_3$ as two samples to estimates $\gamma_1$ . That's why we like ACF and want it to exist.
