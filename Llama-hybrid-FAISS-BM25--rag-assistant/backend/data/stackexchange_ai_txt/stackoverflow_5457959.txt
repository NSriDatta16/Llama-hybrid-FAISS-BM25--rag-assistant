You can't set all the HTTP headers that are sent, but you can set the user-agent string that is sent like so: The user_agent value is NULL by default, which is why you don't currently see anything being sent. That should do the trick. Note that if the .jsp file returns html content rather than php, you should use readfile , not include .
