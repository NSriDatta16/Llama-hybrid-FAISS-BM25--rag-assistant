As others have mentioned you should use a pitch detection algorithm. Since that ground is well-covered I will address a few particulars of your question. You said that you are looking for the pitch class of the note. However, the way to find this is to calculate the frequency of the note and then use a table to convert it to the pitch class, octave, and cents. I don't know of any way to obtain the pitch class without finding the fundamental frequency. You will need a real-time pitch detection algorithm. In evaluating algorithms pay attention to the latency implied by each algorithm, compared with the accuracy you desire. Although some algorithms are better than others, fundamentally you must trade one for the other and cannot know both with certainty -- sort of like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. (How can you know the note is C4 when only a fraction of a cycle has been heard?) Your "smoothing" approach is equivalent to a digital filter , which will alter the frequency characteristics of the voice. In short, it may interfere with your attempts to estimate the pitch. If you have an interest in digital audio, digital filters are fundamental and useful tools in that field, and a fascinating subject besides. It helps to have a strong math background in understanding them, but you don't necessarily need that to get the basic idea. Also, your zero crossing method is a basic technique to estimate the period of a waveform and thus the pitch. It can be done this way, but only with a lot of heuristics and fine-tuning. (Essentially, develop a number of "candidate" pitches and try to infer the dominant one. A lot of special cases will emerge that will confuse this. A quick one is the less 's'.) You'll find it much easier to begin with a frequency domain pitch detection algorithm.
