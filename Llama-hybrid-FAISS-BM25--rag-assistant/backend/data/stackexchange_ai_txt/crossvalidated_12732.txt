Can you be more specific about the types of data you are looking at? This will in part determine what type of algorithm will converge the fastest. I'm also not sure how to compare methods like boosting and DL, as boosting is really just a collection of methods. What other algorithms are you using with the boosting? In general, DL techniques can be described as layers of encoder/decoders. Unsupervised pre-training works by first pre-training each layer by encoding the signal, decoding the signal, then measuring the reconstruction error. Tuning can then be used to get better performance (e.g. if you use denoising stacked-autoencoders you can use back-propagation). One good starting point for DL theory is: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.795&rep=rep1&type=pdf as well as these: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1756025 (sorry, had to delete last link due to SPAM filtration system) I didn't include any information on RBMs, but they are closely related (though personally a little more difficult to understand at first).
