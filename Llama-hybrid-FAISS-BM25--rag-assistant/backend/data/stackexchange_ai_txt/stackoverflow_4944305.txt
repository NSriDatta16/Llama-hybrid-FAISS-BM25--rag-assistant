jQuery UI Dialog and IE

I'm using jQuery UI Dialog for a project and having some problems with IE8 (haven't tested it on IE7 and below but did tested it on Chorme and FF). I use this code in the js: var dialogObj = $("#dialog").dialog({autoOpen: false, title: id, modal: false, width: 600, height: 400}); The dialog is filled through ajax. In IE8 the title is not showing correctly. It's narrow and doesn't show the title's text. Also I have another problem in IE: Whenever I press the element that shows the dialog I have an error message: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; Tablet PC 2.0; InfoPath.3) Timestamp: Wed, 9 Feb 2011 11:27:22 UTC Message: Unexpected call to method or property access. Line: 103 Char: 460 Code: 0 URI: http://localhost/js/jquery.js Which is at this line: return this.domManip(arguments,true,function(a){this.nodeType===1&&this.appendChild(a)})}, char 460 starts here: this.nodeType===1&&this.appendChild(a)})}, I use jQuery v1.4.2 If I press the element again it displays the dialog. The element that shows the dialog is this: Id; ?>')"> Id; ?> Note that my page validates. Thanks for your help!
