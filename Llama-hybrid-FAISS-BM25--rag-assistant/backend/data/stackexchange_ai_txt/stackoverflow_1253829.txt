Make SVN directory locally read-only

Two teams are working on two different projects "A" and "B". Some files are common to both projects and are stored in a directory "Common". When a release date of project A approaches, the team of project A does not want to be bothered by modifications to "Common" made by team "B". Most people like branches for such issues but i don't. What i want is to give a simple possibility to team A to 1) ignore all modifications made by team B to Common files 2) share modifications of Common files among team A members Here are the A,B,Common directories as stored on svn : Common .. A .. B The idea i am trying to implement is to make "Common" directory read-only and not updatable to team A . If they really want to modify Common files, they will have to copy them in directory "A" and commit them. Is there a way, ideally a simple and elegant one, to do "just that" ? NB : this is a simplified presentation of the issue. There are more than just two teams, and more than just one "common" repository NB2 : all teams use tortoiseSVN
