Formally speaking: 2 layers cannot be stacked into one, because there is a non-linearity involved between them. In general the structure of a CNN is $image \rightarrow conv1 \rightarrow f(conv1)\rightarrow conv2 \rightarrow f(conv2) $. There is no way you can convert this into a single layer unless $f(x)$ is the linear function, in which case the CNN might not be very good. And non-linearity is added to extract features, suppress non-useful features, etc which is not probably well understood. But still I suggest you to look at this excellent answer, if you want to better understand the use of non-linearity in CNN's: Do scientists know what is happening inside artificial neural networks?
