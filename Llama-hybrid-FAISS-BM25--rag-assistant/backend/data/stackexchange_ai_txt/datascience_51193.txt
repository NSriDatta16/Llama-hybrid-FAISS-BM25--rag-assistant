Isolated/noisy instances that have outsized effect on SVM hyperplane selection

Consider two linearly separable classes and the optimal separating hyperplane (image credit Prof Jiawei Han of UIUC): Now consider if there were a single "rogue" point for the Yellow class - which may or may not be noise - and the effect it has on the corresponding optimal separating hyperplane (shown in red): Is there a modified version of SVM to allow for this situation - to "consider" the isolated observation when calculating the hyperplane but not be strictly driven by it? Would this be a case of using slack variables - as shown in this slide (credit: CS @ CMU https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/slides/Kernels_SVM2_04_12_2011-ann.pdf ) ? Is this problem - which is to say some observations may be noisy and we should not put too much weight on any individual one the same one as instances of the two classes are not linearly separable If not then would there be a different approach to representing this svm with noise then using slack variables ?
