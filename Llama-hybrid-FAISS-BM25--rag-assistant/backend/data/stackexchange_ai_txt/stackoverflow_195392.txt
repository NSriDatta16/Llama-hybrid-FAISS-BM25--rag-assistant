For Perl there's the excellent Devel::Cover module which I regularly use on my modules. If the build and installation is managed by Module::Build you can simply run ./Build testcover to get a nice HTML site that tells you the coverage per sub, line and condition, with nice colors making it easy to see which code path has not been covered.
