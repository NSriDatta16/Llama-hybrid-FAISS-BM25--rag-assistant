Why the accuracy of my bagging model heavily affected by random state?

The accuracy of my bagging decision tree model reach up to 97% when I set the random seed=5 but the accuracy reduce to only 92% when I set random seed=0. Can someone explain why the huge gap and should I just use the accuracy with highest value in my research paper or takes the average with random seed=None?
