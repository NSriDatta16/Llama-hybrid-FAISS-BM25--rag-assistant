Style text-decoration differently or make a border on each line

I'm having a quite specific CSS problem. I'm trying to get a paragraph of text have a border-bottom: 1px dotted on each line while at the same time avoid writing superfluous markup. Clearly p {border-bottom:1px dotted #000;} doesn't work since it will only set a border-bottom on the last line of the p tag. On the other hand, text-decoration gives the correct underlining, but can't be styled dotted. So basically I'm wondering if there's a better way of doing it than figuring out when there's a new line and add span and then style that with border-bottom and ending up with a seriously messy markup.
