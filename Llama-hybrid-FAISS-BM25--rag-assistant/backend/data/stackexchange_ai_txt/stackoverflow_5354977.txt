Is this just a matter of cleanliness or do you have a reporting infrastructure that you want to be on the lookout for a specific exception? Obviously if you aren't planning on catching the exception then its type (practically speaking) matters not at all. Depending why ShitHitTheFan then I would argue that InvalidOperationException or ApplicationException make sufficient sense. Adding a detailed message would seem sufficient to explain the cause. I tend to be pragmatic so the fact that the documentation indicates that ApplicationExceptions aren't fatal doesn't matter at all to me. Any exception can be fatal if it isn't caught... Depending on any crash reporting/logging framework you have in place it may also be useful to fill out the Exception.Data property with state information that would help you in debugging the problem. Edit: Also, if you do go the custom exception route - please, please implement the constructors necessary for serialization. You never know, months/years down the road, when your exception may be sent over the wire.
