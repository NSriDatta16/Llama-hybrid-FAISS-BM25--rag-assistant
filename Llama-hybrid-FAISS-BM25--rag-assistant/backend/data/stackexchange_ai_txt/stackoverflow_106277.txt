Fun question! I did a bit of googling, and the good news is, I've found an implementation of Hilbert Value. The potentially bad news is, it's in Haskell... http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2007/01/11/two-dimensional-spatial-hashing-with-space-filling-curves/ It also proposes a Lebesgue distance metric you might be able to compute more easily.
