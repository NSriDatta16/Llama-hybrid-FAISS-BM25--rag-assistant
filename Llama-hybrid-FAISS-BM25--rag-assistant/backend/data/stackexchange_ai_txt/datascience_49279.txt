The most common way is to measure the similarity between two text documents is distance in a vector space. A vector space model can be created by using word count, tf-idf , word embeddings, or document embeddings. Distance is most often measured by cosine similarity . Once all the documents are in the same vector space, the 100x100 matrix with cosine similarity can be calculated. " Introduction to Information Retrieval " book goes into greater detail.
