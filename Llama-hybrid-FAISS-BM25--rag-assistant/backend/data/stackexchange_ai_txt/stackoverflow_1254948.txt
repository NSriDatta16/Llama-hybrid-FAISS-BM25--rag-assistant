"User CN={user's name}/O={organisation name } cannot open database {path to databasename.nsf}"

I am getting this error when i am trying to access mail file(mail/usermail.nsf) of user ( on different machine) using C#. I am using "Interop.Domino.dll". Is this happening because of same user name and organization name? But i am able to access local User NSF file (user configured on same machine where Domino server installed) where lotus notes client name is same as that of domain name.
