Except for very unlikely scenarios, a random forest prediction cannot be represented by a single tree. This is because they learn predictors in different hypothesis classes: a random forest learns predictors over the space of linear combinations of trees, which includes predictors that are not trees. Put differently- forests learn predictors in the span of the space of trees. That said, there is the hope that there exists a tree that is a good approximation of the forest predictor. A quick and dirty way of finding this tree, is fitting a tree to the predictions of the forest. The quality of its predictions will depend on the "distance" from the best forest predictor, to its best tree approximation.
