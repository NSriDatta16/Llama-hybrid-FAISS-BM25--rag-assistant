You don't say what profiling or other changes you've done, and when people dive in with off-the-wall solutions to perf problems but don't describe how they arrived at the need for them, I'm always a bit doubtful. Where is your app spending its start-up time? How did you measure that? Can you fix an underlying '300 dlls' problem of the type described in that article? Messing with OS prefetch policy may being improving your application at the expense of everyone else, which may be the right thing to do (on a single-use industrial control system or something like that), but may be completely antisocial. "Load less code" is often a good general way to improve application startup time - do you have some very expensive config file storage mechanism, for example (XmlSerializer was notorious for this at one point, for example).
