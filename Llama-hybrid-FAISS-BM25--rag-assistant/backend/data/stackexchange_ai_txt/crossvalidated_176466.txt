Causation in an agroecosystem?

I'm working in an agroecosystem with one specific crop and am interested in understanding how certain treatments influence given ecosystem characteristics (such as soil organic carbon). Variables that are known to influence these characteristics (beyond the potential impact of treatments) include soil type and climate. I'm considering using multiple regression, with the ultimate goal of being able to predict how the given treatments will influence ecosystem characteristics of interest. I want to predict, given certain variables (climate, soils, and treatment), how the ecosystem characteristic will respond for this plant. I had also considered using structural equation modelling to elucidate underlying mechanisms, although I don't think this would be appropriate here. Will multiple regression be appropriate in this case, or should I use SEM or something else?
