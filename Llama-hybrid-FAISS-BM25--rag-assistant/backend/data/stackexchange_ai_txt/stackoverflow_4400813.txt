readAsDataURL from readAsBinaryString?

I want to save an image as binary to the users localhost for future reference, then at a later date, generate a dataurl from this binary, problem is, it's not working. var reader = new FileReader(); reader.onload = function(file){ this.file = file.target.result; }.bind(this); reader.readAsBinaryString(asset); var reader = new FileReader(); reader.onload = function(image){ this.image = image.target.result; }.bind(this); reader.readAsDataURL(this.file); This might seem a little peverse, but the image data is being put in localstorage, then at a later date (maybe a minute, maybe a week) I want to be able to generate an image from it. Any ideas? Thanks!
