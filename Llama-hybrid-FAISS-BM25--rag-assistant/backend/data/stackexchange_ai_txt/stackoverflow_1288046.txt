How can I get my webapp's base URL in ASP.NET MVC?

How can I quickly determine what the root URL is for my ASP.NET MVC application? I.e., if IIS is set to serve my application at http://example.com/foo/bar , then I'd like to be able to get that URL in a reliable way that doesn't involve getting the current URL from the request and chopping it up in some fragile way that breaks if I re-route my action. The reason that I need the base URL is that this web application calls another one that needs the root to the caller web application for callback purposes.
