Bayesian, causal: latent variable estimation

I have 3 variables: X, Y, U. U is unobserved. I know that X -> Y and U -> Y and U -> X. So U is a confounder. For example: U = IQ, X = education and Y = income. I want to estimate the latent variable U so that I estimate the effect of X on Y more accurately. Let's say I can estimate these equations where e1 and e2 are the errors, and U is estimated as well. (1) Y ~ X + U + e1 (2) X ~ U + e2 U is like a shared idiosyncratic factor. Can I force U and (e1, e2) to be independent of each other via a prior covariance matrix?
