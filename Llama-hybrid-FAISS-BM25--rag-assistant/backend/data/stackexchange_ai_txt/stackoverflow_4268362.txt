Reporting data into Qlikview dynamically from SQL Server 2005

I am currently working on an IT helpdesk application (MANAGE ENGINE) which uses a SQL Server 2005 backend; I would like to dynamically produce data with a chart. How do I create a chart in Qlikview with the two (2) columns in my SELECT statement as the X and Y axes? Anytime I try creating charts, it automatically gives 3 options (sum, average or count). Can it just pick the values from the fields directly without doing any calculation on it? Please find attached an example of the sheet I am interested in building. Many thanks for your audience. Kind Regards, Tunde
