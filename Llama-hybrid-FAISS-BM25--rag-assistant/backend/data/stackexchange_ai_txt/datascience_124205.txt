How can I labelling a sequence of network traffic to one single classification?

I want to labelling network traffic (several .pcap-files ) to different classifications. But this network traffic are not just one entry, there are sequence of entries (~50). So how is it possible, to labelling the sequence of network traffic to one single label? To convert from .pcap-file to .csv I need tshark , where I also pick the needed properties from the .pcap-files. I wish, that I can labelling a sequence of network traffic to example "internet activity 1" and another sequence to "internet activity 2". Here are two screenshot from pcap files, where I want to labelling as whole and feed into a ML model As example "internet activity1" And "internet activity2" And with this labeled datas, I want to train a machine learning algorithm. But all example in the internet are with one-labelling-approach (per row, one label). So nowhere I saw a classification, were based on multiple rows. I am new to this topic and grateful for any help and advice
