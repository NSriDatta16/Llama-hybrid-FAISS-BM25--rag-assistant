Using a schema other than 'dbo' in LinqToSql Designer

Is there a way to specify in a data connection or the LinqToSql Designer a schema? Whenever I go to setup a data connection for LinqToSql there doesn't seem to be anyway to specify a schema and I get 'dbo' by default. I figure that I can't be the first person to use a schema other than 'dbo' with LinqToSql, so I must be missing something obvious. EDIT : Maybe a little clarification is in order. Let's say that my database is such: MyDatabase.dbo.Tables MyDatabase.MySchema.Tables I can create a connection to MyDatabase.dbo (by default) and thus get a nice listing of tables that I can drag on to the designer. What I can't seem to do is create a connection to MyDatabase.MySchema to get the nice table listings etc. of which I could drag on to the designer.
