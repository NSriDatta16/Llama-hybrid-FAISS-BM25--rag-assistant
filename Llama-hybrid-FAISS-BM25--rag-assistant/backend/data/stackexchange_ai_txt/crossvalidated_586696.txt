This can be solved using Markov chains. First define your 4x4 transition matrix (A, B, C, F - final state), probabilities of passing from one state to the next. I am assuming there is only one direction of progression, forward, i.e. there is no rollback to previous tests upon failure. If this is not true then the matrix below can be slightly changed to account for this. A B C F A 0.7 0.3 0.0 0.0 B 0.0 0.8 0.2 0.0 C 0.0 0.0 0.9 0.1 F 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 Then you need to raise this matrix to the power of 20 (19), which gives you the probabilities of being in a certain state depending on where you started after 20 turns. The result is A B C F A 0.0007979227 0.03219388 0.2979484 0.6690598 B 0.0000000000 0.01152922 0.2200949 0.7683759 C 0.0000000000 0.00000000 0.1215767 0.8784233 F 0.0000000000 0.00000000 0.0000000 1.0000000 Here you would look at the first row, since you started in state A. The probability of being in state F (the final state) starting in state A after 20 turns is roughly equal to 67 %.
