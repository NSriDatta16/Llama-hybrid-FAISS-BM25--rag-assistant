Which machine learning technique suits this use case?

I have two different zones say for ex. IN and OUT and each zone with two features i.e., A & B. Now I have a target with the same two features and with the help of this, I need to identify, to which zone the target belongs to? Following are the data set which I have for sample demonstration purpose. In actual scenario, I will have approximately 200 samples for each feature. IN_A,IN_B,OUT_A,OUT_B,Target_A,Target_B -28, -73, -81, -34, -31, -69 -31, -71, -76, -37, -35, -68 -33, -69, -78, -32, -29, -63 -35, -68, -79, -38, -36, -66 -37, -70, -77, -39, -32, -67 -34, -72, -75, -36, -34, -65 -39, -65, -74, -35, -38, -61 -41, -63, -72, -40, -33, -63 -45, -61, -73, -43, -45, -64 -48, -60, -71, -42, -40, -62 -43, -64, -70, -41, -37, -60 -42, -62, -69, -44, -43, -59 -46, -59, -68, -46, -46, -58 -44, -58, -67, -45, -41, -57 -49, -57, -66, -47, -44, -56 The above data set has plotted, Now with the help of this I need to identify to which zone the target belongs to? Which machine learning algorithm suites well for this? Note: The number of samples in target need not to be equal to the training data set.
