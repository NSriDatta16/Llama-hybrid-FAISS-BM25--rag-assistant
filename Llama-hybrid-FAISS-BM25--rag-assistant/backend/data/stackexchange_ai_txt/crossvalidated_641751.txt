What you describe as the "simplest approach" (sum of all ranks) is effectively the Borda count - it is indeed simple to implement and easy to explain, good start (+1). In general, the setup presented aligns well with the concept of ranked voting , a system where " voters indicate a rank to order candidates or options—in a sequence from first, second, third, and onwards—on their ballots." (From the Wikipedia article linked) And thus, we want to explore two main research areas: 1. positional voting and 2. rank fusion methods. Both fields are niche but reasonably well-formulated research areas and have clear overlap. Positional voting is (expectedly) related to Political Science and Rank fusion to Information Retrieval. At first instance, I would also suggest looking at the concept of Condorcet fusion that tries to capture which choice is preferred over all other choices in a pairwise comparison. Following that, we can then go crazy with techniques like: CombSUM, CombMNZ, CombANZ, Rank-Biased Precision, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), the list goes on. Looking at particular voting system allows us to explore which properties our "ranking combination method" will have. e.g. Be Condorcet-consistent? Be median-voter -consistent? Run in polynomial time? (Some methods are NP-hard ) Be independent of irrelevant alternatives ? etc. etc. To start with: Given our initial Borda count method, we should see which properties are relevant for us and are satisfied (and which not). After that, we can move forward to other voting/rank combination methods that are guaranteed to satisfy our selection criteria.
