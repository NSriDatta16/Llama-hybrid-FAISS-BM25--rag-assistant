This is a supervised learning problem, specifically regression. Supervised learning refers to using measured values to model and predict output values. The regression part means that you have numbers as your response variable, as opposed to categories. (Something called ordinal regression blurts the distinction between, but I don’t think you’re in an ordinal situation.) Your inputs are the parameters of the chemical reaction, and your outputs are the reaction times. You then use these values to figure out a plausible transformation from input to output. A few popular methods are linear regression, neural networks, random forest, and additive models. (I assume you know or can measure some reaction times for various combinations of input values. If you don’t, then your way of guessing how long the reactions will take is up to your knowledge of the chemistry and physics, not some kind of data science or machine learning.)
