Fade In select the stackpanel Select Assets -> Behaviors -> drag and drop Changeproperty on the Stack Panel. goto Objects and Timeline -> Select ChangeProperty under Stackpanel -> goto Properties select Trigger Event Name:MouseEnter -> Next in Common Property, PropertyName:Opacity -> Next in Animation Add Duration:00:00:0.5 repeat the same to Fade Out a little change. PropertyName:Opacity Change the Value:0 That's works. enjoy.
