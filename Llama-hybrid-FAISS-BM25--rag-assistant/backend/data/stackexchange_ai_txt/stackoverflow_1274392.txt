Set the main form's DockSite property to True, and then handle the OnDockOver and OnDockDrop events. You can see an example of the VCL's drag and drop docking support in the Docking demo (installed for Delphi 2007 on WinXP in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\RAD Studio\5.0\Demos\DelphiWin32\VCLWin32\Docking, for Delphi 7 in C:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi7\Demos\Docking.) Delphi 2009's will be in the same folder location as Delphi 2007's; just change the 5.0 to 6.0 in the path.
