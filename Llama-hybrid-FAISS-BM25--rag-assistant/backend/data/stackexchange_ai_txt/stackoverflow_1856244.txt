It looks like your answer/errors are divided between proper names, real words (which I assume don't exist in the lexicon) and true misspellings. A false negative on "Sincerity" also suggests that capitalization might be throwing it off, though you'd hope it'd be smart enough not to - worth checking anyway. Plurals shouldn't be an issue either, but a false negative on "gods"? Does it correctly identify "god"? Since you're trying to check spelling, why check it indirectly? what is lp.getLexicon().isKnown(w.word()) doing internally? doesn't it depend on the loaded corpus? Why not just load a dictionary, normalize the case into a big hash, and do a "contains" check? Since you're in an NLP context, it should also be reasonably easy to strip out proper names, especially given that you're not looking for 100% accuracy.
