You might be interested in Introduction to Linguistic Annotation and Text Analytics , a book which is focused very heavily on software tools for text annotation and text analysis. It has no focus whatsoever on natural language processing theory, but can serve as a good introduction to current NLP software tools. (Be forewarned that becuase of this focus, it will probably become obsolete very fast. If you can borrow it from a library, you probably should do that instead of buying it.)
