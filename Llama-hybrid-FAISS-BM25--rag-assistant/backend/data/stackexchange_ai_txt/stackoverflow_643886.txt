It all depends on the situation ... When you know in the design-phase that you'll have multiple classes that have the same 'commonality', but their implementation differ, then the interface comes first. However, software is organic; it is constantly evolving, so I can imagine that in some cases, you'll have a class and after some time it will be necessary to extract an interface from that class.
