I have done some very similar things, but instead of using text substitution strings, I use Word Content Controls. I have documented some of the details in the following blog post, SharePoint and Open Xml . The technique is not specific to SharePoint. You could reuse the pattern in pure ASP.NET or other applications. Also, I would STRONGLY encourage you to review Eric White's Blog for tips, tricks and techniques regarding Open Xml. Specifically, check out the in-memory manipulation of Open Xml post , and the Word content controls posts. I think you'll find these much more helpful in the long run. Hope this helps.
