The first reason is almost certainly software availability/implementation. You do not find GEEs implemented in all software for all (or at least a wide selection) of the cases, where it could be applied. In contrast, a lot of software makes it quite easy to specify the (generalized linear) mixed (effects) model for the same problem (when applicable). As a result mixed model alternatives are quite widely used and people feel familiar with them. A second reason might be that the results of a GEE may need to be interpreted differently than those of a mixed model. (Note: I write "may", because in all the cases I am aware of this is the case, but I cannot exclude the possibility that there are exceptions.) E.g. if you have multiple observations for the same person in an experiment (comparing intervention A vs. B) and account for the correlation of these via a GEE or a GLMM, then the GEE will estimate a population-level effect for the intervention and the GLMM a person-based effect. By this I mean that the GLMM will provide an estimate of "What is the effect of A vs. B has for a person?", while the GEE will give an estimate of "What is the average effect on a population of people with the covariate distribution like in my experiment?". Very often we are more interested in the first question and could also still derive the answer to the second question from the answer to the first one. Thus, one might argue that the GEE approach is not so useful here.
