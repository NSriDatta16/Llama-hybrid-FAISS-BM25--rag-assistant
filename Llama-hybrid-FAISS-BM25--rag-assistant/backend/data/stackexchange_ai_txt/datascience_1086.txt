non query-based document ranking

We have ~500 biomedical documents each of some 1-2 MB. We want to use a non query-based method to rank the documents in order of their unique content score. I'm calling it "unique content" because our researchers want to know from which document to start reading. All the documents are of the same topic, in the biomedical world we know that there is always a lot of content overlap. So all we want to do is to arrange the documents in the order of their unique content. Most Information Retrieval literature suggest query-based ranking which does not fit our need.
