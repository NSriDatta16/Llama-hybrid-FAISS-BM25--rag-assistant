Is not specific for Drupal, but for every PHP setup. More general: for each web-app. I advise you to start with O'Reilly's Building Scalable Websites . See above. For Drupal, note the memory limit; many people just crank it up to rediculous values; after logic: Drupal needs more then 38MB, I'll just give it 250MB, to be safe. Again, see above. For Drupal, pay extra attention to the amount of queries. If you focus on Slow Queries only, you may miss that single tiny query hammering your DB 100+ times per request. Lots. My advice is to start looking at pressflow , an optimised Drupal. It has all the tweaks you are looking for built in. And more. Yes. Many-, but start with memcached . And if you rely on search a lot, consider moving search to SOLR search. Many more tips for starters can be found at Drupal performance Blog
