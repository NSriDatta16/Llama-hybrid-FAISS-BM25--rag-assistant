We went with a very simplistic approach: File Structure: Solution Folder (contains solution file, build scripts, maybe more?) Project Folder Project Folder 2 References (contains shared assemblies for the solution). Then we just check the entire solution folder's contents into our repository. We use one repository for each solution. I'm not sure if this is the optimal way to organize the solution, but it works for us. Also, we branch at the highest level, not per project.
