Multivariate Box Muller

i am reading "machine learning - a probabilistic perspective" by Kevin Murphy - who states the following in the chapter on monte carlo inference. i understand that cov[y] = $\Sigma$, but i do not see why this implies that $y=Lx+\mu$, and why this is equal to multivariate Gaussian sampling. Any hints much appreciated.
