extra-heap program memory consumption as showed by valgrind

My program use a lot of memory. This is what valgrind massif tool is showing me: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- n time(i) total(B) useful-heap(B) extra-heap(B) stacks(B) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28 38,531,086,036 760,235,208 143,002,822 617,232,386 0 As you can see extra part is few times bigger than useful heap. What should I do to reduce this extra memory? Do less allocations? Is this so called memory fragmentation? OS: Linux 2.6. Program is written in C. It should work 24\7 and it manipulate a lot of data.
