Data leakage: Train test split before or after data preprocessing?

A while ago I came across the word "data leakage" for the first time, and after some research, I found that it is a common mistake among data science/machine learning practitioners. But the problem is that most of the data science projects I worked on Kaggle do the train test split after the data preprocessing step, knowing that this might cause the data leakage problem. My question is: as a data scientist should I first do the train test split and then preprocess each set individually, or do the train test split after data preprocessing the whole dataset? Thank you
