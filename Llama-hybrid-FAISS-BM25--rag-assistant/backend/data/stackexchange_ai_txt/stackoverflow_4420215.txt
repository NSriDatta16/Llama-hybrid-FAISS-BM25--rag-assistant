If the web server is currently located on your office LAN, and the access front end applications can use/see the folder where the back end mdb file resides (we're talking windows networking here), then in theory you could expose some of this data to the web server if web server loads and usage rates are not going to be too high. In the case that the server is not going to be on the same Office Network, then an often used an reasonable solution is to simply move the back end data out of access and move it into some database server such as SQL server, or mySQL. When you do this, then both the access application (front end part) thus continue to run and function as before. And now also the web site can also share that data. This so called upsizing process of access data is not hard to do, but you want a competent access developer that knows both SQL server and access, and has done upsize many times. If the developer done this many times then it not a lot of work in most cases to move the data out to a server and keep the existing code investment. So your choices are to keep the access code and database as is, but simply move the data out of access to a server based system. As noted the other alternative is in the case that if your web server is attached to the same network where access data resides, then in theory would be a simple matter to place the access backend data on the same server as the web server. This setup would allow both the locally users on the Office Network, and the web server to share and utilize the data in the access backend file. Another alternative is of course is to have access to connect to a database server your utilizing on the web system, such as MySQL of SQL server. Since access can connect to the database server in this fashion, then again it is theory possible to shuffle data at predetermined times, or even during use to pull data down that's been gathered from the web site into the access application. So you keep Access as is, but connect it to the web part that gathers needed data. Which of the alternative above choices above makes sense will depend on your particular set of circumstances. To really throw a wrench into this mix, access for 2010 can build scalable cloud computing systems where the data is based either on Azure SQL or even 100% web based if you have SharePoint. In fact when you publish an access database to sharepoint now the result is .net XAML (zammel) forms and a scalable system in terms of users. In the following video you'll say that the halfway point I switch to running the access application entirely in a browser: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU4mH0jPntI To do the above access web development, you'll be using SharePoint. However, if your organization does have SharePoint now then this could be a reasonable possibility for you.
