First of all, in Java you don't produce executables (well, you can, but not directly). At run time, the JVM will load whatever is needed for the program to run from a library that is already on the disk, so your executable won't grow. Having a catch-all import merely reduces the need to explicitly list everything you are importing. It's actually often discouraged because that could later create conflicts (e.g., what if you were already obtaining x.y.Foo and now there is also w.v.Foo in your w.f.* import). Some IDEs (such as Eclipse) can fix the latter into the former for you automatically.
