Agile scales fine. It is not a rocket science. In fact it is all about modularity . Software development is a CAS (Complex Adaptive System) and, as almost any CAS, it has modules to rule the complexity better . Scrum of Scrums is one of the possible modular approach for development process scaling. Functional divisions (Developers, QA, etc) is an another modular approach. The worst case is when you do not have modules at all in a large project. Depending on a project nature, team may decide what modules will work for the project. General pattern is to form several teams that work on some low cohesion modules . Each team should be quite autonomous, but interaction with another teams should be good. The analogy from CAS is a human body for example. We have organs like heart and liver. They are separate modules (teams of cells :) that interacts via nervous system/blood/etc.
