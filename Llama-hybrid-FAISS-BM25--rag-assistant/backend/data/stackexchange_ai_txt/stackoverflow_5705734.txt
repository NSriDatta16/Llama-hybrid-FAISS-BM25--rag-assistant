anyone know how to change the size of a Google-Maps-for-Rails map

I have installed the sweet Google-Maps-for-Rails plugin, which seems to be under active development. Right now, I am trying to figure out how to remove the google controls and change the size of the map. There is the start of good documentation here , but I can't find how to do something this simple. I was able to go into the css file and change the width: of the div, but that is fragile and not the way I think the author intended. the function loads: window.onload = function() {Gmaps4Rails.map_options.auto_adjust = true;Gmaps4Rails.initialize();Gmaps4Rails.markers = [{"description": "", "title": "", "sidebar": "","longitude": "-77.0934", "latitude": "38.8115", "picture": "", "width": "", "height": ""} ];Gmaps4Rails.create_markers();} so it seems to be a native option. any help greatly appreciated.
