What is the difference between LabelBinarizer and MultiLabelBinarizer?

I am trying to understand the difference between the two label encoding techniques for output variable. I have read things but still can't get a clear picture as what makes them different. Also can we apply them on independent variables. This is a project I am working on where I have to predict Roles for each observation. There are around 15k unique roles and each output variable has 3-20 combination of roles. This is where the binarizer comes into play. Now when I do this m=MultiLabelBinarizer() ytrain=m.fit_transform(ytrain) yval=m.transform(yval) this is a warning I get but I understand that these labels are not present in my training set also this would avoid leakage but at the same time wouldn't this affect my model's performance.

Any links, modules or answers is appreciated. Thankyou!!
