this has been lost in a barrage of callback functions. Inside your change() handler, store a reference to the list element that originally initiated the event, then later reference it making use of closures. Edit: .fieldSelector and .formSelector are sibings and not parent/child. Since closest starts looking upwards in the hierarchy, it won't find anything. Instead use the siblings method. $('.formSelector').change(function() { var listItem = $(this).siblings(".fieldSelector"); ... $.getJSON(... $.each(... listItem.append(...); ); }); });
