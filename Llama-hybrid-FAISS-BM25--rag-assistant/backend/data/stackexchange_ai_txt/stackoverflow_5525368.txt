"If you can find a way to minimize the cost of transporting massive amounts (possibly gigs) of resources" Actually http already has the minimal cost of transporting gigs of static resources. With its native resource allocation scheme, the URL, it has the ultimate caching abilities. Not only does browsers know how to cache static resources by URL, but fast and efficient proxy servers exists that can handle terrabyte of data. The main secret to this is the HTTP HEAD requeset, where the browser of proxy server efficiently can check if it has the latest version of the resource and re-syncronize it. Also it is possible trough HTTP headers to mark a resource as eternal or very long-living (immutable). re-syncronization will then be impossible, instead updates will be done by creating a new resource with a new name. There is a myth that HTTP is somehow inefficient as a resource transport system, when in fact it have been designed to be very efficient. WoW and other clients that use proprietary protocol are notoriously inefficient compared to HTTP-based clients. These client cannot be accelerated using proxy servers. Windows update, Apt and Yum all have in common that they update OS resources with HTTP and have been able to leverage Akamai:s vast global networks of proxy servers among other similar resources in order to efficiently transfer URL resources in the scale of many gigabytes per client.
