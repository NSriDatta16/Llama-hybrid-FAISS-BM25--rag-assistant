I think what you have done so far is fine; your decision to look into the quasi-variances is correct. We use the quasi-variances as that we care for is the difference between the estimated coefficients. To quote Firth (Sociol. Methodol., 2003): " Quasi standard errors are potentially useful in any situation where contrasts among parameters $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_K$ are of primary or exclusive interest. " The use of a Bradley-Terry model falls squarely in this category as the coefficients $\beta$ are effectively useless without a reference level. The problem : While we can readily estimate the magnitude of the difference $\hat{\beta}_j - \hat{\beta}_k$, getting the associated standard error of this difference is often tricky. Just using the standard idea: $Var(\hat{\beta}_j - \hat{\beta}_k) = (Var(\hat{\beta}_j) + Var(\hat{\beta}_K))^{\frac{1}{2}}$ might be wildly off because these are not uncorrelated estimates; the proper term is: $(Var(\hat{\beta}_j) + Var(\hat{\beta}_K) -2Cov(\hat{\beta}_j, \hat{\beta}_k))^{\frac{1}{2}}$. If we ignore the covariance term, our visualisation would also be problematic as the associated " comparison intervals " would assume uncorrelated samples. Finally even if we assume uncorrelated samples, based on our available information in the lm output we would not be able to estimate the variance associated with the "reference" level. The solution : Calculate some statistics, the quasi-variances, that have the property to behave like the standard errors of $\hat{\beta}_j$ and $\hat{\beta}_k$ are uncorrelated. To estimate the quasi-variances, we use the estimated variance-covariance matrix. In particular, the main idea is to formulate a generalised linear model $M$ with exponential link where the response $y$ is the true standard error ($Var(\hat{\beta}_j - \hat{\beta}_k)$), the covariates $X$ correspond to the variance contrasts between the levels of the factor we are interested in and MLE estimates $\theta$ (the $\beta$'s in this model $M$) are the quasi-variances. Given these $\theta$s we can immediately get the associated standard error for the difference $\hat{\beta}_j - \hat{\beta}_k$ ignoring any covariance terms by using $( \theta_j + \theta_k)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ as the approximate standard error. OK, to put some numbers on all of these. Reminder: estimate SE quasiSE quasiVar 1 0.000000 0.0000000 0.3657419 0.13376715 ... 4 1.489221 0.5861939 0.5199500 0.27034804 The difference $\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_4$ is $-1.489$. If we just ignore the covariance and use the standard errors of these estimates we get ... nothing comprehensible because $\beta_1$ is known to be $0$. We could argue that the standard error is $(0 + 0.586^2)^{0.5} \approx 0.586$; to do that we would have to assume that the variance of $\beta_1 =0$ is a plausible thing and that $\beta_1$ does not covary with $\beta_4$. Both assumptions seem implausible so let's move on. Using the quasi-variances we have $(0.13376715 + 0.27034804)^{0.5}$ $\approx$ $0.636$ as our quasi-standard error. This suggests that it is plausible that $\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_4$ is significantly different than $0$. David Firth has two accessible (and aptly named) papers on the matter: Overcoming the Reference Category Problem in the Presentation of Statistical Models in Sociological Methodology (2003) and Quasi-variances (with De Menezes) in Biometrika (2004). I would suggest you look at both papers as they are generally easily to follow and cover all the relevant details. I would start with the Sociol. Methodol. paper first and use the Biometrika to fill in any gaps in my understanding. Finally, regarding your particular sub-questions: As mentioned, what you did seems fine. Based on the graph and the SE of the differences, the two supplements are probably different in a statistically significant way. Once more, notice that the parameter $\beta_1$ is 0 by convention for the purposes of estimation; try setting $\beta_8$ as your reference level and see what happens. In any case, go ahead and calculate the quasi-standard errors to convince yourself and your readers. :) Yes, the " quasi-variances-thing " is indeed the best way to infer if the difference between the two supplements is significant. Do not get discouraged immediately if the "comparison intervals" slightly overlap, there may still be a statistically significant difference between the means of the two samples (as here).
