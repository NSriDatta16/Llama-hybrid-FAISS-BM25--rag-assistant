Generally the answer is no because Smalltalk is not just a language, it's the environment too, including the changes that you make to it. You could translate it into a more static kind of system with a framework rather than a universe of live objects, but it would be a different thing. NeXTSTEP and thus Cocoa essentially did this. So the answer could be "sure, it's called Objective-C." EDIT: All that said, see Logan's reference to GNU Smalltalk.
