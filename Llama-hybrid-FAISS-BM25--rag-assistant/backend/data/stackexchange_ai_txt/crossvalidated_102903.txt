Are explanatory variables considered random in PCA?

One of properties of PCA states that the sum of the variances of the principal components is equal to the sum of the variances of the explanatory variables. I wonder how to interpret this as I've always thought that we do not consider $X$'s as random variables. I'm quite new to probability theory and I need to get it straight: are explanatory variables random variables (or do we consider them fixed)? And if we don't consider them random, how is it possible to apply the variance operator to a variable that is not stochastic?
