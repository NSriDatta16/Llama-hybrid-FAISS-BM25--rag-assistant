time taken to upload a picture of 1M ~ 5M from iPhone to either Google AE or Amazon S3

Has anyone done some experiment on this? how about a 640 x 480 image? It'll be really bad user experience if it takes more then a couple seconds - as I am thinking about enabling user to take a photo and then upload it to either GAE or S3 from inside the iPhone app that I am providing. By saying that, is there an end-2-end example out that to showcase the flow? either from iPhone App to S3 or from iPhone App to GAE. So far I heard is that S3 is greate for storage, but at the same time there is no straightforward solution to solve the problem from end-2-end (iPhone to S3), is that true? As my web service is hosted on GAE. The follow that I am thinking about is iPhone -> S3 with the pictures, then then iPhone->GAE with the urls to the pictures. is that achievable? is there a better solution then that and could be achived in a short time?
