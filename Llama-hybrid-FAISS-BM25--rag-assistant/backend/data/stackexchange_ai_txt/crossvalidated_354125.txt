Minimum number of observations per group in a prediction model

I ran a univariate logistic regression analysis on some risk factors for a dichotomous outcome. One of the variables is highly significant, but only has 5 outcomes in one of the groups. The confidence interval ends up being very wide when I run a multivariable regression. Is it appropriate to include it, or should I remove it from the multivariable model?
