In my view, a more correct frequentist analysis would be as follows: H0: The sun has exploded and the machine is telling the truth. H1: The sun has not exploded and the machine is lying. The p value here is = P(sun exploded) . p(machine is telling the truth) = 0.97 . P(sun exploded) The statistician can not conclude anything without knowing the nature of the second probability. Although we know that P(sun exploded) is 0, because sun like stars do not explode into supernovae.
