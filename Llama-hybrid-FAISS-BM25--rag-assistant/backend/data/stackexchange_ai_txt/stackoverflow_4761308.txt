Memory conscious string filtering

Lets say I have 500 words: Martin Hopa Dunam Golap Hugnog Foo ... + 494 more words I have following text that is about 85KB in total: Marting went and got him self stuff from Hopa store and now he is looking to put it into storage with his best friend Dunam . They are planing on using Golap lock that they found in Hugnog shop in Foo town. >... text continues into several pages I would like to produce following text: ------- went and got him self stuff from ---- store and now he is looking to put it into storage with his best friend ---- . They are planing on using ---- lock that they found in ------ shop in --- town. >... text continues into several pages Currently I'm using commons method: String[] 500words = //all 500 words String[] maskFor500words = // generated mask for each word String filteredText = StringUtils.replaceEach(textToBeFiltered, 500words , maskFor500words); Is there a another way to do this that could be more efficient when it comes to memory and CPU usage? What is the best storage for the 500 words? File, List, enum, array ...? How would you get statistics, such as how many and what words were replaced; and for each word how many times it was replaced.
