Data science tools for easing the participation of a business into their scoring system

I'm a working in a small company. The company sells products on a website and they have a python script that runs everyday to attribute a score to each product based on a set of parameters (google analytics events, similar products popularity, price, etc). The problem is that the scoring outcome is not satisfying, and requiring developers to edit this script arbitrarily, based on business people assumptions, is time consuming and not a proper way to achieve what the business needs. The ideal solution in my point of view, would be to provide the business team a way to act on the scoring logic in a GUI, integrate what they could come up with, and display the immediate result of applied modifications so they can iterate until they find the right model. In your experience, what kind of tool/service/library could easily allow non tech users to input formulas on a set of data, which could be synced and integrated in a python script ?
