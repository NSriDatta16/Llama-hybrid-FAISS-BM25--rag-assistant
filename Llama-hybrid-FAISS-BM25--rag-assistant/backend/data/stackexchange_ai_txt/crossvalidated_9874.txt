Always check the assumptions for the statistical test you're using! One of the assumptions of logistic regression is independence of errors which means that cases of data should not be related. Eg. you can't measure the same people at different points in time which I fear you may have done with your anger management surveys. I would also be worried that with 2 anger management surveys you're basically measuring the same thing and your analysis could suffer from multicollinearity.
