The nonlinear dependencies you describe are Mercer kernels. A valid kernel is any function taking two observations that is continuous, symmetric and has a positive definite gram matrix. Gram and covariance are interchangeable in this context. The observations needn't be fixed-length vectors. They could be graphs, strings, variable-length time-series or any other object with which you can endow with a distance function. Some common kernels are given here , by the author of a C# Machine Learning library. Any supervised or unsupervised algorithm expecting a design matrix can be kernelized. Linear least-squares can learn the sine function with an appropriate kernel. Kernel PCA is well studied. A popular kernel for nonlinearizing PCA or OLS is the Gaussian Kernel, sometimes called the Radial Basis Function. $X_{ij} = exp({\frac{-||x_i - x_j||^2} {2\sigma^2}}$) The parameter $\sigma$ intuitively controls how fast the importance of that comparison drops off with distance. A revolutionary algorithm for clustering small data sets defined in the paper On Spectral Clustering , is RBF Kernel PCA followed by one of the oldest clustering algorithms called K-Means. One issue with kernels is that their explicit computation can be prohibitive for larger datasets. Indeed one of the best performing nonlinear classifiers, Support Vector Machines, scale with the algorithmic complexity of evaluating the Gram matrix. To get around this a number of sampling techniques have been proposed to reduce your ultimate design matrix from $N \times N$ to $N \times B$, where $N$ is the number of observations and $B$ is a smaller basis s.t. your final covariance matrix $X X^T$ is similar. This is conceptually related to a low-rank approximation that might be performed PCA. Some are kernel specific, while others are general. A simple and effective algorithm is to use Nystroem sampling on the cluster centers of k-means++ as in Improved Nystroem Low-Rank Approximation and Error Analysis
