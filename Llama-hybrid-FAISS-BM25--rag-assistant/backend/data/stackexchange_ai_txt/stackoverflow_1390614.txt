conditionally creating criteria nhibernate

Say I have a users table and a countries table, something like: tblUsers int UserId int UserCountry tblCountries int CountryId string CountryName and have the mappings etc appropriately organized for each. How would create a query to retrieve all users from a list of countries, if I had something like List EligibleCountries? Something like: DetachedCriteria query = DetachedCriteria.For (); for(int i = 0; i Wont work because a users only in one country and that would be checking to see if they're in all countries... I tried using Restrictions.In but that didn't seem to work the way I wanted. How can I do it so that it will retrieve users so long as they are in one of the countries in the eligible countries list?
