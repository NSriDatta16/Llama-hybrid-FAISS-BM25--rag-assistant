Can't add resources to visual C# 2008 express?

I'm trying to add an image to the resource area of my application and not having very good luck. Is this broken in C# express? I've tried: Add image to project using 'Add->Existing Item'. I have marked it as 'content', 'resource', and 'embedded resource' and nothing works. here's the c# code: ResourceManager oResource = new ResourceManager("MyApp.images", Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); oResource.IgnoreCase = true; m_oBedState = (Bitmap)oResource.GetObject("MyImage.bmp"); I tried opening the resource1.resx file in the project and adding it there. Still can't find it. Also, what's up with the auto created resource1.designer.cs?? Why do I need code here? I'm embedding a binary file in the resource area. It doesn't require more code bloat. I don't need "no steenkin' badges" ;)
