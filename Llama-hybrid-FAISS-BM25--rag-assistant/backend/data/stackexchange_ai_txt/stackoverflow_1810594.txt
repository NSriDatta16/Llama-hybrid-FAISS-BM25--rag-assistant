You should look into closures . Try the following code: makeDraggable : function() { // create new draggable for (var i = 0, l = fSel.sI.length, sI = fSel.sI; i Your problem is with the start , drag , and stop functions. They don't execute immediately; by the time they do, mydrag has been set to another value. By wrapping a self-executing function around the code block containing these functions, we create a closure, where mydrag doesn't change. Note: For performance reasons, when accessing properties of an object more than once, it's best to create a variable that references (or holds) the property. In your for loop, I've created two variables l and sI that store fSel.sI.length and fSel.sI (respectively) so that JavaScript doesn't have to look up the sI and length properties every time around the loop.
