Firefox 3.6 (Gecko 1.9.2) doesn't implement these properties (the specification was changing and most other browsers at the time didn't implement these properties either). This is fixed in Firefox 4 (Gecko 2). See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=501423 [edit] your testcase is a single-page. The spec says: When the setItem(), removeItem(), and clear() methods are called on a Storage object x that is associated with a local storage area, if the methods did something, then in every HTMLDocument object whose Window object's localStorage attribute's Storage object is associated with the same storage area, other than x , a storage event must be fired, as described below. So you need a separate page on the same domain to observe the event.
