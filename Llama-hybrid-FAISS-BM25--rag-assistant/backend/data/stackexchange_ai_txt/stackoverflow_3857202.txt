Cross-Platform Building, Standard Directory Structures, Environment Variables

I've started using CMake as a build tool for a cross-platform command line program that requires FFTW3 and Boost.Format. I'm familiar with the Unix-like standard directory structures for headers and binaries of installed libraries but I'm wondering what the quasi standard is on Windows platforms as to how and where libraries are installed, organized, etc. Are there any quasi standard environment variables I could use in my CMakeLists.txt / FindXXX.cmake scripts for finding libraries? Where should I put the FFTW3 headers and binaries on a Windows platform? Does it make sense to install something like pkg-config on a Windows box? Obviously, I don't want to hard-code the libraries' paths so it just works on my Windows box with exactly the same directory structure. TIA, sellibitze
