How to call same method for a list of objects?

Suppose code like this: class Base: def start(self): pass def stop(self) pass class A(Base): def start(self): ... do something for A def stop(self) .... do something for A class B(Base): def start(self): def stop(self): a1 = A(); a2 = A() b1 = B(); b2 = B() all = [a1, b1, b2, a2,.....] Now I want to call methods start and stop (maybe also others) for each object in the list all. Is there any elegant way for doing this except of writing a bunch of functions like def start_all(all): for item in all: item.start() def stop_all(all):
