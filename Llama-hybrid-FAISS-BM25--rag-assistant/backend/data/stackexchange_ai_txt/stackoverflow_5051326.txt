Single query "radio button" selection behaviour with UPDATE

I am using MS SQL CE 3.5 in an desktop application (Windows Forms C# 4) and is unlikely to change database. I sometimes hit a brick wall in the more limited SQL syntax of Compact Edition. Currently I need two queries but would like to join them into one: UPDATE manganames SET display=0 WHERE id=@id AND display=1 UPDATE manganames SET display=1 WHERE id=@id AND name=@name display is datatype BIT Thank you, my question was brief rather than completely clear Final query follows UPDATE manganames SET display = CASE WHEN name=@name THEN 1 ELSE 0 END WHERE id=@id PS My stackoverflow formating skills sucks.
