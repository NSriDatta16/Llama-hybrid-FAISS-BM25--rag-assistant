Representing missing data in an OpenOffice spreadsheet

I'm doing a time series analysis. I'm doing most of my analysis in R, where I can use "NA" to represent "not available" (e.g. a missing data point). But I'm doing some data preparation in OpenOffice; currently, I'm leaving cells blank for missing data. Is there a better way to "declare" that a cell is NA?
