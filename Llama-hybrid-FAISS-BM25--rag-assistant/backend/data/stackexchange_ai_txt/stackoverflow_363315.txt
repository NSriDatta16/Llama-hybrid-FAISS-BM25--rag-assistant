not yet, still skeptical; like most microsoft products, i wait for SP2 or a year and a half before trusting them in a producton environment and note that pretty much every new thing introduced by anyone, not just microsoft, is hailed as "lightweight, fast and easy" - take it with a block of salt. They do not advertise the problems/issues quite as loudly as the benefits/features! That's why we wait for early adopters to discover them. This is not to disparage ORM or LINQ or anything like that; I'm reserving judgement until I have time to evaluate them, some need arises that only they can satisfy, the technology appears stable and well-supported enough to risk in one of my clients' production environments, and/or a client requests it Please note: I've done ORM before, manually, and it worked just fine, so I have high hopes for the newer ORM systems.
