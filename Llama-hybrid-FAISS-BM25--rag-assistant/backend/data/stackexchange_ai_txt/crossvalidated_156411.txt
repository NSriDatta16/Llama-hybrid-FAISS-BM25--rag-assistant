In terms of scholary articles I co-wrote a paper http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/news/131-102706-white-paper-on-cannibalization-qtesting-market-hypothesisq-by-john-c-pickett-david-p-reilly-view on this thorny subject which was subsequently printed by the International Business Forecasting Journal. Time series procedures (ARIMA , Transfer Function) were used to examine sales from two Staples stores and to test the hypothesis that sales for the new store cannibalized sales from the old store OR actually improved sales due to enhanced brand awareness.
