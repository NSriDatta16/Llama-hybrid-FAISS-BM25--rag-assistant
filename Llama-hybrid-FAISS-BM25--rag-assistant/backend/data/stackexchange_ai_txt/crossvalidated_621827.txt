Is it correct to use the posterior distribution from a Bayesian model in other analysis?

I have written a Bayesian model in JAGS that I use to calculate the growth rates of several plant populations as well as their variance while taking into account the observation error during the sampling process. It works well and now I would like to test if those growth rates differ between populations in different habitats or with different conservation status. So far I have used the median of the posterior distributions as a point estimate for the growth rate and variance of each population but I feel that I am loosing a lot of useful information by not considering the whole posterior distribution of those parameters. So, is it correct if I use all or all values from the posterior distributions in other analysis like ANOVA? Edit for context and clarity: My objective is to calculate the growth rates and the variance of those growth rates for about 300 plant populations. My data is the annual count of individuals, so I have one value for each year and population. In addition, and this is really the part that interest me more and the reason for using Bayesian inference, I have measured the observation error en each of those populations by counting twice some years. I am using the variance between each count as a measure of that observation error. This forces me to run the model separately for each population, so I end up with 300 different model results, each one with its own posteriors for the growth rate and its variance. So far, this works as intended, but now I would like to test if there are differences in those growth rates between populations living in different habitats, for example, those living in grasslands vs forests. So far what I have tried doing was taking the median of each posterior as a point estimate for that parameter and compare it between habitats using frequentist ANOVA but I am aware that by doing this I am loosing a lot of the information that I get from the Bayesian approach so I was thinking about using the whole posterior, or maybe just a few thousand samples from it as the data for that ANOVA.
