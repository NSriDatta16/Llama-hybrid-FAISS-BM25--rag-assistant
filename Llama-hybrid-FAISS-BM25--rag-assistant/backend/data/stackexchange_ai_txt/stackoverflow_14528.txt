I've evaluated the Telerik grid as well as Infragistics version. In the end we took an approach similar to what tags2k suggested. We just wrote our own javascript and called .Net PageMethods to do the server side work. We found both of the "out of the box" solutions to be bloated. Unless you put paging in at like 20 records per row they really stunk performance wise.
