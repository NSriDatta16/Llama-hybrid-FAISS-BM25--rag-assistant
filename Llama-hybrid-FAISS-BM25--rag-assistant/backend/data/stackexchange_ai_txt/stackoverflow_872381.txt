You're biggest problem isn't the table scan. Your two biggest problems are: You have an absolutely useless query running 100's of times per minute against your database. My guess BTW, is that the query is actually trying to get the column names from the table as Marc Gravell suggests. and more importantly: You don't have control over who or what is accessing your database. That second problem especially is going to most likely cause you endless headaches. Assuming that you are part of the data team in your organization (since you're the one trying to solve this problem), you really should be looking to make the organizational changes necessary to do your job. Good luck!
