You should rewrite the return snippet like so: User user = Persons.FindPerson(users, id) as User; if (user != null) return user; The problem you were having was to do with you trying to return a base class from a method that should return a more derived class. The compiler cannot automatically downcast( Persons -> User ), but it can upcast ( User -> Persons )
