HTML Parsing Error

I can't find out what the problem is, and why I keep receiving this error in Internet Explorer 8, as it's the only error that I am receiving. Any thoughts as to what it means, or a simple solution? I haven't noticed any problems with my code though, it's just the message that bugs me. Webpage error details. User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Timestamp: Mon, 7 Sep 2009 19:11:13 UTC Message: HTML Parsing Error: Unable to modify the parent container element before the child element is closed (KB927917) Line: 0 Char: 0 Code: 0
