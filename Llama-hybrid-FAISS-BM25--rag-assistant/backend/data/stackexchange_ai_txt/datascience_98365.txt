Is Random forest regression is a good method to approach this problem? Overall, decision trees tend not to be good regressors. But it can be that for your case it is working well. You need to evaluate the results corresponding to a metric and then compare different models. I like MAE in regression models because it's very intuitive. How can I improve the model results? Note that decision trees don't need values to be scaled to perform well. Consider Make sure you have meaningful features in the model. Try different models with different hypeparameters. If you have categorical features, use https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/ How to interpret the results from the outcome If you have not scaled the target. And you are measuring MAE. Let's say your MAE = 2. Then the mean error in your prediction is 2 passengers.
