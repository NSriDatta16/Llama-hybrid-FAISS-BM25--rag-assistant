If this is for a legacy COM project, you'll probably want to follow Microsoft's Hungarian Notation specifications , which are documented on MSDN. Note that this is Apps Hungarian, i.e. the "good" kind of Hungarian Notation . Systems Hungarian is the "bad" kind, where names are prefixed with their compiler types, e.g. i for int . Tables from the MSDN article Table 1. Some examples for procedure names Name Description InitSy Takes an sy as its argument and initializes it. OpenFn fn is the argument. The procedure will "open" the fn. No value is returned. FcFromBnRn Returns the fc corresponding to the bn,rn pair given. (The names cannot tell us what the types sy, fn, fc, and so on, are.) The following is a list of standard type constructions. (X and Y stand for arbitrary tags. According to standard punctuation, the actual tags are lowercase.) Table 2. Standard type constructions pX Pointer to X. dX Difference between two instances of type X. X + dX is of type X. cX Count of instances of type X. mpXY An array of Ys indexed by X. Read as "map from X to Y." rgX An array of Xs. Read as "range X." The indices of the array are called: iX index of the array rgX. dnX (rare) An array indexed by type X. The elements of the array are called: eX (rare) Element of the array dnX. grpX A group of Xs stored one after another in storage. Used when the X elements are of variable size and standard array indexing would not apply. Elements of the group must be referenced by means other then direct indexing. A storage allocation zone, for example, is a grp of blocks. bX Relative offset to a type X. This is used for field displacements in a data structure with variable size fields. The offset may be given in terms of bytes or words, depending on the base pointer from which the offset is measured. cbX Size of instances of X in bytes. cwX Size of instances of X in words. The following are standard qualifiers. (The letter X stands for any type tag. Actual type tags are in lowercase.) Table 3. Standard qualifiers XFirst The first element in an ordered set (interval) of X values. XLast The last element in an ordered set of X values. XLast is the upper limit of a closed interval, hence the loop continuation condition should be: X Table 4. Some common primitive types f Flag (Boolean, logical). If qualifier is used, it should describe the true state of the flag. Exception: the constants fTrue and fFalse. w Word with arbitrary contents. ch Character, usually in ASCII text. b Byte, not necessarily holding a coded character, more akin to w. Distinguished from the b constructor by the capital letter of the qualifier in immediately following. sz Pointer to first character of a zero terminated string. st Pointer to a string. First byte is the count of characters cch. h pp (in heap).
