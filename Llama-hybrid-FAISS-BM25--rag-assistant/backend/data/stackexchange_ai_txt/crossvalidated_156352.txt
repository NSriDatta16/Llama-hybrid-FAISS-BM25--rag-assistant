To complete the answer of Glen_b and his/her example on random walks, if you really want to use Pearson correlation on this kind of time series $(S_t)_{1 \leq t \leq T}$, you should first differentiate them, then work out the correlation coefficient on the increments ($X_t = S_t - S_{t-1}$) which are (in the case of random walks) independent and identically distributed. I suggest you to use the Spearman correlation or the Kendall one, as they are more robust than the Pearson coefficient. Pearson measures linear dependence whereas Spearman and Kendall measure are invariant by monotonous transforms of your variables. Also, imagine that two time series are strongly dependent, say moves up together and goes down together, but one undergoing sometimes strong variations and the other one having always mild variations, your Pearson correlation will be rather low unlike the Spearman and Kendall ones (which are better estimates of dependence between your time series). For a thorough treatment on this and a better understand of dependency, you can look at Copula Theory , and for an application to time series .
