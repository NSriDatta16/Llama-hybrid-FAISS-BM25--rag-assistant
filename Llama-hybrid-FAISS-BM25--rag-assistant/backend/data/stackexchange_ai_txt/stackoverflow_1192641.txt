Major Project Suggestion

I'm in the final year of computer science and engineering. I'm looking for ideas about a year long project,which is of great importance in my curriculum. So, I'm looking for a topic,that is not very simple but which can be implemented within a year. My interests are Data Mining Distributed Computing Data Structures and Algorithms Neural Networks Also, I'm open to suggestions regarding the same for any other field that could be of value to me, as I'm interested in higher studies post my bachelor's degree. I want to improve my coding skills , so I'm interested in doing the implementation in C++/Java. Please help me with some advice.
