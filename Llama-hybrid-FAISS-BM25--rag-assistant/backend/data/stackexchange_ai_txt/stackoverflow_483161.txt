To complete aku's answer , you have here different methods to have a "multilingual use in Vista". Installing a language pack Switching to a different language (and back) Creating computer users . Create a user for each language and change the display language for that user to the language of your preference. A new Speech profile will be automatically created for that user. Switch between your languages by the normal procedure of “switching to another user” (Log offà Switch users). Note: You can create a speech recognition profile for each user with any name you prefer. Change the name, or create a new user, in the Advanced Speech panel. COMMENTS: The advantage of the Separate Users method is that you can switch back and forth without changing any computer defaults . The disadvantages are that it takes more disk space and more attention must be given to user management, and that you may not have access to files opened or saved by your other users unless you know how to give yourself such an access via the new permission dialogues of Windows Vista.
