How to force QDateTime::fromString to read UTC time

I have some input containing UTC time formatted according to iso8601. I try to parse it using QDateTime: const char* s = "2009-11-05T03:54:00"; d.setTimeSpec(Qt::UTC); d = QDateTime::fromString(s, Qt::ISODate); Qt::TimeSpec ts = d.timeSpec(); When this fragment ends, ts is set to localTime and d contains 3 hours 54 minutes. Does anyone know how to read the date properly?
