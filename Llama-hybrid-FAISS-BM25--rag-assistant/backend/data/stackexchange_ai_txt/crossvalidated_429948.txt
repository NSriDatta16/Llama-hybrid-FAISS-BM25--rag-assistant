This is the mode-collapse problem. There are a few ways to tackle this Use mode-collapse avoiding techniques for GAN models. For example Diversity-Sensitive Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Use conditional generative models which explicitly maximize likelihood (VAEs, flows, autoregressive, etc), because they tend to be less vulnerable to this problem.
