Because you want to do activity recognition based on time windows using deep learning models with autoencoders I would strongly suggest to have a look at the following articles: This gives an overview of a custom CNN/RNN model which might give an initial idea of how to proceed for the specific task of AR. and This gives a general idea of how to reconstruct sensor data with semantic meanings before feeding the constructed data features to another model.
