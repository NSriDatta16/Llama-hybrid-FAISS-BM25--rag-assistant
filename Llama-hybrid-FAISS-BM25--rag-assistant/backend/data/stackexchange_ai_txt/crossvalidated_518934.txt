There is no difference. Both are correct (as can be seen by the fact that the outputs are the same). One treats the data as 10 Bernoulli data and the other treats them as 2 binomial data constituting, collectively, 10 Bernoulli trials . Update: The question seems to be about which residual df is correct to use to assess the possibility of overdispersion. Overdispersion doesn't really apply for Bernoulli data (see: Overdispersion in logistic regression ). It does potentially apply to binomial data that really are binomial. This was a canned example and it's not clear whether it is more correct to consider these data as Bernoulli or binomial. Overdispersion also doesn't apply with only one categorical regressor (in this case, Exposed ). Even with a continuous $X$ and binomial data, inferring overdispersion can be ambiguous, it may just be that polynomial or interaction terms are needed (cf., Test logistic regression model using residual deviance and degrees of freedom , and Understanding lack of fit in logistic regression ).
