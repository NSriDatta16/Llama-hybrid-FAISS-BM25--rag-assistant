How do you resolve issues with named pipes?

I have a binary program* which takes the contents of a supplied file, processes it, and prints the result on the screen through stdout. For an automation script, I would like to use a named pipe to send data to this program and process the output myself. After trying to get the script to work I realized that there is an issue with the binary program accepting data from the named pipe. To illustrate the problem I have outlined several tests using the unix shell. It is easy to show that the program works by processing an actual data file. $ binprog file.txt > output.txt This will result in output.txt containing the processed information from file.txt. The named pipe (pipe.txt) works as seen by this demonstration. $ cat pipe.txt > output.txt $ cat file.txt > pipe.txt This will result in output.txt containing the data from file.txt after it has been sent through the pipe. When the binary program is reading from the named pipe instead of the file, things do not work correctly. $ binprog pipe.txt > output.txt $ cat file.txt > pipe.txt In this case output.txt contains no data even after cat and binprog terminate. Using top and ps, I can see binprog "running" and seemingly doing work. Everything executes with no errors. Why is there no output produced by binprog in this third example? What are some things I could try to get this working? [*] The program in question is svm-scale from libsvm . I chose to generalize the examples to keep them clean and simple.
