Data centering for logistic regression estimation

I read in some articles that we can use data centering as per-process of logistic regression. Centering is $X-Mean(X)$ for every value of $X$ input? What is interpretation of coefficients in this situation? Can we use $(abs(X-Mean(X)))/STD(X)$? What is interpretation of coefficients in this situation? Which one is better for logistic regression? I have financial ratios as inputs (highly correlated inputs).
