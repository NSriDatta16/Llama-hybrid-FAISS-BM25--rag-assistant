2 is not a valid ENUM element. It's as simple as that. The reason it works in raw MySQL when you do lang = 2 , is that it's exposing the underlying storage mechanism for the list (basically it's just a normalized value, but the normalization is hid from you by the ENUM column). I'd suggest not trying to do this. MySQL hides the implementation for a reason. Realize that using 2 for the comparison is nothing more than a magic number ...
