PCA: When using eigendecompostion instead of single value decompostion

If you want to perform a PCA, I guess that using SVD will always work. Eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix only works when your data is not high dimensional(so n > p). But I'm wonder if there are circumstances in practice where you would prefer eigendecompostion over SVD?
