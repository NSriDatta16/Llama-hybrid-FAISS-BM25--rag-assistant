You can use a logistic regression, which I think here is a more direct and more directly interpretable solution. The size of class $i$ , $N_i$ , is not in itself informative about proportion from different ethnic groups. At least not when $x_i$ , the number of non-white students, is known. So by conditioning on $N_i$ we can assume that $x_i \mid N_i \sim \mathcal{Binom}(N_i, p_i)$ is binomial. Now you can model $p_i$ as depending on covariates, in your case the type of school, IB or non-IB. That can be represented as a factor variable with two levels. Using R this could be coded as mod0 Here we assume the data frame has one row for each school class. If you have more covariates the model can be extended. For instance, if you have multiple classes within schools, you can use lme4 with mixed models to extend this to a multilevel model. One thing to be aware of is that in this binomial case there might be overdispersion , so maybe try family=quasibinomial . Another advantage with binomial regression in this case is that you can extend it (with multinomial logistic regression) to diversity with more than two ethnic groups. A completely different way to attack your problem, it to measure diversity directly. You can check the tag diversity
