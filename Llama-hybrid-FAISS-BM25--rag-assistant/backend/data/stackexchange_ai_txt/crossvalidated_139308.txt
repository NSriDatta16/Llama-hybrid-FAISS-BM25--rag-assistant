I am posting an answer for the two cases "square of sum of Nakagami" and "sum of squares of Nakagami" Case 1: Square of sum I would use the following approach here: Find the pdf of $X = ah$, which is Nakagami. Find the pdf of $Z = \sum_i X_i$ using the approximation presented in this reference: J. C. S. S. Filho, M. D. Yacoub, "Nakagami-m approximation to the sum of M non-identical independent Nakagami-m variates." Electronics Letters 40.15 (2004): 951-952. Finally, find the pdf of $Y = |Z|^2$ where $Z$ is a Nakagami random variable. Drawback: This reference is behind a paywall, so I was not able to copy the approximation here. Case 2: Sum of squares I believe the paper by Karagiannidis, Sagias, Tsiftsis (2006) has the formula for this case. You can find it in page 2. The formula is a bit complex. I am putting the screenshots of the section where it is presented.
