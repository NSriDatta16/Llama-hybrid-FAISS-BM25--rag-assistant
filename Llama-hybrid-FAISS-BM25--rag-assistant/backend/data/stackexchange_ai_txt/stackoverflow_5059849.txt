Doing this well is not easy. Google would love to be able to do such things ("What links will the user value"), as would Netflix ("What movies will they value") and many others. In fact, you'd probably do well to read through the notes about the winning entry for the Netflix Prize . Then you need to extract a bunch of features, as @hmason says. And then you need an appropriate machine learning algorithm; you either need a function approximator (where you try to use your features to predict a value between, say, 0 and 1, where 1 is "best tweet ever" and 0 is "omg who cares") or a classifier (where you use your features to try to predict whether it's a "good" or "bad" tweet). If you go for the latter--which makes user-training easy, since they just have to score tweets with "like" (to mix social network metaphors)--then you typically do best with support vector machines, for which there exists a fairly comprehensive Java library . In the former case, there are a variety of techniques that might be worth trying; if you decide to use the LIBSVM library, they have variants for regression (i.e. parameter estimation) as well.
