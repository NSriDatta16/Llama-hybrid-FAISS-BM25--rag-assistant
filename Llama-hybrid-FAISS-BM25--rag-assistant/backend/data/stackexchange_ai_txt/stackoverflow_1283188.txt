JNLP doesn't show splash screen when launching from a desktop icon

I have been able to create a JNLP file, which successfully sets up a splash screen & a desktop icon for a Java program launched through Web Start. Here's the relevant chunk of the JNLP: Now, to launch the program, I find I can either click on the JNLP, in which case the splash screen shows, or on the desktop icon, in which case the default Java Web Start splash screen shows instead. This is on Windows XP & Windows Vista, and it's Java 1.5 and Java 1.6. Is there a way to get my splash screen to show when launching from the JNLP file, instead of the Java one? Thanks.
