Unable to Checkout with Large Number of Items (200+) in Shopping Cart - Magento 1.4.2

I've set up a B2B site powered by Magento 1.4.2 community edition. Occasionally, customers are trying to checkout with a large number of items in their shopping cart - up to 250! My issues are twofold: When there are that many items in the cart, simple navigation through the site becomes extremely slow for the user. On the OnePage checkout, when they get around to submitting the order, they get a javascript popup simply stating "undefined" and they remain on the onepage checkout page. Does anyone have any similar experience in dealing with this type of issue? I've tried to implement memcached as well as full page caching hoping that it would help alleviate some of the stress off the server but it hasn't been effective in solving this issue.
