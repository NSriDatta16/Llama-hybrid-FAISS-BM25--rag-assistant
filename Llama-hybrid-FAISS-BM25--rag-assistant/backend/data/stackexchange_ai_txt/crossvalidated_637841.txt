How appropriate is this logistic regression analysis?

I am reviewing this study where they measured fathers' stress, anxiety and depression levels at four-time points. And they measured the child's behavioural problems only at the last time. They then created dichotomous variables from this data (whether there was or wasn't stress, depression, anxiety or behavioural issues). They created logistic models using the children's measure as the dependent variable and the father's measures as the independent. They created a model for each timepoint the father's distress measures were taken. For each model, they then created another model adjusting for age, sex, father's age ... Finally, they created a stepwise log regression with all fathers' and mothers' distress variables from all the time points to predict the children's behavioural problems. I question whether you consider using a log regression appropriate with this data and whether they should have used one model with multilevel variables for stress, depression, and anxiety levels for each time point. Also, in total, they did around ten models or so, given that they made different ones for each time point for each distress measure and then a combination of them. Should they correct for multiple comparisons, or do you think this might not be necessary in this case?
