you need to specify what you're testing for, otherwise benchmarks will only mislead. There are different aspects of IO performance that you need to chose to optimize for, and different parameters to play with. Your system parameters: storage device: HDD, SSD (which?), Raid (which?) filesystem, block size, journal mode file cache, dirty thresholds, amount of memory IO scheduler, its tunables number of CPUs kernel version Your test parameters: read or write performance? sequential or random? 1 thread or multiple? size of requests optimize for throughput or request delay?
