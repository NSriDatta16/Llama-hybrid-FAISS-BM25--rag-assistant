HTTP Post From ActiveMQ using Camel

We're using camel routes to post values from a queue to an http endpoint. I've successfully set up the route using camel's http component , but I'm unable to get the body of the jms message to post. For example, my route is set up like this: POST Which results in a POST, but the message body does not show up in my POST string (as print_r'd from $_SERVER): Array ( [instance] => local [HTTP_JMSDELIVERYMODE] => 1 [HTTP_JMSDESTINATION] => queue://test [HTTP_JMSEXPIRATION] => 0 [HTTP_JMSTYPE] => [HTTP_JMSTIMESTAMP] => 1291468702773 [HTTP_JMSPRIORITY] => 0 [HTTP_JMSCORRELATIONID] => [HTTP_JMSMESSAGEID] => ID:new-host-3.home-62248-1291465669089-4:3:1:1:4 [HTTP_JMSREDELIVERED] => false [HTTP_USER_AGENT] => Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1 [HTTP_HOST] => localhost [HTTP_COOKIE] => $Version=0; PHPSESSID=32aa692c71e1003f2e540c1b80c3b363; $Path=/ [CONTENT_LENGTH] => 44 [CONTENT_TYPE] => text/html [PATH] => /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin [SERVER_SIGNATURE] => Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) PHP/5.2.6 DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.0.59 OpenSSL/0.9.7l Server at localhost Port 80 [SERVER_SOFTWARE] => Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) PHP/5.2.6 DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.0.59 OpenSSL/0.9.7l [SERVER_NAME] => localhost [SERVER_ADDR] => 127.0.0.1 [SERVER_PORT] => 80 [REMOTE_ADDR] => 127.0.0.1 [DOCUMENT_ROOT] => /wufoo/trunk/ [SERVER_ADMIN] => you@example.com [SCRIPT_FILENAME] => /wufoo/trunk/tim/camel/index.php [REMOTE_PORT] => 62877 [GATEWAY_INTERFACE] => CGI/1.1 [SERVER_PROTOCOL] => HTTP/1.1 [REQUEST_METHOD] => POST [QUERY_STRING] => [REQUEST_URI] => /tim/camel/ [SCRIPT_NAME] => /tim/camel/index.php [PHP_SELF] => /tim/camel/index.php [REQUEST_TIME] => 1291468702 [argv] => Array ( ) [argc] => 0 ) Notice REQUEST_METHOD is POST, but argv does not contain a message body. In short, I need to transfer the message body from the 'from' route to the 'to' route so it may be sent as a POST, but I'm failing somehow. Thanks in advance.
