I have used these each quite often, many of them going back 10 years. CPAN module is, of course, one of the best that we sometimes forget about because it fades into the background. It is a meta-module, so to speak. Top group below appears in output of our newperl script which provides a working example of best practices. the resulting perl script implements some basic requirements and hints at basic debug, so that perl novices can develop good habits using a real-life design. we have an analogous newperlmod as well. The first two are more like pragmas in that they really hook onto the nature of the language built-ins. strict English use English is mostly as an aid to others reading Perl who grew up without an appreciation of how rich line noise can be Cwd File::Find File::Basename Carp Date::Calc GetOpt::Long Data::Dumper Data gathering toolbox -- more specialized Spreadsheet::ParseExcel and Text::CSV_XS -- even taught managers to use these :) LWP XML::Simple and XML::Parser tie with G/DBM family: for fast, scalable persisent hashes Parse::RecDescent (slow, but allows for rapidly development/debug of grammars) A recent discovery that is a boon for maintenance. Useful for output of config and batch files, e.g. Text::Template
