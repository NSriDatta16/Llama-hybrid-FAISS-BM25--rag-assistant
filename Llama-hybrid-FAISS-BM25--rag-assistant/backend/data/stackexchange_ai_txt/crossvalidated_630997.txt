Comparing the mean of biological replicates that are not normally distributed, low N for replicates

I work in cell biology where the field standard is now to do 3 biological replicates of experiments. However, each data point is extremely laborious to get and we receive very little statistics training. I believe some kind of nested model would be the most rigorous, but I'm also worried about how "unfamiliar" tests are perceived. Simply, I infected human cells with bacteria for a set length of time and counted how many cells are infected at the end per image/focus. I have control wild type untreated human cells, and 5 experimental conditions where I have treated the cells with various chemical reagents. For each experiment, I counted 20 images per control/condition. I repeated the entire experiment 3 times on different days for my biological replicates. The data is quite noisy (as expected) and each replicate is not normally distributed. The graph of my data with means of each replicate as bold squares and individual data points colored by replicate as circles is below. If I wanted to compare the conditions to the control with an ANOVA followed by a multiple comparisons test, could I treat the comparison of the averages of my data points per replicate as normally distributed? ie can I run an ANOVA rather than a Kruskal Wallis test on the replicate means? Since the replicate data is not normal, would comparing medians be better? Is there an alternate test that you would recommend, especially a more simple one? From my reading, I suspect some kind of nested data test or mixed model might be the most rigorous but I've not found very accessible explanations so I am unsure how best to proceed, especially in a sub field that often just runs repeated T-tests on everything. Thanks! EDIT: I'm getting a lot of great suggestions to follow up on- what approach is likely to have the most power to detect differences? The difference seems to be meaningful biologically based on my further work, but it would be nice if my stats could match the biology.
