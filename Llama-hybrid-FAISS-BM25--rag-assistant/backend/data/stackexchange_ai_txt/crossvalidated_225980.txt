Artificially censored regressors in linear model

I am running a linear regression looking at the effect of long term rainfall averages and rainfall shocks on district welfare (Y). I have measures of rainfall long term averages (rain_lt) as well as measures of rainfall level in the year preceding the survey where welfare is computed (Lag1_rain). In one of the specifications I define the rainfall shock as the difference between the year-specific level and the long term average (Lag1_rain-rain_lt), which I call Lag1_rain_diff. Since I am interested in seeing what is the effect of much higher rain than usual (flooding) as well as much lower rain than usual (drought), I split Lag1_rain_diff into two different variables: 1) Lag1_rain_diff_flood = Lag1_rain-rain_lt if Lag1_rain>=rain_lt, Lag1_rain_diff_flood = 0 otherwise 2) Lag1_rain_diff_drought = -(Lag1_rain-rain_lt) if Lag1_rain And the obtained linear regression specification is the following: Y = rain_lt + Lag1_rain_diff_flood + Lag1_rain_diff_drought + Controls + error I was wondering whether the introduction of two regressors that are artificially censored at 0 introduces any bias in the regression, and in the case they do, how to redefine the specification in order to avoid the issue. Thank you very much in advance!
