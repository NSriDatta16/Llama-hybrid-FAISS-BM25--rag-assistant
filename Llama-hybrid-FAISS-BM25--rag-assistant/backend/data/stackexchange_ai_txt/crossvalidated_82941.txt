Assign 'relative weights' to predictor variables in logistic regression

I am struggling in finding a way to assign a 'weight' (if possible) to each of the independent variables in a logistic regression (I am using R). I explain my problem in a more detailed way: I am working on a dataset of 900 samples. About half of them are affected with a disease, the other half are healthy (my dependent variable is indeed their 'status': disease or healthy). For each sample, I checked the presence of a certain type of variation in 32 different genes, that I intend to use as predictors in my regression. The problem is that I don't want to treat these 32 predictors in an equal way: some genes, in fact, when harbouring variation, are more likely to cause the disease than others. I already have 32 pre-computed scores coming from a previous study that I would like to use as 'predictor weights' a priori in the model. Is there any way to do so?
