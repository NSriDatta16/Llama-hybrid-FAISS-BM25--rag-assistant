I would say you would get less memory fragmentation by storing one large object rather than many small ones. Think about it this way. If you have 100 MB of memory and you allocate 1 50MB object then at worst case you will have two 25MB blocks available. If however you allocate two 25 MB blocks then worst case you might have 3 16MB blocks. That is more fragmentation rather than less.
