Is there any sense of adding the same feature with opposite sign when using SVM?

I'm training a support-vector machine (SVM). Each training vector includes 2 features which are equal in magnitude and have opposite signs, i.e., $F_1 = -F_2$. Is there any sense in doing so? Is one of the features redundant and better to be removed? Are the answers to the above dependent on the kernel being used? I'm currently using the Gaussian/radial-basis function (RBF) kernel.
