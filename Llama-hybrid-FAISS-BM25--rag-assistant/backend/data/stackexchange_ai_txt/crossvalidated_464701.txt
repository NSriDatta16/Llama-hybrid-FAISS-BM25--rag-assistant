Variance stabilizing transformation for time series

I differenced the time series and got this plot. I think I'm supposed to use a variance stabilizing transform because variance is increasing over time but I'm a bit confused as to which one I'm supposed to use. I understand it depends on how variance increases (linearly, quadratic, etc.) but how can you tell just from the plot? Is there some step I am missing or a different way I can stabilize this time series? I'm a beginner with these concepts so any help would be appreciated!
