How can I predict strong increases or decreases for a time series, e.g., by more than 25%?

I have a time series. I would like to have a model that takes in past and current values and outputs something like a probability / number that tells me: If the value is going up by more than 25% If the value is going down by more than 25% Neither of the above I wanted to try Neural Networks (Not interested in LSTMs), but are there other techniques? If not, do you know of a good resource?
