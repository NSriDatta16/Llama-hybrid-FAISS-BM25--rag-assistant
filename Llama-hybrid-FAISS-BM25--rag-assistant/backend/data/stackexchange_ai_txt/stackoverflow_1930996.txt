You don't ever create the int that the pointer points to, so the pointer is pointer to an area of memory that doesn't exist (or is used for something else). You can use new to get a block of memory from the heap, new returns the address of the memory location. itsTenure = new int; So now itsTenure holds the memory location you can dereference it to set its value. The changed constructor is as follows: Agents::Agents() { cout But you must also remember to delete it using delete Agents::~Agents() { cout
