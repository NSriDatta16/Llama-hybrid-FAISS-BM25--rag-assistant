Java , all instance method calls are called by means of dynamic binding. As far as I know, there is no elegant way to accomplish what you want. If you dont care about principles and elegance, you can check class of an instance at Foo. public updateMe(int x, int y) { if (getClass()==Foo.class) updateX(x); }
