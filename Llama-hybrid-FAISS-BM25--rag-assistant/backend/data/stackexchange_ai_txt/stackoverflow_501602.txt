I finally figured it out. On my canvas, I was drawing pointer lines (horizontal and vertical to show on the grid where I am and the values on the left/bottom), it turns out that when the hit test was being performed, it was hitting those lines and stopping. By setting IsHitTestVisible to false on all unrelevant geometry, my tooltip now shows properly. The reason I was seeing the mouse enter/leave event was because when moving the cursor, the lines would drag 1 frame behind and thus allow the mouse to enter/leave but not move. This resolves my issue.
