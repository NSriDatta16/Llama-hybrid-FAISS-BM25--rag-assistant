Edit From the documentation - Android provides several options for you to save persistent application data. The solution you choose depends on your specific needs, such as whether the data should be private to your application or accessible to other applications (and the user) and how much space your data requires. Your data storage options are the following: 1.Shared Preferences Store private primitive data in key-value pairs. 2.Internal Storage Store private data on the device memory. 3.External Storage Store public data on the shared external storage. 4.SQLite Databases Store structured data in a private database. 5.Network Connection Store data on the web with your own network server. To read more, go here . Also from the documentation - Android provides full support for SQLite databases. Any databases you create will be accessible by name to any class in the application, but not outside the application. Here is an example of an Android client-server model. PHP is used in this example as scripting language. Also, see the below question - Options for Client Server Communication in Android
