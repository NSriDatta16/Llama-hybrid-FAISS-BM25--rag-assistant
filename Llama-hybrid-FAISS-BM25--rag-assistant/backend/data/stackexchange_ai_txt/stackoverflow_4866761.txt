Is it wise to replace the trunk for shelvesets?

We're currently migrating from SVN to TFS; Today there are Trunks, Branches and Tags to track and organize our development. But we are questioning the need of a trunk while we have shelvesets, and could just shelve the pending activities and unshelve & merge them as necessary into the main branch. Is it a good plan ? Are there bad consequences upon doing this, has anyone tried before ? Thanks in Advance!
