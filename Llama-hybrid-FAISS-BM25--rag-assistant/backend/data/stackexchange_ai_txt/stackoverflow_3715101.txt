Well, it's easy to prove that it will validate any correct port: just generate each valid string and test that it passes. Making sure it doesn't allow anything that it shouldn't is harder though - obviously you can't test absolutely every invalid string. You should definitely test simple cases and anything which you think might pass incorrectly (or which would pass incorrectly with a lesser regex - "65536" being an example). It will allow some slightly odd port specifications though - such as "0000". Do you want to allow leading zeroes? You might also want to consider whether you actually need to specify ^ and $ separately for each case, or whether you could use ^(case 1)|(case 2)|...$ . Oh, and quantifiers could simplify the "1 to 4 digits" case too: ([0-9]{1,4}) will find between 1 and 4 digits. (You might want to work on sounding a little less arrogant, by the way. If you're working with other people, communicating in a less aggressive way is likely to do more to improve everyone's day than just proving your regex is correct...)
