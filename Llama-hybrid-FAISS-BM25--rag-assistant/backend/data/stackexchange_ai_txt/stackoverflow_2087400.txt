So I am going to go ahead and answer my own question and say no there is no EASY way to implement this behavior. Not only do you have to check the boundaries, but you also have to check the direction of the scrolling, and the console keeps telling me: last touch after scroll but scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate: wasn't called! I guess I have so more research to do...
