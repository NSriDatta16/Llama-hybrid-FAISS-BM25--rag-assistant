Creating image caption from alt script

I am trying to use this jQuery script to make an image caption from the alt tag: $("#content img").each(function () { var $this = $(this); var title = $this.attr("alt"); $this.after(' '+ title +' '); }); I am using another jQuery script before it and it is working fine. I can't seem to get the caption to alt script to work. Example: www.cslack.com/test.html Thanks, Robert
