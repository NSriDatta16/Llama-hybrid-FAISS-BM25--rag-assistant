How to calculate standardized regression coefficients with beta.glm function in r having weights in my model?

At the moment I am running logistic regressions on individual data with weights. Here is my model: model In a next step I wanted to calculate standardized regression coefficients with beta glm from 'reghelper' package . But I receive the following error: beta(model) Error in eval(extras, data, env) : object 'weight' not found There is no error if I exclude the weights from my model. So I think the error is due to using weights in my model. Do you have any idea how to calculate standardized regression coefficients inculding the weights? Thank you!
