Reading floats from a file in ASM

I've been working through the c++ and asm problems from The Binary Auditor . I got through the c++ stuff no problem, but the assembly is giving me a bit of trouble. I'm using masm32 on Windows 7. The first assembly problem essentially asks you to calculate the average of a series of float values which are stored in a text file, one value per line. So far, I've been able to read in the data from the file and store it in an array as a series of characters. So, my question is, to extract the float values from the array will I need to physically look at each byte, detect newline characters and '.'s and then construct the floats? Is there an easier way?! Thanks
