There are many many possible IE6/7 issues. Particularly IE6. First thing to check is does your HTML code include a valid declaration? If not, your page will go into quirks mode, which will make all versions of IE (but IE6 in particular) go nuts. Quirks mode is effectively an IE5 compatibility mode. It is badly broken, so make sure you have a doctype. Second thing to do is read up on some of the IE issues that may be giving you problems, and on browser support for some of the features you may be using. There's a very good website called (appropriately enough) Quirksmode.org which has a comprehensive set of compatibility tables for a wide range of browser features. The following sites may also help: http://haslayout.net/css/index http://css-class.com/test/bugs/ie/ie-bugs.htm http://positioniseverything.net/explorer.html Google is your friend here too. ;-) Next tip, try to narrow down your problem. Strip out the bits that are working until you end up with a page that demonstrates the problem with the minimum of other stuff getting in the way. Save that example to a site like JSFiddle . It'll be easier to work out the issue if you know exactly what the issue is. Finally, if the remaining issues are minor display glitches that don't prevent the page being used, you should give yourself permission to simply ignore them. The market share for both IE6 and 7 has been dropping rapidly over the last year, and will continue falling. There's very little to be gained by spending too much time sweating over minor issues in these browsers. See here for up-to-date browser usage stats: http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200911-201011 (obviously if your site has significantly different demographics, you may need to pay more attention to IE6 and 7, but if that's the case you'll know already)
