How do teams use Flex Builder Pro to develop large applications?

We develop applications for the Flash platform, which have LOTS of run-time loaded assets (graphics, data, audio, code-libraries, etc.) Those assets are logically organized within project folders. Programmers and designers get the latest from version control, check-out their code or design work, test within a full local copy of the application, then check-in when they are done. The organization is important to this workflow and our communication. Using Flash or FlashDevelop, I can easily work with any organization of folders and files. I can easily compile a single package or class to create a run-time loadable swf. In Flex Builder Pro, it seems my options are to create a project for each swf that I need to compile or create a project which references modules, which can also be setup as projects. Neither technique seems ideal for a team or even as good as our current workflow. Note: I've got about 10 years experience with Flash, but only a couple months experience using Flex Builder Pro. It is quite likely that I simply haven't discovered a better workflow. Would you please share a few tips on how you and your team use Flex Builder Pro to develop large applications, which have lots of runtime libraries and other assets?
