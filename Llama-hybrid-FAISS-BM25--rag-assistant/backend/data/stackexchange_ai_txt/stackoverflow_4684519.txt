html5 local storage only returning values on home page, not other pages

This is my first time working with localStorage, and I'm trying to store a json object which I am stringify(ing). On my home page, I use the following code localStorage.setItem("users",JSON.stringify(userList)); alert(localStorage.getItem("users")); location.href="test2.html"; This alert spits out the userlist no problem. Then on the test2.html, I have var userList=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("users")); alert(userList.toSource()); Firebug spits out a 'userlist is null' error. I've tried using the string 'test' in place of the strigified json object, but no luck. I've also tried removing the JSON.parse and just get the string returned. This also didn't work. What am I doing wrong??
