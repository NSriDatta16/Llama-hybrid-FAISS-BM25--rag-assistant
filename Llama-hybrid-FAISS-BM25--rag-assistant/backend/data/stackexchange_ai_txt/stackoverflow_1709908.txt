The WPF Toolkit has a DataGrid that I've used successfully on several projects: http://wpf.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=29117 Third-party vendors also produce simimlar grids. Prominent ones, in no particular order, are Xceed, Telerik, Infragistics, and Syncfusion. Hope that helps! Tim
