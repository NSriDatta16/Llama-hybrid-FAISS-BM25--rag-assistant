Since you can't, in general, read/write to the framebuffer in the same operation (other than simple blending), you need to render to textures using FBO:s (FrameBufferObject), then do various processing on those, then do the final pass onto the real framebuffer. That's the main part you need to understand. Given that, you can sketch your "render tree" on paper, i.e. which parts of the scene goes where and what your effects are, their input and output data. From there on, you just render one or more big quads covering the entire screen with specific fragment shader that perform your effect, using textures as input and one or more framebuffer objects as output.
