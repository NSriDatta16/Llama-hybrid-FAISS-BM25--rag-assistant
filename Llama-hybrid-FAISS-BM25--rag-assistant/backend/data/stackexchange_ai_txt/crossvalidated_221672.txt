Creating a Regression to see how weather can explain sales development

In June, a sales representative explained that the weather in Cologne (Germany) has been very rainy and this is causing sales to drop. Granted, less people go shopping when weather is bad. However, I want to understand how true this statement holds. I have Sales per day from our store in Cologne. I have Average temperature per day I have two dummy variables, Rain (0/1) and Thunder (0/1). I do the regression in Excel (I lack a statistical software at work). Here are my results: Regressionsstatistik Multiple-R 0,377032755 R-squared 0,142153698 Adj. R-sqr 0,025174657 Std. error 5793,157324 Observations 26 From the ANOVA I get this: df SS MS F sig. F Regression 3 122349445,679 40783148,560 1,215 0,328 Residual 22 738334779,230 33560671,783 Total 25 860684224,908 Granted, I have no significance (0.328). Can I do anything about my data or is the input wrong (shit in, shit out)?
