For TFS 2008 right click on the Builds node and chose "Manage Build Agents". Select the agent of choice and then press "Edit..." and change the working directory. My personal preference is to change it to something like: c:\bw\$(BuildDefinitionId) As that will give it a short working folder for your builds (the .NET API's have a 260 character limit for file paths so using as few of those characters as possible for your working folder gives you mor eto play with during your build). For TFS 2005 edit the TFSBuild.proj file of the relevant build(s) and change the working property to point to where you want it for each build. Hope that helps, Martin.
