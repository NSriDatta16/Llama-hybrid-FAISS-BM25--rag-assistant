I think you are thinking about this the wrong way - you should let machine learning determine which parts of the object are discriminative and which are not. If you look at visualizations of models obtained with HOG+linear SVM, you see which cells get high importance according to the strength of the oriented edge. This model, taken from Felzenszwalb's seminal DPM paper, shows that the cells with highest discriminative power are those near the head and shoudlers. Those around the head usually contain background, so the SVM learned to assign low weight. If you have enough positive and negative training images (using your example, lots of mugs and non-mugs), your SVM should pick up that the handle is important, assuming the handle appears in consistent locations in the images.
