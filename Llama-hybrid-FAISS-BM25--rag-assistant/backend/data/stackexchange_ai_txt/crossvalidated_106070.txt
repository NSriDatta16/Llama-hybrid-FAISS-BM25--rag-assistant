What would be an effective strategy to correlate congressional attendance and precipitation?

I have data sets of the attendance of congresspeople, and of the weather in Washington, DC. I would like to examine whether and to what degree precipitation is correlated with the likelihood of individual congresspeople being present or absent. For example, the 111th congress was in session 298 days of the 388 days between 2009-01-06 and 2010-01-29. Precipitation was recorded during 187 of those 388 days. (I also have the amount of precipitation, the temperature, the pressure, lots of weather measurements) Congresswoman A was absent 52 times; of those 52, there was precipitation 39 times. Et cetera for each congressperson. The null hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between precipitation and attendance. I'd like to create some sort of visualization; perhaps a histogram of number of congresspeople on the y axis and... er... something Bayesian? Chances they will be absent, given the fact it's raining?
