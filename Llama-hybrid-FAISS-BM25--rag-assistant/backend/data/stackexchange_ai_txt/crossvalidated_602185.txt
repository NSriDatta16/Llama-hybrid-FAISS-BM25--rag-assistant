How to calculate p.value for non inferiority study with R?

I'll give a little background on my study. It is a non-inferiority study. We have to show that treatment A is non-inferior to treatment B with a delta acceptability margin of -2 for the outcome. The estimated mean for the outcome in the group treatment B is 7 with with a standard deviation of 5. The null hypothesis is Treatment A is inferior to treatment B ( $\mu_A-\mu_B the lower limit is less than $-2$ ) The alternative hypothesis is that Treatment A is non-inferior to treatment B ( $\mu_A-\mu_B > -2$ the lower limit is greater than $-2$ ) I used t.test to compare the two groups: t.test(mydata$outcome~mydata$traitement) After comparison we obtained this results Welch Two Sample t-test data: mydata $outcome by mydata$ traitement t = -0.88938, df = 258.81, p-value = 0.3746 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Treatment A and Treatment B is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.133224 0.805804 sample estimates: mean in group Treatment A mean in group Treatment B 8.390977 9.054688 Our confidence interval tell us we did not prove non inferiority, cause its lower limit is $ . If I understand this p.value is not interpretable. Is it because this p.value represents the p.value of superiority? which can not prove our alternative hypothesis. The international guideline recommends mainly the reporting of the confidence interval and much less the p.value in non-inferiority studies (even if the p.value is more and more encouraged in any type of study), but I believe that it is possible to calculate the p.value specific to the non-inferiority study (or am I mistaken?) Is this specific p.value valid? Is there an R function to calculate this p.value? Normally the alternative hypothesis is accepted if this p.value is $ . Is this the case?
