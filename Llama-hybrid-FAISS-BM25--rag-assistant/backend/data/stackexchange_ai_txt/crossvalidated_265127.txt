How to find the time to failure of a component using mean failure time

Is there a way to find the time it will take a component to fail if we know the average failure time. For example a bulb has a mean failure time of 100 hours but is working even after 200 hours. Can i say at what time it will fail? I dont have any others statistics like distribution etc.
