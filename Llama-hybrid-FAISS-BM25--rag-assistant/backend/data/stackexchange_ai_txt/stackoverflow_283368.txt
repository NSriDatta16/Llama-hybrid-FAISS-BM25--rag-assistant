"Best Practice"/Favourite Pattern for Calling Web Services (ASP.NET)

Problem: We have a web app that calls some web services asynchronously (from the page). Normally this is fine, but some are failing under load test (due to timeouts). What are (if there are any) any suggested "best practices" for calling web services asynchronously in a web application? Are there any patterns that may be of use? Should direct calling of services be avoided? (perhaps resorting to some other method such as AJAX)? To Illustrate - Direct Calling: WSNameSpace.WSName svc = new WSNameSpace.WSName(); svc.EventName += new WSNameSpace.EventNameEventHandler(CallbackDelegate); svc.ServiceMethodAsync(param1, param2); Should I focus more on improving the exception handling rather than calling the services? Many thanks. Rob Update I have been Googleing and have found this article on creating "service agents", while it relates to WinForms, I will definitely have a sit down and read of this later to see how it affects my thoughts on this :)
