Add spaces between words in spaceless string

I'm on OS X, and in objective-c I'm trying to convert for example, "Bobateagreenapple" into "Bob ate a green apple" Is there any way to do this efficiently? Would something involving a spell checker work? EDIT: Just some extra information: I'm attempting to build something that takes some misformatted text (for example, text copy pasted from old pdfs that end up without spaces, especially from internet archives like JSTOR). Since the misformatted text is probably going to be long... well, I'm just trying to figure out whether this is feasibly possible before I actually attempt to actually write system only to find out it takes 2 hours to fix a paragraph of text.
