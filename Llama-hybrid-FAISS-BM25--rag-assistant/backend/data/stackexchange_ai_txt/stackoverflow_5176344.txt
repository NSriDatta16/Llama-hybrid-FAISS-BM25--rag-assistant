Is it bad for a view to create it's own child views? My answer is "NO". In face creating partial views gives you more power to change the UI contents in a modular way. There are always multiple ways of achieving results. I personally think ascx files are a good clean way of creating reusable modules which can inherit from customized user controls. Its modularized approach keeps things very organized for me. Just my 2 cents...
