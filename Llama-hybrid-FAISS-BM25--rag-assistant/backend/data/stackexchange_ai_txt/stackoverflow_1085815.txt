This is an amazing opportunity. You have an array of benefits. Compare your product to competition. See what you did wrong and they got right. See what you didn't think of. Evaluate why you made decisions and how it compares to your competitor. Now you know that there is a niche for whatever you are doing. After all, if somebody else is doing it, that probably means the idea is worth something and there is a need for it. All in all, I had that happen to me. I released a project and a day after I found (quite obvious) competitors. Domain names were better and shorter, they were in the market for longer, had more content. That was a bit discoraging, however I realized my product is better in small ways. I also fixed a lot of usability bugs that I saw in competitors. And I am beginning to get traction: top results in Google, constant visits, bigger market share. There is a long way to go, but some of that path is simply doing better than the other guy. Plus a little bit more. it's all about optimism
