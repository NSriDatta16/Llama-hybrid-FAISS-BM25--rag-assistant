Is what you suggested the same as a weighted average? Average R = w1*R1 + w2*R2 + w3*R3 + ... + wn*Rn Average G = w1*G1 + w2*G2 + w3*G3 + ... + wn*Gn Average B = w1*B1 + w2*B2 + w3*B3 + ... + wn*Bn The w's are the weighting fractions and the sum of them is 1. R1 is the red component of the first color to mix, for example. So if you wanted to mix two colors evenly, it would be: Average R = 0.5*R1 + 0.5*R2 Average G = 0.5*G1 + 0.5*G2 Average B = 0.5*B1 + 0.5*B2 As for mapping the resultant color to a named color ("dark red") maybe just do a lookup table and pick the closest one?
