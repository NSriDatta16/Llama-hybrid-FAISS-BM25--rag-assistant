Modification of date format within a text file

I have some text files containing lines as follow : 07JAN01 , -0.247297942769082E+07, -0.467133797284279E+07, 0.355810777473149E+07 07JAN02 , -0.247297942405032E+07, -0.467133797586388E+07, 0.355810777517715E+07 07JAN03 , -0.247297942584851E+07, -0.467133797727224E+07, 0.355810777627353E+07 . . . . . . . . I need to produce a script which will amend the format of the date to : 01/01/07 , -0.247297942769082E+07, -0.467133797284279E+07, 0.355810777473149E+07 02/01/07 , -0.247297942405032E+07, -0.467133797586388E+07, 0.355810777517715E+07 03/01/07 , -0.247297942584851E+07, -0.467133797727224E+07, 0.355810777627353E+07 . . . . . . . . I was looking for an appropriate sed or grep command to extract only some characters of each line, to define it as a variable in my script. As I would like to "reorganize" the date, I was thinking about defining three variable, where, for the for the first line it would be : a=07 b=JAN (need to implement a "case" in the script to deal with this I think?) c=03 I looked at some grep examples, and tons of docs, but nothing really clear appeared ... found something about the -cut command, but ... I'm not too sure it's appropriate here. The other question I have is about the output, as sed doesn't modify the input data, how can I modify directly the files ? Is there a way ? Any help would really be appreciated :)
