A picture is worth a thousand words: Here we are looking for 1-dimensional structure in 2D. The points lie along an S-shaped curve. PCA tries to describe the data with a linear 1-dimensional manifold, which is simply a line; of course a line fits these data quite bad. Isomap is looking for a nonlinear (i.e. curved!) 1-dimensional manifold, and should be able to discover the underlying S-shaped curve.
