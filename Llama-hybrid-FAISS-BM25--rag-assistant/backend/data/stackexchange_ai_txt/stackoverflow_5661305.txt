Use EXPLAIN before query to get information on how MySQL will execute your query, which tables it will use, how many rows it will read, which indexes exploit and so on... Other solution is to run this query many times (let's say 100) and measure average response time. Looking at your queries lead me to thought that you probably might write better one (not sure, though - too complicated for the first glance).
