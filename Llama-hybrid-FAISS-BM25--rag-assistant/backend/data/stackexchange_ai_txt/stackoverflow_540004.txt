Depends on whether you care about your "instantaneous" or "average" velocity. Personally, I wouldn't make it more complicated than necessary and just add it into the sprint where it was completed. Calculate your average velocity by looking at the average number of points completed per sprint over the last 3, 6, and 12 months. Hopefully, these will eventually converge and you'll have a good idea of how much you can get done in one sprint.
