Neural network - continuous vs. non continuous variables

I'm using the neuralnet package in R to attempt to predict the median value of Sales using all the other variables of the data set ( Carseats ) available. After verifying that no datapoint is missing and randomly split the data to a train and test set I ran across an error when normalizing the data. maxs Since I'm new to this subject I did some research/experimenting before posting here. The problem seems to come from the qualitative variables of the data set Carseats . Looking at the variables of the data set more closely yields the following list: str(Carseats) 'data.frame': 400 obs. of 11 variables: Sales : num 9.5 11.22 10.06 7.4 4.15 ... CompPrice : num 138 111 113 117 141 124 115 136 132 132 ... Income : num 73 48 35 100 64 113 105 81 110 113 ... Advertising: num 11 16 10 4 3 13 0 15 0 0 ... Population : num 276 260 269 466 340 501 45 425 108 131 ... Price : num 120 83 80 97 128 72 108 120 124 124 ... ShelveLoc : Factor w/ 3 levels "Bad","Good","Medium": 1 2 3 ... Age : num 42 65 59 55 38 78 71 67 76 76 ... Education : Ord.factor w/ 9 levels "10" After removing the qualitative variables (i.e. ShelveLoc , Education , Urban and US ) from the data set using the Carseats$variable command and repeating the same steps I was able to plot the neural network. What is the explanation for the error message? How can I include the qualitative variables to build the neural network? Is there a way to transform qualitative variables to continuous variables and does this approach makes sense for the model?
