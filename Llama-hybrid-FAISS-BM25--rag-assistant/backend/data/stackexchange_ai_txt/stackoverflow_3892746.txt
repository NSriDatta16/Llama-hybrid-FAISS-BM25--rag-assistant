We have been working on an approach to business process representation that departs from the usual workflow approach, i.e. the machine metaphor where the organisation is a "machine" that "executes" the business process. We call it the "work product pool" approach, and it centres around products rather than tasks. As ChrisBD says, there are no single starting points, and the work product pool approachs acknowledges this and uses an opportunistic, people-oriented take to process representation. If you google for "work product pool" you will find a few articles that describe the approach. The ISO/IEC 24744 standard metamodel is particularly suited to modelling business processes using this approach, too.
