var_export () is good when you want to save it as a string that is actually valid PHP and can be parsed as such. This appears to most closely match your example. serialize () and unserialize () are good for storing an array as a string internally to your PHP application. json_encode () and json_decode () are good when it needs to be interoperable with other languages, or other versions/builds of PHP, or stored in persistent storage, etc for maximum portability of your data.
