Magento htaccess 301 Redirects

We've got a Magento site we're trying to launch. We've got a whole bunch of URL rewrites, but when I add then to the .htaccess files, the site doesn't load. Obviously I'm doing something wrong, here's the code I'm using: RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^StoreLevel=3&PrevStoreLevel=1&productid=6067&Level1=155&p=5&term=&BrowseBy=0$ RewriteRule ^store\.php$ http://oursite.com/zproduct.html? [R=301,L] Any advice is greatly appreciated.
