Treating missing values in panel data set

You can often see in the empirical papers that do some kind of the regression analysis on economic data something like this "we drop the companies from our sample which do not have the observation in each year of the reporting period". Doing so the author reduces his/her sample. Another way to deal with missing values is to impute them. My questions therefore are: what is more correct to drop or replace missing values while doing regression analysis? Besides, is it better to use some sophisticated methods that allow us to account for missing values in dependent/independent variables or impute the values? For example, I've panel data for 100 companies in the period of 6 last years. For them I've collected 5 variables such as profit, sales etc. For some companies I have missing values in 1-2 periods and for other in 4-5 periods. I am going to conduct the time series/cross-sectional analysis. Is it better 1). to leave all as it is, 2). to drop companies which have missing values in 4-5 periods (than the sample reduces by 50%) and rest of missing values replace with the mean values? Besides what to do if the missing values are dependent variables? Does the imputation methods differ for dependent or independent variables?
