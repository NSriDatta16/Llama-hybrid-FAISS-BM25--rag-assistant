As explained in DVCS - How often and when to commit changes , you can commit as many times as necessary in a private branch (i.e. a branch you will not publish/push elsewhere). When you know you want to keep a particular line of development, then you can reorganize your commits into logical commits (each ones representing a stable state, passing unit testing for instance) or simple merge --squash the all thing. Don't go to extreme though: it doesn't make sense to commit after every save with a DVCS .
