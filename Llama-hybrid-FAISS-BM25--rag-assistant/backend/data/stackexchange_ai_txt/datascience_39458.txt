You can imagine convolution as the mixing of information. Imagine two buckets full of information which are poured into one single bucket and then mixed according to a specific rule. In order to extract the features of the image, CNN uses what is known as a kernel over each image and adjust the kernel as per the propagation in the network. A kernel is then convolved over the entire image to produce what are known as feature maps. You can visualize a feature map as something like this : As the layers becomes deeper and deeper, the network acquires the knowledge of larger and larger feature extraction. The initial layers takes care of the smaller details of the image and deeper layer are able to identify the the bigger picture. These images by adeshpande3 gives a very conscience explanation about what is happening at each layer. You may refer to timdettmers blog and then to Adesh pande's blog . They give a lucid explanation about CNNs.
