WPF CAD-like system - all data in classes

Still picking my way through learning XAML/WPF. If someone can show me how to accomplish the following - it will go a long way to helping me develop my next project (and several similar projects down the road). Say I have a collection of objects that defines objects to be drawn on a canvas. The objects contain all the information necessary to render the objects, including the shape, color, and location. Can a XAML control be created that binds to this collection and handles the rendering, or is this better done by drawing on the canvas in the code-behind? One other point - the objects must eventually be click-selectable, selectable via rectangle-lasso, and draggable. This doesn't have to be solved in the example code someone supplies, but I thought it might be relevant to know this as it might affect the various implementations. Example class below. thanks in advance. Class DrawingElement readonly property Shape as string ("circle", "square", "triangle") readonly property Position as point (coordinates) readonly property Color as string ("red", "blue", "yellow") end class Sub Main dim lst as new List(of DrawingElement) lst.add(new DrawingElement("Circle", 10,20, "Blue")) lst.add(new DrawingElement("Square", 80,35, "Red")) lst.add(new DrawingElement("Triangle", 210,120, "Yellow")) End Sub
