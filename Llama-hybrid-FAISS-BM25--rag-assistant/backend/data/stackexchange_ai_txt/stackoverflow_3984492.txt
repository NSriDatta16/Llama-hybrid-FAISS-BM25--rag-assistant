I had similar problems two places in my app. I couldn't find a way to change or update the editingStyle of cells while editing and it was starting to drive me crazy. I had one cell where I wanted to add a minus when the user entered something, and another where I wanted to remove a plus when the user clicked the cell and transformed it into a valid field. I eventually solved both problems by calling - (void) prepareForReuse; on the cell in question. I don't think it's an elegant solution, but it somehow works. If I call this method before I start editing it causes some strange animation glitches, but if I call it after updating the underlying datastructures and within tableView beginUpdates and tableView endUpdates it animates perfectly for the case where I want to add the minus sign. In my second case the plus sign is removed without animation by calling this method just before an empty tableView beginUpdates and tableView endUpdates sequence. It looks a bit abrupt, but I can live with that as long as the functionality is there.
