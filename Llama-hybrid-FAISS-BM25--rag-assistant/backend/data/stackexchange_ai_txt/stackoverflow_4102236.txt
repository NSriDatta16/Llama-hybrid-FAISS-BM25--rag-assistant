Andreas's answer will give you a good, fast approximation, but you'll lose some quality, because red, green and blue don't mix with equal intensities in the human eye. If you want to "get it right", instead of grey := (rgbBlue + rgbGreen + rgbRed) div 3; try this: grey := round(rgbRed * .3) + round(rgbGreen * .59) + round(rgbBlue * .11); You'll get a bit of a performance hit over the simple average, though it probably won't be noticeable unless you're on a very large image.
