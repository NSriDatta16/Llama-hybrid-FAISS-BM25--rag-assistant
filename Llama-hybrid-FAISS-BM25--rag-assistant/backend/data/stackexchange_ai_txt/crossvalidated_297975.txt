When doing PCA on binary variables, should I scale them?

I'm trying to do PCA for ~1000 patients & 100 genes. The goal is to visualize hidden groups within the patients. Each patient has the information of whether each of the 100 genes is mutated or not (1/0). From R documentation page, scale=TRUE is recommended. However, I almost feel that this kind of variables should not scaled. Is my understanding correct?
