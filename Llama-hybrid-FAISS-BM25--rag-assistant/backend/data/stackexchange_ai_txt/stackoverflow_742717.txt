Usually you want to keep the sentences that have words that are more unique to that article. That is, the more "generic" the sentence is, the less it describes this particular article. The normal way to do this is Bayesian analysis much like a spam-filter. First determine which words in the entire article appear more often than you'd expect, then find the sentences that feature those words.
