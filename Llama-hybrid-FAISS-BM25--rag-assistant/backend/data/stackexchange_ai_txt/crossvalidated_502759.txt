Am I understanding critical value and p-value correctly?

Assume I created a program that plays tic-tac-toe, and measured its preformance over 100 game (1 point for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 otherwise). Afterwards, I made some improvements and a friend made the following hypothesis. The new version will score on average 0.3 points more per game. I need to explain how I would test this hypothesis using p-value and critical value. Here are my attempts: Critical value - playing several games and calculating the average points, if the average turns out to be greater than the cut-off (i.e. critical value) then we can accept the hypothesis. p-value - We play several games and calculate the average number of points. We then calculate the p-value -using 1% as a threshold for example- if the p-value is below the threshold, we reject the null hypothesis. Any mistakes or improvements I can make? Thanks
