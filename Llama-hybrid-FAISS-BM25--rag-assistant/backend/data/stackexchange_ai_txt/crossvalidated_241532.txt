How to quantify the separability of data?

This is more of a "help me complete my knowledge", rather than a direct question. Consider the a binary classification of two clouds of point (in general multiple categories, but let's keep it simple for the sake of our conversation). I am looking for measures of quantifying the clean-ness/well-formed-ness/separability of data points. Like the first figure below looks more separable that the 2nd one. Here are a bunch of things I have seen. Could you add more to my list? margin: $$ \gamma = \max_{w, b} \min_i y_i (\mathbf{w}.\mathbf{x}_i + b), y_i \in \{\pm 1\} $$ distance between means: $$ d_{centers} = \|\mu_1 - \mu_2\| $$ where $$ \begin{cases} \mu_1 = \frac{1}{| \{i: y_i = +1\} |}\sum_{i: y_i = +1} x_i \\ \mu_2 = \frac{1}{| \{i: y_i = -1\} |}\sum_{i: y_i = -1} x_i \end{cases} $$ Min distance between pairs of points. $$ d_{avg} = \frac{1}{|\{i: y_i = 1 \}||\{j: y_j = -1 \}|} \sum_{i \text{ s.t. } y_i = +1, j \text{ s.t. } y_j = -1} \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\| $$ Average distance between pairs of points. $$ d_{\min} = \min_{i \text{ s.t. } y_i = +1, j \text{ s.t. } y_j = -1} \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\| $$
