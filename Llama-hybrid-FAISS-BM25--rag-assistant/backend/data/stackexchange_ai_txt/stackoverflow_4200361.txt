code coverage tool for java webstart/jnlp application

I have been searching for some time for a code coverage tool that will work with my client/sever application, but I have been unable to find a compatible tool. My application stores images on a server, then displays them though a client which is launched via java webstart/jnlp file. Any recommendations would be appreciated. I have already tried emma & clover, with no results. open source or commercials solutions are acceptable. thanks!
