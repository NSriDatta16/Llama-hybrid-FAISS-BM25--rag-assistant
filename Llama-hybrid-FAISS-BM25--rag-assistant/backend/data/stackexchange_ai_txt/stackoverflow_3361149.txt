It depends upon the scenario as well. No doubt it is faster to add with the generic list as compare to the stringbuilder object. But during the time of data retrieval from the generic list, it will be much slower as compare to the stringbuilder object. The stringbuilder will return quickly using _masterText.ToString() but with the generic list, you might have to pull the value using the iteration. And that will be expensive process such as :- for (int x = 0; x Or you can try with Label3.Text = string.Join("", gen_list.ToArray()); then the retrieval operation will be slower and expensive, and you can notice the CPU spike easily.
