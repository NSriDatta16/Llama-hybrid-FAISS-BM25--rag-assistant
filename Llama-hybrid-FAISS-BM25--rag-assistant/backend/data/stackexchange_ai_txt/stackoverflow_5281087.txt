You'll have to overcome the following: appending jQuery to the page if it doesn't already exist minify your code and wrap in a self-executing enclosure Here's an example from @anrorhs's example above: ');$('body').append($e);$e.css({ position: 'absolute', top: '10px', right: '10px', width: '200px', eight: '90px', backgroundColor: 'red'});})();">drag me to your bookmarks bar To do the inline check for jQuery - follow the tutorial here: http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/ That will give you the ability to paste in the code above and it will conditionally load jQuery from Google's CDN when it is not already present on the page. Cheers.
