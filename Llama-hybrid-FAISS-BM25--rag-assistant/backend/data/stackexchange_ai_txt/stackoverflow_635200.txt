Visual Studio 2005 Build of Python with Debug .lib

I am looking for the Visual Studio 2005 build of Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6, I also need the python2x_d.lib (the debug version of the .lib) since I embed the interpreter into my app and the python libs implicitly link to the python2x_d.lib with pragmas (grrr).
