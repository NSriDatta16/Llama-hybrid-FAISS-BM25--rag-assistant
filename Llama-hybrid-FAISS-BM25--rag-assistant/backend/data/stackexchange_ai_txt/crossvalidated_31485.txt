How are you getting more than $20$ events per second if you are sleeping for $1/20$ of a second between checks? In case you are actually using intervals of length $0.005$ then you could see up to $200$ events, but you are throwing out each event after the first in each interval. This would lead to an average of $200(1-\exp(-167/200)) = 113.225$ per second, with a binomial distribution instead of a Poisson distribution. You might see slightly fewer if you are actually sampling less often than once every $0.005$ seconds. You should at least test how often your loop is run.
