How to write this T-SQL WHERE condition?

I've got two tables: TableA Col1 Col2 TableB Col3 Col4 I want to join them together: SELECT * from TableA join TableB ON (...) Now, in place of ... I need to write an expression that evaluates to: If Col3 is not null, then true iif Col1==Col3; otherwise If Col3 is null, then true iif Col2==Col4 What would be the most elegant way to do this?
