How does BERT work for Aspect-Based sentiment analysis?

I have recently used a package to perform Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) through a BERT model. Briefly, the model takes two inputs: words that constitute the aspects a sentence on which we want to perform the ABSA The BERT-based model outputs a sentiment list with three integers representing the positive, the neutral and the negative scores. I would like to understand more about how this kind of model works. I have seen many posts on Medium that are too general and read some papers that give the basic functioning for grated. So, if anyone can explain extensively how bert-based ABSA works, it would be appreciated. Thank you!
