Should I duplicate data in my DB?

I have a MySQL DB containing entry for pages of a website. Let's say it has fields like: Table pages: id | title | content | date | author Each of the pages can be voted by users, so I have two other tables Table users: id | name | etc etc etc Table votes: id | id_user | id_page | vote Now, I have a page where I show a list of the pages (10-50 at a time) with various information along with the average vote of the page. So, I was wondering if it were better to: a) Run the query to display the pages (note that this is already fairly heavy as it queries three tables) and then for each entry do another query to calculate the mean vote (or add a 4th join to the main query?). or b) Add an "average vote" column to the pages table, which I will update (along with the vote table) when an user votes the page. nico
