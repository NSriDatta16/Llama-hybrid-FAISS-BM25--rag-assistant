Interaction of Gender and Income categorical variable

I ran the following model, with exam scores in science as my outcome variable, and parental income group divided into 5 groups and a binary gender variable with the results below: regress test_score i.quantiles_parent_income i.gender_dummy Source | SS df MS Number of obs = 2,268 -------------+---------------------------------- F(6, 2261) = 318.19 Model | 76430.8521 6 12738.4753 Prob > F = 0.0000 Residual | 90516.86 2,261 40.0339938 R-squared = 0.4578 -------------+---------------------------------- Adj R-squared = 0.4564 Total | 166947.712 2,267 73.6425726 Root MSE = 6.3272 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- test_score | Coef. Std. Err. t P>|t| [95% Conf. Interval] ---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- quantiles_parent_income| 2 | -.9545663 .5365921 -1.78 0.075 -2.006831 .0976982 3 | .0265901 .5395947 0.05 0.961 -1.031563 1.084743 4 | 5.121439 .5328825 9.61 0.000 4.07645 6.166429 5 | 7.491982 .5170866 14.49 0.000 6.477968 8.505996 | gender_dummy | male | -8.225431 .2901021 -28.35 0.000 -8.794325 -7.656537 I then ran an F-test between students whose parents fall in the 2nd quantile, relative to the top 20th percentile: test i2.quantiles_parent_income== i5.quantiles_parent_income F( 1, 2261) = 415.54 Prob > F = 0.0000 Can I say that a student living in the top 20th percentile scores on average, 7.5 points higher than a student in 2nd quantile, and the result is significant at the 99 significance level. Is it possible to compute how being a male in the top 20th percentile impacts one's test scores in science compared to a female student in the same parental income group?
