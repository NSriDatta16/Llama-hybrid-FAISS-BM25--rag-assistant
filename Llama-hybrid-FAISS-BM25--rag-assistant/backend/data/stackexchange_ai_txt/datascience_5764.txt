You're learning, are you? Try to find something easy and interesting to start. Why don't you start off something easy like building a Bayesian model to predict which email will get deleted. You should glance over those deleted emails, are they spams? are they just garbage? Here, you have a simply supervised model where the data-set already labels the emails for you (deleted or not). Think of something easy like words, titles, length of the email etc, see if you can build a model that predicts email deletion.
