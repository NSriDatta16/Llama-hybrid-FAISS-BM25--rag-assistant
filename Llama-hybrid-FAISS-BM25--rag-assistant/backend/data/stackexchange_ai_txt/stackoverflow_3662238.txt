Note that in the general scope of authorization, the authorized agent does not necessarily know the identity of the user on whose behalf it acts. In other words, there could be an implementation where your app can be authorized to read the Twitter stream of updates, while still not knowing which identity that stream belongs to. Adding the parameter you ask for would be information disclosure in this case, as your app will need a piece of information that the system is designed not to provide. Or to put it in a real life example - imagine a valet parking, where instead of giving you a parking ticket and taking the keys to the car, the valet would ask you for your SSN just to park the car, just because the valet parks cars for other people too.
