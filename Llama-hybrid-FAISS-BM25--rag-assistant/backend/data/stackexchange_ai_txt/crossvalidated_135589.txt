How to select the set of markets (time series) to include in portfolio

This question is likely to have been asked before but never answered in a way which I completely understand. Assume I have some money that I want to invest in a basket of stocks. The investable funds are divided into N equal chunks. Assume there is a very large number of candidate stocks (10000) in which I could invest. My goal is to have a relatively balanced portfolio where the correlation/covariance among the stocks is low. So, lets say I select IBM as stock 1 of N for my portfolio. Q1: Now, as I add stocks 2-N to the portfolio, what metric do I use to select the N-1 stocks to keep the portfolio balanced? Q2: What metric am I trying to minimize/maximize? Correlation, covariance, other? As there are approximately 10K choices it's not computationally feasible to enumerate all combinations. Assume that you can short a given market that's part of the portfolio.
