Let $y_i=f(x_i)$ and that your interest is in predicting $\tilde{y} = f(\tilde{x})$. From a Bayesian perspective, you want the posterior predictive distribution for $\tilde{y}$, namely $$ p(\tilde{y}|y) = \int p(\tilde{y}|y,\theta)p(\theta|y) d\theta$$ where $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ and $\theta$ is the parameters of the Gaussian process. Since you have assumed a Gaussian process, the conditional distribution $p(\tilde{y}|y,\theta)$ is normal. The marginal distribution $p(\tilde{y}|y)$ is continuous* and thus $Pr(\tilde{y}=0|y) = 0$. One way to answer your question is to see if this distribution has density near zero. If you are interested in single number summaries, then you could calculate $Pr(\tilde{y} *It is unlikely that this marginal distribution can be computed exactly and you will likely end up simulating from the distribution by simulating $\theta$ from its posterior and then simulating $\tilde{y}$ conditional on the simulated values for $\theta$. Then you can calculate the quantities above using simulations.
