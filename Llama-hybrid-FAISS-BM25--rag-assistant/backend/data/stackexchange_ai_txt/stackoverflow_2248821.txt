Both @Michael & @dma_k were correct. The server was not checking if LWP::UserAgent had flash installed. Instead, for some reason the returned content was not being dumped correctly while we were trying to debug the script. Unfortunately we didn't figure out a way to fix this but after some trial and error we figured out how to pull out the appropriate fields from the page. Sorry that there isn't really a correct answer for this one.
