What algorithm is used to extract keywords from unstructured texts?

I'm using StanfordNLP (java pakage) for twitter sentiment analysis. I want to extract keywords from the tweets, classify the keywords as positive, negative, or neutral, and use those counts to classify the polarity of the tweet. How can this be done in Java? Please share few examples. What is the most used algorithm for keyword extraction?
