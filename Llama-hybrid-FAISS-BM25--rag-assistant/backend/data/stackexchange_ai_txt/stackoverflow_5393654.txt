If you're using any form of continuous integration e.g. cruise control, teamcity, TFS etc then you can easily set up your CI to rebuild you're dependent soutions. Another less elegant solution may be to either have a .sln file that contains all of your projects and work in that solution. Alternatively, you could add a post build event that build the dependent solutions when you make a change.
