The most common generalization is as follows (here I am following Bertrand et al. (2004), but for example Hansen (2007) also considers a similar approach): Let $Y_{ist}$ be the outcome of interest for individual $i$ in group $s$ (such as a state) by time $t$ (such as a year) and $I_{st}$ be a dummy for whether the intervention has affected group $s$ at time $t$ . One then typically estimates the following regression using OLS: $Y_{ist}=A_s+B_t+cX_{ist}+\beta I_{st}+\epsilon_{ist}$ where $A_s$ and $B_t$ are fixed effects for states and years, respectively, $X_{ist}$ are relevant individual controls and $\epsilon_{ist}$ is an error term. The estimated impact of the intervention is then the OLS estimate $\hat \beta$ . When you have panel data the model is conceptually similar, but now you would typically consider individual fixed-effects. See Hansen (2007) -and also be aware of the autocorrelation issues-. Imbens and Wooldridge (2008) provide a good overview and useful references for your question. They also have similar lecture notes focusing in difference-in-differences methods ( http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_10_diffindiffs.pdf ). Bertrand, M., Duflo, E. & Mullainathan, S. (2004).
