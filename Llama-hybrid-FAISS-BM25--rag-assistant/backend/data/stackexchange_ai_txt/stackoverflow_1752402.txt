There's nothing illegal about this markup, at least as far as XML syntax is concerned. It's a clever solution to the problem of having a string of text that must be broken up into segments in two overlapping schemes. You omitted the enclosing tags so it's impossible to intuit the hierarchical structure, but I will assume it's there and makes some attempt to organize things in a logical manner as a narrative. Then there's the need to indicate where the verse breaks are, and in general they can be totally arbitrary. They are really point-events in the flow (their term: milestones). The only thing I'd disagree with is having 'start' and 'end' markers for verses. This introduces a potential for errors since the bracketing of start and end can't be validated within XML itself. I'd have used only 'start' markers. This assumes, of course, that the end of every verse corresponds to the start of another, or the end of a hierarchical section. I.e. it's not possible to have something 'between' two verses.
