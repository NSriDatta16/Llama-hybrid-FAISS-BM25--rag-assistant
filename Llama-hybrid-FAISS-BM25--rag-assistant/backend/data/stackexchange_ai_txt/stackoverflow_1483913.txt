iPhone MKMapKit application randomly crashing

I'm writing an MKMapKit app that allows the user to drag around an annotation. Everything seems to work for the most part, but it crashes every now and then with the following message: 2009-09-27 12:34:18.903 iParkNow![7181:207] *** -[LBSGAddressComponent _mapkit_cache_heapTime]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x195320 2009-09-27 12:34:18.907 iParkNow![7181:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[LBSGAddressComponent _mapkit_cache_heapTime]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x195320' I've had no luck googling for useful information and the iphone forums have nothing useful either. I haven't attached any code since its a bit long. Just wondering if anyone how any idea what would cause this error. Thanks in advance!
