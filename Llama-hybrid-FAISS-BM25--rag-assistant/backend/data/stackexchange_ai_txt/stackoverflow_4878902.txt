xcode displaying file list window when editing

When I cut or paste, and possibly other times, my xcode will suddenly pop open that upper window above my code display, the window that lists the file names and roles and code size. This only started happening today, so I'm wondering if I accidentally triggered some setting. It's really annoying as I drag the horizontal window bar up to cover it so I can maximize my code window view and it comes back down minutes later after some editing action (cut, paste, something). I don't know if this possibly has to do with my having a split window view (two code windows one above the other) perhaps. Does anyone know how to stop this from happening?
