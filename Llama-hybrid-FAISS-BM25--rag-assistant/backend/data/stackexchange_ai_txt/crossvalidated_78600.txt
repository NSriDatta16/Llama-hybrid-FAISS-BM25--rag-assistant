You have too few positive events, so there is very little meaningful information for your classifier to actually figure out what factors to seperate clicking on an ad and not It's worthwhile to do some descriptive statistics. You have some attributes that you are looking at to build your random forest, why not to evaluate the distribution of those attributes between the "clicked" and "not-clicked" ads? You can do a chi-squared test to figure out if any of those attributes are actually informative, the truth is none may be, or only a handful are and everything else is not relevant and should be removed. The next thing that may be interesting to try is to create an artificial training set, which would balance clicks and the non-clicks. Because you have so few positives you may want to consider sampling with replacement. So, imagine building a training set of size 400, with 200 ads that were clicked and 200 ads that were not clicked. It may build a better classifier than your current training set. I would bootstrap this to get a sense of how the selection of a training set impacts your classifier performance.
