Your best bet is probably to calculate a scaling factor for age and gender, either constant or dependent on one/both factors. If it were me I'd transliterate the graph into a matrix with age, gender, and BMI, then take the ratios by gender and age and create a linear fit. Since the two variables probably influence each other, include an interaction term to account for the hetereoskedaciticy. Then you can go back to your data, adjust all your observations appropriately, and take "blind" averages just like you did with adults.
