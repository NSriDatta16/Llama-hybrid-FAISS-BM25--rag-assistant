Android Application Requiring Large Data Files

I am working on an android app that needs to act on a few data files totaling around 30MB . I put together a test and the emulator failed with OutOfDiskSpace . Debugging on a device failed with even a smaller data size. After reading through the google groups, it appears that the application size limit isn't stated anywhere and nobody from google has been forthcoming with specifics about this. Given that there are iPhone apps that are over 100MB in size, putting such a small limit on Android apps seems weird, except just for the fact that you have a relatively small amount of total available app storage space ( 100MB ). Now for my question: What techniques do you use to deal with this limit? If you have an app that needs more than 10MB, do you put it on a web server and deal with downloading it the first time? If so, how do you handle access control so that only your app can get the data?
