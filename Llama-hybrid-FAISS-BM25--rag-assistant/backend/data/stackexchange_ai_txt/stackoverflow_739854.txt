If you truly want to do cross platform development easily I would suggest using one of the already built cross-platform engines like Unity or one of the Garage Games stuff like Torque Game Builder (2D). I have virtually zero experience in either so can't tell you which is better but the Torque Game builder demo couldn't get through the first tutorial without having problems and they don't answer tech support questions in their forums like they claim to do so I can say avoid them if you are a novice in game design like myself. The big thing about Garage Games was supposed to be their great support, I saw zero support and in fact only saw a bunch of, "Hey, anybody here?" posts with no answers so I guess they are pretty much giving up on supporting their products. http://unity3d.com/ http://www.garagegames.com/
