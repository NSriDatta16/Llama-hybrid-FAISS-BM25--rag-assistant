GANs are generally known to be hard to train and to collapse into producing only one "kind" of samples. They work well on images, because the discriminator forces the generator to produce good looking images. But usually (in my experience) you will have a hard time to get a GAN to produce the correct distribution. I think normalizing flows or diffusion models are way more likely to solve that problem.
