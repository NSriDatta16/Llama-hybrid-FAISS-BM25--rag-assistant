Javascript syntax highlighter that plays nicely with Markdown

I've looked at a few Javascript programs to add syntax highlighting to code blocks on a page, but they all the ones I've found require setting an attribute on the code block to tell it what language is being used. I am generating the HTML with Markdown, so I have no way of setting these attributes, are there any that will do this automatically and will not need an attribute to be set? The only way I can think of this working is with a shebang line; #!/usr/bin/ruby def foo(bar) bar end And it will know it's Ruby, and maybe even not display the shebang line (having a shebang for a one or two line fragment will get tiring). I wont be needing it to do any very obscure languages, but it would be great if I could easily write new definitions. Thanks.
