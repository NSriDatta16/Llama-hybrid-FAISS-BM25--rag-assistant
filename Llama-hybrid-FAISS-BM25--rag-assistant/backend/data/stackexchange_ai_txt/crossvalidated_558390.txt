I'm not sure it's better, but there is a different approach if you're using state-space model (SSM) representations of your time series models. In this case, you don't need to pick consecutive observations or periods in the beginning/end of the sample. You simply get a random set of observations for the holdout sample. SSM will be able to imply the dependent variable for the holdout sample - where you set the dependent variable to NA (missing) - regardless of where the observations are. So, you can calculate your predictive performance metrics comparing the implied values with actuals. This liberates your from a very restrictive train/holdout arrangement that you mentioned in your question.
