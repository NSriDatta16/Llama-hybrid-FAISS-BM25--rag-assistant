This is accurate mathematical statistics. See this post for the derivation of the distribution of $R^2$ under the hypothesis that all regressors (bar the constant term) are uncorrelated with the dependent variable ("random predictors"). This distribution is a Beta, with $m$ being the number of predictors without counting the constant term, and $n$ the sample size, $$R^2 \sim Beta\left (\frac {m}{2}, \frac {n-m-1}{2}\right)$$ and so $$E(R^2) = \frac {m/2}{(m/2)+[(n-m-1)/2]} = \frac{m}{n-1}$$ This appears to be a clever way to "justify" the logic behind the adjusted $R^2$: if indeed all regressors are uncorrelated, then the adjusted $R^2$ is "on average" zero.
