Can a neural network have an image as its output layer?

According to what I've read, the output layer of a neural network is going to either perform "classification" or "regression". In regression, a numerical value is chosen on a single output node, and in classification, a choice is made of the "best" or "favorite" answer. If my output layer were to represent an image, it needs to have an output neuron expressing a value for each pixel, but I'm not sure how to do this. Is it even possible? I'm wondering because the examples of regression I've seen have all been using multiple variables to predict one value. I want multiple inputs to predict multiple outputs.
