I think the wiki author is somewhat limited in their knowledge of mean imputation. If I were fitting a regression model for the mean of $Y$ as a linear combination of $X$ and $W$, but $X$ has missing values, mean imputation would not impute the missing values of $X$ with $\bar{X}$. I would have to impute those values with $E[X|W, Y]$ to get an unbiased estimator. In bivariate analyses, imputing $\bar{X}$ has no impact on the slope $\hat{\beta}$ because it is a 0 leverage point. Not true in higher dimensions, but still the wrong approach regardless. Mean imputation is generally bad practice. Using a proper conditional mean imputation, while unbiased, tends to underestimate the standard errors. Mean imputation fails to take into account any possible sampling variability in the missing values. Multiple imputation provides far better estimation and is not biased.
