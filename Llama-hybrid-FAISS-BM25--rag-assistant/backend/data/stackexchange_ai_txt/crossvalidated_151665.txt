What is the conceptual difference between doing direct PCA vs. using the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix? PCA is done on a covariance or correlation matrix, but spectral clustering can take any similarity matrix (e.g. built with cosine similarity) and find clusters there. Second, spectral clustering algorithms are based on graph partitioning (usually it's about finding the best cuts of the graph), while PCA finds the directions that have most of the variance. Although in both cases we end up finding the eigenvectors, the conceptual approaches are different. And finally, I see that PCA and spectral clustering serve different purposes: one is a dimensionality reduction technique and the other is more an approach to clustering (but it's done via dimensionality reduction)
