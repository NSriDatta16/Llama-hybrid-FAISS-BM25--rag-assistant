Probably much less advantage than minifying JS, since you definitely can't change the CSS style attribute names. Most of the time, those take up the most space in CSS files. All you can do is shortening ID/class names and removing superfluous whitespace. I'd guess average savings of somewhere around 10% in the HTML/CSS part. Also, what Greg said.
