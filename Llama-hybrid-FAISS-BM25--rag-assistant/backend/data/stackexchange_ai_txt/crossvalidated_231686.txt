How do we know the expected value of Y given X? (population regression function)

Why does $E(Y|X)=B_0+B_1X$ give exactly the conditional expectation of $Y$ for a given $X$ value? I don't understand how we can know the average value of $Y$ for a given $X$ value. In my drawing I circled an obervation (x). How do we know now, given only this oberservation, that the average of $Y$ given $X$ is on the line? Wouldn't we we need more obervations for this given $X$ value to conclude where the average is? I'm quite confused, I hope you understand what I mean.
