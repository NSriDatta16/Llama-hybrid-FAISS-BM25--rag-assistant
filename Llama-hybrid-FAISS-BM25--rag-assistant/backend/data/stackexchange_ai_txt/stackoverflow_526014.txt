I can think of one possible solution but I'm not sure if it's particularly elegant (or what you're looking for). Expanding on the idea of an input parameter to the SP, could you not just add some logic (CASE or IF statement) to call a Select Count() over the script when it comes from the dashboard? It would need adding to each SP but as long as it's documented it shouldn't cause too many problems for future developers.
