Is there a ticket system that also does project management?

Were looking to roll out a ticket system that also has project management capability. We're currently using Trac but we find that it's really difficult to config and also has very weak support with workflows. Ideally we want a system that has: A ticket system that supports workflow Integrates well with window's Active Directory for user management Has good integration with our source management (SVN) Has project management functions and reporting. At the very least some sort of Gantt chart. Project manager needs to be able to pick tickets and features to go into a certain milestone/sprint The interface to this system needs to be accessible from any platform (windows, mac etc). What system should we use? What are your experiences? We are looking at a few examples like Jira, FogBugz, TFS, Jass, etc etc. There's just too many, looking for recommendations. We are a commercial shop so cost is not an issue.
