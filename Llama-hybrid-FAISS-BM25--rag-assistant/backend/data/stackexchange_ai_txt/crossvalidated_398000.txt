I have done more reading on primary literature since posting the questions. I want to post what I have learnt since then and hopefully that might be helpful for someone else. I cannot guarantee that these new findings are absolutely correct. So please feel free to comment and correct any wrong understandings here. If we treat $\sigma$ as known, $Q$ follows an exact Chi-square distribution. The proof is similar to proving $(n-1)S^2/\sigma^2$ follows Chi-square distribution. Using weighted average in the calculation does not break the Chi-square distribution. However, in practice, $\sigma$ is not actually known. It is calculated based on data in primary literature and treated as known. This is what makes the distribution asymptotic. This 1982 paper by Hedges seems to be the first paper that address the distribution property of the Q statistic. It only works in the settings of meta-analysis because $\sigma$ is treated as known. In linear mixed model, $\sigma$ is unknown and has to be estimated. If we use the estimated $\sigma$ in calculating Q, the Q statistics does not have Chi-square distribution any more. In fact, if $\sigma$ is estimated in the absence of any random effect (i.e. in a linear model), Q is actually always n-1. It is indeed a Wald test. And Wald test tends to be anti-conservative in linear mixed model. Because Wald test is based on asymptotic theory, sample size influences its performance. I think this is why the anti-conservative problem is less severe in meta-analysis. In a meta-analysis, the random effect $s_j$ is for each $\theta_{ij}$ and thus we have a large sample size to estimate $\tau$ . For example, if we compiled 100 effect size estimates for a meta-analysis without any moderator, we have 99 degrees of freedom to estimate $\tau$ . In a normal linear mixed model, we often don't have that many samples to estimate random effect. For example, we may do an experiment in a few randomly chosen fields or conduct an experiment in several randomly chosen schools. This makes the anti-conservative property of the Wald test a more severe concern in general for linear mixed model. However, such anti-conservative problem is recognized in meta-analysis literature as well. Adjustments such as the Knapp-Hartung method has been proposed to at least partially resolve this issue.
