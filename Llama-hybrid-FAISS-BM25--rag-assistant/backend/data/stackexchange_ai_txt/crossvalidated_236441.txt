Averaging regression output

I have multiple logistic model outputs with the same predictors. The dependent response is very similar changing slightly randomly. I would like to take an average of the coefficients of all models. But I'm concerned that some coefficients may be large with non-significant p values and other differences. How can I get an overall average measure of effect for each predictor while considering the standard error/statistic/p-value aspects? I thought of penalizing the coefficient each time it is not significant at a predetermined threshold. Something like: #Edit:: This has been concluded to be the wrong way mdl_list .05, 0, tbl$estimate) tbl } ) If an alternative approach to average effect exists, please point me in the right direction. Edit I have tried the meta-analysis in the metafor package. I even emailed the authors, they said that if this is not for summarizing multiple studies, metafor will not work. Example: The b variables are response, the q variables are predictors. #Data set.seed(143) b Edit 2 I may have to combine the different brands into one y variable and repeat the question responses: y The predictors q are questions like on a scale of 1-5 how much do you agree with this statement, "Store brands are just as good as name brands", "Organic foods are worth their price", "I look for discounts when I go to the supermarket". The response variables b are questions like "Do you eat Dannon yogurt?", "Do you eat Campbell's soup?", "Do you eat at McDonald's?". The hypothesis is that there are some attitudes questions that are better than others at predicting brand usage. If I run a logistic regression: $ShopMcD's = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Attitude_1 + ... + \beta_n Attitude_n$ I can see how much each question affects the log odds ratio of shopping at McDonald's. The higher ups want to see this continued for all of the food brands to see the effect each question has on brand usage overall. An example project delivery statement would be: "We find that attitudes questions 2, 4, and 6 have the least effect on average over all other questions. These questions are the least predictive of food brand usage compared to others and are candidates for removal from the survey."
