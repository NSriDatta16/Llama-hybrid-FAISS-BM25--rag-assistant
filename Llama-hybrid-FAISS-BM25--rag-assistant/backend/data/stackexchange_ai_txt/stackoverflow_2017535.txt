If you ever hope to i18n your program, stay away from iostreams. The problem is that it can be impossible to properly localize your strings if the sentence is composed of multiple fragments as is done with iostream. Besides the issue of message fragments, you also have an issue of ordering. Consider a report that prints a student's name and their grade point average: std::cout When you translate that to another language, the other language's grammar may need you to show the GPA before the name. AFAIK, iostreams has not way to reorder the interpolated values. If you want the best of both worlds (type safety and being able to i18n), use Boost.Format .
