Machine learning applications in number theory

Is there any research into or applications of machine learning in number theory? I am also looking for (leading examples of) statistical/empirical analysis of number theory questions. Also wondering if genetic algorithms in particular have ever been used in these areas. roughly related question on other site: Why can machine learning not recognize prime numbers? an area in number theory that seems to have had some statistical analysis, the Collatz conjecture . possibly somewhat related, automated theorem proving .
