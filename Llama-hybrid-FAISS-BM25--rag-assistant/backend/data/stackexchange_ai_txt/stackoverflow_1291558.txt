S. Lott already gave a good list of general reasons why one might want to split that up onto multiple tablespaces. More specific to your situation... I would ask myself if there are specific reasons to change things now. It's no small task to make a structural change like that. Are there performance issues? Are you running against storage space limits? Do you need to assign space quotas? Does your present backup and restore plan meet your needs? If you could go back in time and redo things from the beginning you would certainly want to plan to sensibly divide the database into different table spaces. But is it worth it now?
