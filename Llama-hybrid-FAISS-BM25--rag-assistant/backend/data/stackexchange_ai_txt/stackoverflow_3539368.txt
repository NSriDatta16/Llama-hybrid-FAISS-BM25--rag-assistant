Not sure if this is good etiquette. I couldn't fit all my comments into a normal comment, and the post has no activity for 8 months. Just wanted to see how this was going for you? We have a very very very similar situation where I work - only the simulation is written in C and the storage format is binary files. Every time a boss wants a different summary we have to make/modify handwritten code to do summaries. Our binary files are about 10 GB in size and there is one of these for every year of the simulation, so as you can imagine, things get hairy when we want to run it with different seeds and such. I've just discovered pyTables and had a similar idea to yours. I was hoping to change our storage format to hdf5 and then run our summary reports/queries using pytables. Part of this involves joining tables from each year. Have you had much luck doing these types of "joins" using pytables?
