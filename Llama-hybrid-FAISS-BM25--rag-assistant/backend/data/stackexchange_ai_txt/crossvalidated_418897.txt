I would create a dummy variable that is equal to 1 for all values after the "treatment" and is equal to 0 for all values before the treatment. It's sloppy, but you can collapse across the months by taking the average value of the "Pts percent_with_procedure . Then run a regression of the form: lm(percent_with_procedure + treatment) Looking at the p-values on treatment will tell you if the treatment was effective with a classical significance test.
