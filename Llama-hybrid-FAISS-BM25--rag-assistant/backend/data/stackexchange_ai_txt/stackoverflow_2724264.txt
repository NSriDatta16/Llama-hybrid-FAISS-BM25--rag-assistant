Is there a way to automatically add classes in multi-level lists with jQuery?

I have a multi-level lists like this: Item 1 Item 1's 1st Child Item 1's 1st Grandchild Item 1's Grand Grandchild Item 1's 2nd Grandchild Item 1's 3rd Grandchild Item 1's 2nd Child Item 1's 3rd Child Item 2 I want for each li to have class 'level' according to their positions. The result would be like this: Item 1 Item 1's 1st Child Item 1's 1st Grandchild Item 1's Grand Grandchild Item 1's 2nd Grandchild Item 1's 3rd Grandchild Item 1's 2nd Child Item 1's 3rd Child Item 2 Is there a way to achieve this with jQuery? Thank you very much for your attention.
