By "manage access to" I mean that the average user would not be able to save the page and save the image with it. If they want to view the image again, they would have to revisit, re-request it. Flash streaming server offers that, but are there non-flash/adobe solutions to compare it to. Give up. What you want is impossible. Any content that can be viewed can be copied and no technology on earth can change this. There is no gain in making your site confusing for the average user who only wants to save the image so they can send it to their friend. Give up.
