It is a multi layered methodological onion to be peeled. I will only be able to deal with the top layers both because of the lack of time and the lack on knowledge. I will base this answer in the very clear statement of the goals of the analysis: in bold in the OP: We would like to know if Treatment 2 (Dietary Supplement 2) has the same effect (or even better) on body composition than Treatment 1, while not having those adverse effects on blood profiles. 1) There is no need for the control group - you want to compare two groups Treatment1 and Treatment2 - this is good because you can do 2 group tests without multiple comparisons - (at least in principle) instead of multiple group tests _ post hoc tests 2) Let us assume that you have a single measure of body composition, say B. You want to show that T2 (treatment 2) is at least as good as T1 on the B measure. A big problem here. All the tests you mentioned are tests to show that one group of measures is different than another, not to show that it is at least as good . Yes, you can use a standard 2 group test (say t-test - forget about Gaussian and non-Gaussian data for a while) and show that the B measures for T2 are significantly different (and better) than that of T1. If you are lucky, and you get the significant difference than you can show that T2 is better than T1 and thus, at least as good. But if you are not lucky, then what did you get - the fact that the p-value is high does not tell you that the two sets of measures are the same (and thus T2 is as least as good as T1) , it tells you dont have enough data to show that there is a difference!! So what you need for the B measure is a non-inferiority test (or an equivalence test). I will not get into it - there are many answers in CV on equivalence tests. But my point 1 above is important because the non-inferiority tests I know (TOST for example) only work with two groups! 3) Let us assume you have only one blood measure (C). You want to show that T2 is better than T1 on the C measure, and here standard tests - the ones that show difference - are the appropriate tool. You show that the difference on the measure C for T1 and T2 are significantly different (and that T2 is better) and thus that T2 has significantly better on the blood profile. 4) Another problem is that you dont have a single measurement of B (and C) for each subject. You have 3 measurements at 3 different times I dont really know what to do with the 3 measurements per subject. Notice that this is not a within-subject that matters to the research question - the 3 measurements are on the same subject but we are comparing the set of subjects in T1 and T2, and the subjects in T1 and T2 are not paired or the same. I guess that I would treat the 3 timed measurements as 3 independent measurements to get a better estimate of the true value of B (and C) for each subject. Thus I would just average the three timed measurements into a single one. (I understand one would lose the information on variability by averaging the data but it is unclear to me where this information of variability of the B measurements would be useful for the research question). 4) The next problem is that there in no single B measure for body composition there are many different measures such as Body Weight, Body Mass Index, Body Fat Mass,which are probably correlated). Let us call them Ba, Bb, Bc and so on. (Notice that this is not the 3 measurements in time for each subject discussed above, they are different measures - I used measurements in the item above, and measures here) You can run the procedure described so far (up to item 3 above) for each body measure (average the 3 measurements per subject, perform a non-inferiotity test on the two sets of data) on each Ba Bb Bc measure, and report the results. The same for all the blood measures Ca and Cb, and so on. But then you are making a lot of comparisons and test. In this example there would be 5 tests results (Ba Bb Bc Ca and Cb). Therefore you should also have a multiple comparison procedure to adjust the p-values!! (This is very uncommon - people usually do not do p-value adjusting for different tests - only for a single, multiple group test - but they should do it). On the other hand, the measures Ba Bb and Bc are very correlated, and thus the results of the tests are not independent - and I dont know how to do the p-value adjustement (Notice that the Bonferroni correction assumes that each of the tests are independent - exactly the opposite of the situation here). I will stop the answer at this time. Hopefully more knowledgeable CV contributors will be able to provide better answers, specially to points 3 and 4 above which are at the limit of my knowledge.
