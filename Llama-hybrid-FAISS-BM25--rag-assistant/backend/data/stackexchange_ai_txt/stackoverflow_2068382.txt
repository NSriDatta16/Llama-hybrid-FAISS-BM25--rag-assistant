Move folders across projects in the same repository in Subversion

I am trying to move folders across projects within the same repository. So I intend to use the svn move command or right click and drag the folder. Does this seem ok and wil it ensure that no revisions are lost? Also there are some svn properties on the folders so does move keep those properties intact? I have tried right clig and drag and then select SVN Copy and add files to WC option which gives me this message "Could not copy files. Access is denied." How can I fix this?
