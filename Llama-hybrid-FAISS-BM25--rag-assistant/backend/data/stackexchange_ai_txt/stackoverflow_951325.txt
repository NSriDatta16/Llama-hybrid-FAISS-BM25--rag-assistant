Web devs who have made the switch from MySQL, what postgresql features could you now not do without?

I'm contemplating the switch (mainly because of the more permissive license), and tend to hear a lot of Internet murmuring about how much better Postgres is than MySQL, but not many specifics. What do you do in Postgres that make you more productive, or you find elegant? It doesn't have to be fancy, for example some of my favorite things about MySQL include easy primary key incrementing with AUTOINCREMENT (having to write a generator for every table seems more of a pain than it should be for such a common requirement), "LIMIT,OFFSET" statements (makes for easy pagination) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE (makes inserting/updating "many to many" tables quick and painless)
