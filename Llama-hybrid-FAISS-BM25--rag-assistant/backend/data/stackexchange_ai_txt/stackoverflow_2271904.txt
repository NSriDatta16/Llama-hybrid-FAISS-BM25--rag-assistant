The example you are refering to is using ExtJS it looks like. There's also jqGrid (an extension to jQueryUI), and others. If you are looking for an ASP.Net Ajax grid control there are several options from many different component vendors (Component One, Infragistics, DevXPress etc). I'm only presuming here that you want a server-oriented Grid component because of the term "GridView" in the question. I would suggest searching for: "ASP.Net Ajax" grid control. This will give you results that may best suit your needs.
