Here's the answer. The problem is that the LUT is being applied twice, so before calling the copy, call: Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_MAP_COLOR, Gl.GL_FALSE); Then, once done, call: Gl.glPixelTransferi(Gl.GL_MAP_COLOR, Gl.GL_TRUE); That way, the 'extreme clamping' I was describing is removed. @thing2k-- your solution causes the copy to happen outside the graphics card, so slows down the drawing on mouse drag, but doesn't fix the double clamp.
