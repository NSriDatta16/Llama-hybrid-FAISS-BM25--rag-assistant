xtunitroot fisher does nothing but combining the $p$ -values of individual unit root tests via $$-2\sum_i\ln(p_i).$$ So if you are concerned that you need different lag lengths for the different series in the panel, you can construct $p$ -values for each time series test via dfgls and easily combine these using the above formaula.
