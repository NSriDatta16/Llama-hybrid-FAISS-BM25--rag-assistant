You are sending pretty few headers with your request. It is very possible that they wrote their script so that it expects certain headers to be present. Headers that I can think of off the top of my head are: User-Agent (identifies your browser and version; you can pretend to be Firefox, for example) Referer (identifies the URL you came from; put the homepage URL in here) Accept-Charset , Accept-Encoding , Accept-Language but there may be others. You can probably use the Fiddler tool you mentioned to find out what headers Firefox (or whatever browser youâ€™re using) sends with normal (non-HTTPS) requests and then add some of them to your request and see whether that makes it work. (Personally, I use TamperData for this purpose, which is a Firefox plugin.)
