Estimation using nested data

I want to estimate the average income for a location. I have nested data in the following way: A block is inside a neighborhood, which is inside a zipcode, which is inside a district, which is inside a region, which is inside a state. I want to estimate the average income at a block level, and the issue is that I don't have much data at that level. I have much more data at a state level, but it is not such a good approximation. How would you deal with this problem? Are there any ways to incorporate the uncertainty of not having many data points at a block level? Are there any Bayesian frameworks that allow us to incorporate data of all levels? Can it be mixed models?
