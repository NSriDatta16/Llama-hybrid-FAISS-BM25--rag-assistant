FileSystemWatcher have a drawback, it locks watched folder, so, for example, if you are watching file on removable storage, it prevent "safe device removal". You can try using Shell Notifications via SHChangeNotifyRegister . In this case you will have one entry point for all changes (or several if you want to), but in this case you will need some native shell interop.
