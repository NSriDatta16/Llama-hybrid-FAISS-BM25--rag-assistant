Test for linear separability

Is there a way to test linear separability of a two-class dataset in high dimensions? My feature vectors are 40-long. I know I can always run logistic regression experiments and determine hitrate vs false alarm rate to conclude whether the two classes are linearly separable or not but it would be good to know if there already exists a standard procedure to do that.
