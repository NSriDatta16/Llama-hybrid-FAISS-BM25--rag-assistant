I found a few problems in your approach, namely: Single Link (SLINK) is a hierarchical clustering technique. When you cluster individual chunks of data (subsets) you will get a dendrogram (similar to a tree) of data, where the items that are closer to each other are clustered first and the branches near the top indicate sub-families that are more unlike each other. With your approach, if you merge these dendrogram at the top, you will lose this relationship and you are automatically stating that items within each subset of your data are more similar (there is less distance) to each other compared to items in another sub-tree. Of course, this is OK if you first select the subsets of your data in an intelligent manner. If you were to use SLINK or brute force to organise the subsets of data into partitions that are most similar to each other, you would take $O(n^2)$ time, although you might be happy with using a heuristic approach if you can accept a sub-optimal solution. The second flaw that I notice is that you assume that using SLINK to merge $P$ items takes $O(1)$ time when it should take $O(P)$ time. For large n, if you divide the n items into a small constant number of groups, $\frac{n}{p}$ where $p$ is constant, $O(\frac{n}{p})$ is still $O(n)$.
