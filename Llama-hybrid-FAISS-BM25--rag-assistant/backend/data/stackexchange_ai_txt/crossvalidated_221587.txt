You number of criminals relative to the number of non-criminals will be very low. This can cause some issues in certain cases, You may be better off using Poisson regression to estimate counts and relative risks rather than log odds (the output from logistic regression that can be converted to probabilities). Also, on the multicolinearity issue. This could result in an underestimation of significance, but if your model is theory-driven and replicating something that is "tried and true" - no big deal. If you are trying to tests a new hypothesis, is there a sufficient reason to group certain states together that seem to have colinearity? Stratify by certain attributes and reduce the number of independent variables? That would make a simpler model which is generally better if it is still useful for your project. Also, when you convert back to probabilities, you will not be able to break them into quintiles like you imagine. Your highest predicted probability of committing a crime in your dataset may be 20%. you will have to split you probibilites after thay are calculated into groups. I would suggest just splitting into 2 groups, maybe three at most. With the stepwise, don't rely on that. the number of variables you are dealing with is small enough that you can evaluate what should be put in and what should not. The only reason to allow the computer to so this for you is if there are so many variables it becomes to inefficient to do otherwise. You can use this to HELP you decide the variables and evaluate quickly the impact of including diffferent combinations. But in the end it is your hypothesis and reaoning that has to stand the test, not what the computer picks. Stepwise regression can be great for breaking into your data and looking at possible variables to include by comparing the resulting models, but in the end, you need to present good reasons for including the variables you do.
