I enjoyed Zivot's "Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS" that is quite accessible in the light of its advanced content. Zivot is soon to release a new book "Modeling Financial Time Series with R" which I am very much looking forward to. For multivariate time series analysis, you may check out LÃ¼tkepohl's "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" . It is quite thorough and clearly written. I never liked Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis" ; my time series professor also noted that it is not a book to study from, although it might serve well as a reference. He suggested trying Brockwell & Davis' "Time Series: Theory and Methods" , but it might be outdated (1991). Tsay has two books that are up to date and quite good, "Analysis of Financial Time Series" and "Multivariate Time Series Analysis: With R and Financial Applications" , but they may not be an easy read for a first-timer.
