You need to estimate a probability $p$ of a "conversion" (purchase) given a click for each ad. (It sounds like you're assuming that the probability of a conversion is the same for each click, which is reasonable.) The Bayesian way to do this is to estimate a distribution over $p$, which is Beta and has shape parameters $a$ equal to the number of conversions plus $a'$, and $b$ equal to the number of clicks that didn't result in a conversion plus $b'$. $a'$ and $b'$ represents your prior. Use $(\frac12, \frac12)$ for a Jeffreys' prior. In order to "fall back" to the global average, there are a variety of ways of setting $a', b'$ according to all of the data. To get the estimate of $p$ out of your estimator with parameters $a, b$, you could choose the maximum likelihood value, the mode of the Beta distribution. In answer to your edits: The conversions are not Beta-distributed, but Bernoulli-distributed with probability $p$. Please compare how I am setting $a$ and $b$ in paragraph 2 with what you wrote. Note that you have a $p$ for each ad, and thus a belief over $p$ for each ad, and each of those beliefs has its own $a$ and $b$. The Bayesian update is $$P(p \mid x) \propto P(p)P(x \mid p)$$ where $x$ is the observation (conversion or no conversion) and $p$ is selected for the appropriate ad. This formula is already worked into the update for $a$ and $b$, which works so that in case of a conversion you add 1 to $a$, otherwise you add 1 to $b$ â€” this is updating the belief of $p$. The Jeffreys' prior is not the same thing as the uninformative prior, but I believe that it's better unless you have a good reason to use it. Feel free to ask another question if you want to start a discussion about that.
