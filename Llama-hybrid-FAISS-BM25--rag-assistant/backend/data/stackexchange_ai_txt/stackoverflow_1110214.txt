Demo here . Does this replicate your issue? I am able to drag between the two however you do lose the helper when you drag out of or into the dialogue. I think it may need to adjust the z-indexing when you move out or in of the dialog but it is still functional...just! I'll try to sort this when I have a bit more time later. UPDATE: tweaking the z-index helps (well helps dragging from the list to the dialogue - the first time!)...will make it better later! see here NEW UPDATE New Demo here, I had to make use of the helper to ensure the z-index stayed correct. Works now here
