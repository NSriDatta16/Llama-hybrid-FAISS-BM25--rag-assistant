Is it possible to fit a logistic regression model to a dataset with categorical predictive variables with very high number of levels each?

I want to fit a model to a very large dataset, with a standard binary response variable and with 3 categorical predictor variables with 3000, 15 and 2 levels. Is there any inherent problem in this case, if I want to use logistic regression? Will it be computationally manageable using R?
