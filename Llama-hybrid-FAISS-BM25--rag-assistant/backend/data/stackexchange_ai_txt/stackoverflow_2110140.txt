The example you saw doing that was probably checking for one or more things in the headers and acting upon what it saw. For example, it could inspect USER_AGENT ACCEPT ACCEPT_ENCODING etc, etc, etc. For you to do this in PHP, you will need your check to be run before your SoapServer gets the request. You can access the header values by inspecting $ SERVER. Most of them will start with HTTP . To get started just print_r($_SERVER);
