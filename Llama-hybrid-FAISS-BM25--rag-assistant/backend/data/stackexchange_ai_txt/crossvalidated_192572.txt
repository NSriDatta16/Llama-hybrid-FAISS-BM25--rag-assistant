Concrete examples of a frequentist approach that is superior to a Bayesian one

Can you help me understand the frequentist point of view in the bayesian vs frequentist debate? I have read a lot and all the sources I found are either filled with complex equations or written from a bayesian point of view, or both. I have not found a single sample problem where the frequentist approach would produce more useful output than the bayesian approach. I feel like I only understand one side of this debate and I would like to understand the other side as well. I do not have any background in statistics, so I would appreciate simple examples of cases where frequentist methods produce more value than bayesian methods. A nice example would be a betting scenario where a frequentist and bayesian bet against each other about some future outcome and the frequentist has positive expected value.
