I'm pretty sure you can't do exactly what you're asking here. It might help, however, if you explained what you're trying to do. There may be some other way. update: You could consider putting your HTML fragments into seperate files. This would allow you to define them without having to do any reformatting of the HTML. In a similar manner you could put them into a database or even into resource files. I'm still not 100% clear why you want these HTML fragments defined as variables, but these approaches would work.
