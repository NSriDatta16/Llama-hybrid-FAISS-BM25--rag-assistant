When a row is selected in a table, how can I inform the detail view about which row was selected?

In my app I am using a navigation controller that uses a table view to organize data. Now when the user selects a row a detail view pushed onto the stack. This detail view is the same no matter which row is selected. The only difference is that depending on which row was selected, my detail view will load data corresponding to the selected row from a saved .plist file. So I was wondering how can I inform my detail view about which row was selected in my table view.
