Are you using py2app and distributing a package? If so, you can set LSBackgroundOnly in info.plist. right-click on your package choose *Show Package Contents* double click on info.plist in Contents to open the property list editor Add Child "Application is background only" (That makes the application invisible. If your application has a UI and you just want to hide the dock icon, use LSUIElement, which is "Application is agent" in the property list editor.)
