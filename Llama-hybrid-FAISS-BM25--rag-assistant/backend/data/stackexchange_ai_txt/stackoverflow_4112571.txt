Hi Jules Follow the steps below to set the backgound image to tableview. This works!! I have tried it. STEP-1 In your xib put your tableview and allocate it's delegate and datasource fields to File's Owner. STEP-2 Now Drag a imageView on to your tableview and resize it to size of your View. select the image you want to display in the background using the Inspector. STEP-3 Select the imageView and Go to Menu "Layout -> Send to Back" STEP-4 Select your tableview and set background color as "clear color" from the Inspector. Hope this solves your problem.
