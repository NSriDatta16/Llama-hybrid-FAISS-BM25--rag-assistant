There are two questions here. 1) Why is the first attempt failing with errors? and 2) how to get results from Saxon? 1) The first attempt fails because you're using an XSLT 1.0 processor. As the page you referenced says, XSLTJSON is an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet to transform arbitrary XML to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). ... If you do not have an XSLT 2.0 processor, you can use XSLTJSON Lite, which is an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet to transforms XML to the JSONML format. So if you use XSLTJSON Lite , your problems should be solved. 2) If you still want to try Saxon, this page looks useful . Rather than calling Saxon directly, it uses // set the TransformFactory to use the Saxon TransformerFactoryImpl method System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory", "net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl"); before the TransformerFactory tfactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
