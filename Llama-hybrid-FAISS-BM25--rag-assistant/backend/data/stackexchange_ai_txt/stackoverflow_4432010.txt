You may want to consider creating a separate, de-normalized, 'history' table which is inserted to at the same time any new photo is inserted, containing the album id, the date the photo was inserted, and any columns you may want for displaying results in this history table. You can then select off this table based on the photo_creation_date (I don't think album creation date will help you here.) This has the added benefit of separating any queries you run based on the photo creation date from other insert/update/read operations being performed against the photo and albums that do not have anything to do with the photo creation date. I.E. saving you an extra index on the photoalbum and pictures tables. This does cost you in extra storage and insert operations, but it results in faster read speeds. You also will have to be careful in your maintenance of the history table. Deletes/Updates/Inserts of the photo and photoalbum tables will need to update the history table as well.
