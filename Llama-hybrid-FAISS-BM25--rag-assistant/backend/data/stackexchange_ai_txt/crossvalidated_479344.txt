forecast of a time series model by taking into account over/under cost

Let $T$ denote a univariate time series data, and $c_1$ represent the cost of one unit of over forecasting and $c_2$ represent the cost of one unit of under forecasting. Suppose we can estimate $c_1$ and $c_2$ (i.e., cost of over forecasting and under forecasting), then, can we take them into account in our model such that the cost of forecast is minimized?
