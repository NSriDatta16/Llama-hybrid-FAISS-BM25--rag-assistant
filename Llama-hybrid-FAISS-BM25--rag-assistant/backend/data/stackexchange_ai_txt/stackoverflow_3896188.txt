I've encountered this problem. This best I've managed to do is have two functions for averaging: one for integrals and one for fractionals: avgInt :: (Integral i, Fractional f) => [i] -> f avgInt xs = fromIntegral (sum xs) / fromIntegral (length xs) avgFrac :: (Fractional f) => [f] -> f avgFrac xs = sum xs / fromIntegral (length xs)
