How to approach forecasting time-series data

I'm statistics newbie and any help in picking a good method to analyze the data that I have would be very welcome: We have a customer that has an active Facebook page, that gets posted on regularity. I have data on their last, say, 200 posts (from the last month) - how many likes the post got and time it was posted. If we assume that all the content is received equally well, I'm trying to alter their posting times so that the content will get more views and consequently more likes/comments/etc. What I'd like is to figure the probability that posting in 11am on tuesday will gain X more likes than posting on 10 am tues. It would be good if this can be easily retrained as new data from posts come in. I've been looking on some methods to this and K-nearest neighbors or Neural networks seem most likely to work fine (maybe SVM can be adapted for this too). Thank you for your help! PS: I'm attaching a graph of the sample data. Since I only have data for a month, I figured I'd separate the week into 168 1-hour segments. X-axis is hour of the week (from 0 to 168) and y-axis is the engagement the post got: UPDATE: The real data is very unevenly spaced, e.g. 4 posts made in the morning, and no posts until the late evening. How would you recommend to proceed with that? I think resampling will lead to data loss.
