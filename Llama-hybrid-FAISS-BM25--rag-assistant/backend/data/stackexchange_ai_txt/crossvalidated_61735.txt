what value should be ideally used as the 'correctly labelled accuracy'? The one you're testing - the one without randomized labels that you wanted to assess the probability of. However, the 'correctly labelled accuracy' can also vary around a mean, simply because during k-fold cross-validation, different instances are assigned into different k-fold splits, resulting sometimes in good sometimes in better or worse values Your first paragraph makes some assertions. What was the basis on which they were made? In particular, the reference to the accuracy of a 'specific classifier' is not the same thing as a collection of related classifiers that result from that cross-validation you were discussing.
