UISlider to represent the color spectrum

I have a UISlider that is supposed to update the color of a textlabel. Now I want the user to be able to choose between all colors in the spectrum (sort of all anyway). I was thinking of using this UISlider to represent the colors and when dragging the slider the value/color changes. I know the spectrum is not sequential like: [0,0,0]...[255,0,0]...[255,1,0]...[255,255,0] etc. So: any tip on how I can implement this?
