with php you can get the IP address and the User Agent of their browser like so IP: $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] User Agent: $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] sadly its not the perfect way but it does minimize abuse. You could strengthen this by using a login system and storing what the person has voted on using cookies. but even then its still not perfect.
