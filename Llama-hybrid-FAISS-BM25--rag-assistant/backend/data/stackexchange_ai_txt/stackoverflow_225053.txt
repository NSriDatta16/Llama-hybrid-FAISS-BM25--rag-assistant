TestDriven.NET has the ability to test (NUnit/MSTest/etc) with Team Coverage (which you already have since you have Team System : Dev). Walkthrough: here (you also get the coverage results window for looking at the coverage per method) - but this says it all: (source: mutantdesign.co.uk ) You can use NUnit tests, but use the MS IDE integration for colorization, percentagaes, etc (no need for NCover). I use this all the time ;-p The advantages are: no need to set up a "Test Run Configuration" (sorry, MSFT, but an own-goal there) fully integrated with VS (Code Coverage Results and Coloring) easy to use (just right-click -> Test With -> Team Coverage) easy to debug too (right-click -> Test With -> Debugger) easy to use the separate NUnit/NCover apps if you want (right-click etc)
