First try to understand what the median is: it is the middle value in the sorted list of values. Once you understand that, the approach is two steps: sort the values in either order pick the middle value (if not an odd number of values, pick the average of the two middle values) Example: Median of 0 1 3 7 9 10: 5 (because (7+3)/2=5) Median of 0 1 3 7 9 10 11: 7 (because 7 is the middle value) So, to sort dates you need a numerical value; you can get their time stamp (as seconds elapsed from epoch) and use the definition of median.
