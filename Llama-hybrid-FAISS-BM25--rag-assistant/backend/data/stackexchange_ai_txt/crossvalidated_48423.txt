I'm not certain but it sounds like you have a problem of quasi-complete separation. Paul Allison wrote an excellent paper dealing with this . He uses SAS but the paper really applies to any software package. Per @Rolando2 's request, Allison's basic points (without his introduction and theory and so on) are that, for quasi-complete separation: You can delete the variable that causes the separation You can combine categories in the problem variable, if there is a sensible way to do so You can ignore the problem and report likelihood ratio chi squares for other variables in the model (this one surprised me) If it is a small N, you can use exact inference. You can use Bayesian methods You can use penalized maximum likelihood but that for complete separation, only the first and last options are available.
