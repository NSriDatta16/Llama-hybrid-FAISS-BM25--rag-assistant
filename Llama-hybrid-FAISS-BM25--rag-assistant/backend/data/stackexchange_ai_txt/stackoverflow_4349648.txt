KDE won't automount dvd on CentOS

This is driving me crazy. I have CentOS 5.5 installed running KDE desktop. I have an NEC 3550 DVDRW drive on /dev/hda . When I put in a DVD, I want it to automount it and provide an icon on the desktop, as well as under /media mount point. It will not automount. Automount is running. HALD is running. Drive is on /dev/hda. It is NOT listed in /etc/fstab. There is NOT a remove policy setup for hald-addon-storage for polling. I can read from the drive using dd. K3B burn utility can see the drive and read disk info. Running eject and eject -t ejects the drive ok. I cannot mount from the command line. Says: mount: block device /dev/hda is write-protected, mounting read-only mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda, missing codepage or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail or so dmesg says: ide: failed opcode was: unknown ATAPI device hda: Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05) Cannot read medium - incompatible format -- (asc=0x30, ascq=0x02) The failed "Read Subchannel" packet command was: "42 02 40 01 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 " hfs: unable to parse mount options attempt to access beyond end of device hda: rw=0, want=68, limit=4 isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=hda, iso_blknum=16, block=16 To me, seems like some kind of media format issue, but I have no idea. Ideas?
