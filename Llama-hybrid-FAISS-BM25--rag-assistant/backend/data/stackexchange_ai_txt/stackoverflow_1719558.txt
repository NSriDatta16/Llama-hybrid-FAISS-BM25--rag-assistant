jQuery toggle on each?

im using jquery to toggle some paragraphs. its pretty easy with just one paragraph but say i have a very generic setup. the second paragraph is initially hidden with css. some text some more text read more some text some more text read more problem is that every time i click one of the "read more" links its shows the every second paragraph. i would just want it to show the second paragraph of the one clicked. very new to jquery...
