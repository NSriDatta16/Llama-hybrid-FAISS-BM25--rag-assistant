Shortening LSTM Sequences

I am training an LSTM where I have sales data from 20 different individuals over the past 10 years. Now, I read this brilliant answer: How to train LSTM model on multiple time series data? But, due to domain knowledge / prior analysis, I believe that only “recent” timesteps are useful in predicting a future timestep, let’s say, the previous 1 year. Now, what do I do with all of this historical data? Do I just not use it? Can I just create more subsequences out of these longer sequences and train the LSTM on these as well? Or do I have to input the whole sequence for each individual?
