Deactivate link with DOM click event

This question is mainly out of curiosity (I have a different working solution to the issue). Trying to do some basic progressive enhancement: a table should have each row clickable to go to another page using JavaScript. For people w/out JavaScript, there's a link in the first column of each row. If JavaScript is enabled, the links should be disabled. One of the many simple ways to do so is a.setAttribute("onclick", "return false;"); after initializing the click events on the rows. But it appears more elegant to use addEventListener to achieve the same a.addEventListener("click", function() { return false; }, false); However, the latter doesn't work. I believe the reason for this is that more than one event listener can be added this way and if they'd return different truth values the result would be ambiguous. Is this assumption correct or am I getting something wrong? Please explain the inner workings behind this.
