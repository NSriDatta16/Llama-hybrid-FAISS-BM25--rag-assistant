How do i compare two Self Organizing Maps?

I have results (weights) for multiple runs of self organizing map. I am trying to compare these results to check if my algorithm gets to the same solution from different random initial weights. I have looked online but couldn't find any good method for this, any suggestions or helpful link will be appreciated. Effort made; Compute distances of all SOMS against each other in MATLAB..(got stuck with a big matrix of distances), this doesn't seem right to me, i believe there should be a formal and better way out there. This can also be applied to K-means. Weights are same as Centroids.
