What you're interest in, you can find in the line "groupB" of the table. Estimated parameter is 0.44, its exponential is 1.55, which means that elements in group B survive 1.55 times longer shorter by average, than in group A. This difference, however, is not statistically significant (value 0 is included in the confidence interval [L95%, U95%]). The 1.55 value is called time ratio (TR) and it's actually quite easy to understand: probability of dying is estimated to come 1.55 faster for group B than for group A, if fixing the other factors (it is an adjusted TR, you may say). As the name itself says, AFT models distribute failure probability over time by accelerating or slowing it among groups. Group B here has its time accelerated. This means I must correct myself: unfortunately, different statistical packages parametrize effect sizes with opposite signs, so it's easy to get confused between conservative and risk factors. It appears that flexsurvreg uses PH-alike parametrization, so group B survives shorter, not longer.
