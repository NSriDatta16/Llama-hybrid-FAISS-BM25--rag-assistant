You are missing one thing. Note that auto.arima() fits an ARIMA(0,1,0) model with drift . This is the following model: $$ (1-B)(y_t-\mu t) = e_t, $$ or after rearranging, $$ y_t = y_{t-1}+\mu+e_t. $$ The estimated value of $\mu$ is the 79.0909 you get. So if you wanted to reconstruct your auto.arima() results, you would first have to "correct" your time series drink_ts by this drift term. Unfortunately, it's not clear how the t parameter runs - does it start from 1950 (being the first year in your series), or from 1 (which sounds more reasonable - but would yield a nonzero intercept). I played around a bit, but couldn't fully reconstruct your AIC values. Part of the problem is of course accounting for the degree of freedom expended in estimating the drift parameter, similarly whether to allow a mean or constrain it, and finally likely slight differences in estimating methods between arima() and auto.arima() . In general, I would trust auto.arima() more than a hand-crafted call to arima . (And regarding your parenthetical question, you can extract the AIC by arima(drink_ts)$aic , but I don't know of a way to get the BIC, or the AICc.) If your question is still open, maybe you could either ask a new question that avoids the drift complications (possibly linking the two questions), or edit to explain why you are trying to do what you are trying to do?
