Formula for all first and second order predictors including interactions in R

In the statistics programming language R, the following formula (e.g. in lm() or glm() ) z ~ (x+y)^2 is equivalent to z ~ x + y + x:y Assuming, I only have continuous predictors, is there a concise way to obtain z ~ I(x^2) + I(y^2) + I(x) + I(y) + I(x*y) A formula that does the right thing for factor predictors is a plus. One possible solution is z ~ (poly(x,2) + poly(y,2))^2 I am looking for something more elegant.
