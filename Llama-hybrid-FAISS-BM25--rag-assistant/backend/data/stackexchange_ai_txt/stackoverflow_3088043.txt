I would say it depends on what your webservice, and data creation/update, mean : If creating a record, and updating a record, are two really different things for you and your users, then, you should have two methods : this will probably be more meaningful. If what matters the most is that the data is saved, then, you could use only one. I've often seen API that have two distinct methods ; but I've often used libraries that only have one... I suppose it's because, in those situations, on the API level, creating vs updating matters -- while on a lower level (i.e. data-storage) it doesn't matter much.
