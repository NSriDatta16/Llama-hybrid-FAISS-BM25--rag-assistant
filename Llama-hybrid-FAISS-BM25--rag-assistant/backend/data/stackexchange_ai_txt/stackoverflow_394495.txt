After my first post was rejected, allow me to suggest that you are prematurely optimizing the problem and you shouldn't worry about having lots of if statements. The code you're writing naturally requires multiple 'if' statements, and whether they are expressed with the ternary if operator (A ? B : C) or classic if blocks, the execution time is the same, the compiler is going to optimize almost all of the code posted into very nearly the same logic. Concern yourself with the readability and reliability of your code rather than trying to outwit your future self or anyone else who reads the code. Every solution posted is O(1) from what I can tell, that is, every single solution will contribute insignificantly to the performance of your code. I would like to suggest that this post be tagged "premature optimization," the poster is not looking for elegant code.
