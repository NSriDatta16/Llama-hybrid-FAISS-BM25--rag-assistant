Why do I see people doing if (false !== $var) { Logic comparisons are a common foil for beginning programmers, and it is typical to see $var = false when what was meant $var == false So standard practice is to encourage programmers to always place variables on the right hand side, since $var=true is technically legal, but produces unexpected behavior, while true=$var is not legal and throws an error. In your case it looks like ugly, if sensible, programming habits were taken to their logical end.
