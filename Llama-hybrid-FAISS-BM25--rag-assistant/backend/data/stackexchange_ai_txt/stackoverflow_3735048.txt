Line Graph in windows form app in vb.net

using vs2008 I am trying to create a line graph using vb in a windows form. I have dragged a chart onto the form, and via the properties window, through the series option have changed the type to the graph that I want, which is line. But all the time the data is displayed as a simple bar chart. How do I remedy this please to get the type of chart that I want. Thanks for all and any help
