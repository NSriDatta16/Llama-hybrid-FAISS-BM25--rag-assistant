As a developer, and not a DBA, I keep an eye on various developer resources, and that often is DB related, but I don't specifically 'try to keep up'. I know plenty, but I also know that there is so much more that there is to know. And in every project I have to learn something new. And every project also involves me taking a different approach to a similar task I'd encountered in the past. Should I ever get to the stage where I think I'm doing the same things all the time, perhaps I'll make a concious effort to take specific steps. But currently, and for the foreseeable future, I'm learning organically, on-the-job, and as my projects dictate.
