For what purpose do you want to use the data? I've done similar things previously on data input forms and generally I've found it to be beneficial to the users not to manipulate everything in Javascript but to hook to store the data on the server and interface with AJAX. The issue is that as soon as you start letting users do this sort of complex table manipulation and they accidentally hit the back button you end up with a lot of disgruntled punters. Coding up transient storage on a database isn't that much harder than manipulating Javascript and in fact can be easier as you can break the operations down more easily. Debugging is simpler for that reason too (you always have inspect access to the current state of your table). Lots of option for handling via AJAX - the simplest being to just use a place-holder division and feed the whole table structure in as needed.
