Beginner GUI question, organising different "views"

I've done plenty of programming before for CLI and the web, however recently I am getting into desktop GUI programming. Most of the tutorials for GUI programming I found just explain the different controls you can use and leave it at that. Some of the better ones also skim over a few usability issues. However, my problem is not with the APIs, or the theory but with my code. How are you supposed to organise different views your application might have (e.g. a IM application has a login view, a contacts list view, a conversation view etc.). Are these supposed to be different classes or different methods on one class? Different panels that are hidden and revealed, or different windows altogether? I'm hoping for answers as language agnostic as possible, but in case that's not possible, the languages/frameworks I am considering are Java/Swing or C#/WPF. However, if there's another language/framework that is significantly better for learning from, I would consider using that.
