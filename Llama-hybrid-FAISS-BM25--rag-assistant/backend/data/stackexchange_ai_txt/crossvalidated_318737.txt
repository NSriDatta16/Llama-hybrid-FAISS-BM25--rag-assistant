Why does the p-value for z=x correspond to the negative x in a z-score table?

I was given the following problem on a practice final exam and I think the professor posted the wrong answer, but with the final tomorrow I don't have time to ask him via email so I figured I'd look for the solution here: Q. 7 A sample of n = 36 adults participated in a study measuring the effectiveness of ginkgo biloba and ginseng as tools for improving memory. After 90 days of taking the supplements, these adults took a standardized memory test. Their average score on the test was ̄ x = 84. a. Compared to the general population, whose mean score on this test was μ = 80 with σ = 18, use the critical-value approach to determine if there evidence that taking these supplements improves memory when α = 0 . 05. b. What is the p -value for the test conducted in a. ? answer to a: z = 1.33 (which I got as well), Z0.05= 1.645, answer to b: p-value: p = 0.0918. What I don't get is the p-value of 0.0918 corresponds to -1.33 from the Z score table. How did he get that p-value? Is he correct?
