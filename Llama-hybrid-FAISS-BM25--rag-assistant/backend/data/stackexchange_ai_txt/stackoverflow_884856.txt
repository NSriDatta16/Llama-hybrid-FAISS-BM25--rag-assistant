This embeds a UIScrollView inside a UIScrollView (since UITableView is a UIScrollView). You probably want to set the tableview's canCancelContentTouches to NO so it doesn't cancel your UIScrollView's touches. That may create some problems if your UITableView needs to scroll vertically. If that is your issue, subclass UITableView to overload touchesShouldCancelInContentView: so that this does not return YES for horizontal drags (or perhaps for touches in the header).
