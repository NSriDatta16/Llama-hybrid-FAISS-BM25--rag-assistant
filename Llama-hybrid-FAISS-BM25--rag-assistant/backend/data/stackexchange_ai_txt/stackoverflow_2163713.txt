Does your MySQL box have enough hard drive space for all the data doubled? Local storage would be best here, but if it's not an option, you could also try some sort of NAS device utilizing iSCSI. It's still happening over the network, but in this case you get more throughput and reliability, because you're only relying on a NAS which has a pretty slim OS and almost never has to be rebooted.
