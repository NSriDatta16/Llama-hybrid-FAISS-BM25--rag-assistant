asp.net : is it possible to Split large ASP.NET pages into pieces?

Is it possible to split large ASP.NET-pages into pieces? JSP has the jsp:include directive. Is there any equivivalent in ASP.NET I'm not interested in reusing the pieces. I just want to organize the HTML/ASP code. Isn't User Controls and Master Pages overkill for doing this?
