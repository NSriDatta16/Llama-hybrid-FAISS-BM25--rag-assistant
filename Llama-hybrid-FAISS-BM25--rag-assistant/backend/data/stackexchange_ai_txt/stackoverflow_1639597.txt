You can add custom properties (and variables) to the code generated for your NSManagedObjects, as you would any other class. These won't become part of the model, but instead will be temporary in memory. It's worth noting that if the managed object were to be dealloc'ed the value in memory would too. A tip I would suggest if you are just implementing custom accessors to the underlying data is to create a category on the managed object in question. In the accessors, you access the underlying NSNumber and convert it into your enum, defined in the header for the category. If you need to regenerate the code for the managed object, because say the model changes, you can just delete the class generated for the managed object and regenerate it without needing to merge with any custom code you've added. The category you've added will work all the same as long as the underlying storage property has stayed the same. You can find out more about categories in the Objective-C Programming Language guide at the ADC.
