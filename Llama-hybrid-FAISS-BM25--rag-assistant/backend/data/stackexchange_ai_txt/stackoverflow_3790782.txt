Code organization for Rails models accessed in different views

I am confused about where I should put code for a model that is modified in the view for another controller. Huh? Here's the situation: I have a Phone model and an associated controller. In the Phones view you can modify simple things like who the Phone is assigned to. In order to change more low-level things about the Phone, you have to go to the Settings screen, which has its own controller. I have partials that are used to render information about Phones in the Settings screen. Should these be kept in the app/views/settings directory or app/views/phones? What about partials that are used in both views? Also, if there is an action in the Phones controller that is only accessible from the Settings screen, should I keep the response (eg destroy.js.erb) in app/views/settings or app/views/phones?
