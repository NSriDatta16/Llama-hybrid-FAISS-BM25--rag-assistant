Expected value for a function with a normal distributed random variable

I have a random variable $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and a function $5x^2 + 2x$ . How can I calculate $E(g(x))$ ? I have two ideas, altough I'm not sure which one is right: $E(g(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) f_X(x) dx\\ =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 5x^2 + 2x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }$ The function above just computes the weighted average of the values that $g(x)$ can take on for different values of x. The normal distrubution is symmetric, so $E[g(x)] = 5 \mu^2 + 2\mu$ Sorry if the question might sound stupid, I don't have a statistics background.
