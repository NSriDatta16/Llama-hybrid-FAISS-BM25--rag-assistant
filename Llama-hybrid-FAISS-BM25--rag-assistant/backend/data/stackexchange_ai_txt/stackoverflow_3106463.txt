How to organize code within on Objective-C class/file?

New to iPhone development, not new to software development in general. I want my Objective-C/iPhone source code to look "unsurprising" to someone else reading it. Wondering what is the accepted practice for code organization within one class? As an example, I have a view controller like so: @interface SomeViewController : UIViewController { } What is the accepted practice regarding the ordering/placement of the methods for these protocols within the .m file? I know that it doesn't technically matter, but, as I said, I want someone reading my code to be unsurprised at how I've organized it. As an aside, if implementing these sorts of protocols on my view controllers is considered a bad practice, please let me know in a comment, and I'll ask another question for that (or just point me to an existing one)
