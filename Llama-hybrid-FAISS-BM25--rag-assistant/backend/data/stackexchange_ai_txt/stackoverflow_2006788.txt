One of the things you will definitely need is good knowledge in the formal language area (automata, context free grammars, context sensitive grammars). Most of the stuff I've seen relies heavily on this - the best beginner book is, in my opinion, "Introduction to Formal Languages" by Hopcroft, Ullman &co. I've also seen some techniques pertaining to neural networks, but I do not know much about these. A third technique (somewhat developed from the formal language area) is based on molecular computing - not sure how extensively it is used. I'd look into A. Paun's books for that.
