Pagination using multiple searcing criteria in codeigniter

Im trying to implement pagination using multiple searching criteria. Supposed I Have student table. I also use pagination when the list of student displayed. The pagination link is. site_url . '/student/page/'; so I use $config['uri_segment'] = 1 ; so the pagination link will be 1 2 and son. After that I wanna search student data using 3 searching criteria implemented using textfield. id name address. user can search by id or name or address or combination of the three criteria. the url become http://mysite/index.php/student/page/0 href=http://mysite/index.php/student/page/1 and son. but I use get method for searching. and while trying to search using the search criteria field the url become href="http://mysite/index.php/student/page/1?id=1&name=a&address=b the problem occurred when I try create pagination based on criteria. because the pagination link have contain query string i don't know how to create become href="http://mysite/index.php/student/page/0?id=1&name=a&address=b href="http://mysite/index.php/student/page/1?id=1&name=a&address=b or do you have a best practice to solve this problem ? Hi phill .... I have try your suggestion. $array = array('id' => '001', 'name' => 'a', 'address' => 'canada'); the url become id/001/name/a/address/canada . I use $this->uri->uri_to_assoc() function to get key and value of the segment. array ( id => 001, name=>a, address=>canada ) but while there some searching criteria that not included while searching. let say, the user only search by name and address. the array become $array = array('id' => '', 'name' => 'a', 'address' => 'canada'); and the url id/name/a/address/canada the assoc array become array ( id => name, a=>address, canada=> ) the assoc array is not disorganized again. so I can't get the right value of the assoc array. I think i will set the identifier to the searching criteria if not included. supposed i put # . if isset($_GET['id']) then $id = '#' else $id = $_GET['id'] $array = array('id' => $id, 'name' => 'a', 'address' => 'canada'); How about that ... ? or if there are another best practice ?
