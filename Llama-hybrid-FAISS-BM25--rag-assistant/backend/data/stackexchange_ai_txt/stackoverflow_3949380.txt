An interesting variation on Flash (2D games only), if your project is UI-heavy (such as wargames, RPG, strategy) is to use the Flex SDK and Flash Builder 4 as well, which also allows you to drag/drop UI components and quickly throw together prototype dialogs or interfaces and such. If you're doing a typical Flash-shooter or casual Flash game I probably wouldn't recommend using Flex in that case.
