There are some solutions that try to do this - the ones I know are Ch and TextTransformer . However, I doubt that this works very well. C++ is not at all designed to run as an interpreted language. One of the problems is that C++ is very, very hard to parse . And this makes it very hard to provide certain types of tools that are usual for other languages. For example, I don't think there is any C++ refactoring tool that really works well.
