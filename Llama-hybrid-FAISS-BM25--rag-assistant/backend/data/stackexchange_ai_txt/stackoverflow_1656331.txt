Click on the button in interface builder, press CMD+2 (Or in info dialog, second tab) and drag the circle from Touch up inside to File's Owner from the yourView.xib window and then it'll let you select one of the methods which has the - (IBAction) method:(id)sender signature. Choose the one you want to associate with that button :) You say you don't want to make a method for each button, but actually that is the best way in my opinion, rather than having one huge monolithic method which handles each of the buttons and checks each time to see which one of them it is. Using the process I mentioned above, you can specifically tie a handler method to a particular button, keeping things nice, tidy, and logical. If you really want to do that though, you can also test for the tag number .
