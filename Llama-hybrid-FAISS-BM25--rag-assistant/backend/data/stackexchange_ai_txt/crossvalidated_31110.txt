Inducing sparsity in a Bayesian model

Can someone explain or point me to an introductory reference that deals with the notion of sparsity in Bayesian modeling? What does the idea of sparsity really mean? What does it mean to 'induce sparsity'? How are 'sparse priors' identified and used? In fact, what are they?
