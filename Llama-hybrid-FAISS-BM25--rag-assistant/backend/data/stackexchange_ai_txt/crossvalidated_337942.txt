Bayesian optimization neural network

When tuning my neural net with Bayesian optimization I want to determine the optimal number of hidden layers and the corresponding number of neurons in each hidden layer. The problem is that with an increasing number of hidden layersthe vector of hyperparameters gets longer, because for each hidden layer added I need one more entry in the hyperparameter vector indicating the number of neurons in the added layer. For bayesian regression I need the input dimension to be constant. How do I cope with this problem?
