Posterior very different to prior and likelihood

If the prior and the likelihood are very different from each other, then sometimes a situation occurs where the posterior is similar to neither of them. See for example this picture, which uses normal distributions. Although this is mathematically correct, it doesn't seem to accord with my intuition -- if the data doesn't match with my strongly held beliefs or the data, I would expect neither range to fare well and would expect either a flat posterior over the whole range or perhaps a bimodal distribution around the prior and likelihood (I'm not sure which makes more logical sense). I certainly wouldn't expect a tight posterior around a range that matches neither my prior beliefs or the data. I understand that as more data is collected, the posterior will move towards the likelihood, but in this situation it seems counter-intuitive. My question is: how is my understanding of this situation flawed (or is it flawed). Is the posterior the `correct' function for this situation. And if not, how else might it be modelled? For completeness sake, the prior is given as $\mathcal{N}(\mu=1.5, \sigma=0.4)$ and the likelihood as $\mathcal{N}(\mu=6.1, \sigma=0.4)$. EDIT: Looking at some of the answers given, I feel like I haven't explained the situation very well. My point was the the Bayesian analysis seems to produce a non-intuitive result given the assumptions in the model. My hope was that the posterior would somehow `account' for perhaps bad modelling decisions, which when thought about is definitely not the case. I'll expand upon this in my answer.
