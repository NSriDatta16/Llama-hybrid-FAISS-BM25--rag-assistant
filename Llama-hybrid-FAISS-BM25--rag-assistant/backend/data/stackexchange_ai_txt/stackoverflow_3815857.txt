Basically, git checkout hashcode does what I thought git reset would. I'm not sure WHY the changes got rolled back when I branch filtered, but now that I can at least see the code again, I just manually copied the changes into a clone of the head, then rechecked the changes in again. Not the most elegant solution, but I got to keep my filtering AND have the latest code. I think part of what probably happened was my incomplete understanding of git repositories. I'd never really managed one before, but I had this half-concieved notion that a git repository is always "up to date", and that it has the latest version of things. When i did the branch filtering, I was in the git repository, and I noticed that the filters were in the git status as needing to be commited. So I did. Likely the repository wasn't actually "up to date", and so in commiting (and overriding things blithely) I probably overwrote changes and essentially rolled things back.
