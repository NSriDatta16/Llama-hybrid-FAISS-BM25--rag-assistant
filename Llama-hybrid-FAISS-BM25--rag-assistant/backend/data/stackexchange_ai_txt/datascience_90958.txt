Methods to visualize the filters in the later layers of a CNN?

I've extracted the weights from the filters of a pretrained model (AlexNet). I wish to represent these weights visually, this works fine for the first layer as there is only 3 input channels so I can represent the filters as color images with channels (RGB). However this breaks down in later layers as they often have more than 3 input channels, I can represent them as many greyscale kernels but was hoping someone has found a better solution.
