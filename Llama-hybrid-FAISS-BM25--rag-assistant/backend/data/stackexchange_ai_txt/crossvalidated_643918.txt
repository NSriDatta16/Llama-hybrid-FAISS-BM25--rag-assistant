OK, I figured it out - the reason they have different variances is just because the units are different. I tested it via simulation: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CdqA00y0sIAex_GilQo-3odQLeHfjZq8 . I defined two normal distributions (using the normal approximation of the binomial) - one for the count of successes and one for the proportion of successes: $$ X \sim N(np, \sqrt{np(1-p)}) $$ $$ \frac{X}{n} \sim N(p, \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}) $$ Then I set p to 0.55 and evaluated their PDFs and CDFs for all values in [0, n] (or n evenly spaced values in [0, 1] for the X/n distribution) when n = 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000. Then I computed their average error across all those PDFs and CDFs, and also plotted the distributions. The result is below. As you can see at the bottom, the difference is essentially 0 (likely just floating point noise). The only difference is that for these normal approximations, the PDF for the X/n distribution is n times as large as that of the distribution for X, which makes sense since the support of the binomial X/n is always [0,1] (since it's a proportion), so that means it's 1/n the size of the support of X. So the distributions for X and X/n really do end up being the same for all intents and purposes.
