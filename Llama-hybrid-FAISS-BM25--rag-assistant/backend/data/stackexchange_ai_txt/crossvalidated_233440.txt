There is no "best answer", since it all depends on how precisely you want to follow the variations in temperature. However, there can be assumed to be some temporal interval $d t$ wherein the temperature function will be essentially linear, and you won't need a temporal solution higher than this. But then again, temperature is a statistical average, so it doesn't really make sense to demand too small a $dt$. So all in all, your question is ill-defined; it all depends what you are intending to use the measurements for.
