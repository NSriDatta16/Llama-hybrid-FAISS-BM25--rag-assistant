Mixed effect model covariance prior

How should I choose the covariance prior for my bglmer model? This is a model which has the singularity problem. mod |z|) (Intercept) 2.49686 0.06909 36.14 I would like to use the blme package to run the model with a cov. prior. However, there are multiple options to choose from, e.g. wishart , invwishart , gamma and invgamma . What should guide my choice of cov.prior? Is it appropriate to use the rePCA function to check for singularity, i.e. overfitting in bglmer models? Is it appropriate to use the likelihood ratio test with anova function to reduce the overfitted bglmer models?
