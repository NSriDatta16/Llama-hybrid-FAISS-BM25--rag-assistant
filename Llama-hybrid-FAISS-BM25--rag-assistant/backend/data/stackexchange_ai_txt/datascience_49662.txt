The numbers to which you are referring are probably the logits of the NN. The logits have to be transformed using a activation function which could be: Softmax ( which you showed ) for classification tasks. Linear activation function for regression tasks. Softmax activation function : The mathematical notion is as follows: $\Large S( y_i ) = \frac{ e^{y_i}}{ \sum e^{y_i} }$ It converts the logits to class probabilities that sum to 1. It is widely used in multiclass classification problems. CNNs for classification need to produce class probabilities which are produced by a softmax activation function at the output layer.
