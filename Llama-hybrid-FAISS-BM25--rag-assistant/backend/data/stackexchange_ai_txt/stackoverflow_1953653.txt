Yes. To search a hash map with 100 million items added to it, you do this: 1) Calculate the hash of the object you're looking for. 2) Find that bucket 3) Search through that bucket for the item. (1) is independent of the size of the hash map or number of items in it. (2) is O(1), assuming a standard hashmap implemented as an array of linked lists. (3) takes an amount of time related to the number of items in the bucket, which should be approximately (number of items added to hash) / (number of buckets). This part will start at O(1), but will very slowly increase as the number of items begins to greatly exceed the number of buckets. For almost any purpose, Hash Maps can be considered O(1) for both insertion and retrieval, even with very large data sets, as long as you start with a sufficiently large number of buckets.
