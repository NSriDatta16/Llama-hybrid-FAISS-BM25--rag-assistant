Statistics are used by the oracle cost based optimizer (CBO) to calculate the relative costs of different ways of executing a query so that the most appropriate one can be chosen. On the whole this works very well, and is being continually improved. For example in 11g you can gather multicolumn histograms that help greatly with queries having predicates on correlated columns (eg. strongly correlated like month of birth and star sign, or more weakly correlted like gender and height). However it is not perfect. For example estimating the cardinality of the result set of a join between two tables is reasonably accurate, as is estimating the cardinality from a filter operation, but combining the two requires a lot of estimation that can easily be inaccurate. In some cases these issues can be worked around with hints, or with the use of global temporary tables for intermediate result sets. Another problem of statistics is that changing them can change the execution plan, so there is more of a movement recently to either discourage continual gathering of statistics, or to analyse the impact of changes to statistics before implementing them. Look for the Jonathan Lewis book -- it is a very thorough treatment of the subject.
