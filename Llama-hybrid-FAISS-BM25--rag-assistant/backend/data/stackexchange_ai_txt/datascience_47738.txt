Manning Publications has a new (late 2018) Video Course out , where the Author, Phil Tabor, builds RL apps (e.g. a robot in a maze) using Python. Readers/Participants are encouraged to follow along, implementing a few new functions at the end of each section. (I for one try to do these exercises, but usually do not get working code, just a sketch with pseudocode). Code samples are here on Github: Reinforcement Learning In Motion
