Can I reverse engineer (parts of) the training data from a machine learning model?

Somebody trained a machine learning model successfully with some data A. Is it possible to reverse engineer that machine learning model in such a way, that I get insights about that data A or at least parts of it? With insights I mean: to get an idea about a single row in my data A like: what values or value ranges did certain attributes in that row have. Extra question: may it perhaps depend on the kind of machine learning model (whether it is a neural networks model or another one)?
