Thank you both @derobert and @peter! I finally went back to this, and this: break main commands watch somevar commands cont end cont end run does the trick. This works when "somevar" is global, or local to "main". If "somevar" is local to anther function, just replace "main" with that function name above. Put these commands in a file (e.g. "gdbscript") and run gdb like: gdb -x gdbscript a.out
