There is a paradigm that any loop should only have one point of exit (same as a function should only have one return). This has to do with readability. Too many exit points can make the code very difficult to understand. Also, it is important if you want to do code verification (i.e. mathematically proof if your code is correct). However, guidelines are often there to help, but are not strict. There are possibly situations where a break is better than not using it. Hence, one should be pragmatic about this, but understand the reason for such principles in order to create good code.
