I think there is a SNMP agent available in MySQL Enterprise Monitor, but that is of course for the commercial version. There are also several other commercial snmp agents available. There is a C API for MYSQL that can be used for many of the monitoring tasks that you may be interested in: mysql_ping, mysql_sqlstate, etc. Since you were mentioning that you were using C++ that may be an option. Take a look at MySQL C API for complete documentation. That said, there is also some status information available that you can fetch with SQL statements: 'SHOW PROCESSLIST', 'SHOW SLAVE STATUS', etc. Documentation about this you can find at SHOW Syntax
