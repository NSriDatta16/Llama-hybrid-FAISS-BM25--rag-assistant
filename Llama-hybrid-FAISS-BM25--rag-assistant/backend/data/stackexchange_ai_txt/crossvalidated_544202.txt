Is k-fold CV ever better than LOOCV for estimating the accuracy of a model's predictions?

I use logistic regression for a binary prediction problem and use LOOCV to estimate the models' prediction accuracies for different predictor sets. A reviewer wants me to use k-fold CV instead. Does this make sense? I would think LOOCV would dominate k-fold CV, and should be preferred unless it it too computationally demanding. Isn't it better to estimate the sub-models on larger samples?
