We solved exactly this problem recently for one of our clients. Our implementation involved the following components (but you can achieve the same with different tools depending on your organisation). JIRA workflow - orchestrate the process (and capture performance metrics) manage approvals and track history for auditing JIRA plugin - Trigger builds\deployments\tests via CI server (Hudson\Jenkins). Listener: respond to status updates from Hudson\Jenkins Jenkins plugin - to interact with JIRA build-pipeline-plugin - to manage the Jenkins workflow deployment scripts - orchestrated by Jenkins\Groovy It sounds complex, but a lot of these tools have great APIs to work with, so you can get a stable solution together in a reasonable timeframe. Cheers, Geoff
