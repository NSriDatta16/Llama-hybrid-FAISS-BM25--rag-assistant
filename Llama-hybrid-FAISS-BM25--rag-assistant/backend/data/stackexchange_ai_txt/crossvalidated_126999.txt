You'd normally use logistic regression for a situation like this (though there are a few alternatives). You model $P(\text{response}=\tt{'yes'})$ in terms of the variables, but not as a linear function, like in ordinary regression. Rather, if $p$ is $P(\text{response}=\tt{'yes'})$, then in logistic regression you model $\log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ as a linear function of the independent variables (predictors). There are some good questions and answers about logistic regression here. You might start with these questions . In R, you get a logistic regression via the glm command. It works a lot like the lm command, but it takes a family argument (in this case, family=binomial will give you logistic regression). So instead of fm1 (where disease is a factor, not character*), you could have fm1 * though you can you can use functions like factor or as.factor to deal with that otherwise
