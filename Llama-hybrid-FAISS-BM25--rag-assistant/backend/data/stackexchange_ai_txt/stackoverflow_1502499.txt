You can't easily do this with XmlReader - at least, not without reading the whole XML document in from the reader, futzing with it and then creating a new XmlReader from the result. That defeats a lot of the point of using XmlReader though - namely the ability to stream large documents. You could potentially derive from XmlReader , forwarding most method calls to the existing reader but intercepting them where appropriate to add extra attributes etc... but I suspect that code would be really quite complex and fragile.
