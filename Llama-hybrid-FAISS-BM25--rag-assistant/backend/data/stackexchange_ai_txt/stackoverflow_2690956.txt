You can build a SQL Agent job andkick it off via system SP's from a trigger or SP. The job may call SSIS or bulk dump scrits... returning instant error message may be an issue though In general, it's quite unusual requirement - what are you trying to accomplish? UPDATE: After some more thinking - this is a design issue and I have not been able to find a solution simply by using SQL Server SP's. IN the past - this is what I did: on the app level - implement async process where user pushes a button, requesting a file download; the app accepts and let user go the user can check the status via status page or will get email when it's done or error occured in the mean time the application layer, kicks of either SSIS package or SQL Agent Job If parameters are needed - use design and implement special table: JOB_PARAMETERS - where you would put the parameters you would also need to create more tables to manage the jobs and store job status and communicate with application layer you may want o use SQL Server Broker on DB level You may want to use MSMQ on the app level This is not easy, but this is the most efficient way to export data, where it goes from DB to a file, without traveling to app server and user PC via browser.
