I'm sure many people would argue as to what the purpose of a meta-analysis is, but perhaps at a meta-meta level the point of such analysis is to study the studies rather than obtain a pooled parameter estimate. We are interested in whether effects are consistent among each other, of the same direction, have CI bounds that are inversely proportional to the root of the sample size approximately, and so on. Only when all the studies seem to point to the same effect size and magnitude for an association or treatment effect do we tend to report, with some confidence, that what has been observed may be a "truth". Indeed, there are frequentist ways of conducting a pooled analysis, such as just aggregating evidence from multiple studies with random effects to account for heterogeneity. A Bayesian approach is a nice modification of this, because you can be explicit about how one study might inform another. Just as well, there are Bayesian approaches to "studying the studies" as a typical (frequentist) meta analysis might do, but that's not what you're describing here.
