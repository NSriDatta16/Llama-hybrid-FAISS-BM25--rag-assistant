Iphone Game Develoment - Need design guidance

I have started programming a game for the iphone and as all beginners I feel like I am shooting in the dark. I just want to run my design and how my "graphics engine" works by you to see if it is anything close to standard design or good practise. Let me explain how it works: For simplification reasons lets just say I have the following 3 classes: LevelView : inherits from UIViewController and is a view with 10 buttons for each level of the game. Clicking a button creates a new GameViewController object (using initWithLevel) and instantiates it with an integer ( 1-10) according to the level the player chose. GameViewController : inherits from UIViewController and has the initWithLevel(int) method and a big switch statement which performs the level setup according to the int that was passed. So it instantiates two types of objects (robots and planets) in various numbers according to each level. Each object it creates is inserted into an array belonging to a singleton. Then at the end it will start the gameloop which is another method in this class. GameView : inherits from UIView and is where everything is drawn ( has a drawRect method) and where the touches Began,Moved and Ended methods are. What will happen for every gameLoop is that this will pull all objects from the global array (the array in the singleton) and according to what object it is it will draw the correct image at the correct location. ( location of robots and planets is stored within their respective objects as variables) In the touches Began,Moved,Ended methods according to what the user does the relevant objects are pulled back from the Singleton array and their position/ability is updated. Therefore the next time the loop runs and they are drawn again the draw method wil update their location or behaviour. Does this sound about right at this point? Should I be instantiating a GameViewController object to start the level? Should the gameLoop be in the GameViewController or should it be in the GameView. I have added the GameView onto the GameViewController in InterfaceBuilder It will draw the initial objects but I am not sure how to update them going forward. How do I call the drawRect method to update everything? Anyways, sorry for the extremely long post. I am not looking for a specific answer just a review from someone more experienced in this to tell me: 1) yes you are going in the right direction design wise 2) no you need to rethink a few things Thanks for your help Stav
