How to redirect in Magento?

I am new on Magento. I am facing some problem when open the site in browser. I am having two sites: http://www.diamondjewelryhub.com http://musicalinstruments101.com/ I have download the code and database of http://www.diamondjewelryhub.com . I want to upload this code and database on the server of http://musicalinstruments101.com/ . After download the data base I searched for this http://www.diamondjewelryhub.com and replace with http://musicalinstruments101.com/ . After that I have import the database file on the server of http://musicalinstruments101.com/ , When I am trying to open http://musicalinstruments101.com/ it redirecting on the site http://www.diamondjewelryhub.com . Is there any change needed because it redirects wrong?
