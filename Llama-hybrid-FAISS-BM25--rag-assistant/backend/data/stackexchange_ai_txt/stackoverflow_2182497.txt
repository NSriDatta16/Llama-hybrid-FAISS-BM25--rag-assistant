This seems to work well for page views, but not for scroll view, which is okay. reader is of type FlowDocumentReader , and document is the FlowDocument within it. Set the bookmark: var paginator = ((IDocumentPaginatorSource)document).DocumentPaginator as DynamicDocumentPaginator; var position = paginator.GetPagePosition(paginator.GetPage(reader.PageNumber - 1)) as TextPointer; bookmark = position.Paragraph; Restore the bookmark: bookmark.BringIntoView();
