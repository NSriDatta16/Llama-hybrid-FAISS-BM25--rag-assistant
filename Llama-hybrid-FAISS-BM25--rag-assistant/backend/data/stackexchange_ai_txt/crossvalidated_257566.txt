Exercise on cointegrated processes

I have this time series problem that I cannot solve: Considering two I(1) independent stochastic processes $z_t$ and $x_t$ and a stationary stochastic process $w_t$, I have the following DGP: $$ y_t=x_t+z_t+w_t. $$ Suppose that I misspecify the DGP and regress $y_t$ only on $x_t$ and $z_t$. Will I be able to find cointegration between $x_t$ and $z_t$? For which conditions? What I understood thus far, is that the variability of the I(0) process in estimating the wrong DGP will be embedded in the I(1) variables. But I don't know how to deal formally with the problem.
