Is there a way to train my Machine Learning model to fit 8 images into circle?

I simply have circle and 8 png images. Is there a way to train my model to have possibility to receive an output image with 8 images filled as much as possible into that circle? This is an example output prepared in photoshop: But I need to have a model, which will let me use it in Xcode with Swift. Then I run that model with any 8 images, and the result will be an output image filled with these 8 images as much as possible. size of images, rotation, position is randomly generated ratio is preserved parameters for every image should be returned for that model (I need to be able to recreate it manually from code, so I need x, y, rotation, scale for every image in circle) Any ideas? Is it possible to train that model here for example? Or in any other place? Do you know any website where I can ask for help? Of course not for free.
