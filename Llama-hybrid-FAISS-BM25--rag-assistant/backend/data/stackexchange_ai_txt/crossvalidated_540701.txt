Endogeneity in Discrete Choice Models

Suppose we are trying to estimate a model to predict failure of a company as a function of some firm-level and macroeconomic variables using a logistic regression $Y_{it} = X_{it} \beta + \epsilon_{it}$ where $Y_{it} = \lbrace 0,\,1\rbrace$ is the indicator variable with $Y_{it}=1$ meaning the firm is bankrupt and $X_{it}$ is a set of explanatory variables measured with say, a quarter/month lag. Furthermore, suppose firm leverage $L_{i,\,t-1}$ is one of the $X's$ . I'm interested in the following case. Suppose, creditors of a firm take into account the probability of bankruptcy at a point in time to decide how much money to lend, i.e, $L_{i,\,t-1}$ is a function of $P(Y_{it}=1\,|\,X_{it})$ . Thus, there is "endogeneity" in the estimation. How is estimation affected if the problem is ignored? If this is indeed a problem, how should we account for it? Thank you.
