You probably don't want to do this by IP address. Most crawlers send a unique user agent string when they crawl your site and it's much more likely you want to use that to identify them. I don't know where you can find a good list of those though EDIT: Actually this page I found with google seems to both answer your question a bit, and also give the user agents (which is still more likely a better approach)
