Organizing assemblies (assembly structure) in C#

Say you are writing an app like Photoshop where you have effects (filters), etc, should one make each of these filters a separate assembly using a separate project? The main idea is to have each of these filters as nodes, so think of it like: sourceImage -> Sharpen -> Darken -> Contrast -> Blur ... It seems to me that it would make sense to have dll files like: [Filters folder] Sharpen.dll Darken.dll Contrast.dll Blur.dll But it would be hard to manage them like that, and that would prevent me to use the internal keyword for class members, right? So right now I only have 1 dll for all filters. What's the best practices for organizing assemblies?
