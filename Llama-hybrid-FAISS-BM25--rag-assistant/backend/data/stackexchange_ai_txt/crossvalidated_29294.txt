I am not an expert, but I think it is common sense to not merge two studies if they have strongly opposite outcomes. For the sake of the example, say they measure a variable $X$ (glucose in the blood etc.) in identical conditions. Since the outcome is different, you can imagine that there is "something" unknown, so that one of the team measures actually $X + a$. Now does that make sense to merge the records? You end up with a mixture model which is much more difficult to analyze. To give you an example, the mean is meaningless because it will depend mostly on the ratio between the sample sizes. Addition: Thank you @Michael Chernick for this fantastic quote in the comments below: Man puts one foot in a bucket on fire and the other in a ice bucket. On average the temperature is normal. You wouldn't want to describe this with the sample mean
