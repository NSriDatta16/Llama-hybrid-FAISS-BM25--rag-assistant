Is Item Response Theory (IRT) a form of reinforcement learning?

I was doing studies in reinforcement learning and trying to apply it in Computerised Adaptive Testing (CAT). While learning IRT, I felt it is similar to behaviour of RL setting - receiving feedback and adjusting parameters(or learning) in each cycle. Is Item Response Theory (IRT) a form of reinforcement learning? Can I know the differences if any.
