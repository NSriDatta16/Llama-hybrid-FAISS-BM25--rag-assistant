I glanced at the paper, and with that interpretation is also the phrase "controlling for the out of pocket cost consequences", which is another predictor in the model. It seems reasonable to look at the predictions with and without the dummy variable present, and in particular to compare the out-of-pocket cost values needed to produce the same predictions with the dummy variable set to 0 and to 1. In other words, compare the out-of-pocket consequences for two people equally likely to buy a policy, one without the coverage and one with it. I'd have to read the whole paper to know for sure that's what they did, but that's my guess.
