Maximum size of Actor Queues?

I'm considering using Actors in a system to wrap some storage (could be a database, could be an in-memory collection). The reason I want to do this is because I don't want calls to the store to be blocking from the code that's calling it and I intend to push a high volume of messages through. Could an actor's inbound message queue handle hundreds of thousands of messages? What difference in performance would there be between code directly calling a method on an object and placing an actor with a queue in the middle? Cheers Joe
