If you have data that are user that will change quite rarely and need fast response, going for a custom mechanism bases on local storage is a great advantage quite faster than having to wait for a server roundtrip. Dino Sposito published an interesting article about local storage and caching on MSDN Magazine there you can find as well an approach to catch assemblies (imagine just loading the minimum package required and just go loadin the rest of assemblies in background, ... performance rocket, more complexity on your code :)). As you said is matter to go putting in a balance and decide. HTH Braulio
