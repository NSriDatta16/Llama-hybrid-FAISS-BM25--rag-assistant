what is the content of oCDataQueueingAndPersisting? (Especially the type of poDFCMsgQUEUE) If I am right: * I think it is actually a queue of pointer and not a queue of data. * which mean that the memory pointed by poDFCMsgQUEUE.front() is not the good one. for example you can not do that: void function1() { myItem i; myQueueOfPointer.push(&myItem) } void main() { function1() cout In this case, myItem is destroy after function1 return. So the address in myQueueOfPointer::front() is still pointing at nothing (a memory that can be use by other function etc...). This is why you print a piece of junk in your second print. The first one succeded because the memory was not yet overwrite by another part of your program. PS: As we all did request, you did not post the part where you push element in the queue. I will tell you one last time but if you do not post it, we can not help you (even the opposite, your post get downvoted). An advice for the future (if you want to use this site efficiently): Present well you problem (this was ok) Paste the source code of your problem Well indented, ans structured (Like i did in this post) If it is complex: reduce the source code as much as possible (with only interesting part) Hope it will help you
