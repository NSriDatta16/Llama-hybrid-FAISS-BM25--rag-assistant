DROOLS is the first one that pops into my mind... There are probably more of those out there, but I would not know as I have next to no experience with 3rd party rule engines... OTOH: Depending on the complexity of your task, you can also roll your own by including any number of scripting languages and providing their execution environments Clojure is probably a good match if you need to be able to define your rules in a semi-declarative syntax (that it has from it's Lisp heritage) Groovy has a more natural syntax for an average Java programmer, so it is also a good choice... And finally, if you know your domain well enough, or if the task is not too complex, you can easily roll your own. I would suggest trying XText to define your rule syntax and generate EMF models of the rules domain and make an engine yourself. XText can even generate you a full blown Eclipse text editor plug-in for your syntax with syntax highlighting, outline, intellisense auto-complete and all the other goodies you'd expect from an IDE text editor...
