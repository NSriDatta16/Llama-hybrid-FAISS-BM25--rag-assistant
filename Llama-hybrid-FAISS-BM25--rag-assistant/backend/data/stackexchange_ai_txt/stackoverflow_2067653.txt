What about something like this : You first use json_decode , which is php's built-in function to decode JSON data : $json = '{ ... }'; $data = json_decode($json); Here, you can seen what PHP kind of data (i.e. objects, arrays, ...) the decoding of the JSON string gave you, using, for example : var_dump($data); And, then, you loop over the data items, searching in each element's categoryid if the $catId you are searching for is in the list -- in_array helps doing that : $catId = 30; $urls = array(); foreach ($data->jsondata as $d) { if (in_array($catId, $d->categoryid)) { $urls[] = $d->url; } } And, each time you find a match, add the url to an array... Which means that, at the end of the loop, you have the list of URLs : var_dump($urls); Gives you, in this example : array 0 => string 'www.cnn.com' (length=11) 1 => string 'www.time.com' (length=12) 2 => string 'www.microsoft.com' (length=17) 3 => string 'www.freshmeat.com' (length=17) Up to you to build from this -- there shouldn't be much left to do ;-)
