If names always have //name following them and the filenames always have //filename following them and the name before the filename is the name to associate with the filename, it is fairly simple: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; my $key; my %name_to_filename; while ( ) { #only pay attention to lines that have //name or //filename #and save off the part before //name or //filename and which type it was next unless my ($name, $type) = m{(.*?)\s+//(name|filename)}i; if ($type =~ /^name$/i) { $key = $name; #remember the last name seen next; } $name_to_filename{$key} = $name; } use Data::Dumper; print Dumper \%name_to_filename; __DATA__ Tom //name Washington account.txt //filename Gary //NAME New York accountbalance.png //filename Mary //name New Jersey Michelle //NAME Larry //NAME Charles //NAME Washington Real.cpp //FILENAME
