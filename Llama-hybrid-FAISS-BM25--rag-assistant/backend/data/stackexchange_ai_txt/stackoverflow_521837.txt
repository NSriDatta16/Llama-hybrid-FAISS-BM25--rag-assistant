ASP.Net MVC - forms authentication using an external URL

Our organization has a central solution for forms authentication. I am trying to implement an ASP.Net MVC app that uses this external URL - and it worked till RC! was released... Here's what's happening In an ActionAttribute Extension I check for s session var if not found check for a request data chuck if found, set the session var if not found - redirect to external URL if found continue. The trouble is that till I updated to RC1, this worked. Since then, so many requests are being sent to the external URL that it detects a DoS attack and shuts me out! I removed the redirection code and replaced it with the web.config changes for Forms Auth - and the same thing happened...
