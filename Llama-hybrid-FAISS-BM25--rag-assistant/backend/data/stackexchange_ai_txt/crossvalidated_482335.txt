Computing p(D|θ)p(θ) would give the un-normalised posterior That sounds as if MCMC was an alternative to compute the posterior distribution. However, MCMC starts to shine whenever p(D|θ)p(θ) is to complicated and cannot be computed (with reasonable effort). Bayes books often start with simple cases where there is a conjugate prior and the result can be computed in closed form. In many real life cases such a conjugate prior does not exist or is for other reasons not feasible. Then Monte Carlos simulation can still produce usable results. It is not primarily a technique to determine scaling factors.
