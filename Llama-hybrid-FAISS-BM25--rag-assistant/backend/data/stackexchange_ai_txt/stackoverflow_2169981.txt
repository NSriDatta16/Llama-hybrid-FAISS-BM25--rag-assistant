Looks like the only way you can do this is to use type checking. I understand that this is not supposed to be encouraged, but... void dispatch(I i) { if(i instanceof A) { handlerA(); } else { handlerB(); } } But seriously, if you can avoid it at all, do not write code like this. If you can't modify them, could you by any chance extend A and B, add in a different handler() method for both and and use these new subclasses instead of A and B?
