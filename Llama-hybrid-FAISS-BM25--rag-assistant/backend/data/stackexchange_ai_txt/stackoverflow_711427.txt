I don't think a few thousand records should put any strain on your database; even my laptop should handle it nicely. Your biggest concern might be(come) gigantic tables if you don't do any cleanup or partitioning. Avoid premature optimization on that part. As for your method, make sure you do each user (or batch) in a separate transaction. If mysql, make sure you're using innodb to avoid unnecessary locking. If you're already using innodb/postgres/other database that supports transactions you might see a significant performance increase. Consider using COPY (at least on postgres - unsure about mysql). Make sure your table is properly indexed (including removing unused ones). Indexes hurt insert speed. Remember to optimize/vacuum regularly.
