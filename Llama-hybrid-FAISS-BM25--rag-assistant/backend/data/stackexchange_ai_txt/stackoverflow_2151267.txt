Should I put paragraph tags around images?

I have a web page where I have text with images. I write some text (in a paragraph) then put an image, then another paragraph. Should I put p tags around the image too, or should I just leave it in between with just the img tag? The reason I ask this is because up until now I was just plopping images in between paragraphs, but now if I want to add more than one image or add an image and an anchor then the don't sit together right. The other thing I tried was adding in between two images but I feel like that is wrong :P
