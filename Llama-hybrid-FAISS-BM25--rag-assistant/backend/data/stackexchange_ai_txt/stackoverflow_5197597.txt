How to average over a cell-array of arrays?

I have a cell array c of equal-sized arrays, i.e. size(c{n}) = [ m l ... ] for any n . How can I get the mean values (averaging over the cell array index n ) for all array elements in one sweep? I thought about using cell2mat and mean but the former does not add another dimension but changes l to l*n . And looping manually of course takes like forever...
