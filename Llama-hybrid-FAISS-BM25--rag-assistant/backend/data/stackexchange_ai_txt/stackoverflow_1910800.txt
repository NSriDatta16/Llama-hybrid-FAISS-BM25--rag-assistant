I see you're setting the size of the form Form1. You need to be changing the size of a picturebox on the form. Make sure you have a PictureBox control ("Picture1") on your form, and try this: Picture1.ScaleMode = vbPixels ' Set scale to pixels. Picture1.AutoRedraw = True ' If needed Picture1.Width = W ' in pixels Picture1.Height = H ' in pixels Then save it with this: SavePicture Picture1.Image, Output_Dir + Patternname + ".bmp"
