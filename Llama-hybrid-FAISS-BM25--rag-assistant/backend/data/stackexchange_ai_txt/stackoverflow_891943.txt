How to assign permissions for Copy/Paste on windows

Well, as everyone knows there is no way you can assign permissions for Copy/Paste of files on windows platform. I need to control the copy process from a central file server, in a way that helps me know: which user performed the copy Which files were copied where did he pasted them Total size of data copied Time of copy operation If user exceeds the allowed "Copy-Limit", a dialog box requests him to enter administrative credentials or deny him (as it would be configured) Store all this data in a file for later review or send by email. I need to collect this data by putting a utility program on the server itself, without any other installation on client computers. I know about monitoring the Clipboard , but which clipboard would it be? the user's clipboard or the server's clipboard ? And what about drag-drop operation, which doesn't even pass through the clipboard? Any knowledge of whether SystemFileWatcher is useful in such case ? Any ideas ?
