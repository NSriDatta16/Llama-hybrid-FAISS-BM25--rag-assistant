Don't waste your time looking for a transition tool. If you were working with Java 1.4 and maybe C# 1.x, there was a beta utility from Microsoft that did on-par conversion between the two. But that was a long time ago, and they don't publish the utility any longer. Even then, the utility would only convert source code at the language level, as opposed to dealing with the separate languages' implementation, i.e. in a Windows service, web service, console app, etc. Having ported applications in both directions (C#->Java and Java->C#), the manual effort IS your shortest path. Any tool that suggests otherwise is likely a poor implementation. You're making modifications in either case. Convert-and-update is slower than writing-from-scratch. Not to suggest this, but if the basis for your approach is not time-savings but rather a lack of understanding C#, then a conversion tool is only going to cause you more problems because it will hide the true intention of the source code. Basically, take your lumps and roll your own. Follow @Padmarag's suggestion and stick with simplicity. The closest agreement between your two options (C# and Java) is a generated WSDL. This is a great way to get started with your base objects and operations.
