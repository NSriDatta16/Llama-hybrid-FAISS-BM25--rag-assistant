Sort products by 2 attributes in magento catal

On my magento site we have the requirement to sort the product listings by 2 attributes, 'Manufacturer', 'Name' and then falling back to the Unique and default attribute 'Entity ID'. Seems magento only lets you order by 1 then entity_id. I dont mind having to do this in a hacky way if required. Looking around a few people have the problem but no one seems to offer an answer so thought I'd give this ago ( First question too, had to be a toughie :) ). http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/7314/ http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/206869/
