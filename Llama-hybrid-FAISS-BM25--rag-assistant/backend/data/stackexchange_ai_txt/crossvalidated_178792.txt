How to use LDA results for feature selection?

I am working on the Forest type mapping dataset which is available in the UCI machine learning repository. I have 27 features to predict the 4 types of forest. I am performing a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the number of features using lda() function available in the MASS library. The results of my LDA are as follows - forest.lda From wiki and other links what I understand is LD1, LD2 and LD3 are functions that I can use to classify the new data (LD1 73.7% and LD2 19.7%). I am not able to interpret how I can use this result to reduce the number of features or select only the relevant features as LD1 and LD2 functions have coefficient for each feature. I am looking for help on interpreting the results to reduce the number of features from $27$ to some $x
