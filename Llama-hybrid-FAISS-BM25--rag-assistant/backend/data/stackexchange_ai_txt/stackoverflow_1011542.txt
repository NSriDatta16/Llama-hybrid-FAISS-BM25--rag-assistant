Steve Dekorte: "Writing a Mandelbrot set calculator in a high level language is like trying to run the Indy 500 in a bus." http://www.dekorte.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&id=4047 I recommend to learn various tools in order to use the right tool for the job. Doing matrix transformations could be done efficiently using high-level API which wraps around tight loops with arithmetic-intensive computations. See RubyInline gem for an example of embedding C or C++ code into Ruby script. There is also Io language which is much slower than Ruby, but it efficiently renders movies in Pixar and outperforms raw C on vector arithmetics by using SIMD acceleration. http://iolanguage.com https://renderman.pixar.com/products/tools/it.html http://iolanguage.com/scm/git/checkout/Io/docs/IoGuide.html#Primitives-Vector
