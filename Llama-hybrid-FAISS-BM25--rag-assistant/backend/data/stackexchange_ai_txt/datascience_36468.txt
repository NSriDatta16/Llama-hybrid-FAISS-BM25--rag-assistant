I would suggest instead of trying to get many sources, get one source that goes through concepts first (fairly robustly), then seek out sources to refine or deepen your knowledge. One source comes from Stanford's NLP group, and is Introduction to Information Retrieval . The only thing I don't like about this books is that it tends to orient documents as columns (where data science has more or less agreed that they are rows), but that's a pretty trivial concern (as long as you can take a matrix transpose). Aside from that, this book has excellent explanations, and the proper depth and breadth to be considered an exhaustive base for NLP.
