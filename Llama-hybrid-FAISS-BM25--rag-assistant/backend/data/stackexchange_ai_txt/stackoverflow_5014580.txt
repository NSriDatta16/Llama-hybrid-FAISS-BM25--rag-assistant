I've made my background graphics 480x864, the hdpi equivalent of WQVGA and thus as large as it gets. Since I center background graphics vertically, this will display nicely on QVGA, HVGA, WQVGA and WVGA, cropping a bit in most cases. To make sure that the important elements are always seen, I limit them to an area of 480x640 in the center. To leave nothing to chance, I provide scaled down versions of the graphics at the same aspect ratio for MDPI and LDPI. Works great so far.
