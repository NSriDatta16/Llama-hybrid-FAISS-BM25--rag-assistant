It depends! Assuming the mesh is of an object that is a 2-dimensional manifold (i.e. topologically equivalent to a plane over sufficiently small areas around any point on the surface) and the first pass renders front- and back-facing triangles or just front-facing ones, and the depth function is GL_LESS or GL_LEQUAL then the second paragraph is right, since the front-facing triangles are always in front of the back-facing triangles and hence will always cause the depth test to fail. Of course, if you use GL_GREATER or GL_GEQUAL as your depth function, the reverse is true so the first paragraph is correct.
