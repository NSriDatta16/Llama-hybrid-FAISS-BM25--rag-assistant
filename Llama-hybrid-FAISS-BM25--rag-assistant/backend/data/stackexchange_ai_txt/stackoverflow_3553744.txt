The Drupal way is to keep installing modules on top of more modules until your application does what you want. Strongarm might be the best solution. But you can also write an update hook that sets the values in your variables table. So this way your changes are captured in code. You'll need to take a look at your variables tables and possibly the admin form in your module to see what values it stores. It kinda sucks that you have to do that. Writing update hooks is good practice when you're collaborating. It's akin to Ruby on Rails migration technique. I can't remember using the word "akin" before! See: http://api.drupal.org/api/function/hook_update_N http://api.drupal.org/api/function/variable_set You should also encourage your team to regularly grab a copy of the database from one definitive location so, if you make changes to the schema, it's likely that your team will pick up those changes soon enough (after you've applied them). But that's not really a guarantee. Just a half decent form of risk management.
