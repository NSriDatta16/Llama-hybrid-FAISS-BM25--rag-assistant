Creating thinned models in during Dropout process

Applying dropout to a neural network amounts to sampling a “thinned” network from it. The thinned network consists of all the units that survived dropout. A neural net with $n$ units can be seen as a collection of $2^n$ possible thinned neural networks. Source: Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks fromOverfitting , pg. 1931. How are we getting these $2^n$ models?
