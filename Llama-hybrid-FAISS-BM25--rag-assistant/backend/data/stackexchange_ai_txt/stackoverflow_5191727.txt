"#IF DEBUG" should be used with extreme caution. You are telling the tested code to act differently during test, thus rendering the test pretty close to useless. Catch specific exception types instead. No exceptions should just be caught silently - they must leave some kind of trail. So, either you throw an exception, or you do something that can be detected by outiders - including your test. My advice would be to identify the different types of exceptions your code will encounter, and make a catch block for each. Remember that you can create your own exception types: private class MyException: Exception { } This can be used to organize your exeptions in groups that corresponds to the logic of your code. If your program is not a windows- or a webservice, I would recommend that you do not catch the basic "Exception" type. This is based on the philosophy that if the program meets unexpected behavior, it should be felt loud and clear. In this context, exceptions should NOT be considered unexpected (i.e. when using a database, one should expect occasional connection problems, timeouts, user issues etc.).
