The integral in question is in fact the Kullback-Leibler divergance between $F(\cdot,θ_0)$ and $F(\cdot,\hat{θ})$. You cannot generally say that it converges to anything (especially considering the fact that you parametric assumption may be wrong). However, for certain distribution families it has good estimates. You might want to look at Vladimir Spokoiny publications , who has spent quite a lot of time working on this sort of problems. For instance, you might consider useful this article about exponential family distributions (2005).
