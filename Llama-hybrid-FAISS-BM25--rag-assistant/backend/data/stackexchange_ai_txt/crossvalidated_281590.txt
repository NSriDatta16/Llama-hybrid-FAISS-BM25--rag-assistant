How do I create a lift curve?

I am having trouble constructing a lift curve from scratch. Say I have bunch of 0-1 labels, and predictive labels. In order to construct the lift curve, I do the following steps (assume I have already trained my model using a logistic regression): make a prediction using the validation set Sort the outcome of step #1 in terms of decreasing probability (here, I am talking about the probability of getting a label 1) Then, I divide this sorted outcomes into 10 bin of equal size. For each bin, I do the following: i) Count the number of true- label 1 occurrences. ii) Do a random samples (say n = 200), and count the number of true-label 1 occurrences in the random samples iii) divide step-i) by step-ii) to get the lift. Repeat this for the remaining bins. Is this the correct way to build a lift curve from scratch?
