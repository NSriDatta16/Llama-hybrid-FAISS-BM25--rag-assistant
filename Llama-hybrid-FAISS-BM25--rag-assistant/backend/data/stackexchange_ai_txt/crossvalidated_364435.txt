Which approach to estimate conditional probability?

Hope this is clear. Suppose we have two categorical random variables and want to estimate $P(A|B)$ with data: A B 0 1 1 0 . . . . . . 0 1 We could take two approaches: (1) use a logistic regression model $$P(A=a|B=b) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_0 + \beta_1b}}$$ (2) count $$P(A=a|B=b)=\frac{count(a,b)}{count(b)}$$ Which approach should we use? Suppose now that B is continuous. Which should we use?
