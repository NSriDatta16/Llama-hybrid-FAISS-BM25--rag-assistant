Scala - get unique values from List with a twist

I have a list like this: val l= List(("Agent", "PASS"), ("Agent", "FAIL"), ("Agent 1", "FAIL"), ("Agent", "PASS"), ("Agent 2", "PASS") ) and I need to end up with a list like this: val filteredList= List(("Agent", "FAIL"), ("Agent 1", "FAIL"), ("Agent 2", "PASS") ) What happened? ("Agent", "PASS"), ("Agent", "FAIL") becomes ("Agent", "FAIL") (because if there is at least one FAIL, I need to keep that entry) the entries for Agent 1 and Agent 2 stay the same because there are just one entry for each. The closest answer I found is How in Scala to find unique items in List but I cannot tell how to keep the entries with FAIL. I hope the question is clear, if not, I can give you a better example. Thanks
