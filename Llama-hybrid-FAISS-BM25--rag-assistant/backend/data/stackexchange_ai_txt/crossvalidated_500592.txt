Method for obtaining an asymmetric confidence interval

I have an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ = $\frac{XY}{Z}$ where $X$ and $Y$ are constants and $Z$ is a random variable. $Z$ ranges from [1, $Y$ ]. Further $Z$ $\rightarrow$ $Y$ in the limit (asymptotically), and therefore $X$ $\rightarrow$ $\hat{\theta}$ . I can use the Delta Method to produce a Wald-type (symmetric) confidence interval (CI) for $\theta$ through relying on the asymptotic normality of $Z$ . The interval is $\hat{\theta} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{Z_{n}}\sqrt{\hat{\theta}}$ where $Z_{n}$ is the last realization corresponding to $Z$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ is the estimated (sample) standard deviation. Unfortunately, at small sample sizes, the resulting confidence interval will likely have very poor coverage due to the nonlinear nature of $\theta$ as a function of $Z$ . Thus, I suspect that an asymmetric interval would be better. Is there a simple method (easily coded up in R) to produce such an asymmetric interval? I found the below link to a post by @Cliff AB which suggests that direct sampling from $N(\hat{\theta}, \hat{\sigma^2}$ ) would work. A user points out that this can be accomplished via resampling, since techniques like bootstrapping are equivalent to the delta method. Sampling instead of delta method Once resampling is done, a simple 95% CI could be formed from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the resulting estimated sampling distribution of $\hat{\theta}$ . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
