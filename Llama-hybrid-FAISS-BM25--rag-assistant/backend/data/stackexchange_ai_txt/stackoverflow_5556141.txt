Assigning class to div element based on hash fragment in URL

I hope someone can help! My website: http://www.richardmilne.net I have a wordpress site set up to use the iinclude plugin to display individual pages all on the front page. This works great but I don't want users to access individual pages, ie "site.com/page". If a user visits "site.com/page" (eg from a search result), I want them to be redirected to "site.com/#location", have the window scroll to the correct location, and trigger the jquery slider. (see link above) I was planning on using .htaccess to redirect the page. After that from what I've gathered I need to use a bit of javascript trickery to trigger the desired div to slide open. In my case this is simply a case of changing it's class to "toggle_initial", which the jquery script animates after an 800ms delay on page load. (again, see the link above, which already uses this to load the "recent posts" section when you first visit. Just so you know this is a jquery-UI plugin). It's the bit in the middle I can't get my head round. What I've read so far tells me I can't do this with php which was my first approach, as "PHP_SELF" ignores the "#location" bit of the URL. This leaves javascript up to the task of changing the div's class, I've found these links which I'm sure contain some hints for me, but as a javascript novice I can't make head nor tail of how to apply them to my site: Adding a class to an a element with a particular href using hash doing substring in window.location.hash Any tips would be greatly appreciated, cheers!
