Books reference for econometrics for PhD that focus on the programming aspect

I'd like to know which book you would recommend for studying econometrics in a rigorous way at a PhD level. I'm aware that this question has already been asked, but what I want to question is slightly different. I found the Hamilton book for time series the best one by far. The problem I have with this book is that it lacks in providing examples about coding, maybe because is quite old. Is there any book on the market that is rigorous as the Hamilton and provides coding examples? There is something out there but is more about a statistical approach. About cross-section analysis, in my opinion, the Wooldridge (advanced version) is the real Bible. Is there, something, also for this research field, that is more about coding and still rigorous as the Wooldridge?
