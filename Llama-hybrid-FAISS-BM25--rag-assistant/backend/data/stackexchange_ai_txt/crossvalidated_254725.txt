This paragraph from a blog post seems to answer the question: The key relationship between images and statistics is that we can interpret images as samples from a high-dimensional probability distribution. The probability distribution goes over the pixels of images. Imagine you’re taking a picture with your camera. This picture will have some finite number of pixels. When you take an image with your camera, you are sampling from this complex probability distribution. This distribution is what we’ll use to define what makes an image normal or not. With images, unlike with the normal distributions, we don’t know the true probability distribution and we can only collect samples. Upon more thinking, what cements the idea for me is that one can in fact make any wanted pattern be a 'real picture', by drawing that pattern and with proper conditions, taking a picture of it. Hence, all combinations of pixels are 'real'. With this said, it is obvious that the probabilistic component is a necessity for a 'fake'/'real' classification.
