Different results for Bayesian ANOVA in JASP and R (BayesFactor)

I computed Bayes Factors for a repeated measures ANOVA in JASP and the R package BayesFactor. There were two between-subjects groups (factor "group") with multiple measurements. However, the results were different: JASP output: Model comparison - dependent Models P(M) P(M|data) BF M BF 10 % error group 0.200 5.618e -56 2.247e -55 0.174 0.944 Analysis of Effects - dependent Effects P(incl) P(incl|data) BF Inclusion group 0.600 0.169 0.135 vs. BayesFactor model: bf = anovaBF(val ~ group + subj, data = dat, + whichRandom="subj") BayesFactor output: Bayes factor analysis -------------- [1] group + subj : 0.1693252 Â±0.69% This is my first Bayesian analysis, so I may be missing some obvious points. The analyses were performed according to the manuals though. Update: I now noticed that the BayesFactor output is identical to the P(incl|data) value provided by JASP. I am trying to find evidence for the null hypothesis. I want to report the BF 10, but I do not know how it relates to the BayesFactor output. I would be very thankful for a clarification which portions of the output are relevant.
