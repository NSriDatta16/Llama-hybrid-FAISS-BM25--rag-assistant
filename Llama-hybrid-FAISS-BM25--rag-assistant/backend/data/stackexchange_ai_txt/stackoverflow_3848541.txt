Running a swf file locally doesn't really work for applications that have been pushed out to end users. The user's won't have access to any updates of the application (which an Air application does). Also a swf run locally might not be able to connect back to the server it came from, depending on the security settings. In reality the nice part of flex is you don't have to commit to web or air. You can develop an application that can be built to run in both the web and on the desktop. For example you can put a majority of the code in a library project and then have a web specific and desktop specific projects that use that library. Two other advantages of Air - one is that it allows you manage updates to your application and have the updates automatically pushed out. Second is it supports drag and drop (similar to native file access) so you can support dragging pictures or files onto your application.
