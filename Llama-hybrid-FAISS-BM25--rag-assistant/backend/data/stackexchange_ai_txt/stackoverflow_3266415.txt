jquery each on a JSON api

I'm trying to loop through the NY Times' search API. The resulting JSON looks like this: { "offset": "0", "results": [{ "body": "NEW ORLEANS &mdash; The hemorrhaging well that has spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico remained capped for a second day Friday, providing some hope of a long-term solution to the environmental disaster. Live video from the seabed Friday morning showed that all was quiet around the top of the well, suggesting the test", "byline": "By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and HENRY FOUNTAIN", "date": "20100717", "title": "Oil Spill Capped for a Second Day, Offering Some Hope", "url": "http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/17\/us\/17spill.html" }, { "body": "GALVESTON, Tex. &mdash; The crayons and paper were out, but not too many children made it to family day at the Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig and Museum . Granted, the exhibits of pipelines and seismic vessels may have been over the heads of many grade-schoolers. And despite a few cheerful displays about marine life around rigs and all the bounty", "byline": "By MELENA RYZIK", "date": "20100716", "title": "Texas Remains Stoic as Spill Hits Its Shores", "url": "http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/16\/us\/16galveston.html" } (that's just two in the larger 'results' set) Here's the code I'm using (with my API key removed) $.getJSON('http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v1/article?format=json&query=oil%2C+bp%2C+gulf+of+mexico&api-key=KEY_REMOVED'+'&callback=?', function(e) { $.each(e.results, function() { $('#slippery').appendTo( ' ' + this.title + ' ' ); }); }); I feel like this should work to loop through and print all the story titles, but it's not. The Chrome dev tools return two errors: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token" and "Resource interpreted as script but transferred with MIME type text/plain" I'm still working my way through Jquery parsing of JSON, so I'm sure I'm doing something simple incorrectly. Any help would be much appreciated.
