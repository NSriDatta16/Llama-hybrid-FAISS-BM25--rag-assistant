How can I make the Android browser render my document at the screen's size?

I'm working on a site that's supposed to scale fluently down to low resolutions, so that it would work just as well on a phone. This works well in Firefox and Chrome when I just make the window small, but when I try it out on an actual Android phone (Nexus One running Android 2.2), it renders it super-huge! (Using JS's window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties, it seems the viewport resolution it reports is 800x1271!) Is there a way to render the page at actual-size in the browser window so I can have my full design show up on the phone? User-agent sniffing is allowed, JS is allowed but discouraged.
