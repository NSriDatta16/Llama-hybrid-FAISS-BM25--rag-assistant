A Question About Embedding HTML In PHP

Some time ago I read a posting on a board where the person was talking poorly about people that have HTML embedded/within their PHP. I do quite a bit of PHP development but I still interleave HTML and PHP in the same document. Is there a better way to do this, am I doing it wrong? I know that in JSP/JSF they use an XML document with namespaces to insert their HTML code so I was wondering if there was a similar function that PHP uses that I should be taking advantage of. Thanks for taking the time to read. :-)
