In answer to your comment: To make part of the window transparent, call the UpdateLayerdWindow function and give it a partially transparent background image. You can also pass the ULW_COLORKEY instead of giving a partially transparent background image, and every part of the window that is the color you specify will become transparent. (most people use magenta). However, if you do it this way, you can't make part of the window semitransparent.
