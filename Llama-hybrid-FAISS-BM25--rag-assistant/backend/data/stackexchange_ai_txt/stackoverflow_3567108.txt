That depends on how the cookie was defined, especially if the Domain attribute is specified what values it has (see RFC 2965 – User Agent Role ): if Domain attribute is missing, the user agent assumes the current host; otherwise if Domain attribute is set, its value must start with a . like .example.com (if not, e.g. example.com , it will get changed by the user agent to .example.com ). Now the domain of a cookies must domain-match the a domain to be send within the request. And that is the case: if either the domains are identical (in case the Domain parameter was missing), or if the value specified in the Domain attribute must be a suffix of the domain. That means: effective domain | example.com | a.example.com | foo.example.com | bar.a.example.com ------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------------+------------------- example.com | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ a.example.com | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ .example.com | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ .a.example.com | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ So if you want a cookie to only be valid for a.example.com , you either omit the Domain attribute or you specify the Domain attribute with .a.example.com (that will make the cookie valid for a.example.com as well as its subdomains).
