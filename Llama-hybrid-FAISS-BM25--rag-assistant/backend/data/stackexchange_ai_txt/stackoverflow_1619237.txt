Triple-DES is still in use today but is widely considered a legacy encryption algorithm. DES is inherently insecure, while Triple-DES has much better security characteristics but is still considered problematic. NIST is the government organization that standardizes on cryptographic algorithms. The most current symmetric-key encryption algorithm NIST standard is AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard. In fact, there were a number of good nominations to be NIST's AES, including the Rijndael algorithm which became AES, as well as Bruce Schneier's Blowfish, the Twofish algorithm, and the Serpent algorithm.
