Combination of a discrete and a continuous Markov Chain in a MCMC

Recently, I've been questioning myself on the possibility of combining a discrete update and a continuous update on a single MCMC. Stephens (2000) in Algorithm 3.2 runs the process for a fixed amount of time and then use this result to update the rest while Mohammadi and Wit (2015) use a continuous update on one "parameter" and a discrete update on the other. Which is the correct way to go and why? I can't find any theoretical literature about it but I find it easier to discretize the continuous chain.
