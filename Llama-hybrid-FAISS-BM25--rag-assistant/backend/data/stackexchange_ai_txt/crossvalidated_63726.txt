Nonparametric/nonlinear regression

I am looking for a survey/book on some state-of-the-art non-parametric (or nonlinear regression) methods, preferably with an inclination towards sequential data. Untill now I have used gaussian process regression and some others such as knn regression, Random Forest regression, etc. I am looking for other possible regressors for example particle filtering based regression, etc. As mentioned earlier, a recent survey would be great.
