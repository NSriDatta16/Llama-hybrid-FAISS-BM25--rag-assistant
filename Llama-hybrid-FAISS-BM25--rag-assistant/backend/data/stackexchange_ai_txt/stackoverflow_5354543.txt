Since the query plans are actually consistently different, that implies that the optimizer's cardinality estimates are off for some reason. Can you confirm from the query plans that the optimizer expects the conditions to be insufficiently selective when bind variables are used? Since you're using 11.2, Oracle should be using adaptive cursor sharing so it shouldn't be a bind variable peeking issue (assuming you are calling the version with bind variables many times with different NO values in your testing. Are the cardinality estimates on the good plan actually correct? I know you said that the statistics on the NO column are accurate but I would be suspicious of a stray histogram that may not be updated by your regular statistics gathering process, for example. You could always use a hint in the query to force a particular index to be used (though using a stored outline or optimizer plan stability would be preferable from a long-term maintenance perspective). Any of those options would be preferable to resorting to dynamic SQL. One additional test to try, however, would be to replace the SQL 99 join syntax with Oracle's old syntax, i.e. SELECT > FROM > cust, organization org WHERE cust.org_id = org.id AND ( ((org_from IS NULL) OR (org_from = org.no))) That obviously shouldn't change anything, but there have been parser issues with the SQL 99 syntax so that's something to check.
