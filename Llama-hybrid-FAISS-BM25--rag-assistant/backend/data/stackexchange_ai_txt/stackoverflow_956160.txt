One object-oriented approach is to use a library called ECS . It is quite simple library, and has not changed for ages. Then again, the HTML 4.01 spec has not changed either ;) I've used ECS and consider it far better than generating large HTML fragments with just Strings or StringBuffers/StringBuilders. Small example: Option optionElement = new Option(); optionElement.setTagText("bar"); optionElement.setValue("foo"); optionElement.setSelected(false); optionElement.toString() would now yield: bar The library supports both HTML 4.0 and XHTML. The only thing that initially bothered me a lot was that names of classes related to the XHTML version started with a lowercase letter: option , input , a , tr , and so on, which goes against the most basic Java conventions. But that's something you can get used to if you want to use XHTML; at least I did, surprisingly fast.
