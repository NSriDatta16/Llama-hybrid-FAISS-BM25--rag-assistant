To produce a probability for weights you should really apply Bayesian methods in this case. This is not about frequentism against Bayes, but you have some very strong prior information here: You know, that a chickens weight is not negative and that it is not .5 kg. Standard frequentist methods are basically open for all results, often presuming normally distributed data and your example is a good example for non-normally distributed data. Find yourself a credible prior distribution that excludes negative chicken (how about half-normal prior?) and compute a posterior distribution. From that posterior distribution you can conclude real probabilities.
