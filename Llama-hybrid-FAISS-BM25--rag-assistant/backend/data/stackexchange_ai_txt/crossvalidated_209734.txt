Performance of Logistic Regression with time

I am building a predictive model using logistic regression to predict if an applicant should be given a credit product based on their telecommunication data of the previous eight months postpaid subscribers only. But the behaviors I am trying to capture can vary with time for the entire population. Example: data usage, spending power, etc will vary with time. So the question is how to build a model that performs consistently across time. Else, a suggestion on how to refresh/update the model with time should help as well.
