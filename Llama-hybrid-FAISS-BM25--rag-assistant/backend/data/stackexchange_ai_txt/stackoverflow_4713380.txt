Should you get swfobject.js from the same place you get this code which displaying your flash content? Also you may find swfobject.js here http://blog.deconcept.com/2007/02/28/swfobject-1-5-released/ Than put it in to your solution and check if path src='swfobject.js' in is correct. Also you may drag and drop your 'swfobject.js' file from solution to aspx and designer will add new section with correct path. UPDATE: 1) you need to say var s1 = new SWFObject(...) not var s1 = new swfobject(...) 2) s1.write('preview'); it's mean "Place flash content to element with Id = 'preview' ". So you need to place f.e.g div with id='preview' on your form. In your case if you don't have element Id = 'preview' there is nowhere to place your flash content. You need to upgrade your Flash Player Than it should work.
