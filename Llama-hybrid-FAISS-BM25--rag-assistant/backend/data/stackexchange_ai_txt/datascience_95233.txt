Definition of linear model

I am new to machine learning and am a bit confused about the definition of a linear model. I've searched many sources and the most common definition is: The term linear model implies that the model is specified as a linear combination of features. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/linear-models.html As I understood, when we speak about linear classifier, we mean an algorithm like that: $a(x)=w_1 * x_1 + w_2 * x_2 + ... + w_n * x_n$ , where $w_i$ - weights, $x_i$ - features. So, the question is, term "linear" means function, which is mathematically linear by feature or by weight? For example, in the task, where we have only one feature, can we say, that algorithm $a(x) = w*((x)^2)$ is linear classifier? The same question about $a(x)=((w)^2)*(x)$ ? Thanks!
