I can think of two other possibilities that focus more on which variables are important to which clusters. Multi-class classification. Consider the objects that belong to cluster x members of the same class (e.g., class 1) and the objects that belong to other clusters members of a second class (e.g., class 2). Train a classifier to predict class membership (e.g., class 1 vs. class 2). The classifier's variable coefficients can serve to estimate the importance of each variable in clustering objects to cluster x . Repeat this approach for all other clusters. Intra-cluster variable similarity. For every variable, calculate the average similarity of each object to its centroid. A variable that has high similarity between a centroid and its objects is likely more important to the clustering process than a variable that has low similarity. Of course, similarity magnitude is relative, but now variables can be ranked by the degree to which they help to cluster the objects in each cluster.
