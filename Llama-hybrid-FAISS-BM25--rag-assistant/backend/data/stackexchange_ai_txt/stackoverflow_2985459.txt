There is not much benefit in porting from phone to desktop. While that is essentially a freebie once you write the VM, it is not compelling in itself. The touch interface does not always work well with a mouse. The reason to write it would be to add 100k free apps to android. I say free because there would be no reason to buy them, since you could just copy them. The VM would be equivalent to a jailbroken phone in terms of piracy. Legally, I think you would have no better standing the psystar did. If you are making a pure VM, then you are installing Apple OS on unlicensed hardware. I am no lawyer, but I cannot imagine they would embrace the project. You could also try to be like Wine, implementing the entire OS from scratch. As far as the actual feasibility of running apps in a VM on Android, I would have low expectations. Apple hardware is better than average, while Android hardware covers a wide range. Many apps would run poorly or not at all on a lot of the android hardware out there, even if there was no overhead for the VM. And there will be overhead for the VM.
