Time Series chart X-axis Time display

I am working on TimeSeries in jfreechart and in this chart time is represented as hh:mm:ss. But when I start time from 00:00:00, chart shows the start time 12:00:00 and it rotates after 24 hour, but I do not want rotation of time such I want to see 25:00:00 in place of 1:00:00. Is there any solution for these problems? Thanks in advance.
