Before and after data: Which test for average comparison of Likert scale data?

I have one group of respondents which answer on a scale of 1-5 once before and once after an experiment. I want to see if the experiment made a difference to their responses. I was told not to use a t-test because of the Likert scale (ordinal data does not seem to fit a t-test) and because my data are not nearly normally distributed (answers to the questions lean heavily to the 1 of the scale (which is not a mistake in the design)). I am not sure if the Wilcoxon signed-rank test works, because it seems to be designed for differences in groups (as in "Do men respond differently from women?"). Any suggestions on what could actually be used here? (The answer here refers to a "special paired t-test", but does not explain which one)
