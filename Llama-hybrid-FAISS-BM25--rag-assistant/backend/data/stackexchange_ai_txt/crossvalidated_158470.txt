A prediction interval is an interval that covers the future (or otherwise unknown) value of a random variable with some prespecified probability. Prediction intervals are conceptually related to confidence intervals , but they are not the same. A prediction interval pertains to a realization (which has not yet been observed, but will be observed in the future), whereas a confidence interval pertains to a parameter (which is in principle not observable, e.g., the population mean). See Rob Hyndman's blog post "The difference between prediction intervals and confidence intervals" for more illustration. In a time series context, prediction intervals are also known as forecast intervals .
