typedef would be better in this instance because #define is just a generic mechanism but typedef is for defining types which is what you are doing. I would say put your code: #ifdef WIN32 /* windows stuff */ #else typedef unsigned long DWORD; typedef unsigned short WORD; typedef unsigned int UNINT32; #endif into a new header file (with #define guards/#pragma once), then include that from the header or source files as necessary.
