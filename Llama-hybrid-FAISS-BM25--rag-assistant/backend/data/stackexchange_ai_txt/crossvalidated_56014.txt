If you think that "DK" answers give information, then you don't want to treat them as missing and therefore don't want to multiply impute them. Multinomial logistic regression is, as you say, the usual method for nominal outcome variables; it works well; what other methods did you have in mind? One other possibility is ordinal logistic, which would assume that "DK" is somewhere between "Yes" and "No"; the reasonableness of this assumption depends on your exact situation. Another possibility is multinomial probit - I have never seen this used. In the binomial case, the results of probit and logistic regression are often quite similar.
