Probably the standard approach in these cases would be to use a generalized linear model . Appropriate hypothesis tests can then be made. This is analogous to fitting a general linear model and then making hypothesis tests that result in the traditional anova for conditionally normal distributions. Addition: I should also mention that for some situations there may be specific appropriate tests, especially for the two sample case. For example, two binomial proportions could be compared with a chi-square test (shown below with both prop.test and the equivalent chisq.test ). There are also tests to compare samples for Poisson processes, though I'm not very familiar with them. Below is an example worked through in R to compare two binomial samples with logistic regression. One with 6 out of 16 successes and one with 10 out of 16 successes. This code can be run in R or at rdrr.io Load some supplemental packages. if(!require(car)){install.packages("car")} if(!require(emmeans)){install.packages("emmeans")} Create two samples of data. A = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) B = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Y = c(A, B) Group = c(rep("A", length(A)), rep("B", length(B))) Logistic regression and analysis of deviance model = glm(Y ~ Group, family=binomial()) library(car) Anova(model, test="Wald") ### Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) ### ### Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) ### Group 1 1.9571 0.1618 Use emmeans to get the proportions for the samples, confidence intervals for these proportions, and pairwise comparisons. library(emmeans) marginals = emmeans(model, ~ Group, type="response") marginals ### Group prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL ### A 0.375 0.121 Inf 0.179 0.623 ### B 0.625 0.121 Inf 0.377 0.821 pairs(marginals) ### contrast odds.ratio SE df z.ratio p.value ### A / B 0.36 0.263 Inf -1.399 0.1618 For comparison, we could use a simple chi-square to compare two binomial proportions. Note that the results are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the results from logistic regression. prop.test(c(sum(A), sum(B)), c(length(A), length(B)), correct=FALSE) ### prop.test(c(6, 10), c(16, 16), correct=FALSE) ### 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction ### ### X-squared = 2, df = 1, p-value = 0.1573 ### ### sample estimates: ### prop 1 prop 2 ### 0.375 0.625 Note that this test is equivalent to a chi-square test of association on a contingency table.
