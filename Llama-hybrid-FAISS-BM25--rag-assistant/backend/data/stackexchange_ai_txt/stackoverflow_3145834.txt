I think you are close, you just need a list of distinct Ids instead if distinct objects. Try adding this to your criteria: criteria.setProjection(Projections.distinct(Projections.property("Id"))); The reason this works is because the projection will perform the distinctness check as part of the sql query, instead of what a ResultTransformer does which is to filter the results for distinctness after the sql query has been performed. the above is a quote from the answer at 300491
