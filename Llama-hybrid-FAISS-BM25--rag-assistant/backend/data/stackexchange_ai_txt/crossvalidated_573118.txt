Intuitive effect size (and CI) for one-way comparison of group means?

I'm a big fan of common language effect sizes (e.g. McGraw and Wong's CL or Cohen's U3 - "what proportion of group 1 are higher than the average for group 2"). I've been scrabbling around trying to find something like that I could pull out of a multiple group comparison (as would be commonly analysed with one-way ANOVA). But most of the literature seems to stop at two-group comparisons. It occurred to me that a nice effect size would be either the CL or U3 of the highest mean compared with the lowest mean out of all of them. Obviously, that is easy to compute. But what I'm struggling with then is, is it possible to calculate a confidence interval on that? At first glance it looks closely related to Hsu's MCB ("Multiple Comparisons to the Best"), except that that looks at unstandardised differences (and I'm looking for something standardised). If there were an adaptation of Hsu's MCB to Cohen's d (instead of unstandardised diffs), that I guess would work for this, but I appreciate that is an added layer of complexity (needing to account for sampling of SD also), and I haven't been able to find anything that goes that far. So: Is there a way of calculating a confidence interval on the Cohen's d between the highest and lowest means in one-way ANOVA type setup? Alternatively, is there a nice super-intuitive effect size (with CI) that I could use?
