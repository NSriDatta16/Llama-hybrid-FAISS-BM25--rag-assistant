The performance of an array-based solution expanded with realloc() will depend on your strategy for creating more space. If you increase the amount of space by adding a fixed amount of storage on each re-allocation, you'll end up with an expansion that, on average, depends on the number of elements you have stored in the array. This is on the assumption that realloc will need to (occasionally) allocate space elsewhere and copy the contents, rather than just expanding the existing allocation. If you increase the amount of space by adding a proportion of your current number of elements (doubling is pretty standard), you'll end up with an expansion that, on average, takes constant time.
