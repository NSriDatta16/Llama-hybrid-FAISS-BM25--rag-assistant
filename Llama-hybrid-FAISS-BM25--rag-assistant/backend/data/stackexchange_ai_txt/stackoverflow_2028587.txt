How to perform video editing with Silverlight?

I would like to port an ActiveX of mine (to Silverlight) that have the following features: Embedding a logo image in any video file. Embedding subtitles in any video file. Cropping any video file (for example: cropping 10 seconds of a 1 min. video). Save the video file result (by the current encoders of the client). The current ActiveX uses DirectShow - unfortunately, it can't be used in Silverlight. How I can abandon the old ActiveX technology for the new Silverlight technology?
