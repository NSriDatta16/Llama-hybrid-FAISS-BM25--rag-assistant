One possibility: Generate four (non-orthoganal) 3-vectors, \vec{v}_i from the center of the tetrahedron toward each vertex. For each four position x = (x_1 .. x_4) form the vector sum \Sum_i x_i*\vec{v}_i . Of course this mapping is not unique in general, but you condition that the x_i 's sum to 1 constrains things.
