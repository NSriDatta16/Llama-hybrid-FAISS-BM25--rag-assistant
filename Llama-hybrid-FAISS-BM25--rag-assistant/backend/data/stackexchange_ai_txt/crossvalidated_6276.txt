Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples by Robert H. Shumway and David S. Stoffer would be a great resource for the subject, but you may find a lot of useful blog entries (e.g. my favorite one: learnr ) and tutorials (e.g. from the linked homepage ) also on the Internet freely available . On David Stoffer's homepage (linked above) you can find the example datasets used in the book's chapters, and others from the first and second editions with even sample chapters also.
