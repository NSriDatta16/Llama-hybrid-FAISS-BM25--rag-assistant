I believe that $conf(B_m)$ refers to the average confidence of the network at the bin $B_m$ . In order to implement the ECE, you set up M bins on the range=[0,1] with M $conf(B_m)$ is found by averaging the confidences in that bin. So for example, say in $B_0 = [0,0.25]$ you have 3 data items each with individual confidences 0.1,0.15, and 0.2. You would find $conf(B_0)$ by taking the average of the confidences in this bin, $$conf(B_0) = (0.1+0.15+0.2)/3 = 0.15$$ . I referenced this webpage by James D. McCaffrey, and he has an even more thorough explanation I would recommend looking into. https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2021/01/22/how-to-calculate-expected-calibration-error-for-multi-class-classification/#:~:text=Expected%20calibration%20error%20(ECE)%20is,probabilities%20of%20a%20correct%20prediction
