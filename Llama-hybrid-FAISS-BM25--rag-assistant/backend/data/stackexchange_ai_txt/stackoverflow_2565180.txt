Yes, tabs are considered to be evil by a few. However, if you want to use TransformFactory and want to change the indenting behavior to use tabs instead of spaces, you need to provide your own implementation of ContentHandler . Then pass your implementation of ContentHandler into a new SAXResult - pass that as the "result" to the Transformer.transform(...) . Lot of hoops to jump through. Another consideration may be to use a smart XSLT over your output.
