.Net : main resources, tools and libraries, open source or not, to build entreprise level applications?

As a young professional in .Net, I noticed that there are plenty of .Net application blocks for build an entreprise level application. Still, I could not find a place where all these resources are gathered, as an entry point to .Net development for beginners or professional. Here is my question. Which application blocks do you use in your entreprise-level application? Please classify your blocks (database access, GUI, testing... add tags to it dammit!), precise if it is open source or not. If your library provides functionnality in several fields (like Microsoft prism), some additional information would be great. Be specific. No tiny useful block shall be forgotten. Vote up useful and entreprise level libraries, vote down unstable ones. Gotta catch'em all! Of course if such a place exists, I'd be glad to get its url ;-) Libraries : Microsoft Entreprise Library (Caching, Cryptography, Data Access, Exception Handling, Logging, Policy Injection, Security, Unity ie Dependency Injection, Validation - Open Source) by Robert Harvey NHibernate (O/R Mapping, Data Access - Open Source) by g. Proj.Net (Spatial Reference and Projection - Open Source) by George Resources : CodePlex (Open Source) by Nifle CodeProject (Open Source) by Nifle SourceForge (Open Source) by Nifle
