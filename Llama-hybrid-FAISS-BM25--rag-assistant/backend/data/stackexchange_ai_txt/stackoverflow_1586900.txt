Is it possible to to re-initialize an object in cocos2d

I have a class named insect child of sprite.I have created a instance of that class in GameLayer and then initialize with it using, insect *bgg = [insect spriteWithFile:@"bird2a.gif"]; then i set a timer(10 second) to change the image using *bgg = [insect spriteWithFile:@"2.gif"]; but my program crashes.Now my question is it possible to re-initialize an object or it is immutable?? I have another question, when i used - (BOOL) ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point2 = [touch locationInView:[touch view]]; CGPoint cpoint=[[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate:point2]; NSLog(@"In touch began"); } in my insect class it cannot detect touch on 'bgg' object declared in GameLayer.But when I used this function in GameLayer it can detect touch. whats wrong with my approach??Plz someone explain. Advanced thanx for your reply.
