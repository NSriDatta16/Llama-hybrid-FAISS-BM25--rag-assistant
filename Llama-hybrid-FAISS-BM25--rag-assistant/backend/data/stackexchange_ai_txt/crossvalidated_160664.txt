You need to examine the rest of the output to see the source of the test statistic. The Augmented Dickey Fuller Test runs an regression of the first difference of the time series against a lag of the level values of the time series plus lagged first differences. The test statistic is based on the significance of the lagged level values, not the significance of the overall regression via the F-statistic. The test statistic is the t-value of the lag of the level values of the time series. A rough guide to significance would be its associated p-value. However, the reported critical values at the end of the output are more appropriate. These are the adjusted critical values as calculated by MacKinnon for the ADF. It looks like you are using the urca package of R . Here's is the extended output on a simulated monthly time series with annual autocorrelation and a unit root. I set the (max) lags to twice the frequency and let ur.df (correctly) select the number of lags using the AIC. Note the test-statistic corresponds to the t-value. > arima.sim(list(ar=c(rep(0,11),0.8),order=c(12,1,0)),1000)->x > summary(ur.df(x,type="none",lags=24,selectlags="AIC")) ############################################### # Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Unit Root Test # ############################################### Test regression none Call: lm(formula = z.diff ~ z.lag.1 - 1 + z.diff.lag) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.1882 -0.6450 0.0481 0.7121 3.4243 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Value of test-statistic is: -0.6123 Critical values for test statistics: 1pct 5pct 10pct tau1 -2.58 - 1.95 - 1.62 The overall regression is highly significant as it picks up the AR(12) nature of the time series. However, the lagged level variable is not significant. Therefore, we would not reject the null hypothesis of a unit root under this test.
