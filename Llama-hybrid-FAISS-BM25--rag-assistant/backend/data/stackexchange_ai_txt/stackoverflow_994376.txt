Fast Scrolling in Tweetie with UITableView

On December 12th 2008, the maker of the Tweetie IPhone App posted a great example how he accomplishes UITableView scrolling without the jagged/raggedness that normally entails. His example code works great with version 2.2 of the SDK, however, when I compile for 3.0 I cannot get the click-highlight to work on an individual cell. Anyone have any idea what needs to be updated from 2.2 -> 3.0 to get his code to (fully) work?
