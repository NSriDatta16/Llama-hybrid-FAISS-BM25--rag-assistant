Reading int value from txt file on SD card android

So in this app I made, The user makes a project and when they save, the number of frames is saved to numberFrames.txt on the SD card. Then I retrieve the file in another class. Only thing is that nFrames = 50 when i show a toast of nFrames to the screen after I run this code. The only initializing of nFrames I do is to zero right above this code, which is located in the onCreate(). File sdcardLocal = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File dir = new File (sdcardLocal.getAbsolutePath() + "/Flipbook/"+customizeDialog.getTitle()+"/"); dir.mkdirs(); File fileNum = new File(dir, "numberFrames.txt"); FileWriter myFileWriter = null; try { myFileWriter = new FileWriter(fileNum); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(myFileWriter); try { String text = bitmaps.size()+""; out.write(text); out.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } I retrieve the file like this. I have no idea where this "50" value for nFrames came from as there are no loops around this and I know for sure that the particular project saved has only 3 frames. Why is this? FileInputStream is = null; BufferedInputStream bis = null; try { is = new FileInputStream(new File(mFolderDialog.getPath()+"/numberFrames.txt")); bis = new BufferedInputStream(is); nFrames = bis.read(); }catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
