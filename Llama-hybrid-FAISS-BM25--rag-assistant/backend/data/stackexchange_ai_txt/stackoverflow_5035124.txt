Add Image and Caption Text to Three20 Table section using TTSectionedDataSource

I am trying to create table using TTTableViewController . I want to display an image in the section header along with some caption text, something similar to what instagram and many other application does. I tried using the sample from TTNavigatorDemo to display data from TTSectionedDatasource , (I am not sure if this is the right way to do it, please suggest some better way if you know any). It contains section name/headers as regular strings and data as TTTableViewItem . I tried implementing protocol and achieved it using viewForHeaderInSection method, now the data is separated from section, Is there any better way using Three20 through which I can pass on my Header/Section view and TableItemView along in a datasource as it would allow me to implement the TTTableViewDragRefreshDelegate , which I was not able to implement when implementing the protocol in my class. My class declaration right now, looks something like @interface ImageTable : TTTableViewController { } I would like to show section headers with image and text like: : I am currently using the TTNavigatorCode to populate the data in my Table which is: self.dataSource = [TTSectionedDataSource dataSourceWithObjects: @"Food" [TTTableViewItem itemWithText:@"Porridge" URL:@"tt://food/porridge"], [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Bacon & Eggs" URL:@"tt://food/baconeggs"], [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"French Toast" URL:@"tt://food/frenchtoast"], @"Drinks", [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Coffee" URL:@"tt://food/coffee"], [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Orange Juice" URL:@"tt://food/oj"], @"Other", [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Just Desserts" URL:@"tt://menu/4"], [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Complaints" URL:@"tt://about/complaints"], @"Other", [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Just Desserts" URL:@"tt://menu/4"], [TTTableTextItem itemWithText:@"Complaints" URL:@"tt://about/complaints"], nil]; I was able to make something similar by implementing the method: - (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section { return myCustomView; } But since my data is coming from the Model Class and I want my generate views and add them to datasource in a formatted way. I would like to know if there is a way using Three20 through which I specify an Array of my data for sections and another array for corresponding data under the sections? Your help is highly appreciated Thanks
