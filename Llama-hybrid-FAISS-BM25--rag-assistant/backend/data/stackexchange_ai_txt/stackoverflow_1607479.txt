WhichdDatabase would prove efficient?

I have to develop a web application in Java, a pretty big one with loads of data to store and manipulate. I am also planning to use Hibernate and Spring. There are many databases available now like MSSQL Server, MySQL Server, Oracle, db2, etc.. Which do you recommend? Features I look for would be Java - database connection should be efficient and easy to implement good user interface for Database Server Management data storage capacity support and obviously the cost factor. All valuable suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :-) Edited: The web application will be hosted on a Linux Server.
