I'm having the same problem. Maybe this will be a partial answer. I bound the MaxWidth of the column I'm expanding to the ActualWidth of its grid. The goal being that the splitter never exceed the size of its grid. The binding works correctly but it's not achieving the goal because once my grid splitter gets to the edge of the grid, the grid starts resizing larger as I drag the splitter. If we can make the grid not resize with the splitter, this should work.
