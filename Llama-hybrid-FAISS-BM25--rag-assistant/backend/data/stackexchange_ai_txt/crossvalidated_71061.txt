Convergence problems created by jittered coordinates

I am creating a mixed model and including a spatial correlation. My data points include lat long values although some are duplicated. I have two questions about dealing with these. To specify the spatial correlation there must not be any distances of 0. Therefor, I jittered my coordinates to ensure that there were no duplicates. The maximum that they are jittered is 0.01 degrees lat/long. As this is data on a global scale, while these small numbers make the computation more difficult? Have any effect at all? Most of my data has 2 or 3 decimals, while the jittered has more (not fully represented in the example) When I jitter the same data multiple times it make the difference if a model will or will not converge. For example, for the same dataset, with the coordinates jittered 2 times, one may converge while one does not? Is there another way to solve this problem? (not jittering/not averaging at the location) My current workaround has been to write the jittered coordinates to file, and use the same ones – but this doesn’t seem to be the best solution. I have created example data to show my problem. If you run the code once, and then rerun the code below the stars again (or maybe three times) there may be a convergence error. I ran this 3 times, and found that all things staying the same (except the jittered coordinates) there was 1 time where the data did not converge. #Simulate data lat = runif(1500, -90, 90) long = runif(1500, -90,90) y = log(runif(1500, 10, 2500)) x1 = log(runif(1500, 0, 5)) x2 = log(runif(1500, 90, 2000)) x3 = log(runif(1500, 1, 1000)) LC = sample(c(1,2,3), 1500, replace = TRUE) # to simulate duplicates i = 0 while(i Please let me know if there is anything I need to clarify. Thanks for your help!
