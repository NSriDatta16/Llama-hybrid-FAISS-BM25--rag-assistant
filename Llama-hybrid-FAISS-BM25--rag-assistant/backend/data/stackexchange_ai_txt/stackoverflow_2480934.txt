I'm not sure I understand your question, but I'm going to assume you've factored out this common summary into it's own widget. If so, the problem is that you don't like the ugly way of embedding HTML into the Java code. GWT 2.0 has UiBinder , which allows you to define the GUI in raw HTMLish template, and you can inject values into the template from the Java world. Read through the dev guide and it gives a pretty good outline.
