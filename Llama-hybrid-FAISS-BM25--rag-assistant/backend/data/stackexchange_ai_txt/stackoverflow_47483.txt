Passing switches to Xcode 3.1 user scripts

I have a user script that would be much more useful if it could dynamically change some of its execution dependent on what the user wanted. Passing simple switches would easily solve this problem but I don't see any way to do it. I also tried embedding a keyword in the script name, but Xcode copies the script to a guid-looking filename before execution, so that won't work either. So does anyone know of a way to call a user script with some sort of argument? (other that the normal %%%var%%% variables) EDIT: User scripts are accessible via the script menu in Xcode's menubar (between the Window and Help menus). My question is not about "run script" build phase scripts. My apologies for leaving that somewhat ambiguous.
