Yep, easily possible, just make sure you're covering the times in your indexes: class Widget To pull it based purely off the dates, a small amount of trickery is required due to sphinx requiring a bounded range (x..y as opposed to x>=y). The use of min/max value is very inelegant, but I'm not aware of a good way around it at the moment. min_time = Time.now.advance(:years => -10) max_time = Time.now.advance(:years => 10) title = "foo" Widget.search title, :with => {:publish_at => min_time..Time.now, :unpublish_at => Time.now..max_time}
