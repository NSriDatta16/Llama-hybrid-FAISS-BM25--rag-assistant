For a fixed input size for both networks, the asymptotic complexities are identical, and, ceteris paribus, you would have to expect only a constant factor of difference in actual computation time. You probably don't want to know the asymptotic complexity for increasing input sizes, right? Anyway, for this case, the 2D CNN would be quadratic in the complexity of the 1D CNN.
