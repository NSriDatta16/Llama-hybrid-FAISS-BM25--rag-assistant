Test that detects non-stationarity of the following time series?

Let the DGP be given as: $$X_t\sim t^2\chi_1$$ with all $X_t$ independent. Based on simulations, an ADF test fails detect non-stationarity (i.e. it does not find a unit root). This makes sense, since ADF is a parametric test that assumes a completely different model than the DGP above. I'm looking for some other test that will reliably detect non-stationarity of the DGP above, based on, for example, a sample of size 100 drawn at $t=1,\dots,100$ .
