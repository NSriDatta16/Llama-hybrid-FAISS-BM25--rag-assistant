The least squares means are, in a sense, weighted averages. You can obtain similar results by using predict.glm with a type="response" option and then summarising over the variable of interest. E.g. predict the umeployment rates for all the data, and then summarise for all Males / Females and calculate the difference. SAS's ilink option is doing the same thing by inverting the link (logit) function and turning the estimates from log odds back into probabilities - converting the estimates to the scale of the response variable (i.e. probability). Be careful reporting differences in probability derived this way. As an extreme example, if there was a sub-population with a Male unemployment rate of zero, would you expect the unemployment rate for Females in that same sub-group to to be zero, or -8.9 percent?
