How to use ontologies for text classification?

I am new to machine learning and want to classify sentences using ontologies (taxonomies/ knowledge graphs) and supervised learning methods (I have an annotated training dataset). My question is how to use the ontology for this task? Is the following method correct? I will first perform the tokenization, stemming and stop word removal (pre-processing). Then, I will search for each term in the ontology and after finding them, I will add their related hierarchy to an array or vector for each document. Then I will train the classifiers (supervised) on those vectors. Please let me know if this method is correct or if there are steps that I am missing here. Thanks! :)
