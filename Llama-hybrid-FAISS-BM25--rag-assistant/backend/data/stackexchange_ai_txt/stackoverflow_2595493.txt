Automatic Hudson CI setup and plugin updates through apt?

We've used Hudson for quite a while to implement a CI server with all the bells and whistles. The setup is quite straight forward, when installing from the provided RPMs and Debs, but through googling I haven't been able to figure out whether the plugins are installable using apt/rpm or some other package manager? The reason is that I would like to create a (meta)package for Ubuntu which would install and also update both Hudson and all the plugins through the normal upgrade mechanism. At the same time I could create a template setup for other projects, say JavaEE project needs git, cobertura and Chuck Norris plugins, while my Python project needs plugins XXX and YYY. Anybody got such a setup? As a workaround I figured setting up a number of Maven POMs, which would do the init, and later upgrades, but I feel this would require more scripting on the side, which I'm not very eager to do. Any other suggestions for this would also be appreciated.
