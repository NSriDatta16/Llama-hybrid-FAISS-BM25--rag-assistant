Unsupported major.minor version 49.0

I am getting the following exception whenever I login to my application ... javax.servlet.ServletException: com/sun/org/apache/xalan/internal/xsltc/trax/TransformerFactoryImpl (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0) What does this mean and how can I resolve the problem?
