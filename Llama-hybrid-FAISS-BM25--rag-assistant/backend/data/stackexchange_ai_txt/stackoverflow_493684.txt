How to avoid short-lifespan enterprise applications?

A while ago another question referred to the (possibly urban tale) statistic that ... the average lifespan of software is about 3 years At the time I came up with the following reasons (and I'm sure there are more possibly better ones): A new major system (ERP, CRM, etc.) is implemented and it has an "integrated" module to replace the old app. Same, but no integrated app - but the existing app is not adaptable (the people left, technology has changed, current IT policies have changed, users don't like the existing app.) The company you acquired the basic app from, to customize it for your needs has disappeared. Or you don't get along well with them any more. The technology for the existing app is "obsolete" (according to the framework vendor/Microsoft/consultant/industry expert/new IT manager who has management's ear.) "We're phasing out (Windows 95/Windows 98/Windows 2000/Windows XP/NT) and we need matching technology in our apps". "We've learned a lot from (App Version n) and we'll do a lot better the second/third/fourth/n+1th time." Job justification for developers/IT manager/Division VP/consulting company. The users hate it. We've merged/acquired a competitor/been acquired by a competitor and theirs is better. Some of these are unavoidable (e.g. your company gets bought), but overall this is surely smething that needs to be avoided. Does your organization intentionally fight this syndrome? What effective strategies would you recommend?
