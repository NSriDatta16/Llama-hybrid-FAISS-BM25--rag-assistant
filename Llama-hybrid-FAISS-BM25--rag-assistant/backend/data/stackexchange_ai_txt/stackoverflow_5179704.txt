c# LINQ question

I have a dataset that is has a number of groups. I have to calculate two things: The average value of some data per group - which I have done with the following code: var results = from res in dt.AsEnumerable() group res by res.Field (key) into grp orderby Convert.ToInt32(grp.Key) select new { date = grp.Key, sum = grp.Average(r => Convert.ToDouble(r.Field (average))) }; I also need to calculate the standard deviation of the values for each group, so for each individual group, I need to create an array or list of the individual results per group. How could I do this with LINQ? Thanks. EDIT: I appreciate my question my be a little vague; I know how to calculate the standard deviation, I would like to know how to extract the list of values for each group(as above) to allow the calculation to be performed. Thanks.
