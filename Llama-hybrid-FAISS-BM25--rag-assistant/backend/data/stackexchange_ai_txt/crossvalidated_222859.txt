Can you use neural networks for non-binary input feature sets?

I want to feed a set of non-binary features/attributes of my problem into the input for a neural network. Currently, I am looking about 21 features I would like to use for my input and one binary output (true/false). I just want to make sure that neural nets can actually utilize non-binary input values before I start delving deeper into solving the problem. If there is a better method of machine learning given the number of features and the need for a true/false output, I am also open to new approaches.
