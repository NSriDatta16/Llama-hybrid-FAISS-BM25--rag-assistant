Test for nonlinearity of regression model with ARIMA errors in R?

I would like to do regression with ARIMA errors in R with TropBirds.ts as response variable and ForFrag.ts as explanatory variable: arima(TropBirds,order=c(p,d,q), xreg=ForFrag) According to both Keenan and Tsay tests, TropBirds.ts is a non-linear time series, and ForFrag is a linear time series. Is it sound to do the proposed regression given the non-linearity of TropBirds.ts ? If not, is there a way to fix this issue, e.g. transform TropBirds.ts into a linear time series? I've tried Box-Cox transformation, it didn't work. If it is OK to go ahead with the proposed regression, is there a package to test for nonlinearity of the regression models with ARIMA errors in R? Keenan.test and Tsay.test from TSA package do not seem to support this option. References Keenan, Daniel MacRae. "A Tukey nonadditivity-type test for time series nonlinearity." Biometrika 72.1 (1985): 39-44. Tsay, Ruey S. "Nonlinearity tests for time series." Biometrika 73.2 (1986): 461-466.
