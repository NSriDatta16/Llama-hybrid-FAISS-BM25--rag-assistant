We had exactly this situation at work, and after evaluating all the options, decided to go with Redmine . Redmine has the concept of multiple projects, each with their own bug and feature tracker, wiki space, version control integration, document storage, news feed, etc. The projects can be hierarchically nested as well, which is a really nice feature. You can also set up project roadmaps and link features to specific releases. You can set up custom roles, and developers can have different project management rights for each project they are a member of. My favourite feature is the source code management integration. It's great to be able to link bugs to individual SVN commits, and clicking through to see the diff is really helpful. The code is implemented using Ruby on Rails, with a DB backend (we use MySQL). It is our production bug tracker, and has been very reliable. The project itself uses Redmine for it's own bug tracking . It is well supported, open source, and there has been steady progress and improvements in the 2 years we have been using it. There's an interactive demo site that you can have a look at, if you want to get a feel for Redmine's capabilities before you download it yourself.
