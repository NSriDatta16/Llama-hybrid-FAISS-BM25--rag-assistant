Mark Location of Trend Time Series

I am new in the topic of time series data and found out about the STL decomposition which can smoothly show the trend in some time series data. My task is to detect trends given certain data. At first, I went the complicated way and labelled data, where trends were and trained classification models on it and tested it with new data. Unfortunately this did not perform well. Now after reading more about time series data, I thought it might be a better solution to treat it as a time series problem rather than a classification problem. Take this STL decomposition as an example: Is there a way to 'detect' the location of the trend? I mean to put points in the plot of the trend around x=30 until x=52 (upgoing trend) or around x=45 until x=80 (down-going trend)? (Not manually & hardcoded obviously, but with an algorithm that detect a trend) My data are measurement points of laptop components that are retrieved after each other (with a timestamp) but not necessary periodically with the same time interval. I hope this isn't a problem for this. My data has this look: 0 0.2362 1 0.3939 2 0.3062 3 -0.2643 ... 232 -0.3146 233 -0.1514 234 -0.1881 235 -0.0965
