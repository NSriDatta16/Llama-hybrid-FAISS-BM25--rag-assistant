Not at all. It's not portable at all. In addition, there's no guarantee that another process won't have used the memory in question- C runs on many devices like embedded where virtual memory addressing doesn't exist. Nor will it reduce fragmentation- you'd have to know the page size of the machine and allocate an exact number of pages- and then, when you freed them, they'd be just unfragmented again. If you really want to guarantee malloced memory, malloc a large block and manually place objects into it. That's the only way. As for efficiency, you must be running on an incredibly starved device in order to save a few ifs.
