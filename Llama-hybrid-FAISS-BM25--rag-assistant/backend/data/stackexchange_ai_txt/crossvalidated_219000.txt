Is weakly stationary equivalent to $I(0)$?

I'm currently reading some time series lecture notes. It says that: Weakly stationary (or wide-sense stationary) processes are said to be $I(0)$ (integrated of order $0$). Let's call the above definition A. On the other hand the Wikipedia page on order of integration says A time series is integrated of order $0$ if it admits a moving average representation with $\sum _{k=0} ^\infty |b_k|^2 Let's call the above definition B. My question is: I am unsure if if definitions A and B for $I(0)$ are equivalent. Can someone please point me to a proof or a counter example? Many thanks!
