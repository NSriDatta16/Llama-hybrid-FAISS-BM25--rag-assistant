How likely a setting change made a significant change from test results?

Data from single machine at different times (before/after setting change). I ran 5 tests, change a setting, and ran five more tests. I got these results: A: 2209 1948 2189 2227 2225 A Average: 2160 A Standard Deviation: 119 B: 2763 3055 3117 3083 2876 B Average: 2979 B Standard Deviation: 152 How do I quantify the feeling that the setting definitely made a difference and estimate the probability of the latter five test results just being randomly high?
