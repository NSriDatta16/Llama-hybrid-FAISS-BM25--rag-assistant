Typically I've found that the pragma comment style manifest decleration's to be much more error free, from a developer maintenence and an over all build action perspective. The XML manifest's are natoriously snafu . The fimiluarity with how the linker operates and the usual compilation of C code and the fact that you simply tak this in, onto one of your source files, keeps everything a bit feeling more "together"; #pragma comment(linker, \ "\"/manifestdependency:type='Win32' "\ "name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' "\ "version='6.0.0.0' "\ "processorArchitecture='*' "\ "publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' "\ "language='*'\"")
