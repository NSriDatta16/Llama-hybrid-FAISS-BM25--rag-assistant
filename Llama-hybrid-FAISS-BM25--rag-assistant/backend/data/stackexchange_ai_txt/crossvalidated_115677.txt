How can I calculate cosine distance with multiple feature vectors and weigh them?

I have a dataset of text documents and I'm calculating pairwise cosine distances among them. For each document I have a bag of words vector, a vector built from entities extracted from the document, and the time the document was created. Each type of vector is of different dimensions. I want the distance calculation to use all of these features, but such that the distance is biased towards the concepts vector. I have been calculating the distances for each type of vector independently then combining them as a weighted average, but I suspect there's a more correct approach.
