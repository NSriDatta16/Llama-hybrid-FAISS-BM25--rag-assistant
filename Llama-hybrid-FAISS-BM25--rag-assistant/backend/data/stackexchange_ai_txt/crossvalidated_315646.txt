Should I transform this time series for forecasting?

My data is monthly CPI( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS ). Here is the original plot: There is an exponential trend here, but variance isn't necessarily increasing with the trend. I tried a log transform, and here's what I got: The first 1/3 of the plot's variance increased, but the exponential trend is gone; however, neither the original plot nor the log transformed plot are normal. I've only learned log and Box-Cox transforms, so they're the only ones that I can use. Should I be transforming my data here? This data is the only variable that I'm using in my forecast.
