How to use keyboard shortcuts to select a portion of waveform instead of mouse drag and drop?

I am making a project where i am drawing waveform of an audio file in C#. Currently I am using mouse drag and drop for a part of waveform selection. But now i want that the waveform should also be selected by using following: click at a point press shift and click again on another point. I dont have much knowledge about keyboard events. So need help in this.
