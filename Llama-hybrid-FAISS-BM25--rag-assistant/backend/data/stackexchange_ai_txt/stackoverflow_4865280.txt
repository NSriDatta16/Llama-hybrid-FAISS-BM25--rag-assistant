If I understand your question correctly, this can be done using the find function. http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/find.html To create your matrix, just write: M(:,1) = B(find(enumCells==1)); M(:,2) = B(find(enumCells==2)); M(:,3) = B(find(enumCells==3)); M(:,4) = B(find(enumCells==4)); There's probably a more elegant way to do it, but this should work. EDIT: You could try using "sort" to do it. The sort function can give the permutations of the sorting as output. Try: [s perm] = sort(enumCells); M = reshape(B(perm),50,4);
