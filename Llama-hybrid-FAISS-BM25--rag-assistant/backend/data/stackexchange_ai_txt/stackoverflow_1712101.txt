PHP MVC Best Practices/"Rules" for Success

I'm sure that someone already posted this question; however, I would like to get all kind of recommendations for MVC on PHP. I know there are many experts out there willing to share their knowledge with people who has doubts about their coding best practices. How should you organize your Controller? How should you organize your Model? Should Controller call one Model Method and the Model call submethods or should controller call all Model Submethods? etc. Hope this helps someone out there (because it'll help me for sure).
