Please, take a look at this site . It gives you informations about how to study the ontology of a game, depending on its features and genre. It is divided into sections: for each section you have a list of actions available. Each action has its own page (it's like a wiki). Anyway, I think you'll need to think about what do you want to do: that site won't give you everything you need. My suggestion is to write on paper and do some brainstorming first without using an application, checking the site for reference or to see how they organize things in sections.
