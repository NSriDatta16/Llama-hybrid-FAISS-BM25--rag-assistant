Very basic HTML/scripting/active page question

A friend has asked me for help with her website design. Although I know a fair amount about the basics behind HTML, XML, Php, ASP.Net, javascript, etc., I'm not really comfortable sitting down and coding from scratch. All of the work I do is in Java, C++, and so on. My friend would like to add a vertically scrolling marquee to her site - no problem, there is code for that all over the internet. Here is the tricky part - she would like the text to be dynamically pulled from another website. This isn't like a simple text file, either - it's a list of names from a specific blog post, so there would be a lot of text processing involved to wade through all of the other markup, and extract the relevant info. The way I see it, here are her options - 1) Write some kind of a perl script or somesuch that is set to run daily. This script will visit the blog and extract the necessary info. It will then update the HTML file's marquee text with its new info. 2) Some sort of active page written in ASP or PHP that will dynamically build the marquee (and the rest of the site) each time the site is visited, basically doing the work of the perl script each time. This seems like it has the potential to be somewhat slow. Per my understanding, those are her only options. Am I correct? There is no simply way to do this in javascript that I am just missing? I know you can reference an image to be dynamically pulled with the marquee, but this isn't that simple... Thanks. EDIT: I guess where I was going with my question was this: Unless I implement this statically, this is going to be fairly involved, right? I believe it is over my head. This is why I would like to simply copy/paste the text list into the html document. It would need to be updated every time the blog does, but that only appears to happen every few months, so that's not a large chore. I realize this is a lazy solution, but this is from someone very inexperienced in web development. For reference, this is the SPECIFIC blog post which the text will come from, and my friend would ONLY like to display that list of names that begins when you scroll several paragraphs down. http://truthnottasers.blogspot.com/2008/04/what-follows-are-names-where-known.html
