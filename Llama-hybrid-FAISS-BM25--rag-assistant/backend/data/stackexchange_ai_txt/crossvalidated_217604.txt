XGBoost shows the performance in every iteration (in your example, 100 iterations will have 100 lines in the training.), i.e., it shows the performance during the training process but not showing you the final results. You can turn off the verbose mode to have a more clear view. xgboost(param=param,data=x,label=y, nrounds=n_iter, verbose = F) In addition, keep in mind Anything can happen in testing set Training loss will decrease with more iterations
