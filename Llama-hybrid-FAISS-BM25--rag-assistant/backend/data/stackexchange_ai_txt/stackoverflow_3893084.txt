What's the most useful and complete Java cheat sheet?

I need a cheat sheet for Java and started looking around, but could not find one that seemed "canonical" - which surprised me considering how widespread the language is. Could experienced Java coders please suggest a cheat sheet that is useful (organized so well you actually use it often) and complete (covers real-world daily usage) please? By contrast, here's what I'd consider a canonical cheat sheet for Python: http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR26/PQR2.6.html It is complete (syntax, types, statements, built-ins, common modules, idioms) and useful (well-organized: sectioned and hyperlinked; easy to search, and easy to explore). Also, I have looked at the listing here already: http://devcheatsheet.com/tag/java/ and did not find a cheat sheet comparable to RGruet's Python cheat sheet above. The top listing in Google for "Java cheat sheet" is http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/11cheatsheet/ which is fairly complete, but not organized to be useful. There's gotta' be something better out there!? BTW, it need not fit on 1 page. I'm aware of the Java API docs, but that's more what I'd expect a cheat sheet to link to, not be . Update Some SO members thought this question was subjective, but I think I explained my criteria to be fairly objective: completeness (content) and usefulness (presentation) are not hard to judge in this context. I've accepted one of the more useful answers, but remain surprised that Java doesn't have a canonical cheat-sheet.
