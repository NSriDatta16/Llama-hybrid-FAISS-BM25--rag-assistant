In what data science applications has the stack exchange dump been used?

Anonymized dumps of the stack exchange data are available here . Do you know projects or article that have been using these data (for social network analysis or information retrieval) ? My little research on the subject on Google Scholar & co seems to indicate that this dataset has been very seldom used.
