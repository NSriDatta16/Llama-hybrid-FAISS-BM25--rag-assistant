Repeated measures vs. cluster in logistic regression

I have data from an experiment in which participants played a repeated game 50 times. That is, I have 50 data points per participant. I want to run a logistic regression and I have of course to take into account that I have data points that are correlated, but I don't know if I should use repeated measures or if I should work with clustered sample . I have found some very clear articles on why clusters are better than other techniques (Williams, 2000; Petersen, 2009), but I have found nothing on repeated measures or on the comparison between the two. I would appreciate it if you could help me on this one! Thanks!
