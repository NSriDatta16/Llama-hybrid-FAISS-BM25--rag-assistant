A danger in analyzing this as 1000 separate models, one for each gene, is that you lose the ability to pool information from different comparisons. As an example of a combined approach, consider the MulCom package in R. This package performs the types of comparisons you want, in the context of examining differential expression of many genes among multiple groups with respect to a reference, as an integrated analysis. This has the advantage of pooling information on error terms for statistical tests, rather than using the highly variable error estimates obtained in individual comparisons. A combined approach also may simplify the correction for multiple testing. In the type of study you are doing, it is often more useful to control the false discovery rate (FDR, the fraction of "significant" results that aren't true) rather than correct individual p -values for multiple testing. A combined analysis like that done by MulCom allows for permutation tests to estimate the FDR directly from the data, and allows for optimization of test parameters. FDR control is well accepted in bioinformatics. For FDR analysis the answer to your original question, about how many comparisons need to be taken into account when correcting p -values, becomes perhaps a bit simpler. You count the number of positive results of all comparisons (against reference) at your choice of parameter values, then determine the median number of positive results in the same analysis applied to multiple randomly permuted sample groups. The ratio of median positives in the permuted groups to the positives in the original data is the estimate of the FDR. See the paper for further details, or examine the R code. With your count data rather than standard expression data, you may need to consider whether MulCom or a similar expression-focused analysis method is appropriate. Since you are willing to average counts across "parts" of genes to get a single value for each gene, however, your data then look like expression data appropriate for this type of analysis. If you decide that you need to do a different type of analysis because you have count data, you will be better off following an approach like that used by MulCom rather than the gene-by-gene correction of p -values that your question anticipated.
