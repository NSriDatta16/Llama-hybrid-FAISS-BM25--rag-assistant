Order of hyperparamater tunning

I'm trying to do hyperparameter tunning for random forest regression model. My question is- is there any order I should do it? like starting with specific parameter and then move on on the other? should I check the model each time with one paramter only or for each parameter i'm checking I should add the ones I have found already? Exmaple: if I run model with only n_job -1 and min_sample_leaf, and I got the best value for min_sample_leaf and now I want to check the max depth, and after that more parameters, should I put already the best value I found for min)sample_leaf? or I should check it without any other parameter and in the end create model with the best values from each one?
