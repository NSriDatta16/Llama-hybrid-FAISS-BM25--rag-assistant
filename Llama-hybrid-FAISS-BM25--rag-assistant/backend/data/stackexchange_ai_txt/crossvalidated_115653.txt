I will rename "original value" to "purchase cost" (PC) since I think that is the value you are referring to. I will call Resale Value (RV) - PC the Turn Value (TV). The time from start of valuation to floor I will call Turn Time (TT), this is the sum of valuation time (VT), queue time (QT), and repair time (RT). The costs of repair (RC) are the third metric you should calculate. I assume this prediction model has the sole purpose of allowing you to determine whether a purchase will be lucrative, e.g. $TV>0$. As a caveat, there is a strong risk management aspect to this: you can wait for low-balling sales that require minimal work for maximum TV. You can specify $TV > c$, $c>0$ for a decision rule, but this will cost you when many nearly new (e.g. high RV, low TT low RC) have many units with TV - RC - PV To assess the real impact of TT, you should calculate your fixed costs: parts, tools, hours, facility costs, and define a unit of FC/T (fixed value per time), then TT can be transformed to a cost (turn cost or TC) by calculating TC = FC/T*TT. This is like a tax that you pay to have unsalable goods sitting on the floor, waiting for parts or services, and depreciating. So using valuation you can develop a prediction model for TC and TT as these are the sole determining factors of PC and TV. Predicting TT with a gamma GLM is reasonable. Parsing out RC makes the outcome of TT more justifiable than RT alone, since waiting to receive parts or for available labor (QT) costs you. I would hazard against using the metric of resale to purchase value. It makes the assumption of scalability. You may come up with predictions from such equations that justify buying too much stock at once, and overexpend fixed costs and capacities such as available labor, storage, etc. (this creates a third time, queue time, in which parts sit on the floor, depreciating, waiting for available mechanics and supplies). As business people say, "cash is king" and using TV as an outcome gives units of dollars.
