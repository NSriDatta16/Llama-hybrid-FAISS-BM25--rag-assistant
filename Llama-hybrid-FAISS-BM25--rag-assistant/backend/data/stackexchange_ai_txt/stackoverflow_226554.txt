C#: Partial Classes & Web Services: Separating form and functionality

I am dabbling in the world of web services and I've been making a simple web service which mimics mathematical operations. Firstly it was simple, passing in two integers and then a binary operator would be applied to these (plus, minus etc) depending on the method called. Then I decided to make things a little more complex and started passing objects around, but then I discovered that a web service only exposes the data side of the class and not the functional side. I was told that a good way to deal with this is to make the class on the service side a partial class (this side of the class encapsulating form) and on the client side have another partial class (where this side of the class encapsulates functionality). This seems like an elegant way of doing things.. So, I have set up two classes as described above, but it doesn't seem to be working as I was told. Is what I am attempting possible? If so, where am I going wrong?
