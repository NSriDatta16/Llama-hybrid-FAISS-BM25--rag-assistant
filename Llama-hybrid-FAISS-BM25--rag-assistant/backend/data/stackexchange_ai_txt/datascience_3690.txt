Exporting R model to OpenCV's Machine Learning Library

I'm wonder if it's possible to export a model trained in R, to OpenCV's Machine Learning (ML) library format? The latter appears to save/read models in XML/YAML , whereas the former might be exportable via PMML . Specifically, I'm working with Random Forests, which are classifiers available both in R and OpenCV's ML library. Any advice on how I can get the two to share models would be greatly appreciated.
