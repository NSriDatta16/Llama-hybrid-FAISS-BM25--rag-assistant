How to handle a column with both float and categorical values

This sounds like a question that should have come up before but I couldn't find it on CV. I am trying to use a column called limit_price as in the limit price of an order for a machine learning project (you can assume I am trying to predict the average trading price of an order). This column is an upper limit for a buy order, or a lower limit for a sell order. Let's say we have an AAPL buy order with a limit price of \$142, that means we are not willing to buy this stock for higher than \$142. This column either has a limit price or it has the value "Market", which means the limit price is missing since the upper / lower limit for this order was not specified. I am wondering what model and preprocessing technique I should use to properly model this column. I am also more broadly curious about how to model dependencies in my training set that spans multiple columns.
