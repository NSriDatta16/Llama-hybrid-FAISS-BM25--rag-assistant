How can I estimate the number of correct guess right based on varying probabilities for each independent event?

Assuming that we have a model that outputs these (binomial) probabilities for 10 independend events: 0.89, 0.69, 0.41, 0.92, 0.43, 0.52, 0.90, 0.98, 0.56, 0.85 I would like to know if there is a way to find the expected number of events happening, as in: "if the model is calibrated correctly, it should result in 'X' hits and '10-X' misses". I do know that I can find the range of hits by running a simulation and constructing a histogram, however I was wondering whether there is a more elegant way. Thank you.
