linear regression comparing two models

I am doing linear regression and predicting y using constant,x1,x2,x,3,x4,....x10 (11 x variables) and I am getting R^2 of 88.7% and R^2 adjusted of 85.1% I noticed that all x variables including the intercept have very high P values, indicating that they are not significant. Therefore I decide to build a model like below predict y using sum(x5...x10) (summing 6 variables to get only 1 variable) and now I am getting R^2 of 97.5% and R^2 adjusted of 97.5% . I am not fitting an intercept in this case because value of R^2 and R^2 adjusted is going down if I use the intercept and also P value of intercept is high indicating that it is not significant In such case if I average absolute residuals for each model then the second model should have lower average right?
