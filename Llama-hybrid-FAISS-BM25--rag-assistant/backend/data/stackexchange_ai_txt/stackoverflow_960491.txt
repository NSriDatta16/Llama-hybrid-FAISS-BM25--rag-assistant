A bit of investigation suggests that by "storage", the system is referring to memory for the process rather than disk space. Given that the XmlSerializer will be creating the assembly in memory from C# code, it looks like that might be a place to start. Some things to investigate could include: Is the XML object graph large? (I'll admit that is more likely to be an issue if it was serialization where the problem lay rather than deserialization...) Is there anything unusual about the memory configuration of this workstation? Are there lots of other processes running, no virtual memory left, or some other unusual pressure? In any case, +1 for the suggestion to pre-compile the XML, if this is pre-set configuration-style data that has to be the way to go.
