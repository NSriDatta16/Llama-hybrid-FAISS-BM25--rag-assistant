Solved. I used a custom UIButton class. Then, in (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event I test if the touch occurred in that custom UIButton. And if it did, I act accordingly.
