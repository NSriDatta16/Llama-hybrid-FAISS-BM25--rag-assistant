JQuery UI "drop" event does not fire?

I have a drag and drop interface with JQueryUI, and when a user drags an element into one of its containers and drops it, I want to display some information about the selected item. $(document).ready(function() { $( ".element" ).draggable({snap: ".elementContainer"}); $( ".elementContainer" ).droppable({ drop:function(){ $("table").append(' '); }}); }); So it's creating a new element with the UI droppable class. My question is, why won't it fire a "drop" event on the newly created element?
