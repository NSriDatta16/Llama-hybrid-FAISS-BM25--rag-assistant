Making sure that the design matrix is positive (semi-) definite

In Bayesian linear regression, how do I make sure that the design matrix produced by a neural network $ \Phi$ is positive definite? Computing the covariance matrix on the weight requires inverting --- i.e., $(\Phi^\text{T}\Phi)^{-1}$ . For reference, the posterior on the weights follows: $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(m_N,S_N)$ and prior $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\alpha^{-1}I)$ $S_N^{-1} = \beta \cdot (\Phi^T\Phi)^{-1} + \alpha \cdot I$ where $\beta$ is the noise precision on output. $m_N = \beta \cdot S_N \cdot \Phi^\text{T} \cdot t$ where $t$ is the target on seen data.
