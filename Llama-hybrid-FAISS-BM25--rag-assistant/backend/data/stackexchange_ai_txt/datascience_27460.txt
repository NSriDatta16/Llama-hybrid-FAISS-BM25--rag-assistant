Find which type of log using machine learning?

I am the beginner of Machine learning. The process is: I have different log files (System log, MSSQL Server log, Linux log, MySQL Log, FTP log, IIS log).If any input is given, I will find out which type of log using machine learning technique. Each log has a different format. Some logs don't have structure format(Linux, MySQL log, FTP log). In my analysis, these are all implemented using KNN algorithm(machine learning). But I don't know how to implement this? please give any suggestion about this. The log type format: Linux-syslog: Jan 5 08:39:01 iei-Virtual-Machine CRON[48622]: (root) CMD ( [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -x /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ] && /usr/lib/php5/sessionclean /var/lib/php5 $(/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime)) MySQL-error log: 2018-01-05 10:55:20 18856 [Warning] Unsafe statement is written to the binary log using statement format since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT. Statements writing to a table with an auto-increment column after selecting from another table are unsafe because the order in which rows are retrieved determines what (if any) rows will be written. This order cannot be predicted and may differ between master and the slave.
