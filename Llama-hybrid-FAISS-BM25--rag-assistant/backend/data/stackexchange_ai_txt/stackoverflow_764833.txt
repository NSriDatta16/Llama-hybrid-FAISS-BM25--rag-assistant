Programming a Steganography application in C/C++

I have been reading up on on steno for a while. I have seen tools that help aid in embedding messages in .mp3's and png's etc. I am familiar that they do this by replacing the least important bit. In images, these LIB are colors that the human eye can't see; thus not needed. In audio files frequencies not audible to the human ear; also not needed. So my question is, how would one program something like this in a C or C++ language, preferably in a Windows environment.
