Flash CS4 tag in with htmlText

Wow, this one is really weird. I have the following setup: Two textfields on the stage with Arial normal and Arial bold, both embedded. I then have another textfield which I am setting like so: tb.htmlText = "Test Test "; For some reason, the bold text is not displaying as bold, but as regular weight. I have tried embedding the fonts in the library, using the [Embed] meta tag and even resorted to using CSS to force the fontFamily. Weirdly, I can use Font.enumurateFonts and see both fonts are embedded, but the textfield refused to use the bold version inside the tags. I've been told this is a problem with Flash CS4 on a mac and that it will work on PC. I refuse to believe this is the case, however. Surely Adobe would have fixed this by now? Any help would be appreciated.
