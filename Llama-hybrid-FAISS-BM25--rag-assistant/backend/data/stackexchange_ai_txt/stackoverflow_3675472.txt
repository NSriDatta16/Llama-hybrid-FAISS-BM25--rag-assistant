Not totally sure what you're having trouble with here, but I'll take a shot in the dark and assume this is a program organization/design question. There may be better ways that I'm unfamiliar with, but this is what I'd try to do: create a "parent" object (doesn't have to have any particular type) that keeps references to the multiple frames. When one of the frames receives the exit event from a menu or what have you, it calls self.parent.broadcast_quit(), which sends a quit event to each of the frames it holds references to. This way of doing it kind of expresses a view-controller separation, where the frames are part of the view and the parent object is a tell-me-when-to-shut-down controller -- the parent can nicely encapsulate the connection teardown as well, since it can stay informed on which frames have shut down and when. You can keep details on how to tear down the view in the frames themselves, and then can send an "I'm finished" message back to the controller during their teardown, triggering some final teardown on the parent side. See the docs for wx.PostEvent and Custom Event Classes . (Events are a nice normalized way of expressing cross-window messages in a non-blocking GUI .)
