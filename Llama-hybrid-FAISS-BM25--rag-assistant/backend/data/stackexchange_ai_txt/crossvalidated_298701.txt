Pure nodes in Random forest

I understand that we select a subset of predictors and data points to build each tree in the random forest. The tree is fully grown till the terminal nodes are pure. Can there be a chance that for a given set of predictors and data points, terminal nodes cannot be made pure, within a prespecified tree depth. Does random forest algorithm simply ignore such trees?
