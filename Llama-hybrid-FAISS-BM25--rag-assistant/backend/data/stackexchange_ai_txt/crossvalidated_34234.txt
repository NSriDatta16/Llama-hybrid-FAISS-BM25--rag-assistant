You might want to check out this paper: Bertrand, Marianne, Ester Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan. 2004. "How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates?" Quarterly Journal of Economics. 119(1): 249--275. [ prepub version ] The paper recommends using a block bootstrap, probably not canned in EViews, or clustered standard errors, which I imagine would be. Lastly, you could calculate a simple before-and-after difference, which also works well according to the authors.
