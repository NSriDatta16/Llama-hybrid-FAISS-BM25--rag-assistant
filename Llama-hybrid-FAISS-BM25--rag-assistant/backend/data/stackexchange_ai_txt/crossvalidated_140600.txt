Logistic glm: marginal predicted probabilities and log-odds coefficients support different hypotheses

I'm running a fixed effects logistic regression in R. The model consists of a binary outcome and two binary predictors, with no interaction term. On the log-odds scale, and as an odds-ratio, the coefficient for one of the predictors ( carbf in the mocked-up example below) indicates that the expected probability of Y=1 ("success") is different between the two levels of the factor (i.e., the effect is significant). When I use the effects package to get marginal predicted probabilities, the 95% CIs for the two levels of carbf overlap considerably, indicating there is no evidence of a difference in the expected probability of Y=1 between the two factor levels. When I use the mfx package to get average marginal effects for the coefficients (i.e., for the expected difference in the probability of Y=1 between the two factor levels), I do get a significant difference. I'm confused as to whether this discrepancy is because: 1) the output from the model and the mfx package is an expected difference in the probability of Y=1 between factor levels, rather than predicted probabilities for each level. 2) of the way the effects package is calculating the marginal effect. In an effort to determine this, I modified the source code from the mfx package to give me average marginal effects for each level of the carbf factor. The 95% CIs for these predictions do not overlap, indicating a significant difference. This makes me wonder why I get such different results using the effects package. Or is it that I'm just confused about the difference between marginal effects for coefficients and for predicted probabilities? ##################################### # packages library(effects) library(mfx) library(ggplot2) # data data(mtcars) carsdat |z| # amf1 0.217 0.197 1.10 0.2697 # carbf1 -0.450 0.155 -2.91 0.0037 # mfx package marginal effects (averaged) mfx2 |z| # amf1 0.177 0.158 1.12 0.2623 # carbf1 -0.436 0.150 -2.90 0.0037 ##################################### # mfx source code fit
