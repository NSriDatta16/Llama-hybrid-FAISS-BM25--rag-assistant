I found this SO - How do I access template cache? And adapted it to from django.utils.hashcompat import md5_constructor from django.utils.http import urlquote from django.core.cache import cache def hasFragmentCache(key, variables = []): hash = md5_constructor(u':'.join([urlquote(var) for var in variables])) return cache.has_key(cache_key) Edit - I've accepted skirmantas answer as whilst this does exactly as asked its the better approach as then the template and view are more loosly coupled. Using this method you need to know the name of each cache fragment and whats used where. A designer moves things around and it would fall over.
