To answer your first question: You can use categories to keep everything organised in a single assembly if that's how you want to go. As to whether it would cut down on build time, I would hazard a guess at perhaps, I don't think it'd be a huge amount overall though. To answer your second: You can use categories and the [Explicit] and [Ignore] attribute to tell NUnit which tests to run, and which tests you have to tell it to run before it will. You might also want to look at [Platform] or some of the other attributes, depending on what exactly your requirements on 'environment' are. For instance, you could add an Explicit tag to all your long running tests. Then you would have to run these tests explicitly, NUnit won't run them automatically. Or add all these tests to a category, then when you run NUnit, tell it to explicitly not run that category.
