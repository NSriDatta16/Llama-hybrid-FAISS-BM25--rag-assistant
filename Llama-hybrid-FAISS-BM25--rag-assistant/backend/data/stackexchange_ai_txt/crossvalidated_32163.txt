The procedure is to look at the sample autocorrelation function (ACF). If it is a stationary AR(p) process it the ACF will decline toward 0 exponentially. If it is positive and slowly declining it is probably non stationary and trend removal will be needed prior to fitting a staionary time series model. If the ACF has the characteristics of an AR(p) process the ACF and the partial autocorrelation function can be used to help you find the order of the model. See the book by Box, Jenkins and Reinsel for all the details about this. There are many software packages that you can use to fit the model. SAS/ETS is one. SPSS, Minitab and other large packages also have this capability. IrishStat (Dave Reilly) who participates on this website has autobox a software package that will do the whole three stages of modeling (indentification, fitting and diagnostic checking) automatically for you. In R the arima function that Macro referred to can be used.
