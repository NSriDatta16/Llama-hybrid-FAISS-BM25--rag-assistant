If you want to apply PCA to new data, you must have fit a model first on some training dataset. What is the model you will ask? This is the mean vector you subtracted from the dataset, the variances you used to "whiten" each data vector and the learned mapping matrix. So in order to map new dataset in the same space as the training data, you first subtract the mean, whiten it and map it with the mapping matrix.
