Yes. I was searching for the same thing a while back and I came across the concept of PINNs . Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that encode model equations, such as partial differential equations (PDEs), as a component of the neural network itself. This article describes PINNs for a harmonic oscillator! Code for the harmonic oscillator problem. This link describes the concept in detail with the help of a simple projectile motion example. Cheers!
