One approach is to discretize a continuous family. Although one's instinct might be to pick off the values of the probability density function at even intervals, that is complicated by the need to convert those densities into probabilities, which requires adding them up for a normalization factor. A better way is to carve the support of the distribution into equal intervals (to correspond to your data points) and compute the total probability in each interval. Abstractly, this recipe says that when $\{F_\theta\mid \theta\in\Theta\}$ is a family of distributions (represented by their cumulative distribution functions) parameterized by $\theta\in\Theta$ supported on an interval $[l,u],$ you can discretize it into a family of distributions supported on any sequence of $d\ge 1$ values via $$p_\theta(x) = F_\theta\left(l + (u-l)\frac{x}{d}\right) - F_\theta\left(l + (u-l)\frac{x-1}{d}\right)$$ for $x=1,2,\ldots, d.$ Provided $d$ exceeds the dimension of $\Theta,$ usually all these discrete distributions are distinct. Their shapes clearly echo the shapes of their parent density functions. I will illustrate with the Beta family, where $[a,b]=[0,1]$ and $\theta=(a,b)$ contains positive parameters. This figure shows the distributions for $16$ values of $\theta.$ These are bar charts of probability mass functions, not histograms of probability densities! The heights of the bars indicate the probabilities associated with the $x$ values beneath them. Thus, the sum of the $d=20$ heights in each chart is exactly $1,$ as required of any probability mass function. (To help you see that, a horizontal dotted line appears at a height of $1/d$ in each chart: this must be the average of the heights of the bars.) The R code that created the figure shows how easy it is to implement this approach. After creating a data frame for the values of $x$ and some choices of parameters $(a,b),$ a single line computes the discrete probabilities. No other calculations are needed. d The plotting is done with a ggplot2 command, as in library(ggplot2) ggplot(X, aes(x, Probability)) + geom_col() + facet_grid(a ~ b) (I have omitted the decorative commands such as the colors and title.) The question refers to sampling from this discrete distribution. This is as easy (or difficult) as sampling from its parent. If you have a procedure that generates random values $Y$ according to $F_\theta$ (for any specified $\theta$ ), then the random variable $$X = \lceil \frac{d(Y-l)}{u-l} \rceil$$ almost surely has values in the set $\{1,2,\ldots, d\}$ and has $p_\theta$ for its distribution.
