I ran into the same issue in a similar study/publication of mine. Rather than "aggregate to one", I would suggest maybe producing a graphic/plotting summary to illustrate the comparison of the two methods of feature-engineering. For precision and recall, since people are used to seeing precision-recall curves, you can combine the two to produce a precision-recall "confidence region" plot (note, "confidence" is used in a very casual and not statistical way) as below: and for individual accuracy measures, I'd say boxplots are better than averages because you can show how "stable" the runs are by showing whether the boxplots are tight or wide (like I did here) Here's the citation and biorxiv link to the publication (I believe BMC Medical Genomics might be behind a paywall).
