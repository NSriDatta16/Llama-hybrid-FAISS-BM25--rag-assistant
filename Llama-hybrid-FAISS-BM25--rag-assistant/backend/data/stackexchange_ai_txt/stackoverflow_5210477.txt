Steps to test iphone app on device (profile/certificate already created)

I want to test my app on my itouch which has ios 4.2.1 . I have completed the steps for provisioning profile/certificate. So under Organizer, when I select my device, I am seeing the provisioning profile and under Developer profile, I see 2 entries; iPhone Developer and iPhone Distributor Now I want to just test the app on my device (NOT looking for steps to submit the app for distribution at this stage) I think there are some Project settings that I need to do under XCode. But I am unable to figure it out. Please provide me the steps to test on device. My XCode ver is 3.2.5
