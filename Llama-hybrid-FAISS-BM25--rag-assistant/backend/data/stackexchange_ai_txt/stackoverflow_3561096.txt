Mule: What's the difference between a multicasting-router and a static-recipient-list-router?

I can't really see a difference between a multicasting-router and a static-recipient-list-router. Why would I use one over the other? According to Mule-2.x user guide Recipient List the Recipient list router can be used to send the same event to multiple endpoints over the same endpoint or to implement routing-slip behaviour where the next destination for the event is determined from the event properties or payload. Mule provides an abstract Recipient list implementation org.mule.routing.outbound.AbstractRecipientList that provides a thread-safe base for specialised implementations. Mule also provides a Static recipient list that takes a configured list of endpoints from the current event or statically declared on the endpoint. Multicasting Router The Multicasting router can be used to send the same event over multiple endpoints. When using this router care must be taken to configure the correct transformers on the endpoints to handle the event source type. Remember that care should be taken to ensure that the message being routed is transformed to a format that the endpoint understands.
