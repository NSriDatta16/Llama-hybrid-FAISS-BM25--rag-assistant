Have a look at picturebox allowdrop property missing? There might be something stated about this on MSDN perhaps? the picturebox class seems to override that property and hide it from the user. See for yourself in Reflector if you want it sets browsable to false, and editbrowsabel to never And Drag and Drop Text For most controls, you can set the AllowDrop property in the Properties window during design time. However, some controls (such as the PictureBox control) do not expose this property in the Properties window. As such, you need to dynamically set them in code (note that IntelliSense will not show the AllowDrop property).
