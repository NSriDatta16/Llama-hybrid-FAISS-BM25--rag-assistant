Add local storage to Flash webapp

I would like to add local storage to an existing Flash webapp that up until now uses a web server to store data (database and media files). What are my options? I'd like to reuse the code of the Flash webapp and run it inside a browser if possible (which, if I'm not mistaken, is not possible with Adobe AIR).
