ASP.NET Menu Parent Menu Item Highlighting on Hover when Flyouts are enabled

I have a ASP.Net Menu Control with three levels and flyouts enabled. I want to highlight the parent items (right upto the top level parent) whenever a user hovers over the menu items. I do not want to use a client side solution as described here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webforms/AspMenuParentHighlighting.aspx Is there an elegant server side solution? Kind regards.
