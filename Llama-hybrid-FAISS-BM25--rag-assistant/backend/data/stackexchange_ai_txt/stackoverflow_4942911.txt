The main idea is mongoDB was created for denormalization and embedding. At one of my past projects i've done sql denormalization to get better performance, but i don't like sql denormalization because very many dublicated data( if you have one to many relation for example). Second step was rewriting data access layer to mongoDB. And in mongoDB for some difficult pages where i need to load multiple documents i've created denormalized document(with embeded collections and plain data from different documents) to fit page content. No all my problem pages work fast, like facebook ;). But here possible problems, becase you should support denormalized document every time. Also all my denormalized data updates work async, and some data can be stale in some moment, but it's normal practice. Even stackoverlow use denormalization because sometime when open question i see an answer, but when i return back to questions list and refresh page sometimes question doesn't have answer. If i need denormalization i choose mongodb.
