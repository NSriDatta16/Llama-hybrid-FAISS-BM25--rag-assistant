You may be interested in the following papers : Computing with infinite networks , by Christopher K. I. Williams and Bayesian learning for neural networks by Radford M. Neal presenting an interesting relationships between neural networks and gaussian processes. It is not related to "deep learning" (understood as neural network with multiple layers) but it has a strong mathematical content, related to single layer neural networks with an infinite number of weights.
