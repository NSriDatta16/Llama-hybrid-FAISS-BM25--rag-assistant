How can I determine which taskbar application/windows are requesting user attention

I'd like to know how to get a list of the windows requiring user attention from the Windows taskbar. Windows requiring attention appear with a flashing orange color within the Windows taskbar. Un-focused MSN Messenger conversation windows are a good example of this behavior: they turn orange as soon as a remote user sends an instance message. My code targets the Windows 7 platform, but working on older Windows OS would be nice too.
