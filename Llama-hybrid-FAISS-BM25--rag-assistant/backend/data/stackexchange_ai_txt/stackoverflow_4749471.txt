Days and days of researching led me to the following conclusion: It's a bug on both sides (adobe/.Net). At first the string contained in the OleDataObject dragged off of Adobe Reader is not null terminated which is a very unsafe way of exchanging data. No wonder this feature is turned off in the standard configuration of adobe reader X (But you can unlock it). On the .Net side every string must be terminated to work properly. Well you get a pointer and a new string instance is created which runs through the memory until it finds the '\0' character and that adds the wrong characters (or characters of previously dragged text). The solution to this mess is to query the size of the text part contained in the OleDataObject. This size (obviously smaller or equal than the result string size) could be used to do a substring operation on the original string. With all this in palce the string has no more wrong characters attached to it. -solved
