I had the exact same problem, then I stepped on this link http://androidcodemonkey.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-to-base64-encode-decode-android.html I downloaded the Base64 class from Robert W. Harder's site and it worked, the only thing I did was to add my package definition in the class itself just so that I could use it. Note: I'm working with Android 1.6 so I can assume it works upwards. Hope this helps :)
