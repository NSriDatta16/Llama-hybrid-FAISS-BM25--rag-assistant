First, you're right that GMM is a model. EM is not a model. EM helps to find values of variables within a model. That you have to define $k$ before using EM is not itself to do with supervised/unsupervisedness. AFAIK it is to do with the fact that the standard EM algorithm supposes you know the structure of the model / what parameters are involved. The finite-GMM is a model for the structure of a dataset. EM helps to fit the finite-GMM to a particular dataset. Once you have the structure you can use that as a springboard for doing a classification/regression task. By way of contrast, you can have non-parametric clustering algorithms for regression. I.e. where you do not specify $k$, and both the number of clusters and cluster assignments are learnt from the data. Other algorithms are used for inference in such models e.g. MCMC. Supervised/unsupervised is about whether you're trying to minimize some kind of loss function by the settings in a model, or whether you're just learn about the structure of the data itself.
