Windows Azure WebRole stuck in a deployment loop

I've been struggling with this one for a couple of days now. My current Windows Azure WebRole is stuck in a loop where the status keeps changing between Initializing, Busy, Stopping and Stopped. It never goes live, and I can can never see the website as a result. The WebRole is an "out of the box" MVC 2 application with Copy Local set to true on the Mvc dll and I haven't even tried hooking up a storage or WorkerRole yet, and there is nothing really happening inside the Start method that I can see would crash. I've really tried going back to basics to ensure nothing can complicate the process and the website launches without a problem on the Dev Fabric and yes it looks just like the standard "Home", "About" MVC app - just can't get it running in the cloud! Funny thing is, a few days ago, this exact package worked on the staging area in the cloud, and I could even see it in the browser - but could never get it swapped over to production, so I deleted everything and started from scratch, and now I can't even get it running on staging... Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do to diagnose this problem myself because since logging this problem on the forums 2 days ago, there has been no improvement or feedback. Any help appreciated, Regards, Rob G
