You can use one of the services available on Internet which allow hiding referrers (by setting their address), but you cannot impose a specific referrer that ain't the actual referrer. The user must actually be redirected to that website (which will appear as a referrer) before he is redirected to the target website. One of such services: http://linkanon.com edit: Since you changed your question now, my comment about writing a user agent in PHP which acts like a proxy, applies, but then this gets close to a criminal activity, because you will be displaying a third party website to a user who might think that she is in the actual website, while in fact she will have loaded your content (the content you have passed on). To perform this close-to-criminal activity (you are one step away from trying to read a username and password), you load the third party's website content with PHP by using your own written user agent which specifies the fake referrer and simply passes the output to visitor of your website. The function in PHP which lets one send HTTP headers, is header($header): header("Referer: http://example.org"); Instead of shouting at people who try to help, you could try to read HTTP (that's the protocol according to which the world turns around) specification regarding Referer header: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html (See Section 14.36). You also might want to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referrer_spoofing where you can see that it's all about client side. PHP is server side. All you can do is try to write a client code (Javascript) generated by PHP, but if you have any luck, then you're breaking into user's world.
