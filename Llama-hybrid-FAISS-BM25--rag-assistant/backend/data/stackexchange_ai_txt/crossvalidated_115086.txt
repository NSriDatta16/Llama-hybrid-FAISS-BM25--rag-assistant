This was too long for the comments, so posting it here. From what the others have pointed out about thinking about the prior as a belief, I think a road-block in understanding had been combining the prior and the conditional. The prior $P(\theta)$ is understood as a belief in what the true $\theta$ might be. The conditional $P(Data|\theta)$ is better thought in frequentist terms, i.e. take a model with this $\theta$ and generate many samples from it, and just count the frequencies for each sample. Their combination $\sum_{\theta} {P(\theta)\times P(Data|\theta)}$ doesn't remain a concrete process with a well defined $\theta$. So the problem is to understand that. Suppose, initially I didn't have any concrete data, I just had a belief about what the background generating process could be, i.e. a $P(\theta)$. Also, for each process I could tell what the frequencies $P(Data|\theta)$ would be. Because I wasn't really sure about the process, the $P(Data)$ was a belief: With all my uncertainty about $\theta$, I'd on average expect data, if I ever collected any, to have a distribution like this $P(Data)$. But now I actually collect some samples, call this set $S$, and I calculate the frequencies of the samples. What I have now is $P(Data|S)$. But I could write: $P(Data|S)=\sum_{\theta} P(Data|\theta)P(\theta|S)$. Thinking in this way, my counting probability $P(Data|S)$ has been arrived by first changing my belief about $\theta$ to $P(\theta|S)$, which becomes more spiked towards a particular $\theta$, and the data distribution now looks more like $P(Data|\theta)$ for that $\theta$. So, was the crux the difference between $P(Data)$ and $P(Data|S)$?
