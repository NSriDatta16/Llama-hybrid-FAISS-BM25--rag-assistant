Although this is a late response. There are a few basic scenarios you need to take into account before you do this even if you have prior knowledge in how the dbo and its engine works. 1. Is it for heavy storage? If so, then you need to fine tune the pages and work on a file format that does take so much tick time to load and retrieve. Does it need to handle many connection? Again the pages are important but also you may need to create an engine for a Service or an app based instanced working behind the scenes. Is it for application usage or web usage? If it is for the web, then really use MySql or MSSQL. Do not opt for inline memory to as your db storage because that nullifies the purpose of a database. The database was create so that you can free up the memory and release the table object(s) after an amount of time giving that memory back to the system. If it is for light use, create a simple XML/custom file database system because you are not saving or altering mass amounts of data at a time. Better than that, use SQLite which is very well suited for that purpose. If it is for opensource or commercial use do not go with inline memory because you don't to force someone to meet a high memory requirement, memory cost money and some folks are still running 32-bit OS.
