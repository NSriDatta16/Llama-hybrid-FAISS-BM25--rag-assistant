Hidden markov model to detect Stock outs in Hourly sales Time series data

I'm currently dealing with time series data about sales of beverages in a supermarket. I have data for each minute, but I'm aggregating by hour since the dataset is already huge with a daily granularity. I would like to detect stock outs occurring to a product, where a stock out happens when all the items of a given product where sold and the product is not available until refilled. I was suggested to use a Hidden Markov Model, but having little knowledge about it I don't know how to set up the problem, so I ask for help with references and suggestions of the statistical and mathematical assumptions to use. My idea would be something like: $Y_i$ = hourly time series of sales, $i=1,...,n$, $Y_i \in Z^+$ $Z_i $ = hourly time series of latent states, $i=1,...,n$ $Z_i \in {0,1}$, with $0$ corresponding to no items available/stock out Basically I would like to infer the latent state given the observable sequence of sales. I'm currently trying to find it using depmixS4 library in R : dep2 Thank you in advance
