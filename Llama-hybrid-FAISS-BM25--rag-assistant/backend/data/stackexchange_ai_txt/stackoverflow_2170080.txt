If you need to debug a library such as mootools, instead of @require-ing it, just copy/paste the entire source into your own script. Then you can debug it the same as your own code. On another note, this script includes the ability to drag-and-drop it's own window around the screen, with no additional library. Maybe you could analyze it and borrow code?
