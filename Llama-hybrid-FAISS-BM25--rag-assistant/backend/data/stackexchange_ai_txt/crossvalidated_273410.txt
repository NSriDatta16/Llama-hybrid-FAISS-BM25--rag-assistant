One way to think of this is as a binomial experiment. Given two samples, each base position for which the base is known for both samples is a trial; if the bases match, the trial is a success. Then you can measure the similarity between two samples using methods to estimate the parameter of a binomial distribution, particularly, the formula $(s + a)/(n + a + b)$, where $s$ is the number of successes, $n$ is the number of trials, and $a$ and $b$ are free parameters that allow you to bias the estimate in favor of a central value. In Bayesian terms, $a$ and $b$ express the prior. For example, you might choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$ for a weak bias towards $1/4$ (I choose $1/4$ because there are 4 distinct bases in DNA). Then 5 matches on 5 positions would result in a similarity of $2/3$, whereas 20 matches on 20 positions would result in a similarity of $7/8$.
