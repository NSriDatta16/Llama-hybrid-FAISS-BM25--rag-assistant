This question is old but I just going to tell the answer on how to resolve this. In case someone stumbled upon it.. In this case, it's the default ENGINE that is used. I haven't noticed it until now, that the server i'm using (Z-WAMP) configure INNODB as it's default engine. After I changed it to MyISAM, which is the default engine for mysql, everything works perfectly!! however, thanks for the guys who are helping me out.. In this file --> my.cnf, change this line: default-storage-engine=MyISAM
