Why One class SVM seperate from the origin

I don't understand what is the intuition behind the idea of finding a hyperplane that separate the training data from the origin if the feature space. To me it would be more intuitive to create a boundary around the positive class from all direction not just from the origin (as the Support Vector Data Description SVDD does). Can anyone clarify that for me?
