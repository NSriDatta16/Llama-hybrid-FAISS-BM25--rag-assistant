This works nicely, but is obviously not ideal - if File changes, I will not have overridden any new methods or constructors and this will expose the underlying empty abstract pathname. Am I missing something obvious? No, you have spotted a problem with using inheritance - that subclasses get tightly coupled to superclasses and their internals, so it can be fragile. That is why Effective Java and others say you should favour delegation before inheritance if possible. I think krosenvold's solution sounds clean.
