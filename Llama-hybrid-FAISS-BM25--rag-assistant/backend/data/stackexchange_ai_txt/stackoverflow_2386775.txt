JavaFX and embedded applications

I have just started digging into JavaFX and have a requirement that I am not sure if I can fulfill with JavaFX. Does anyone know if JavaFX supports embedding another application (non-java, in this case a microsoft app) in a panel? I don't (at this time) have a requirement to control anything on that application, just have it run in that panel. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
