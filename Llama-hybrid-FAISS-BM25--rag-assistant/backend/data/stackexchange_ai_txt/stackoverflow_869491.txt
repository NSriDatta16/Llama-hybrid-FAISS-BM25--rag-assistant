Like Tim said you should deploy the DLL's in the same directory as the app/plugin you are making. I believe the PATH variable is not the first place your program will look for the QT4 dll so therefore if you deploy it in the same folder your app will pick up the one with your app and ignore any that are on the PATH. Q1: In the past it seemed like everyone threw their DLLs in the system32 folder because they knew it was on the PATH and knew there program would be able to find it. From a user's point of view I find that very hard to clean up when I want to uninstall something. And now with the small price of storage I would say keep your DLLs with your app especially if they are like this where there could be multiple versions. While I'm no expert this is how I handle jar files for Java applications. Q2: I would think so. It would depend on the directory structure of the app and plugin. You can tell your plugin which version to use and I'm willing to bet the app has its version in a special place already as well.
