From my own understanding, it is notoriously difficult to infer useful things from the weights of a complex neural network. However, with 10 digits, you could play around a bit. Don't look just at the hidden-layer neuron with the strongest weight for 3, look at the top few. Then look at those hidden-layer neuron's input weights, but without multiplying with the input image already. That shows you which regions of the input image the neuron "scans" for. Now if you think heuristically about how such a neural network will work: It'll have to recognize broad features that make a 3 a 3 and discourage features that make it not a 3. So, positive weight for the arches, negative weight for a closed top loop (because that could be a hastily written 9 instead). The problem is that it's getting quite complicated quite fast. As a simpler exercise, you could try to build a smaller neural network that just distinguishes between two relatively dissimilar shapes and build your intuition from there.
