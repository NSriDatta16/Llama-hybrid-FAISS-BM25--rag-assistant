This is a frequentist approach because we are considering $\mu$ to be fixed. Thus, all the variance of $\hat \mu$ comes from the data. Technically, a Bayesian would say that $V[\hat \mu] = V[\mu] + V[\hat \mu | \mu]$ (assuming the variance of $\hat \mu$ is independent of $\mu$ ). But more over, I think the authors are just saying they are using MLE's, which have a frequentist justification.
