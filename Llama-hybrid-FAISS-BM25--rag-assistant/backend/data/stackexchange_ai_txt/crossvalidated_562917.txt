How to prepare dataset for multivariate time series analysis using LSTM or RNNs?

I am looking to use LSTM/RNN to perform time series prediction using some clinical data, however the structuring of the data might be an issue. I am fairly new to LSTM/RNN, would like to know how can I model the LSTM for my use case. I have a dataset looking like this, ID date feature1 feature2 feature3 person1 date1 value11 value12 value13 person1 date2 value21 value22 value23 person2 date1 value31 value32 value33 person2 date2 ... ... ... person3 ... ... ... ... I would like to perform a time series analysis to perform prediction based on each person's characteristics/features but based on my previous research and understanding most of the LSTM models are modelled based on lets say a singular person with multiple timestamps and data respectively. Given a data format/structure like mine, how can I go about training a LSTM model to perform predictions based on such features. The dates/years are the not the same for each person too.
