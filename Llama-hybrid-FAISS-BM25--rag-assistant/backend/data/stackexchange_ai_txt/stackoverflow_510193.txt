Why does my LaTeX subfigure not work with an a0poster?

Here's my problem. I have a bunch of figures already written in a LaTeX document, and I'd like to reuse them for a poster. The code for the figure looks like: \begin{figure}[htp] \begin{center} \subfigure[Figure A]{\label{fig:Sample-a}\includegraphics[scale=5]{Image1.png}} \subfigure[Figure B]{\label{fig:Sampple-b}\includegraphics[scale=5]{Image2.png}} \end{center} \caption{This is my caption!} \label{LineJustification} \end{figure} And it works when I put at the beginning: \usepackage{subfigure} \usepackage{graphicx} When I'm putting together the poster, I'm using the template I've found online at this website, with packages like: \documentclass[a0]{a0poster} \pagestyle{empty} \setcounter{secnumdepth}{0} \usepackage[absolute]{textpos} \usepackage[it]{subfigure} (and I've commented out the graphics, wrapfig, and times packages from the landscape file, just in case they're interfering). So what gives? Why do I get the following error when I try to put the same figure into the a0poster document? If I don't use subfigures, the file compiles, but then I'd have to rework all of my figures, which would be painful. !Undefined control sequence if\@captype topcap I.154 \subfigure [Figure A]{\label{fig:Sample-a} (I'm using mactex, if that means anything)
