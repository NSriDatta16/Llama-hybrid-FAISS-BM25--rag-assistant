From Replication Agent Security Model : Merge Agent for a pull subscription The Windows account under which the agent runs is used when it makes connections to the Subscriber. This account must at minimum be a member of the db_owner fixed database role in the subscription database. The account that is used to connect to the Publisher and Distributor must: Be a member of the PAL. Be a login associated with a user in the publication database. Be a login associated with a user in the distribution database. The user can be the Guest user. Have read permissions on the snapshot share. Therefore is a documented requirement of Merge replication that the account running the replication agent (replmerge.exe) be member of db_owner. If you this does not work for you situation, then Merge replication is not the right technology to use, since it has a requirement you cannot fill. Now int theory an application can do whatever REPLMERGE does from another application, and you can leverage the power of code signing to run a set of wrapper procedures that are granted dbo privileges via code signing, thus not needing the elevated login, but that's just theory since the replication procedures are not exactly easy to use nor are they documented at the level one needs to re-implement the agents...
