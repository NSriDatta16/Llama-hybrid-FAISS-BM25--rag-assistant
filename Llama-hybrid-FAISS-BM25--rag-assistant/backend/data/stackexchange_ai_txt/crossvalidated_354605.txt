In my field (sociology) Machine Learning techniques are very very very rare, and the techniques from Agressti's book are dominant, and I don't expect that to change. I don't think one is replacing the other, they are different tools for different problems. Roughly speaking Machine Learning is good when you want to predict, categorical data analysis is good when you want to explain. My field is much more interested in explaining. In specific fields there is a lot of enthusiasm about Machine Learning, but at the risk of sounding old: we have seen such phases before. (anybody remember fractals and chaos theory) The good thing about such a phase is that a lot of work on that specific topic gets done. However, the enthusiasm will eventually die down when it becomes clear that the results will be nowhere near is world changing as initially prophesied. After that the topic will find it's own niche, and be useful in that niche.
