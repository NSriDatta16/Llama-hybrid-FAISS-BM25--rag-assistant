One way of managing where your code is, is for each of your forms to have a hidden field describing what the form does. Then you can check what form was submitted back and include another php file to deal with it. This kind of thing: This way you ought to be able to separate your code from each other. These other php files you are including could contain just a form or just the code to process the form. Either way, it's a lot easier to maintain code this way. There are many patterns of organising code and this is just one of them.
