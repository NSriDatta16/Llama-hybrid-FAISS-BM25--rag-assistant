The truth is that the tool can never give you a 100% certain answer, but coverage tool can give you a pretty good run for the money. If you count with comprehensive unit test suite, than you can use test coverage tool to see exactly what lines of code were not executed during the test run. You will still need to analyze the code manually: either eliminate what you consider dead code or write test to improve test coverage. One such tool is NCover , with open source precursor on Sourceforge . Another alternative is PartCover . Check out this answer on stackoverflow.
