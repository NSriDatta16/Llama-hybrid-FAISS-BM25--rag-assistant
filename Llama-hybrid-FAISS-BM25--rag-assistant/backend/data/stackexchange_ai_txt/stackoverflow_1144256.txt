I haven't used the control you are so I can't say if this one will work for you but I highly recommend: http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/ It's a javascript calendar so the user will only download the js includes once. After that the creation calls are just a few lines. It's not immediately "drag-and-drop" compatible with ASP.Net. I recommend wrapping it in a user control.
