Instead of MySQL you might consider using a triplestore , or a key-value store that way you get the benifits of having all the multithreading multiuser, performance and caching voodoo, figured out, without all the trouble of trying to figure out ahead of time what kind of values you really want to store. Downsides: it's a bit more costly to figure out the average salary of all the people in idaho who also own hats.
