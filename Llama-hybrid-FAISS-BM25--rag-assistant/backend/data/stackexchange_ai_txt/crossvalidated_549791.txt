Random Forest in R: intepret the plot

I run random forest (using package randomForest) on the classic titanic data. Here are the code and results. set.seed(123) dt_rf Wondering how shall I interpret the plot here. What does each line represent? Is it training, testing, and validation? If so, which one is which? And how does the randomForest function split the data?
