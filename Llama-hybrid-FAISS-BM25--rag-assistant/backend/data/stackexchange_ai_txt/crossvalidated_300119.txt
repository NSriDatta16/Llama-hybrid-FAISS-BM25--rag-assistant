Does SVM perform poorly with too few observations

I try to train a linear SVM using package e1071, with cost=10 on the following data: x The data looks like: In theory, point E(0.26,0.63) should also be a support vector. But svm() does not return it as a support vector, but considers point T(1.14,1.09) as SV. This happens also when I change the kernel to "radial". In theory, E should be a support vector, while point T(1.14, 1.09) not, if I understand correctly the theory. Might this inconsistency be due to the fact that I have only 10 observations?
