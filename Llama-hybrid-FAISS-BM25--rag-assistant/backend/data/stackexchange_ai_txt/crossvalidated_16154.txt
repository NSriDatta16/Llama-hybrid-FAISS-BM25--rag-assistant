Use regression -- look for the "polynomial fitting" slide. Principal component analysis is useful for analysing multidimensional clusters (there are dramatic examples of representing photographs of faces using only a handful of parameters, or breaking down the political axes exposed by a survey). Once you have a polynomial you can differentiate it to find the interesting features maximum slope turning points and inflexion points trends (in range x=a...x=b the gradient never exceeds amount N) Regression is nice because does not require an exact fit in the same way that polynomial interpolation does -- so it's more tolerant of errors and noise -- and also you can calculate when the fit is "good enough" according to arbitrary criteria. You can express a number of machine learning methods (perceptrons, for example) in the language of regression. The only tricky part is inverting what may be a rather large matrix, you'll need a good numerical library to get stable solutions in extreme cases.
