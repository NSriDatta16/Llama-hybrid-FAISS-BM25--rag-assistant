Try this: g = Company.all.group_by{|c|c.name.upcase[0..0]} ('A'..'Z').each do |letter| companies = g[letter] || [] # process the name and the letter end This will work even in scenarios when you do not have items for few letters. Note : You might want to handle the numbers and non English letters differently by modifying the group_by logic. You also have to change the letter name iteration list accordingly.
