This article might help: Implementing a custom runtime host . It discusses the various aspects of the host and when/why you might want to implement your own. Lifted directly from the article: examples of hosts that ship with the .NET Framework include: ASP.NET: An ISAPI filter that ships with ASP.NET is responsible for starting the CLR and initializing the plumbing needed to route Web requests to the ASP.NET processes. Internet Explorer: The .NET Framework ships with a MIME filter that hooks into Internet Explorer 5.01 or later to execute managed code controls that are referenced from HTML pages. Shell Executables: Each time an executable is launched from the shell, a small piece of unmanaged code gets invoked that transitions control to the CLR. Other hosts could include: Database Engines A future version of Microsoft SQL Server will allow stored procedures to be written in languages that support the .NET Framework and are executed with the CLR. Personal Organizers Several e-mail/calendar/contact programs allow users to write scripts to customize the processing of e-mail messages, appointments, and so on. It's easy to imagine these scripts running on the CLR. The security system provided by the CLR is especially important in this scenario because of the proliferation of viruses spread by e-mail systems.
