I think there are some studies claiming that it makes a difference regarding the distribution of responses. The main concern is to justify the interval scale. Likert scales anchor every point and try to encourage equal interval sizes. Strictly speaking, a Likert scale always requires that all points are anchored. However, I doubt it makes a difference. Whatever anchoring you use, data will always be subject to scale usage heterogeneity ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/2670337 ). This effect will be much stronger than any effect caused by anchoring.
