Customizing matplotlib image display to add copy/paste

I would like to customize matplotlib image display so that i can type control-c and it will copy the image to the clipboard so then i can copy it to openoffice spreadsheet to organize all of my raw data and image results. Is there any way to do this? Thanks!
