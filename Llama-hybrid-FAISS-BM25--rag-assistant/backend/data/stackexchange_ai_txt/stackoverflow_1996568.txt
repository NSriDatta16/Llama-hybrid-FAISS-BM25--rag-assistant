What is it that makes the DefaultTeam a Value Object rather than an Entity? Isn't a DefaultTeam also an entity? That being said, here are some comments: Why do you need a special class for DefaultTeam? Can't a DefaultTeam simply be an ExecutionTeam, with certain specified values? A DefaultTeam should probably be an instance of a Team that is associated with an application domain. For example, you might have a particular team that is generally used to solve problems with Project XYZ. Instead of listing "DefaultTeam" as a property of the ExecutionTeam, you should probably have a "PreviousTeam" as a property of both the Team and ExecutionTeam classes. This will be more generalizable, in case the team gets changed yet again. Since Task is an important part of the domain and is assigned to a Team, it should probably be a property of Team. "Helpers" doesn't seem an appropriate name for the team members. Why not just name them "Members" or "TeamMembers"? "Master" is probably un-PC unless you are working in Dilbert land or dealing with a database :) You might want to change this to "Supervisor" or "Manager". "Code" is probably a bad name in the context of your application, as it may easily be confused with programming code. You might want to use "Id" or "TeamId" instead.
