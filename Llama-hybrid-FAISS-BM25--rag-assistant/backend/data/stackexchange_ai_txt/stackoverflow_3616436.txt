Using text/html javascript templates in production code

Has anyone implemented John Resig's micro-templating in production code? In particular I'd like to know if embedding the templates with has caused any problems. A bit more information: here's the sort of thing I'm worried about: My users are mostly in corporate environments - could an unusual proxy server mangle or strip out the templates The embedded templates seem to fail W3C validation. What if, for instance, the next version of IE decides it doesn't like them?
