MouseEnter/MouseLeave and mouse left button down

I'am trying to implement a click and drag selection like the one in windows explorer (the blue selection rectangle that occurs when you keep the mouse button down and you move the mouse). So basically I have a ListView, with styled and templated ListViewItem. I have added MouseEnter and MouseLeave event on my ListViewItem (with the EventSetter), It works fine except when the left mouse button is down. In this case, the events doesn't get fired, which is not good for what I'm trying to achieve. Do you know if there is any good workaround for this, I want to know when I'm over an item or not when the left mouse button is down. For now I've tried with the VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(), but I only know when I cross a ListViewItem, and I need to know when I leave it. Thank you.
