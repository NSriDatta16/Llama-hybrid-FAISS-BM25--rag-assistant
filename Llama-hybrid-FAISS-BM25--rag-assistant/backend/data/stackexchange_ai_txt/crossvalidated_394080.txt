Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood estimator for soft-core point process

I am trying to fit a soft-core point process model on a set of point pattern using maximum pseudo-likelihood. I followed the instructions given in this paper by Baddeley and Turner And here is the R-code I came up with `library(deldir) library(tidyverse) library(fields) #MPLE # irregular parameter k k % mutate(Ind = c(rep(1, nrow(X)), rep(0, nrow(dum)))) ## Calculate Quadrature weights using Voronoi cell area w $RA, bind.x$ DE) $summary$ dir.area ## Response y $RA, bind.x$ DE) t1 However, the fitted parameter for t is negative which is obviously not a correct value for a softcore point process. Also, my point pattern is actually simulated from a softcore process so it does not make sense that the fitted parameter is negative. I tried my best to find any bugs in the code but I can't seem to find it. The only potential issue I see is that my sufficient statistics is extremely large (on the order of 10^14) which I fear may cause numerical issues. But the statistics are large because my observation window spans a very small unit and the average distance between a pair of points is around 0.006. So sufficient statistics based on this will certainly be very large and my intuition tells me that it should not cause a numerical problem and make the fitted parameter to be negative. Can anybody help and check if my code is correct? Thanks very much!
