Short answer: Indeed, when the same customer may be approached at most $n$ times, it is optimal to start with offer $y_1=\frac{n-1}{n}x$ and decrease the price by $\frac{x}{n}$ with every refusal. The above result only holds for the uniform distribution of the customer's valuation $v$ . Under the normal distribution, closed form answer is feasible only numerically. When $n$ customer may be approached, each at most once, the optimization problem assumes a double layer structure: inner smooth optimization problem is wrapped in outer combinatorial optimization task. Coupled with non-trivial covariance structure in valuations, this makes the analytical (and/or tractable) closed form solution infeasible. A promising approach for the latter case would be to assume that valuations $v_1,...,v_n$ are uniformly distributed over a parallelotope and leverage the polyhedral computation methods to speed up computations. Detailed answer Approaching the same customer at most $n$ times When we are dealing with asingle customer and may try up to $n$ times until he walks away, the problem solution is straightforward and and follows the logic presented in the other answer to this post. The expected profit can be written down as follows: \begin{align} \mathbb{E}\pi =& y_1 \cdot \mathbb{P}(v > y_1) + y_2 \cdot \mathbb{P}(v where the implicit convention is that $y_0$ is some upper bound of the support of $v$ so that $\mathbb{P}( v . The solution to the problem is thus a sequence $\mathbf{y}:=(y_1,...,y_n)$ maximizing the expected profit. In the case of uniform distribution, $v \sim U[0, x]$ the first order conditions with respect to $y_i$ represent a system of linear equations: \begin{equation} \frac{\partial}{\partial y_i} \mathbb{E} \pi = 0 \iff \begin{cases} \frac{x-y_1}{x} - y_1 \frac{1}{x} + y_2 \frac{1}{x} = 0 \\ \frac{y_{i-1}-y_{i}}{x} - y_i \frac{1}{x} + y_{i+1} \frac{1}{x} = 0 \quad \forall i=2,..n-1 \\ \frac{y_{n-1}-y_{n}}{x} - y_n \frac{1}{x} = 0 \end{cases} \end{equation} It is immediate from the second equality that there exists an increment $\delta$ such that $\forall i=2,..n$ holds $y_{i} = y_{i-1} - \delta$ , implying that $y_i = y_1 - (i-1)\delta$ . This is consistent with the first and the last equality iff $\delta = \frac{x}{n}$ and $y_1 = \frac{n-1}{n}x$ as per intuition described in the OP. Remark: Once we switch to a more contrived assumption about the distribution of the customer valuation, explicit answer becomes impossible to obtain analytically. E.g. in the case of a normal distribution truncated to the interval $[0,x]$ the system of first order conditions becomes \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \frac{\Phi(x)-\Phi(y_1)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} - y_1 \frac{\phi(y_1)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} + y_2 \frac{\phi(y_1)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} = 0 \\ \frac{\Phi(y_{i-1})-\Phi(y_{i})}{\Phi(x)-1/2} - y_i \frac{\phi(y_i)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} + y_{i+1} \frac{\phi(y_i)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} = 0 \quad \forall i=2,..n-1 \\ \frac{\Phi(y_{n-1})-\Phi(y_{n})}{\Phi(x)-1/2} - y_n \frac{\phi(y_n)}{\Phi(x)-1/2} = 0 \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\phi(z) = (2\pi)^{-1/2}\exp(-\frac{z^2}{2})$ is the pdf of the standart normal and $\Phi(z) = \int_{-\infty}^{z} \phi(\xi)d\xi$ is its cdf. One can clearly see that the analytical closed form solution is infeasible in this case. Approaching at most $n$ different customers no more than once each First take a look at a 2-customer problem: for a sequence of offers $y_1, y_2$ and the ordering (permutation) of clients $\sigma(1),\sigma(2)$ the expected revenue looks as follows: \begin{align} \mathbb{E}\pi = &y_1 \mathbb{P}(v_{\sigma(1)} > y_1) + \mathbb{P}(v_{\sigma(1)} y_2 | y_1 > v_{\sigma(1)}) =\\ = & y_1 \mathbb{P}(v_{\sigma(1)} > y_1) + y_2 \mathbb{P}(v_{\sigma(1)} y_2). \end{align} Now, it is not hard to write down the formula for $n$ clients: \begin{align} \mathbb{E}\pi =& \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \cdot \mathbb{P}\left(v_{\sigma(i)} > y_i \cap ( \cap_{j=1}^{i-1} v_{\sigma(j)} where the last equality holds true if we posit $y_{n+1}\equiv 0$ . Here just as in the remark above, one can see that analytical closed form solution of the inner smooth optimization problem is impossible to obtain under the joint normality assumption as the first order conditions will certainly be non-polynomial. This and given that the outer problem is combinatorial makes the numerical (algorithmical) solution of the problem the most promising way forward. An idea for a way forward: Computation of probabilities $\mathbb{P}\left(\cap_{j=1}^{i} v_{\sigma(j)} might turn out to be easier if we assume a distorted uniform distribution (uniform over a [parallelotope][3]). I haven't seen anything like this in the litterature myself, but it might be the good compromise between the simplicity of operations with the uniform distribution and the capacity of the normal to capture non-trivial covariance structure. More precisely, one may assume that $\mathbf{v}=(v_1,...,v_n)$ is distributed uniformly over an $n$ -parallelotope . In this case the parameter of the distribution would be the matrix of $n$ stacked vectors $a_1,...,a_n$ in the frame of the parallelotope, and the unconditional density would be the inverse of its volume, whereas conditional probabilities may be computed as volumes of straightforwardly formulated convex polytopes. Given a reasonably fast oracle for computing optimal $\mathbf{y}$ , the combinatorial optimization for moderate $n$ may then be performed by a simple comparison of expected profits of different permutations.
