The VC dimension depends on the dimension of your data and on the family of functions you are evaluating. In $\mathbb R^2$ , the VC dimesion of the family $h(x)$ of oriented lines is 3 beacause, with oriented lines, you can only classify correctly three points taking into account all the 8 possible label assignments, as depicted in the figure below: Figure from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/svmtutorial.pdf Yor family of functions $h(x) = x + 10$ is a subset of the family of lines, then the VC is 3, you can try to draw the same figure as the one above but whith your particular $h(x)$ . You won't be able to separate 4 points taking into account their 16 possible labelings with this family of functions.
