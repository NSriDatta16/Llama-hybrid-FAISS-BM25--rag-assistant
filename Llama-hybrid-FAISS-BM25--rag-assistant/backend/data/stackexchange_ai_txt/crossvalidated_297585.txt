Logistic regression with grouped data

Likely a simple question, have searched for an answer I promise! I'm looking to do a Logistic regression for a dataset in which data is grouped by an ID, where there is one positive flag per group and the groups vary in size. A simple example would be a prediction of who is the heaviest in a group of individuals, given their age and height: | GroupId | Age | Height | Heaviest | |---------|-----|--------|----------| | 1 | 27 | 198 | 1 | | 1 | 42 | 165 | 0 | | 1 | 34 | 133 | 0 | | 2 | 63 | 176 | 1 | | 2 | 27 | 189 | 0 | | 2 | 55 | 165 | 0 | | 2 | 44 | 166 | 0 | My question is how we can leverage the grouping information into a logistic regression, as many of the positive flags will be on individuals who shouldn't be characterised as 'Heaviest' in a global sense, or am I thinking about it the wrong way? For what it's worth, I'm working with python's statsmodels library.
