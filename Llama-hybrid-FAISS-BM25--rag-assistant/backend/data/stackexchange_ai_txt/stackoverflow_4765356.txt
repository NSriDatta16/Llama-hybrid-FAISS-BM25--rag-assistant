How do you extract the lat and lon from a GeoPt property?

I'm extending the GeoModel to store locations in the datastore so I can do geo-based searches more efficiently and I assumed I could use the GeoPt property to store latitude and longitude. And the storage has worked fine. But I'm at a complete loss as to how to extract the lat and lon from an entity. I must be missing something simple but I can't actually find the documentation for the GeoPt type so I'm looking for help on supported methods. class StopLocation(GeoModel): stopID = db.StringProperty() def create(stopID,lat,lon): stop = StopLocation() stop.stopID = stopID stop.location = GeoPt(lat,lon) latitude = stop.location???
