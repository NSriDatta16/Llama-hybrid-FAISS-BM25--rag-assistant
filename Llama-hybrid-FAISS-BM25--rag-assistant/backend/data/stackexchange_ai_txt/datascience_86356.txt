First perform data augmentation or normalization?

Should I first perform data augmentation or normalization in deep learning? I am mainly interested in 2D and 3D input data. In tutorials that I have seen so far the data augmentation always comes first. Is there a (mathematical) reason for that? Would it also work vice versa?
