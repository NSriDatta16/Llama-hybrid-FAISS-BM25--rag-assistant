I do a lot of cellular work with Verizon and AT&T. Ping times when pointing to a mobile device have to be taken with the understanding that any initial connection attempt will be higher than normal. If the baseline that we see for ping RTT can be around 300 ms on average for AT&T. They are even higher for Verizon 400 ms to 600 ms. But the first packet for each carrier has to first find the mobile device. And because of that the first response you get can be really (really) high. 3000 ms to as high as 4500 ms is what I've seen on a network I manage that has 2700 mobile endpoints that we connect to regularly from a monitoring system. Additionally any environment with a lot of RF noise will create latency and dropped packets. Even your home can generate plenty of noise to interfere with devices that operate over radio. This probably isn't helpful but... If you can use an API that has better buffering capabilities you might be better off... or look more closely at the buffering capabilities of the current API you're thinking about using. I hope you get it working =)
