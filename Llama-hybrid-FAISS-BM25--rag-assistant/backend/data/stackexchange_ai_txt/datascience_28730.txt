In general, I would suggest to use a regularization technique for reducing the dimensionality ofa data set in linear regression cases. Please refer to L1 regularization . If you want to decrease the number variables using PCA, you should look at the lambda values that describe the variations in the principle components, then, select the a few components with the largest corresponding lambda values (eg the first four). Note: Do a scaling if necessary. Sometimes the very first component is not very relevant and can be eliminated.
