Compare growth rate for different sized samples

I have 11 years of membership data for a denomination of churches and I want to find the top 20 growth rate "trend breakers". In my current method I have: calculated % change from the previous year for all churches calculated 3yr, 5yr and 10yr averages determined the overall mean for each of these filtered out below avg scores for 10y, 5y, and then 3y This stil leaves me with a list of more than 20. I have two questions: Is there a more scientific way to identify the top twenty trendbreakers? On what basis can I filter out small churches with explosive but short-term growth that inflates their growth average?
