You can do it when the groups have the same size. Say you have two groups of three values, then $$\begin{align} \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} + \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}\Big) = \frac{x_1}{6} + \frac{x_2}{6} + \frac{x_3}{6} + \frac{y_1}{6} + \frac{y_2}{6} + \frac{y_3}{6} \end{align}$$ vs $$\begin{align} \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} + \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4}{4}\Big) = \frac{x_1}{6} + \frac{x_2}{6} + \frac{x_3}{6} + \frac{y_1}{8} + \frac{y_2}{8} + \frac{y_3}{8} + \frac{y_4}{8} \end{align}$$ As you can see, with the second approach the values are not equally weighted so the average of averages would differ from the average of all the raw values taken together. You would need to use a weighted average , where the weights would be proportional to the group sizes. So the average of averages calculates the average of the group averages, rather than of the observations. I can imagine where calculating it may make sense, for example when you want the size of the groups not to affect the result, so smaller groups have the same impact on the result as larger groups. Just, you need to keep in mind the difference and the interpretation of the result.
