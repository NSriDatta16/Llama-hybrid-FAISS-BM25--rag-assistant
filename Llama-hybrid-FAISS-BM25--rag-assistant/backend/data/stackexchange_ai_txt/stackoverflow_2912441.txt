I get that it's making a vector of type char, with each entry being an array of char 4096 bytes large It's not. The WTF::Vector template takes two template parameters. The first is the element type (in this case char, which means that each element is a char, not an array of chars). The second is the inline capacity, i.e. the number of bytes the vector can store without allocating additional memory on the heap. but I don't get the buffer(fragmentEnd * 3 + 1) part. The syntax to create a variable on the stack is type variablename(constructor,arguments); . So buffer is the name of the variable and fragmentEnd * 3 + 1 is the argument to Vector 's constructor (which specifies the vector's initial size).
