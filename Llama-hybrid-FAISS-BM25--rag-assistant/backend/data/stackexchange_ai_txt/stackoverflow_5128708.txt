Rails Paperclip - Can't get thumbnail to resize properly

I'm having difficulty creating a thumbnail, for some reason it's not chopping off the way I want. I typically post landscape photos so the dimensions are correct, however when the photo has to be auto rotated, it's not working. has_attached_file :image, :styles => { :mobile_lg => "640x480>", :mobile_sm => "200x150#", :thumb => "96x96#" }, :convert_options => { :all => '-auto-orient' }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/:style/:id/:filename" Don't laugh at the pic, it's my only example! Here's the mobile_lg photo. and the mobile_sm photo: When the thumbnail should be like this (i cropped it like this in Photoshop) I've tried to add this after the styles, but it's not working. :commands => { :mobile_sm => "-gravity center -extent 200x150#" } I would like to take the photo and crop/resize it to 200(width) by 150(height), even if it means doing it destructively. I've also tried to use ! after the dimensions, but still I get the mobile_sm image you see above.
