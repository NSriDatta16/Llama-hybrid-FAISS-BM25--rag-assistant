Latent Profile Analysis - standardizing the variables and interpreting it

This is the first time I'm running an LPA and prior to running it, I standardized all variables because I read that would help interpret the profile structure later. And now I'm confused in the interpretations; for example, is it right that in the solution below, both groups are lower than average on the purple item...? how does that make sense? Really appreciate any help!
