UIScrollView - detect second touch while scrolling

I have a subclass of UIScrollView that implements this method: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touches: %d", [[event allTouches] count]); [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } This gets called when I first touch the scroll view. However, if I begin dragging the scroll view, then place a second finger down, touchesBegan does not get called. I need to detect when a second touch has occured in the scrollview, even if it is currently scrolling. Any ideas? EDIT: Two touches are registered if I start with two, but if I start with one, begin scrolling, then put a 2nd finger down it is not registered.
