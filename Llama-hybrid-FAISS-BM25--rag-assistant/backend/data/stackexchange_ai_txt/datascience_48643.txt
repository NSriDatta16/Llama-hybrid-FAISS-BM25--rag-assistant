Will the features in the image (edge, color, etc.. ) impacts on the performance of the spherical k-means?

I am very new in Machine learning, I recently implemented the spherical k-means, but finally I found a interesting point from the result. I used four datasets, they are minst, cifar-10, fashion-minst, and svhn. I was following the paper Learning Feature Representations with K-means (Coates & Ng, 2012) https://www-cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/coatesng_nntot2012.pdf . I did not finish the deep learning yet. See the following image, I tried the max pooling and average pooling to see if there any difference, but I found an interesting point, the dataset with the clear feature (edge, color, etc. of the object in the image ) has the high performance, the dataset without clear feature has low performance. See the four pictures on the bottom, I extracted one image from each dataset. I ordered them according the performance. I tried search online, but I did not get any useful information about my question. I am not sure whether the point is correct or not. Could any one please explain this to me. Thanks!
