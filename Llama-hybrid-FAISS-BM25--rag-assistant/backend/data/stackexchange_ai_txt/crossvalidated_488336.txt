Why is factor rotation always recommended, though it obscures general factors?

I have discovered that factor rotation has had detrimental effects in a lot of studies applying factor analysis in cross-cultural studies. I have made a meta-analysis of cultural differences between countries. Most of the published studies of cultural differences use rotated factor analysis. I discovered that the unrotated results of the different analyses were very similar, while the published rotated results all looked different. The authors of each study invented new confusing names for the factors they found, believing that they had found something new and useful. Using unrotated factors instead, I found that most of the cultural variables had high correlations with one or two general factors, while the remaining factors seemed unimportant and non-reproducible. The common practice of factor rotation has obscured the fact that many researchers have made very similar findings with strong loadings on the same two general factors. My discovery immediately caused attention among researchers in the field of cross-cultural studies. My study is published in the journal Cross-Cultural Research: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397120956948 (open access preprint: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343670790_A_test_of_the_reproducibility_of_the_clustering_of_cultural_variables ) I find it hard to believe that factor rotation has been a standard recommendation for many years without mentioning that it may obscure the existence of strong general factors in the case where many variables are correlated with each other. The only mentioning of this phenomenon that I can find is in this post Is there a reason to leave an exploratory factor analysis solution unrotated? Have I missed something in the literature that is discussing this? Should I publicize my findings somewhere so that researchers in other fields than cross-cultural studies can learn from it?
