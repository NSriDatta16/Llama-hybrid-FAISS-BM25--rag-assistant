Stored procedures or stored functions in any open source software?

I've been reading about Mysql stored procedures lately. and... after awhile I see very little use for them personally. ...well...Maybe for security reasons if you only want to give access to part of your data. Also - I've never seen them being used in the wild. AFAIK - I checked magento, wordpress, joomla, drupal - non of them used stored procs, functions or views. Can someone suggest any open source piece of software that actually uses stored procedures. I'm eager to see what problems are solved by the authors that can't be solved using standard dynamic sql. Thanks. UPDATE: While I definitely agree with points made by Suroot and duffymo - I'm still looking for an example usage of stored procedures in any real world open source software. If anyone could point me to such a software - plz let me know. :)
