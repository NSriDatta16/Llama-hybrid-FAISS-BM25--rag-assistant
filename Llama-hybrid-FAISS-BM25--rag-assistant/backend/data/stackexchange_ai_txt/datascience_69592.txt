Clustering a dataset and creating a model per each cluster

I was wondering if it makes sense to cluster a dataset to find closely related data points and train a binary classification model for each of this clusters as they would be minidatasets. I'll ellaborate a bit more. I have a dataset with information about an infrequent event (e.g. a crime in one part of the city). The dataset looks like this. Note how the features are not item-specific but timestamp specific (as in the 2020-03-12 17:00 timestamp) as they represent the state of the city at that timestamp: weather, hour of the day, visibility, etc... Timestamp StreetID Feature1 Feature2, Feature3,... FeatureN 2020-03-12 17:00 12 4 C 5 100 2020-03-12 17:00 145 4 C 5 100 2020-03-08 19:00 145 8 D 6 98 ... 2020-03-06 18:15 76 6 C 8 110 I want to train a machine learning model that predicts if this rare event is going to happen or not in a given street or set of streets. I have two options here: Train a multiclass classification model where you will get a probability for each of the streets. The problem is that there are thousands of streets and some of them have few positive cases Train one binary classification model for each street. Also impractical for the reasons mentioned above Group several streets and train a binary classification model for each of these groups. My question is related to the third option. How can we build these groups?. I assume that it would help to group together streets that share a feature distribution that explains if this unfrequent event is happening or not. Could I make that by clustering the dataset shown above (ignoring the StreetID feature obviously) and checking if inside those clusters there is a high concentration of one or more StreetID's?. Then I can train a binary model with a dataset for the StreetID's of one cluster containing the positive cases/timestamps where the event happened together with the negative cases/timestamps where the event didn't happen like in the example below (assuming we have 15 minutes timestamps and Streets 145 and 76 belong to the same cluster i.e have a high concentration of events inside one cluster). Hypothetically this would make more sense than just grouping streets by some other criteria. Timestamp StreetID Feature1 Feature2, Feature3,...
