How many bots have JS "enabled"?

We're talking your average everyday spamming bots -- those which we try to protect against using captcha. How many of them are capable of running JS in some kind of embedded-browser? If it's a very tiny amount, then how on earth can solutions like this be useful: http://wcaptcha.wozia.pt/sample.php Apart from the obvious usability/accessibility issues, these drag-n-drop solutions require the client to have JS. There's not even a fallback. So, assuming it is intended to protect against bots (non-humans) isn't it entirely redundant, or at least redundant to the extent of how many bots would be technically capable of attempting such a thing? If the client has JS ( which is a pre-requisite for this solution to work ) then isn't it safe (within reasonable measure) to assume the client not a bot?
