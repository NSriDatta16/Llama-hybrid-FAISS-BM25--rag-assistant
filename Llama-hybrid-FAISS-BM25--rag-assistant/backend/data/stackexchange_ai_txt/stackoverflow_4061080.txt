Output each combination of an array of numbers with javascript

I have several numbers in an array var numArr = [1, 3, 5, 9]; I want to cycle through that array and multiply every unique 3 number combination as follows: 1 * 3 * 5 = 1 * 3 * 9 = 1 * 5 * 9 = 3 * 5 * 9 = Then return an array of all the calculations var ansArr = [15,27,45,135]; Anyone have an elegant solution? Thanks in advance.
