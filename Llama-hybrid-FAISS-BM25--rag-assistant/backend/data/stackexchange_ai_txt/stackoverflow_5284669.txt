VC2008 is a fragile beast. The optimiser just doesn't work for some cases, and looks like you might possibly have one such case. Examples of "not working" include De-optimised code (slow!) Compiler or (more frequently) linker crashes Obscure compile/link error messages Incorrect code execution (this one is rare, but not unknown). Actually, if you look at some of the tricks used by modern optimisers it is pretty amazing that it works as often as it does. The complexity is quite astounding. Addressing Shane's problem specifically, some things that might cause your error: Running out of file handles used to be a big problem in DOS and early Windows versions. You hardly ever see it in modern Windows versions. I'm not even certain there is still a limit on file handles. A compiler bug could be doing an infinite loop, meaning that no amount of resources will be enough. A recursive include file could also cause something similar. Do all your include files have " #pragma once " or " #if !defined(FOO_INCLUDED) "? Is it possible you've included the file TINDoc.obj twice in the project? The 2008 compiler is aggressively multi-threaded and there might be contention between two threads trying to access the file. Actually this could happen via a compiler bug, even if you haven't included the file twice. If the program really is just too big, consider breaking it up into one or more DLLs and building it piecemeal, or splitting the contentious source file into multiple files to compiler in multiple phases. Don't assume that, because it says "not enough space" that has to be the reason. Some programs (including some compilers) will guess a reason for an error, instead of checking. You can monitor the use of memory, handles, etc. using task manager or perfmon, or (my preference) Process Explorer I already posted the first part of this as a comment (above) but I an making it an answer, as suggested by Ben (http://stackoverflow.com/users/587803/ben) -- and expanded it somewhat.
