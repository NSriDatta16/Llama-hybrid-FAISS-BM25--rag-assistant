Many machine learning models do not care about the effect of confounding variables, because they only care about the accuracy of the model, but not casual relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. We can easily make an example using simulation: let variable $A$ have prior distribution of $P(A)$ , and generate two other variables $B$ and $C$ with conditional distribution $P(B|A)$ and $P(C|A)$ given. Then generate the prediction target $Y$ from all three variables. Finally we can use random forest to predict and check the performance. You can see, random forest will work "fine" on all variable included, although there are confounding variables exists.
