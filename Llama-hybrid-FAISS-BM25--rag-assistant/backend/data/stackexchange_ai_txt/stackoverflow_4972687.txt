Marking a component as Apartment threaded is just an assertion from the component developer. There are plenty of component developers around who don't understand threading, and even those who do understand threading sometimes get it wrong, so it's an act of faith to trust this assertion. Personally I'm very wary of using 3rd party components in a multithreaded environment for that reason. Except those that I know have had very wide exposure in multithreaded applications, and/or for which I know I can get adequate support. If you don't have access to support from the component developer, or source code for the component, and you absolutely need to use it, then the option of creating a single instance may be a good pragmatic solution.
