Interaction terms, dummy variables, and fixed effects

I am getting very strange results for an interaction term in a model I am fitting. I am interested in the impact of uncertainty on investment. The theory predicts that the effect of uncertainty on investment will be higher for manufacturing companies than for non-manufacturing ones. To tests this hypothesis I use the following fixed effects model in my longitudinal panel data set: $$ Invest_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 U_t + \beta_2 U_t \mathord{\cdot} M_{i} + \beta_3 X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t} (1) $$ where $i=1,2,...,N$ indexes cross-section dimension and $t=1,2,...,T$ the time series dimension. $M_i$ is a dummy variable with values 0 and 1, none manufacturing firms and manufacturing firms respectively; $U_t$ is uncertainty which does not vary across firms but only through time, and $X_{i,t}$ is a set of controls. Given that $M_i$ is a time-invariant characteristic, my fixed effects variable $\alpha_i$ absorbs its effect in the interaction term: $ \beta_1 U_t + \beta_2 M_{i} + \beta_3 U_t \mathord{\cdot} M_{i} $. That is why $ \beta_2 = 0$. Now when running the regression of equation 1, I obtain the following results: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) U -0.0102484 0.0031349 -3.2691 0.001088 *** UxM 0.0156437 0.0063180 2.4760 0.013326 ** which indicates that manufacturing companies react less to uncertainty since the interaction term $UxM$ is positive and significant. Nonetheless, when I do the regression separately using the two data sets (one for manufacturing companies and one for non-manufacturing) I get the opposite result (note that in this case, I do not need the interaction term so my equation is $ Invest_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 U_t + \beta_2 X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t} $: Manufacturing firms: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) U -0.0092903 0.0048826 -1.9027 0.0573272 * Non-Manufacturing firms: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) U -0.0046793 0.0032443 -1.4423 0.149320 Clearly, these results (separate regressions for each group) contradicts the results when I use the interaction term: these results suggest that Uncertainty correlates only with investment for manufacturing firms while not for non-manufacturing ones. Any ideas, suggestions of why this might be? might this be due to the fixed effects?
