In model 2, the intercept represents the mean response when all covariates are set to zero...Because zero are presumably implausible values for those height and weight, looking at the mean response when height=weight=0 is extrapolating well beyond the scope of your data. Because height and weight are negatively associated with the outcome variable in your sample, this extrapolation results in a very large intercept (which should convince you of the dangers of extrapolation). In model 1 the intercept estimate effectively averages over the sample values of height and weight, rather than quantifying the mean when those two variables (and the others) are zero. I suggest you center height and weight (and maybe the other predictors). When you do that, the intercept represents the mean response when those predictors are set to their means, which has a more natural interpretation (and doesn't change the overall fit of the model in any way).
