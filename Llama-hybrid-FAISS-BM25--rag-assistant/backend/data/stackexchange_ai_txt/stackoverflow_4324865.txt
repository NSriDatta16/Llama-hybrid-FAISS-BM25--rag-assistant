my.cnf changing datadir, 2days and still no luck

Hi i have been trying this for hours upon hours, this forum is my last resort sfter googling hundreds of pages. PROBLEM: Sorry for the length but i am supplying in detail of what i have tried I have set up mysql and its working fine, i now need to change the data-storage to point at my External HD. With mac osx there is no default my.cnf so i copied my-huge.cnf from /usr/local/mysql-5.1.53-osx10.6-x86/support-files, now if it makes any odds i also have a 'mysql' folder in local also. when i place and rename my-huge.cnf into /etc i renamed it to my.cnf like instructed, it works as normal if i dont add a datadir field which looks like this datadir= /Volumes/Elements/database, i have also copied my old data to my new location using sudo cp -R -p /var/lib/mysql /Volumes/Elements/database Everything workds fine unless i add the field datadir = /Volumes/Elements/database to the my.cnf file, if i do i get the error ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2) my.cnf file looks like the following Macintosh-100:support-files seanf$ cd /etc Macintosh-100:etc seanf$ sudo nano my.cnf Password: Macintosh-100:etc seanf$ nano my.cnf Macintosh-100:etc seanf$ my.cnf > /Desktop/blah.txt -bash: /Desktop/blah.txt: No such file or directory Macintosh-100:etc seanf$ my.cnf GNU nano 2.0.6 File: my.cnf # Example MySQL config file for very large systems. # # This is for a large system with memory of 1G-2G where the system runs mainly # MySQL. # # You can copy this file to # /etc/my.cnf to set global options, # mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options (in this # installation this directory is /usr/local/mysql/data) or # ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options. # # In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports. # If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program # with the "--help" option. # The following options will be passed to all MySQL clients [client] #password = your_password port = 3306 socket = /tmp/mysql.sock # Here follows entries for some specific programs # The MySQL server [mysqld]l datadir = /Volumes/Elements/database port = 3306 socket = /tmp/mysql.sock skip-locking key_buffer_size = 384M etc.... I hope someone can shed light on this, i have an assignment due and have spent 2 days trying to get this working on my external Also even when mysql is working and i type mysqld i get errors if this is an issue?
