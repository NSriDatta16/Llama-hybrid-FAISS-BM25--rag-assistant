Android: creating a search, collecting values from different actvities

Iam about to create a search, But the point here is that Iam going to collect values from different activities, maybe I will store them in a keyvalue, Where can I store the keyvalue object so I can reach from every activity without sending to eachother all the time? okej, well iam going to store values, so i can sent to my service so it returns requested items (it means I will create a search) Property Name ID Selected Name For example: Proberty : Location selectedID = 36 selectedName = New York By the way, I guess I can't use keyvaluepairs, what can I use if I have three rows as in my case?
