I would really advice against reading legacy code (which it is). Ruby has changed much since Rails was released and many core features in Ruby (including lambdas, blocks and OO) changed much since. Instead, try fixing yourself a random gem on github or buy the PickAxe (was only $10 on pragprog last time I checked), in both you can find excellent documentation and examples. Hope that helps!
