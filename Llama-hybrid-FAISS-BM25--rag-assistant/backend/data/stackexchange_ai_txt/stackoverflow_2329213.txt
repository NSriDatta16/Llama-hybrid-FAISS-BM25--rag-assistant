The main issue with sessions is not the disabled cookies. The main argument against sessions is that they make your app stateful. Stateless services have some advantages. The related argument is performance: sessions are often the bottleneck for sites under high load, they make it harder to use caching and imply reading or writing to storage for each request. It is fine to use sessions when they are needed but it is better to avoid them if you can.
