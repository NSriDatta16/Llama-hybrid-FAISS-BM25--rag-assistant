There is no built-in support in Visual Studio for this type of operation (at least for managed languages). The .PDB and .EXE files are created at the same time and have no option for embedding. I'm not even sure the .EXE format supports embedding PDB symbols although I could be wrong on this point. The only course I can see is embedding the PDB as a resource in th e .EXE. However that would have to be a post build step since the two are built at the same time. And there is the potential for invalidating parts of the PDB if you modify the EXE after it's been built. Is there a particular reason you're trying to do this? I'm imagining it's going to end up causing you a lot of pain as 1) it's not supported AFAIK and 2) the tool chain is geared towards looking for PDB in the same directory not within the .EXE. Deploying 2 files is a bit annoying at first but it's how its done at this point.
