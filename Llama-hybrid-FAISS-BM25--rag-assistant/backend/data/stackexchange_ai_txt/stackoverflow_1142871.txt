Is there a chart that displays browser usage in different sectors, for instance local authorities?

I'm a frontend web developer working for a company at the moment that has a lot of RIA design going on in the backend but it also caters almost entirely for UK local authorities and social workers. For those of you not too enlightened about local authorities/councils here in the UK, they tend to be rather slow on the uptake of new technologies, and therefore this clashes slightly with the cutting edge the company is trying to purvey. Therefore, it would be helpful for information about how browser usage is broken down in all sectors (since I also freelance) to give me an idea of how much leverage I have to hand in convincing the suits not to support IE6.
