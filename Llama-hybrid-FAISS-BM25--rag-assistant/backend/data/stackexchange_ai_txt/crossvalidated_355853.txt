Looking to see if random sample is uniform or not

I've been tracking data and I am looking to see if it is truly uniformly random. The scenario is there can be a grid of 35 colour tiles with 5 different colours (Blue, Green, Purple, Red and Yellow). So in theory over time you should see an average of 7 tiles per each colour. I have collected a sample size of 112 grids and here is the average of each colour: B - 7.053571 G - 7.098214 P - 6.633929 R - 7.223214 Y - 6.991071 Is the sample size large enough? I'm curious to why purple is coming up so low but need to know if statistically if it is random or not? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards, Paul
