You can try curl use --form-string to pass form data to server (1) curl --form-string "book_key=BOOK1234" --form-string "author=Gandhi" -X PUT 'http://localhost:3000/api/show_all_books_of_a_particular_author?params1=value1&param2=value2' In the controller you will get params['book_key']=BOOK1234 and params["author"]="Gandhi" use -F "document=@test.doc;type=application/msword;" (2) curl -F "document=@my_experiments_with_truth.pdf;type=application/pdf;" --form-string "author=Gandhi" --form-string "email=joe@mymail.com" -X PUT 'http://localhost:3000/api/submit_a_pdf_book?params1=value1&param2=value2' In the controller you will get params['email]="joe@mymail.com" and params["author"]="Gandhi" and params["document"] = "File(object)" . This works only if test.doc is in current directory . Dont forget to pass mime-type as the server may take it as "application octet-stream" and need to write to code to handle this seperately.
