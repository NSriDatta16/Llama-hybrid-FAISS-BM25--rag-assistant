As the market is in desperate need of people, and there are plenty of people with absolutely no formal training and no background in statistics, you are already perfectly qualified to spin this hype wheel and call yourself a "data scientist", too. I'm not kidding. Just do some free online courses and you'll likely see that you can do all they ask for. Data science is about buzzword bingo, not about being smart at statistics not good at coding (unfortunately). If you don't want to feel like an impostor, I suggest the following: find some important algorithm still missing from the big toolkits such as sklearn, R, Weka, ELKI. Implement it, and contribute it to some open-source toolkit . Then you can call yourself an "sklearn contributor" in your resume, which puts you ahead of 90% of self-proclaimed data scientists. What could make you a more proven data scientist / machine learner than having written code used by other data scientists / machine learners?
