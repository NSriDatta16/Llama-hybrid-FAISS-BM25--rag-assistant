In general, no -- state is not preserved between requests in a browser. When you navigate between pages, the first page is completely unloaded (DOM, Javascript variables, etc.) and the second page is then loaded. There are some ways that you can preserve data outside of Javascript without hitting the server though, such as cookies, or HTML5's localstorage as Chris mentioned.
