If you can control the other alert views, check the visible property for each of them. In iOS 6 or before, when an alert appears, it will be moved to a _UIAlertOverlayWindow. Therefore, a pretty fragile method is to iterate through all windows and check if there's any UIAlertView subviews. for (UIWindow* window in [UIApplication sharedApplication].windows) { NSArray* subviews = window.subviews; if ([subviews count] > 0) if ([[subviews objectAtIndex:0] isKindOfClass:[UIAlertView class]]) return YES; } return NO; This is undocumented as it depends on internal view hierarchy, although Apple cannot complain about this. A more reliable but even more undocumented method is to check if [_UIAlertManager visibleAlert] is nil . These methods can't check if a UIAlertView from SpringBoard is shown.
