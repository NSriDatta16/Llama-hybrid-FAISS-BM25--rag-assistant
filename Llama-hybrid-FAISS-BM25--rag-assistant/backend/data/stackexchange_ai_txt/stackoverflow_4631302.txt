go and get a virtual machine player and have functionnal virtual machines for each OS you will test. Execute the same unitary test scenarii on all the virtual machines. Don't hesitate to focuss on what may be implemented differently on each plateform: Save/Load dialogs Remote communication Drag'n'Drop that's what come to my mind, there maybe thousands of other issues. Anything really really low level (with inline asm code for eample) may be impacted by OS change.
