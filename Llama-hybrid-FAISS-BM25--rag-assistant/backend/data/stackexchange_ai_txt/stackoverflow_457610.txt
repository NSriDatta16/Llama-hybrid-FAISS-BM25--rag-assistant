Execute your code repeatedly. The problem seems to be that your code executes a lot faster than the granularity of your measuring instrument. The simplest solution to this is to execute your code many, many times (thousands, maybe millions) and then calculate the average execution time. Edit: Also, due to the nature of current optimizing compilers (and Virtual Machines such as the CLR and the JVM) it can be very misleading to measure the execution speed of single lines of code, since the measurement can influence the speed quite a lot. A much better approach would be to profile the entire system (or at least larger blocks) and check where the bottlenecks are.
