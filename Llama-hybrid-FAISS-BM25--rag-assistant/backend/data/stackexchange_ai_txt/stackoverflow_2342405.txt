From this paper Unlike standard collaborative filtering, Collaborative Quality Filtering (CQF) systems do not create personal recommendations for users. Instead, they use individual reviews to estimate the underlying quality of the item being reviewed. Clearly, collaborative quality filtering is less useful for items where peopleâ€™s tastes tend to differ, such as movies, books, and music. However, for items where there is agreement about what constitutes quality, it can be a more accurate method of estimating quality than the simple or Bayesian means in common use today. Thats a specific usage but IMO it is enough to show the difference between them.
