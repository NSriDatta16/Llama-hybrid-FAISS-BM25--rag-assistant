Can I have a neural network output values >100?

All the samples and articles i have seen are all having outputs of 1 or less. Is there a hidden reason why no one is using NN to produce higher value integers?? My situation is that I want NN to predict the exact outcome value rather than a -1 If I have a NN with say 4 inputs and 1 output with Round 1 Input: 51,22,35,43 Output: 847 Round 2 Input: 25,31,46,29 Output: 761 I want Round n Input: 51,33,19,27 Output: ??? (expected value) I have read that GA is better in training NN but few examples have been provided to guide beginners like me. Am yet to see a detailed article on how to get this done. Using same example above, if i get the (near) best weights from first evolution using Round 1 error value, do i add the weight as parents in the next generation for Round 2?? How do i ensure that the best chromosome from previous rounds don't die after that generation. Links to existing articles and detailed explanation will be very much appreciated. Thanks.
