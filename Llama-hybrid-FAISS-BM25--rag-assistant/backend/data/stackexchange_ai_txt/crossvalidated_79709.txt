"Statistically significant" means that something could have just happened randomly, but it is unlikely. Instead, there is much more likely that there is some kind of cause. You should make this more concrete with an example that is relevant to your client, since that explanation is so abstract. For example, if the lawyer Anne won many more cases on average than Bill, this could have just happened randomly. However, if Anne won a statistically significant more cases then it is much more likely that there is something that could help to explain why Anne has won more cases than Bill. We don't know the cause. Perhaps Anne is a better lawyer or Bill purposely chooses cases that are more difficult.
