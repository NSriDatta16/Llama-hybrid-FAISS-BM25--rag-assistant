Ok so I am answering my own question, just in case anyone has the same issue. Status.all(:joins => :users, :select => "statuses.*, count(users.id) as users_count", :group => "statuses.id") This returns every status that has users and the count of the users as users_count. In order to further refine the query and only count users that belong to a certain organization the query changes to this. Status.all(:joins => :users, :select => "statuses.*, count(users.id) as users_count", :conditions => {:users => {:organization_id => ORG_ID_HERE}}, :group => "statuses.id") I hope this helps anyone with the same issue and thanks to Eimantas, and Ryan Bates(RailCasts).
