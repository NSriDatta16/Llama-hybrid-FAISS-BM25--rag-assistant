mysql: find highest average score

I've written a query that pulls out the average score per player who was in inning 4: SELECT batsmen.player_id, AVG(score) FROM batsmen WHERE batsmen.inning_no=4 GROUP BY player_id; But now I need to find the highest average score. obviously i could look at the output, orderby and easily see the highest average, but i would like a query that pulls it out for me. I assume somehow i need to use SELECT MAX(score); with the result set received in my avg query above. Do I need to join/subquery? Thanks Theresa
