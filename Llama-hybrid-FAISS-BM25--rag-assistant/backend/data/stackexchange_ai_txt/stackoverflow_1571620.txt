SSIS Package runs from Windows, but fails when run from SQL Agent jobs

I have a SSIS package (exports some database tables --> CSV file) After creation of this package, I can run the package from Visual Studio or just by clicking it. But it fails if i add to execute this package as a SQL Agent Job scheduled at some arbitrary time of a day. Pointers needed if i have to configure anything related to Permissions/Command line args ?? Thanks in advance
