Causal inference using regression for multiple covariates

I am reading lot of material regarding Causal Inference using Regression Analysis but I am unable to resolve my doubt. Suppose I have a data with Outcome Y , Treatment Tr and covariates X1, X2, X3, X4, .... I need to find Average Treatment Effect using Regression Analysis for my data. with three model. First with only outcome and treatment model1-> lm(Y~Tr, data) Second with outcome, treatment, and covariates model2-> lm(Y~Tr+X1+X2+X3+X4+...., data) Third with outcome, treatment, covariates and Interaction between covariates and treatment model3-> lm(Y~Tr+X1+X2+X3+X4+....+X1*Tr + X2*Tr + X3*Tr + X4*Tr +......, data) I know for model1 Average treatment effect(ATE) is coefficient of Tr in the model1 . For model2 I think ATE is still coefficient of Tr in the model2 . But I am not sure. I am really confused what will be the ATE in our third model i.e. model3
