Organizing files in tar bz2 file with python

I have about 200,000 text files that are placed in a bz2 file. The issue I have is that when I scan the bz2 file to extract the data I need, it goes extremely slow. It has to look through the entire bz2 file to fine the single file I am looking for. Is there anyway to speed this up? Also, I thought about possibly organizing the files in the tar.bz2 so I can instead have it know where to look. Is there anyway to organize files that are put into a bz2? More Info/Edit: I need to query the compressed file for each textfile. Is there a better compression method that supports such a large number of files and is as thoroughly compressed?
