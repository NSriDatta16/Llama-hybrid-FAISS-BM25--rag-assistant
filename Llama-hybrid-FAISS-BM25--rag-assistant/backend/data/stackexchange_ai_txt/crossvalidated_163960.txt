(1) When the true sampling distributions are asymmetric, then applying a symmetric confidence interval based on the mean and the variance of that distribution leads to uneven coverage. Instead of missing 5% on each tail for a 90% CI, you would get 3% on one tail and 12% on the other tail, with the actual coverage lower than the nominal. (2) All asymptotic statistics have finite sample biases. Unfortunately for the likelihood based methods, these biases tend to go on the side of lowering the standard errors relative for what they would need to be. The area of statistics that studies these subtleties is called "higher order asymptotics" or "second order asymptotics" (the first order being the asymptotic normal distribution that many ML estimates follow under "standard" conditions). Maybe this could help, too: Obtaining any Wald statistic you want .
