I'm assuming you're using Bash. It sounds to me like the key bindings have gotten messed up for some reason. If you do this command: bind -p|grep -i '"[pE]"' you should get this result: "E": self-insert "e": self-insert "P": self-insert "p": self-insert If the entries for "P" and "e" are missing then try these commands. bind '"e":self-insert' bind '"P":self-insert' Obviously, you can't type the characters, so type their opposite-case version, press left-arrow, then press Alt-u to upcase the small "p" or Alt-l (that's a lower-case "ell") to downcase the capital "E" (you will need to do this for each "e" in the first command). If that works, check the ~/.inputrc file for invalid keybindings. Also, check your startup files such as ~/.bashrc , etc. The issue is likely to be with missing or misplaced quotation marks and it may be for a key binding for something like \eP which, by default, is bound to the readline function do-lowercase-version .
