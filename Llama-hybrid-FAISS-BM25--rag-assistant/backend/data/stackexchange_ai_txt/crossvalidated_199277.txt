Seasonality tests

I have data which I need to check for seasonality. Now I found two methods to do this, the autocorrelation plot and the rank Von Neumann ratio. Now I found the autocorrelation has some requirements: Data should be normally distributed or be reasonably symmetrical There has to be 8 to 10 available data points The data shouldn't contain outliers Since my data is all between 0 and 4 and discrete, my data isn't normally distributed (it's Poisson) so I'm not able to use the autocorrelation. However, I found the following requirement for the rank Von Neumann ratio. Check that the data are not autocorrelated. What do they mean I should do if I can't check autocorrelation because I have no normal distribution? Are there other tests available which I could use with my data? I have 26 monthly data points, Poisson distributed. Edit: To clear it up. I have data of the last 26 months. This data differs between 40 and 160. This data is divided in 4 categories, with in each category between 6 and 50 groups, with a total of 100+ groups. I need to do forecasts on group-level. I found graphically that there may be seasonal influences on the pooled data, but since the group-level data is mostly 0 and 1, there probably isn't any seasonality (or trend). To support this assumption I want(ed) to do formal tests to test the seasonality and trend.
