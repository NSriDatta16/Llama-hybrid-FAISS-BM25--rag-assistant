How do you elegantly program ASP.NET MVC when the View needs more than one Model?

A View accepts one Model. But I need to draw HTML input controls for two models. An example will illustrate: I have a screen where I add Employees. After adding their first name, last name and so on, I need the user to choose a number of Companies the Employees could be in. The Companies are in one table. The Employees are in another. And a linking table joins them. So it seems I need to pass the Companies to the View. Can I pass multiple models to the view? Or do I have to do an ugly database lookup in the View to find the Companies and manually spit out HTML for checkboxes without HTML helpers?
