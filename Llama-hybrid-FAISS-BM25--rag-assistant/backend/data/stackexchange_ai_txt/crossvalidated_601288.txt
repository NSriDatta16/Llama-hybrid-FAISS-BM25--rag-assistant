How to report the results of a binomial logistic regression?

I am currently trying to understand how temperature influences the hatching success (no of eggs hatching) of two species of insect. As a result I have attempted to run a binomial logistic regression with temperature (factor: 5 levels 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degrees Celsius), species (factor: 2 levels HA and AP) and the interaction between them as independent variables. The dependent variable is the proportion of eggs that hatched. Here is my model and model output: eggmodelA Call: glm(formula = cbind(No.hatched, No.eggs.added - No.hatched) ~ Temperature * Species, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = eggto1st) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Dev Df Deviance Pr(>Chi) 1 0 0.0 2 4 5520.1 -4 -5520.1 This led me to plot the interaction using the emmip() function in the package emmeans and conduct pairwise comparisons between species (within each temperature) and between temperatures (within each species). The results for the between temperature comparisons are as follows: #Effect of temperature Within.species Species = AP: Temperature prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group 32 0.324 0.0353 Inf 0.259 0.396 a 26 0.468 0.0423 Inf 0.386 0.551 ab 29 0.580 0.0388 Inf 0.503 0.654 b 20 0.661 0.0633 Inf 0.528 0.772 b 23 0.884 0.0385 Inf 0.785 0.941 c Species = HA: Temperature prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL .group 32 0.212 0.0283 Inf 0.161 0.272 a 29 0.503 0.0368 Inf 0.431 0.574 b 23 0.718 0.0534 Inf 0.603 0.810 c 26 0.733 0.0344 Inf 0.661 0.795 c 20 0.804 0.0531 Inf 0.679 0.888 c Confidence level used: 0.95 Intervals are back-transformed from the logit scale P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 5 estimates Tests are performed on the log odds ratio scale significance level used: alpha = 0.05 Would anyone be able to tell me how should I report the results of this analysis. Which parameters should I include and are there any that I am missing that I would need to report these results properly? Also, do I need to report the results for the main effects if the interaction is significant?
