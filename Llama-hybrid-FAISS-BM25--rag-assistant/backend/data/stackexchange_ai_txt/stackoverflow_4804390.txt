Your string is not JSON, it is JSON-in-Script. Notice the fragment that says: YAHOO.Finance.SymbolSuggest.ssCallback(...) When a browser receives the above mentioned script (actually a javascript code) it will call the YAHOO.Finance.SymbolSuggest.ssCallback function, passing the JSON data as the argument. You did not mention if you want to access the JASON data on the server side or client? It its server side (PHP) then you can use regular expressions or string replacement functions to extract the portion you like. The you can use json_decode() function to convert the resulting string into an associative array. Edit ---- A quick and dirty hack for converting JSONP to JSON: ResultSet->Result[0]); var_dump($data->ResultSet->Result[0]->symbol); var_dump($data->ResultSet->Result[0]->name); # etc etc ?>
