Load your project in Visual Studio. Connect your Phone. At the top select Windows Phone 7 Device (instead of Emulator). Press F5. Now you're debugging. You can set breakpoints if you want to debug that way, or you can log whatever your want to the output window via Debug.WriteLine(). If you want to log to a file, you can write your own logger that writes data to Isolated Storage. There is a hacky, non-supported way to get this data off the phone, or you can just add the functionality to your app to view the log.
