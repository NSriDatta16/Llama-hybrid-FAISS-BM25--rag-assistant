The first thing you can do is, for example, interpret $\hat{\beta_2}$ as the estimated effect of $sex$ on the logit of the quantile you're looking at. $\exp\{\hat{\beta_2}\}$, similarly to "classic" logistic regression, is the odds ratio of median (or any other quantile) outcome in males versus females. The difference with "classic" logistic regression is how the odds are calculated: using your (bounded) outcome instead of a probability. Besides, you can always look at the predicted quantiles according to one covariate. Of course you have to fix (condition on) the values of the other covariates in your model (like you did in your example). By the way, the transformation should be $\log(\frac{y-y_{min}}{y_{max}-y})$. (This is not really intended to be an answer, as it's just a (poor) rewording of what it's written in this paper , that you cited yourself. However, it was too long to be a comment and someone who doesn't have access to on-line journals could be interested anyway).
