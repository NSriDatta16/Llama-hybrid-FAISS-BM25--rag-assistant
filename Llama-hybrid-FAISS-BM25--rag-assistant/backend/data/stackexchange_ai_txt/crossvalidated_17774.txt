What is the probability of a team winning many golf tournaments when conducted with handicaps (i.e., has sandbagging occurred)?

For non golfers, each golfer has a handicap based on his scoring history. The handicap predicts, on average, how many shots above par that golfer will take to play 18 holes. In theory, when that golfer plays in a handicap tournament against other golfers with their respective handicaps, he should have the same chance as all of the golfers of winning. Some golfers are known to avoid putting in their low scores which in turn keeps their handicap high and gives them an unfair advantage in a tournament. Golfers call this sandbagging. I play in a tournament where one team won 5 out of 7 years and a second team won 3 out of 4 years. What are the odds of that happening? There are 40 teams in each tournament.
