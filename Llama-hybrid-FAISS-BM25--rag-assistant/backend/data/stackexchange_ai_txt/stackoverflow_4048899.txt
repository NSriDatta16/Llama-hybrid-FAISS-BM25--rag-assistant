If you know the exact path, try as a test temporarily skipping the getExternalStorageDirectory() and just hard coding the path, and see if it works. Then try using the function to discover the directory but write the discovered path name to logcat and see if it is as expected. Beware that the Samsung Galaxy handles this a bit differently from other android devices, in that the function does not return the path to the removable sdcard. Also the path name that is returned will be different between froyo and earlier versions - the reason you call the function is for protection from changes like that. (I assume you have write external storage permission in this application, and not just in something else that did the download)
