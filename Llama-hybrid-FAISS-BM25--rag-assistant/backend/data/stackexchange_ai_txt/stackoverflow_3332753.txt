Desktop Icon link

I would like to know if there is an option of setting an auto icon link of my application in the user's desktop, after installing it? The only way I know to do it, is that the user could drag it manually to his desktop from the applications list. Is there any way of doing it automaticlly for the user(withouth his touch) ? Thanks, Moshic.
