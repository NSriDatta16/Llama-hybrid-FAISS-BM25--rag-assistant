Finding the degree of separation between two people in a social network is just a special case of finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. The most common approach is Dijkstra's algorithm , but see also a longer discussion of the Shortest path problem . In addition, by running an All-pairs shortest path algorithm, you could find out the minimum, maximum, and average number of degrees of separation for the entire network.
