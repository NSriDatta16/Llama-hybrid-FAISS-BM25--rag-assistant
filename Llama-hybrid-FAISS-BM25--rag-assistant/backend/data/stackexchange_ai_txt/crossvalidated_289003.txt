Interpreting the coefficients when predictors are standarised

Let's say I have a model of the form: mdl I am interested in knowing the relationship between x3 and y when x1 and x2 remain unchanged. To do this, I do the following: dat$x1 If I interpret mean(pred) correctly, it represents average change in y with a unit change in x3 while keeping x2 and x1 constant. Please correct me if I am wrong. Now imagine a second model where x1 , x2 and x3 are standardised. dat$z.x1 This is where my question is. Does mean(pred.z) has the same interpretation as mean(pred) in the previous model? Can mean(pred.z) be interpreted as mean change in y with a unit change in x3 while keeping x2 and x1 constant. OR Does mean(pred.z) represent mean change in y when x3 changes by one standard deviation since I had standardised x3 in this model? Thank you
