Tests should be maintained in separate projects because you don't want to deploy testing code to a production environment. For a single-project solution, one test project is probably sufficient. Internally, a test project can be organized in any way you find convenient, as long as it's consistent. An ASP.NET MVC test project might have a ControllerTests folder with one test .cs file per controller, mirroring the MVC project structure to some degree. This makes the tests easy to find and relate to the code they're testing.
