Given what you wrote, I would use a multivariate mixed effects model with two levels of random effects. The simplest model would have a slope and intercept. Subject id is nested within twin id. There is variability between twins and variability within twins. There are two packages I have seen on cran to fit multivariate mixed effects models. First, MMeM . Unfortunately, it says "Currently, it only supports multivariate mixed effects model with one fixed effects and one random effects and two response variates". You have two response variates, but you need more than one fixed effect and more than one random effect. Also, you want two levels of random effects, which this doesn't allow. The second package is MCMCglmm . See this vignette . It says "More than one response variable can be analysed simultaneously, and these variables are allowed to follow Gaussian, Poisson, multi(bi)nominal, exponential, zero-inflated and censored distributions. A range of variance structures are permitted for the random effects, including interactions with categorical or continuous variables (i.e., random regression), and more complicated variance structures that arise through shared ancestry, either through a pedigree or through a phylogeny". Also, see this previous question here and the answer points to this which has an example using MCMCglmm.
