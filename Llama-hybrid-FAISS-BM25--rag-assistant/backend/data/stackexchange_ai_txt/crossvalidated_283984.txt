Dangers of TF-DIF on different languages First of all, as stressed by @Roosh a TF-IDF on documents having documents in different languages seems to be a bad idea to me. Imagine the case where two languages do not share the same alphabet (like Japanese and English). In the TF-IDF embedding, they will leave on different axises. And the same thing would happen for language who do not share (m)any words (like French and German). So my first impression is that unsupervised clustering on documents in different languages will create clusters mostly related to the languages themselves. Another approach Therefore you may want to use a different embedding than TFIDF. Word2Vec (described in Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality ) has been applied with two different languages simultaneously: Joint word2vec Networks for Bilingual Semantic Representations
