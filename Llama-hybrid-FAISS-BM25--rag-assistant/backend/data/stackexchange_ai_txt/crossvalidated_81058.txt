How to handle leverage values?

I have a dataset with 1747 observations. Outcome variable is categorical, while independent variables are continuous, so I decided to use logistic regression for my analysis. I built the model using backward elimination algorithm, and resulting model seemed to be quite stable. Checking VIF values provided very good results, less than 5% of residuals were large and DFBeta values are less than 1. However, 76 cases were identified as large leverage values (only one of them as large residual as well). When I remove these cases, results are somewhat different. What would be the best approach to handle these values?
