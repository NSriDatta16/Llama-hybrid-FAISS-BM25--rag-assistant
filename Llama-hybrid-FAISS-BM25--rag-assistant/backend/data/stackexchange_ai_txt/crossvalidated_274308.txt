How do I estimate the contribution of each kernel in the prediction of the Gaussian Process?

Assume that I have a gaussian regression problem, where I have a covariance function K that is estimated based on two kernels K1 and K2. For example K1 is a squared exponential kernel, and K2 is a periodic kernel. How can I know the contribution of each kernel on the prediction of the gaussian process? The solution to this question is presented in Figures 5.7 and 5.8 in: C. E. Rasmussen & C. K. I. Williams, Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, the MIT Press, 2006, ISBN 026218253X. c 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (free online) but the authors didn't explain how did they come up with these figures. This is not a programming question nor a question about the book's specific example. I am interested in learning how do I estimate the influence of each component of the covariance function K on the prediction since it is extremely helpful in the inference, understanding, and interpretation of the gaussian process regression model.
