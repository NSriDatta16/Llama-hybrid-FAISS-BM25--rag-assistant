Poisson regression for time series data?

I collected citation data on four scholars for two time-points. For this I selected different types of literature (journal articles, encyclopedias, etc.). I would therefore state, that the data I have are a sample. The data is as follows: library(dplyr) library(rstanarm) my_dat # A tibble: 8 x 3 #> year person n #> #> 1 1970 A 102 #> 2 2010 A 80 #> 3 1970 B 138 #> 4 2010 B 128 #> 5 1970 C 158 #> 6 2010 C 81 #> 7 1970 D 174 #> 8 2010 D 202 Now I would like to assess with what plausibility I could state, that each of those scholars either was more important in 2010 or less important, measured by citation counts. Since the data come from a sample, I don't want to simply plot the points with lines and state: "Scholar B is a bit less relevant, since the citation count decreased." I'd like to make a statement like this: "Given the data (and the model, see below), we can be very confident that scholar C was cited less often, and quite confident that scholar D was cited more often." I thought, I could model these data with a poisson regression like the following: mod1 trying deprecated constructor; please alert package maintainer I would sample from the posterior and plot it like this. But I suspect, I could be completely wrong in what I'm doing: I'm not taking into account, that the data come from a time series. I'm not sure, if those 8 data-points warrant a model like this, and whether or not the specification without intercept creates problems on its own. If I'm completely off with this approach: how could I measure/display the uncertainty in the direction and magnitude of the change frome 1970 to 2010?
