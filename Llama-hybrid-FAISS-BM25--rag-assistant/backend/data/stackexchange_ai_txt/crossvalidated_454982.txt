I don’t believe the Confidence Interval is giving you what you think. It doesn’t say that there is an XX % probability that any particular measurement is within the CI. It says that, if you repeated the entire process of forming the CI a large number of times, the correct true mean is within XX % of the intervals formed. To be able to say a single (future) measurement is within a particular range, you want to form a Prediction Interval. Or, if you want to to say a certain proportion of all future measurements are within a certain range, then you want a Tolerance Interval. Or, if you want to become a Bayesian, you can form a Posterior Predictive Interval.
