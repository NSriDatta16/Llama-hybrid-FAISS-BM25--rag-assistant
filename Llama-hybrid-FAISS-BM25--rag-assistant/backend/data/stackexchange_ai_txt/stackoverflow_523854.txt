If you mean a class that inherits from System.ComponentModel.Component , like for example the System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource and strongly-typed DataSets, this will allow to drag an instance on the Visual Studio design surface (on a form in design-time) and set some properties using the property grid. Once there is an instance of such component on the form it is discoverable by other components/controls. For example a BindingSource can be selected as a data source for a grid view or some other control.
