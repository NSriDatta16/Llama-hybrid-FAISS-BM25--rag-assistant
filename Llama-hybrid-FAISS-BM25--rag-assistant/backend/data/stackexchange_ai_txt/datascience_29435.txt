Can colors be detected using Neural Nets?

How do I represent a color as an activation value within a neuron? ( might be off-topic) I want to detect colors Using Neural Nets In my Knowledge any activation function which is generally used will push the values in between 0-1 which isn't of any use to me... Just wondering how Windows 10 decides on the theme color change when we switch themes.. (led me to think about this or its just simple averaging on pixel values of the channels?) So seems like an impossible task for Neural Nets then?
