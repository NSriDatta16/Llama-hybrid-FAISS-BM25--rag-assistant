I agree with others that it sounds like you may need someone to help you analyze this data, because what I am going to suggest is not likely something that can be undertaken by a novice. Having said that - depending how many repeated measures you have, a good approach for this data may be longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Conceptually, HLM allows you to estimate all the effects it seems like you are interested in 1) the trajectories of change for your variables, for both individuals and in aggregate (HLM allows for the estimation of the 'average; change trajectory and also the variability of individuals around that average change); 2) the effects of person level variables on the individual change trajectories, for example the effects of sex or age; and 3) the effects of a time-varying covariate (suicidality over time) on your outcome (I am not clear about your hypothesis so I am guessing that what you mean is how changes in one variable effect the observed changes in the other). HLM would do all these things for you, and also allow you to ask questions about non-linear change in your outcome. HTH.
