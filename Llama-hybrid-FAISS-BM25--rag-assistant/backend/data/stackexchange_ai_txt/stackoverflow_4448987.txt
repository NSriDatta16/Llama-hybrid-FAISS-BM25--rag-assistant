Does it matter on which control you call the DoDragDrop method?

I'm wondering if it makes any difference on which control I call the DoDragDrop method in a Windows Forms Application. I have a Form with two PictureBox controls. One can be dragged and the other one has its AllowsDrop property set to true. The MouseDown event handler for the draggable PictureBox is as follows: private void dragPictureBox_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (sender is PictureBox) { var pictureBox = (PictureBox) sender; var effect = pictureBox.DoDragDrop( pictureBox.Image, DragDropEffects.All); MessageBox.Show("Drag ended in a " + effect); } } But in stead of calling DoDragDrop on the pictureBox, I seems like I can use any control, for instance the Form itself var effect = this.DoDragDrop(pictureBox.Image, DragDropEffects.All); or even var effect = label1.DoDragDrop(pictureBox.Image, DragDropEffects.All); Does it make any difference on which control I call the DoDragDrop method? And if so, what's the difference?
