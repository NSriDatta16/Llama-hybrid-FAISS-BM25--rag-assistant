I maintain the Fetcher plugin for download email from an IMAP server which I use with cron. I used to use a daemon but that was tough to keep running (even with monit) because Ruby would hang. Cron is OK for my workload but it does spawn a Rails process once a minute. For processing attachments, check out the MMS2R library. It has a nice interface for getting the files out of an email. The other approach I've had recommended to me is to fire off an HTTP post for each message received. Then you can scale your web tier to handle it. Shameless plug: you may want to check out Mike Mondragon and my PeepCode book on receiving email with Ruby .
