Instead of doing what you're planning, consider grouping the functions in some logical manner and namespace the groups. You'd have an object that holds objects that holds functions and call like this: serial = myApp.common.getSerialNumber(year,month); model = myApp.common.getModelNumber(year); or myApp.effects.blinkText(textId); If you wanted to hide a function or functions per page, I suppose you could null them out by function or group after the load. But hopefully having things organized would satisfy your desire to clean up the global namespace.
