iPhone modal View with parent view semi-visible?

I am adding a modal view using the following code: [self presentModalViewController:phrasesEditor animated:YES]; How can I make the modal view semi-transparent so that the superview "shines" through? My complete method/function looks like this: -(IBAction)showEditPhrases:(id)sender{ PhrasesViewController *phrasesEditor = [[PhrasesViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"PhrasesViewController" bundle:nil]; phrasesEditor.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCrossDissolve; [phrasesEditor.view setAlpha: 0.5]; [phrasesEditor.view setBackgroundColor: [UIColor clearColor]]; [self presentModalViewController:phrasesEditor animated:YES]; [phrasesEditor release]; } EDIT: The pragmatic approach of changing the alpha will not work, apparently. How can I load a NIB into a UIView and interact with it? I have a UIViewController now. Do I convert/modify/change it into a UIVIew and then load it, or am I supposed to do something else? EDIT 2: I tried [self.view addSubview:phrasesEditor.view]; , but that leaves me with no way to remove the subview. Each view seems to have its own View Controller. EDIT 3: I thought that I should mention that the superview is inside of a view controller called iDecideViewController and the phrasesEditor has a separate View Controller.
