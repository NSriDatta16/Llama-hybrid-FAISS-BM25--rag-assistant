Grails - Find by non-native types

I'm very new to grails (day 2). First, I find it hard to find easily browsable resources (the documentation is very raw, and the tutorials are spread out and only show 'hello world' types of examples ). I've set up my domain class with a relationship to other data types. class ShopCategoryPage{ //some stuff ProductProcedure procedure; ProductCategory category; //some stuff } In my controller, I am getting a category id and a procedure id as parameters, and I am trying to get the ShopCategoryPage associated with those parameters. How do I "find" them? I tried passing the ids as procedureId or procedure_id, I tried passing a ProductProcedure object generated by findById ... I'm not sure how to find by a property that is not of native type.
