How to build a threaded Comment System in C#? Help

Im building a Threaded Comment System for a website of mine and I ran into a problem... I have a list PULLED FROM A DATABASE that has a ID field and a Parent ID Field. The parent ID field can be null, but the ID field will NEVER be null. Since this will be a threaded comment system, I organize the list to where the ID is the top one, but if a parent ID exists, then it would be inserted under the ID. Then this can go on for infinity also. So the second level now also has an ID and and I want to insert any item with a parent ID of that ID under it. For example: ---1. Blah --------2. Blah Blah -> ParentID=1 -----------3. Blah Blah -> parentID=2 -------------- 4. Blah Blah ->parentID=3 ----------- 3.Blah Blah -> parentID=2 --------2. Blah Blah -> parentID=1 I think you get the point. So here is what I have so far... List finalList = new List (); for (int i = 0; i It seems to sort it half way, but not truly... The ThreadID is of course how far it gets planted to the right.
