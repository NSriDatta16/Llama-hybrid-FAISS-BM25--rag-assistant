For data persistency, if you're not certain that you must use SQL, you should take a look at alternate data-storage libraries: Prevayler : an in memory database systems, using developing ideas like "crash only components", that make it easy to use and very performatic. May be used even for simple applications where you just need to save some state. It has a BSD License. BerkleyDB Java Edition : a storage system with different layers of abstraction, so one can use it as a basic key-value storage (almost an in-disk hashtable) to a fully transactional ACID system. Take a look at it's licensing information because even some commercial software may use it for free. Be aware that they have trade-offs when compared with each other or with a standard SQL database! And, of course, there may be other similar options around, but these are the ones I know and like. :) PS: I was not allowed to post the respective links because I'm a new user. Just google for them; first hits are the right ones.
