Counter is not single instance, an instance name needs to be specified

In developing a performance monitoring console app, what is passed into the getcategories method?: PerformanceCounter[] pcArr = pc.GetCounters(string instance); When using the no param overload, a runtime exception is thrown: Counter is not single instance, an instance name needs to be specified. Also, how do you decide between a static utility method or an extension method? For example, I may use a certain utility method quite frequently but then it would be best to add that as an extension method so I don't have to reference another assembly all the time. Thanks
