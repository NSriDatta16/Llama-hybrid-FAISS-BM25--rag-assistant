If you objective is purely optimization of VI then without a lot of knowledge on the structure of your data you can't expect to do much better than what standard combinatorial algorithms offer. You can try things like simulated annealing to move across the feature space "intelligently", perhaps. Typically however you want a statistical method to determine which subset of features yield the most informative clustering. The terminology for this problem is unsupervised feature selection. Some popular methods include: Regularization on parameters Zhou, Pan and Shen (2009) , which assumes a Gaussian mixture model. Regularization on feature weights Witten and Tibshirani (2010) , which express clustering criteria as additive in features then regularize the weights assigned to each summand. If your clustering algorithm in already known (and/or the number of clusters) then I worked on a method that is based on Prediction Strength . The idea is to split your data into two halves by rows (observations), call them $X$ (training data) and $Y$ (test data). Then calculate $A^X_{i} = \{x:C_X(x) = i\}$ and $B_{ij} = A^X_i \cap A^Y_j, \: i,j = 1,\ldots,k$ , where $C_X(x)$ is the cluster index the algorithm would assign to a data point $x$ when fit on the data-set $X$ . The $A_i^X$ represent how the training data partitions the feature space space. Therefore $B_{ij}$ represents how much overlap there is between the training set and a test set clustering. If the clustering is extremely stable the overlap will be large, so you search for features that maximize the statistic $\begin{align*} ps(K) &= \mathbf{P}(x_1, x_2 \: \text{in same training cluster} \: | \: x_1,x_2 \:\text{in same test cluster}) \\ &=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^K\frac{\sum_{j=1}^K |B_{ij}|\left(|B_{ij}| - 1\right)}{|A_i^X|\left(|A_i^X| - 1\right)} + o_p(1) \end{align*}$ given the number of clusters $K$ . In practice I sample feature subsets randomly then average to see which features yield the best prediction strength.
