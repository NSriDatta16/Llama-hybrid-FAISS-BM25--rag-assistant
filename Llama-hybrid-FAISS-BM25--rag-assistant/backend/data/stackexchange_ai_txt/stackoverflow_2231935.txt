@Azad I think there are 2 big differences: the first is the ease of use of the VCL that enables you to drag and drop controls on a form (window), change its properties and assign events, giving you high productivity in the development of the GUI. The other big difference is the size of the final application, if you create an application using only WINAPI calls, your final application will be smaller than using the VCL. I recommend you see the project KOL (KOL - Key Objects Library is a set of objects to develop power (but small) 32 bit Windows GUI applications using Delphi but without VCL (or Free Pascal). It is distributed free of charge, with source code.). (source: kolmck.net )
