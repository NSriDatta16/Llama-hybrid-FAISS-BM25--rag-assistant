Since you don't want to use XML, I'd recommend creating your own file format that is text editable. PROPERTIES name = First Level number = 1 END MONSTERS Barbarian pos = (3, 6) health = 2 Dragon pos = (10, 10) health = 8 END and so on so forth for whatever else you need. Creating a parser yourself is really straight forward. Pretty much just read in the file line by line. At the first line, you see the title is PROPERTIES so you then read in properties until you read in the END line. Same thing for any other headers you'd have. There are many ways you can vary this, so you can make the syntax however you want it to be.
