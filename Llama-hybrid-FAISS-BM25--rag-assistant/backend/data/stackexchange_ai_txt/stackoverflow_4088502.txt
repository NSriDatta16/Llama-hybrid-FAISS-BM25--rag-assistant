On my test machine (PHP 5.3.3) I ran 5 runs of 10 million iterations of each and averaged the results. "$x > 2" took 5.7357 seconds while "$x >= 3" took 5.8654. Note this excludes compilation time because compilation occurred only once for these iterations. So "$x > 2" is faster, but barely. I don't understand why, but there you go.
