Do you mean scale to meet increasing demand, or do you mean increase in size to accommodate additional data? With respect to size: you pick the "edition" of the database (web or business) - both have different size limitations. You are billed based on size only. max size is 50gb. Once edition is picked, the capacity will increase up to max allowed to accommodate your data. You do nothing special. With respect to scale to meet performance demands... you are abstracted away from managing really anything that has to do with scalability from SQL Azure perspective... Your database is colocated with other databases on various SQL servers running in MS data center. theoretically your database will be moved to a less-busy server if it becomes too hot... however, SQL Azure is not considered to be highly scalable solution (ie: facebook/twitter quality). If you need mega-scalability, you'll need to go with Azure Table Storage
