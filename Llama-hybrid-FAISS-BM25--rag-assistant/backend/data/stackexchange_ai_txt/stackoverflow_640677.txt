jQuery Magic with hook_form_alter in Drupal

There isn't much tutorial in the Pro Drupal book about ahah, but I'm trying to start off with something simple. I have two content types, 'topic' and 'tips' and categories. The topics are a node reference field in tips. The topics are organized by category. When filling out the form for a tip, I would like the category the topic belongs to appear in a div when select list of topics is chosen. I found a jQuery tutorial, but curious how to use ahah in all of this.
