I believe you need to add the source files to your project (Project/Add to project...), rather than drag and drop the .xcodeproj file. You can uncheck "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" if you just want to reference the files without duplicating them. Be sure to include all the required source files (e.g. sjeng.h etc.). Make sure the files are added to the right Targets in your iPhone project.
