In linear regression, if you center and scale x, the OLS (unregularized) intercept is the mean of y. In some cases, x and y are both centered and scaled; in that rescaled space, the intercept is 0 (which gives an unregularized intercept in the original space). In logistic regression, if you center and scale x, you will still need an intercept. People generally do not penalize the intercept because they want full flexibility of the intercept. If you have prior belief that the intercept should be zero, then penalize it.
