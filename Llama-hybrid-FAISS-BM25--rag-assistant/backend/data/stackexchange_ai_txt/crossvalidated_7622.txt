Random Forest Fast, robust, good accuracy, in most cases nothing to tune, requires no normalization, immune to collinearity, generates quite good error approximation and useful importance ranking as a side effect of training, trivially parallel, predicts in a blink of an eye. Drawbacks: slower than trivial methods like kNN or NB, works best with equal classes, worse accuracy than SVM for problems desperately requiring kernel trick, is a hard black-box, does not make coffee.
