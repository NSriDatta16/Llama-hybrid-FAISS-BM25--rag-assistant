I recommend 'Step by Step Guide to Implementing a Neural Network in C' by John A. Bullinaria. This is very simple walk through on how to implement a multi-layer neural network that's capable of learning how to XOR. The code introduced in the article is in C, which is very easy to understand. Most 'introduction-to-neural-network' articles on the web are Object-Oriented-based and comes in form of reusable libraries, which may make them harder to be understood and get started with.
