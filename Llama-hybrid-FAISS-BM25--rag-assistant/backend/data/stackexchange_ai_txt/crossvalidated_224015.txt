How to implement Bayesian Model Combination?

I'm interested in formal procedure mentioned in "Turning Bayesian Model Averaging Into Bayesian Model Combination" (Kristine Monteith 2011). I have a set of $N$ "best" AIC ranked models and I want to combine forecasts of $n \le N$ models, to do so I need to chose $n$, I also need to chose number of combinations in each diversified ensemble $c \le n$. My question is how to determine "optimal" $n$ and $c$? My goal is to maximize forecasting performance but I do not want to generate overfitted combination.
