The simple answer is: if you can't run it, the best any tool will be able to do is debug compile-time errors. That's even if you have the source. From you description, it is evident that the bug you're trying to root out is a run-time bug (not compile time), so you will have be able to actually run it. If your application cannot run in Windows, than you shoudln't be attempting to debug it from windows. That being said, using something like cygwin, as RageZ has suggested, is probably your best bet. Then just debug the program like you would in linux. HTH
