Create a weight with Principal Component Analysis

There is 50 blog's authors and a a data with three variables $v_1$,$v_2$ and $v_3$ related with these authors. In other words, I have a dataset $D=(x_{ij})_{50\times3}$. I would like to create a weight for each author and I think that I can use PCA. Using the corresponding change of basis matrix $R$, I have $$ R D = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} y_{11} & y_{12} & y_{13} \\ y_{21} & y_{22} & y_{23} \\ . & . & . \\ . & . & . \\ y_{50,1} & y_{50,2} & y_{50,3} \end{array} \right)$$ So, I have two questions a) Can I use the first component of the PCA as weight, i.e, $w =\left( \begin{array}{c} y_{11} \\ y_{21} \\ . \\ . \\ y_{50,1} \end{array} \right)$ b) If YES, what would be the ideal variance of this first component: 80%? If, for example, I obtain 60%, it would be a good index?
