I based this problem on this video by Geoffrey Hinton: A toy example of training an RNN Basically, in order to do binary addition in bit-by-by steps, in order to learn how to carry a 1, a feed-forward neural network needs roughly 10 neurons. A recurrent neural network can do this using only 3 neurons. That is what this example demonstrates.
