Precise pixel movement in Canvas

I am doing some sort of drawing software in WPF, and I have certain visual elements in a Canvas like for example Rectangles and Lines. I have implemented dragging of those elements around the Canvas to move them. The motion must be aligned to pixels, I read WPF uses points and not pixels so it has become a concern of mine to know whether my lines or rectangles are aligned to pixels. I tried using SnapsToPixels, but I'm not sure it will do the trick, or if it will do it when I'm moving the visuals around. Finally, I must implement moving visuals with the keyboard, a single cursor stroke means move the visual exactly one pixel, how can I do this from the code behind? I assume doing something like: Canvas.SetLeft(visual) = Canvas.GetLeft(visual) + 1; Will only add one point to its position, and not one pixel, how can I move exactly one pixel in the Canvas? Thank you very much.
