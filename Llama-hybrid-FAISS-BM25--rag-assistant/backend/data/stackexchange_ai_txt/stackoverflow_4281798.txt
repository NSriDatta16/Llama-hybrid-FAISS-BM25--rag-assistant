How can I drop the text from the list to the specific textinput position (under cursor)?

I know how to drag from list and drop into the textinput control. But I don't know how to insert the text in textinput under the position of the cursor. For example, I have text qwerty in textinput. And I need to drop the word asdf in the textinput. As a result I want to get text qweasdfrty or qasdfwerty , or whatever I want depending on the cursor position. Here is the simplified code of what I already have: Is there any ways to achieve this?
