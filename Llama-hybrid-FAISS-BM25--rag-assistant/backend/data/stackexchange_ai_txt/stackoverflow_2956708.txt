It's quite easy and efficient to use Excel as a reporting tool for Access data. A quick "non programming" approach is to set a List or a Pivot Table, linked to your External Data source. But that's out of scope for Stackoverflow. A programmatic approach can be very simple: strProv = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" & SourceFile & ";" Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection cnn.Open strProv Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset rst.Open strSql, cnn myDestRange.CopyFromRecordset rst That's it !
