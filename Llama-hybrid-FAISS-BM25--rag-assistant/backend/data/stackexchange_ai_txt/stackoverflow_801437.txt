GML usage criteria, or what is the proper way for useing GML (Geography XML)

We want to use GML in our application; It is a GIS based application which simulates the real word objects (i.e. Pipes, Roads, etc) in a virtual reality environment. Currently we draw and store the geometry in AutoCAD DWGs but in future we want to change the Database. I really need to find the answers of these questions. 1- Is GML proper for encoding Geometry file (CAD,Shape,..) That contains more than 100000 features (What is the relation between data Volume and GML performance, is there any limitation?) 2- how can we check the correctness of geometry data, for example how GML Understand that 2 inner Boundaries of a polygon intersect each other, (by Schema? By special Libraries? Or it just validate GML by Schema without check the inner coordinates data) 3-If I want to use a DB, can I store GML data in XML Berkeley Database? Thanks for your Attention
