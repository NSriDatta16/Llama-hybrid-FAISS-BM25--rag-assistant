I wrote a .NET application where memory usage is growing over time. As a test, I set it up to download 800 * 5K (average) size files and doing XML transform and using DTComcontroller to generate manifest, inside 1 hour with an interval of 15 Minutes. During a period of about 5 hours, memory usage grows from 35M to about 70M. Is that a problem? If not (i.e. enough memory) that may be the reason. The GC only works when memory starts getting scarce. 70mb is also very low in general IMHO.
