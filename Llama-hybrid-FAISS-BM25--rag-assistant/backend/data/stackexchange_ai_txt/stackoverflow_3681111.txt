Your structure is being padded. The 04 08 is a garbage value from your stack. You need to use whatever feature your compiler provides to pack the structure. In most cases you should be able to use #pragma pack(1) : #pragma pack(1) // ensure structure is packed typedef struct { . . . } BITMAPFILEHEADER; #pragma pack(0) // restore normal structure packing rules You can read about data structure padding on wikipedia.
