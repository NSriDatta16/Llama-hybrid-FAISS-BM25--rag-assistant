What you want is the LONG_PTR SetWindowLongPtr(HWND hWnd, int nIndex, LONG_PTR dwNewLong); function which, according to MSDN "function changes an attribute of the specified window.". The nIndex param should be set to 'GWL_STYLE' and 'dwNewLong' represents the new style. You can select the various values (use the constants) for the style. There's a great article exploring this in detail on MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997562.aspx which includes a list of the various styles you can set.
