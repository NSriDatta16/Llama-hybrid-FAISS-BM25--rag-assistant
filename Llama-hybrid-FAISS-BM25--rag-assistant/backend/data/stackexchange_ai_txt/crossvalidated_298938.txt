In binary logistic regression, must the binary Y be interpreted as the dependent variable?

If I have a binary variable, say sex, and I want to test whether multiple other variables are associated with it. To do this, I run a logistic regression of the form \begin{equation} logit(probability(sex = male)) = \beta X1 + \beta X2 ... + \beta Xk \end{equation} Once I do this, I calculate the pseudo R-squared, and it is 0.45 meaning that the regression explained 45% of the variance in sex. My question is, is it also fair/correct to interpret this as sex explained 45% of the variance in the regressors? Likewise, if the odds ratio for X1 is 2.0, can one claim that being male increased the odds of X1 occurring by 100%? Basically, can the equal sign in the regression equation truly be treated as an equal sign (i.e., bi-directional equivalence) if I have no claim to directionality?
