Maybe there is another solution, but I found out that we can change the "etc_dir" when we lauch the application. I copied the "app/etc/local.xml" and "app/etc/config.xml" to a newly created folder "tests/etc/"; I changed this database configuration to what I needed; I made a symbolic link in "tests/etc/" to point to "app/etc/modules" (A copy is not recommended); Finally I passed the defaults parameters and the "etc_dir" to the "Mage::app()" method in a file "tests/helper.php" that is executed to setup my tests (include path, white list for code coverage). It looked like this. Before "tests/helper.php" ... // Start Magento application Mage::app(); ... After "tests/helper.php" ... // Start Magento application Mage::app('default', 'store', '/path/to/test/etc'); ... My app folder My test folder Hope this could help someone.
