Found out what the problem was: i was depending too much on $nr_zone which gets incremented before any of the events get fired; My solution is to store the value of $nr_zone in the element's id (sth like $(zona).attr("id","zona_"+$nr_zone) and replace its use in code with $(zona).attr("id").split("_")[1] . If there's a moer elegant solution i'd love to hear it.
