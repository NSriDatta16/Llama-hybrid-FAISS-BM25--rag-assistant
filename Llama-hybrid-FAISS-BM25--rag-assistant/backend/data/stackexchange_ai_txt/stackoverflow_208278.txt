I would take this opportunity to leave extensions (.html, .aspx, etc) behind. For all our major websites we now use a custom mapping system, whereby a virtual page URI is mapped to a specific .aspx (or.html) page. This has a few benefits: Your visitors see "nicer" URIs; You're free to re-organise your site as you see fit, behind the scenes, without breaking existing incoming links; You can use dynamic virtual URIs, eg instead of /Product.aspx?p=Blah, you can use /Products/Blah We have our own custom system, but I believe ASP.NET MVC now has this feature built-in. (If you go down this route, you can add legacy mappings for .html URIs that point to your new .aspx pages).
