When does a stationary distribution for a CTMC not exist?

Recalling that a Continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) is defined by its generator matrix $Q$ , when does a stationary distribution for a CTMC not exist? Or when does there not exist a probability vector $\pi$ s.t. $\pi Q = 0$ ? If there is a mathematical reason, is there also a statistical interpretation? Thanks! (The difficulty seems to lie in the fact that $\pi$ must also be a probability vector. For example, a vector of ones is a clear right eigenvector with eigenvalue $0$ , which implies that $Q$ must also have at least one left eigenvector with eigenvalue $0$ . But when can it be scaled to be a probability vector? As an additional note, for discrete Markov Chains we have Perron-Frobenius, which helps guarantee the existence of a stationary distribution.)
