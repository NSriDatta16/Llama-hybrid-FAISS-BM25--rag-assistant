This is from one of the responses on the thread you pointed to and should work fine - have the WQO agent simply write to a hidden field on the form. This will do a client-side redirect, so you'll get two trips to the server. You could use your WQO to set a field on the document called redirect. Set the field to text and hide it from everything. HEre's what you put in the field (with your WQO agent): location.replace('http://www.website.com'); In your HtmlHeadContent, put this formula: "" + @NewLine + redirect + @NewLine + ""
