would the exclusion of outliers at each step of an ensemble process defeat some of the purpose of an ensemble method? No, it would not. The idea of an ensemble method is just to pool the strengths of multiple models (possibly multiple iterations of pretty much the same model, as in a random forest) by combining the models. If none of the models can handle outliers itself, it may still be useful to have an outlier-removal step. It all depends on what you're trying to do with the ensemble and how you think the outliers came about. outliers, that do not have statistical significance To be clear, statistical significance is a judgment you make about an effect on the basis of a significance test. It doesn't make sense to speak of a data point being significant or not.
