What it means to have a higher cost for a local minima than the global minima?

In the following lines, I do not understand what it means to have a high cost for local minima than a global minima? Local minima can be problematic if they have high cost in comparison to the global minimum. One can construct small neural networks, even without hidden units, that have local minima with higher cost than the global minimum. If local minima with high cost are common, this could pose a serious problem for gradient-based optimization algorithms.
