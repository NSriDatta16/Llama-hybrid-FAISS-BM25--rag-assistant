Which pre-trained model to select to generate embeddings from shop names written in English?

Good afternoon! I have a dataset with thousands of shop names written in English. Several shop names might belong to one business entity, for instance, shops with names "KFC 001", "WWW.KFC.COM" and "KFC LITTLE STORE" might belong to KFC. I want to make a clustering model to group specific shops by their names similarity into business entities as in the example described above. So I want to encode shop names someway, each shop name to some vector. Shop names might be rather long (30-40 letters), the names might contain uppercase English letters, numbers and special symbols. My question is which pre-trained model would you recommend to generate vector embeddings for my purpose from shop names? Important features the modell shall have: The model shall someway save the info about order of the symbols in the words The model shall save the info about the symbols themselves So what would be your advice?
