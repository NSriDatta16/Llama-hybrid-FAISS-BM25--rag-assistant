In his notes, when you must "estimate them from data", he does not mean the reward function . You rarely estimate the reward function. You typically learn the value function , which estimates the immediate reward plus the temporally-discounted future reward (if the temporal discount is zero, then you are estimating the rewards). Or, you can learn Q values , which are values associated with state-action pairs. In summary, the reward function and the true transition function is defined by the environment. The agent learns things like the transition function, Q values, and the value function.
