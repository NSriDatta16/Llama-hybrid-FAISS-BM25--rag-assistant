Heroku app breaks when adding Amazon Simple Storage Service (aws-s3)

My app works on Heroku until I add "gem 'aws-s3', :require => 'aws/s3'" to the gemfile. (I've also tried it with only the first part). As soon as I add this and try to "heroku rake db:migrate" I get this error "rake aborted! no such file to load -- rails/all /app/Rakefile:4" It works fine with aws s3 on my local server, and it works fine on heroku up until I change the gemfile. Any ideas? edit Here is the whole Gemfile source 'http://rubygems.org' gem 'rails' gem 'devise' gem 'omniauth' gem 'nifty-generators' gem 'paperclip' gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require => 'sqlite3' gem 'aws-s3' group :development, :test do gem 'rspec-rails' gem 'annotate-models' end /edit
