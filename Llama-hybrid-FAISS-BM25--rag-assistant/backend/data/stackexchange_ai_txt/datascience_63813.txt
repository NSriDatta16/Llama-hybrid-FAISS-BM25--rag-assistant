Datasets for Topic Modeling

I'm looking to try and use deep learning methods for topic modeling as opposed to the more traditional methods of lda and word embedding methods. However, I'm having trouble finding good labeled datasets for this task. So far the best that I've seen is the New York Times Dataset which I can't use due to licensing constraints. I've also seen the 20News Dataset but it only has twenty categories so it probably won't scale well to other domains. Are there any other good datasets out there that I'm missing that can be used for topic modeling? I'm happy to use a dataset that isn't explicitly meant for topic modeling; as long as it has some sentences/paragraphs that are tagged or labeled that should be fine.
