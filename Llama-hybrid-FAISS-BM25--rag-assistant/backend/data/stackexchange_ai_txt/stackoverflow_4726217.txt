Its been fixed. The problem was that I wasn't thorough enough in re-indexing and flushing the cache. To get it working I: Flushed Magento Cache and Cache storage by pushing the buttons in System -> Cache Management Refreshed the cache by checking all the items under System -> Cache and selecting "Refresh" Reindexed everything by going to System -> Index Management and selecting all times and then selecting "Reindex Data". I hope this helps!
