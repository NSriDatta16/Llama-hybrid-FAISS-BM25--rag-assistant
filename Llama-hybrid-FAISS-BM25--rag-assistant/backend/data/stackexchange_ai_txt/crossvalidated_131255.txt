Class imbalance in Supervised Machine Learning

This is a question in general, not specific to any method or data set. How do we deal with a class imbalance problem in Supervised Machine learning where the number of 0 is around 90% and number of 1 is around 10% in your dataset.How do we optimally train the classifier. One of the ways which I follow is sampling to make the dataset balanced and then train the classifier and repeat this for multiple samples. I feel this is random, Is there any framework to approach these kind of problems.
