What is the difference between serial correlation and having a unit root?

I may be mixing up my time series and non time series concepts, but what is the difference between a regression model that exhibits serial correlation and a model that exhibits a unit root? In addition, why is it that you can use a Durbin-Watson test to test for serial correlation, but must use a Dickey-Fuller test for unit roots? (My textbook says this is because the Durbun Watson Test cannot be used in models that include lags in the independent variables.)
