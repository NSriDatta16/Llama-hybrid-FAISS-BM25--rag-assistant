You can't define two entities based on same table except special cases (table splitting, hiearchy mapping). In this case you have to use DefiningQuery as @James suggested or QueryView . The difference is that DefiningQuery is defined in storage model and it is common SQL. QueryView is defined in conceptual model and it is ESQL defined on top of already existing entities. QueryView supports only some features of ESQL (for example it doesn't support aggregate functions). In both cases you have to modify EDMX directly (XML), these features are not supported in designer. Database view mentioned by @James is also an option if you don't want to use these advanced EF features. You can as well simply expose predefined queries on your object context and map return projection to custom type. Be aware that neither of these methods will allow you to modify, insert or delete data.
