I can confirm that my original code seems to work. I was casually sticking to an image with a wrong path. Here's a test : http://paragraphe.org/slidetoggletest/test.html var pic = new Image(); var pic2 = new Image(); var pic3 = new Image(); pic.src="images/inputs/input1.png"; pic2.src="images/inputs/input2.png"; pic3.src="images/inputs/input3.png";
