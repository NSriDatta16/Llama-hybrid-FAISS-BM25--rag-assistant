"View in Browser" and "Browse with..." context menu entry on classic .asp files in VS?

some bad legancy web application projects still have classic asp files. these project consist of 95% of classic .asp files and the rest only of asp.net (.aspx). if you right click on an .aspx file in the solution explorer of VS you can choose "view in browser" and "browse with..." . however if i right click on an classic .asp file there, there is no such option! do you have any tip/hint/addin for me so that it will show these two context menu entries also for .asp files? i run all my projects in IIS not the build in casini web development server VS comes with! thanks, toebens
