Accessing Azure Blob Storage from a VB6 App

Does anyone know if its possible to connect to Azure blob storage from a VB6 App and, if so, how would you do it? I've got a CMS written in VB6 and I need to offer uploading images and files to the web server. The idea is that we'll store images and files in Azure blob storage but seeing how I'm not using the .Net framework how could I do it? If at all. Thanks Steve
