Reading a little more I found you can change the format for an specific field but there is not recommended. you cannot change the storage format you could set ALLOW_INVALID_DATES and save the dates with the format you wish but I really don't recommend that. if your field isn't indexed there is not issue on call DATE_FORMAT() when you are doing the select, the only issue is if you need to make a select for that field in which case the index wont be used because you are calling the function.
