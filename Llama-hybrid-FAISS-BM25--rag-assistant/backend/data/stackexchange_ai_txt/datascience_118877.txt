This is an interesting problem to tackle, and there are several approaches you can take to solve it. Here are some suggestions: Clustering Algorithms : You can use clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN to group messages into conversation threads based on their similarity. To do this you'll need to extract relevant features from the text data and use them as input to the clustering algorithm. Some common features to consider could be the TF-IDF score of the message, the length of the message, or the time difference between messages. Sequence labeling : Another approach is to use sequence labeling techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to label each message with a conversation ID. To do this, you'll need to train a model on your labeled data to learn the patterns that distinguish between different conversation threads. You can the use this model to label new messages automatically. Transformer-based methods : With the recent advancements in dl, you can use pre-trained transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT-2 to encode the text data and then use them as input to a clustering or sequence labeling algorithm. These models are powerful in understanding the context and semantics of the text and can lead to better performance. In addition to these techniques, you can also consider pre-processing the text data to remove noise, stop words, and punctuation marks, and use stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text. I hope this suggestions help you get start with your project :)
