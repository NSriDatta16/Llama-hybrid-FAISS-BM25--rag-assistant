There is the "edge" mode . My Web Page Content goes here. From the linked MSDN page: Edge mode tells Windows Internet Explorer to display content in the highest mode available, which actually breaks the “lock-in” paradigm. With Internet Explorer 8, this is equivalent to IE8 mode. If a (hypothetical) future release of Internet Explorer supported a higher compatibility mode, pages set to Edge mode would appear in the highest mode supported by that version; however, those same pages would still appear in IE8 mode when viewed with Internet Explorer 8. However, "edge" mode is not encouraged in production use: It is recommended that Web developers restrict their use of Edge mode to test pages and other non-production uses because of the possible unexpected results of rendering page content in future versions of Windows Internet Explorer. I honestly don't entirely understand why. But according to this, the best way to go at the moment is using IE=8 .
