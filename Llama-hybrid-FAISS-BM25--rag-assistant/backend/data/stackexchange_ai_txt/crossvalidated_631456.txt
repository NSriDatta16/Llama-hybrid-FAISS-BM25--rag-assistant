If the data from the first sample gives a very tight estimate for variance, $\sigma^2_x$ , whilst data from the second sample gives a very wide estimate for second variance, $\sigma^2_y$ , then even though confidence intervals may be overlapping now, there is a good chance that if you were to increase the number of samples in the second sample, your estimate for $\sigma_y^2$ would end up converging to a value outside the confidence interval for $\sigma_x^2$ . So I would suggest that F-test, since it literally is about ratio of sample variances, is more appropriate. Another way to approach this is with Bayesian methods. The appropriate distribution of variance given data is Scaled Inverse $\chi^2$ . You can then have distributions for $\sigma^2_{x,y}$ and literally compute the probability $P\left[-\epsilon for some epsilon which you deem to be sufficiently small to ignore the differences between variables. It might be a good idea to tie $\epsilon$ to uncertainty in the variances themselves.
