You can use imread function from imageio library with np.array from numpy: from imageio import imread import numpy as np filename = '/path/to/dog.jpg' vectorized_picture = np.array(imread(filename)) When entering this data into a ML engine, you'll probably need to reshape it to a column matrix (at least in Prof. Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning courses that I've been doing). If so, you can do that by: reshaped_vectorized_picture = vectorized_picture.reshape(1, -1).T You need to install both libraries through apt, brew or pip (preferred one) pip install numpy imageio
