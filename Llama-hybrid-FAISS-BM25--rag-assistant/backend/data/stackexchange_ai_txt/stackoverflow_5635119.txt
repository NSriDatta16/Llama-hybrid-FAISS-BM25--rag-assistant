PLSQL-Parametric definition of group function

I have a table where i want to apply some aggregation functions having as criteria the grouping of spesific element of specific column. Assume the example below: TIMESTAMP SITE VALUE 10:00 A 100 10:00 B 50 10:00 C 25 10:00 D 25 10:05 A 25 10:05 B 15 10:05 C 5 10:05 D 10 i want to find the average value grouping by SITE , TIMESTAMP but the site A,B i want it to be estimated as one, meaning that i wanted to REPLACE B WITH A have AND THEN find the average: TIMESTAMP SITE VALUE 10:00 A 75 10:00 A 75 10:00 C 25 10:00 D 25 10:05 A 20 10:05 A 20 10:05 C 5 10:05 D 10 One way is to update the table setting B=A , but this is not such a sophisticated solution if i want in future to group more SITES
