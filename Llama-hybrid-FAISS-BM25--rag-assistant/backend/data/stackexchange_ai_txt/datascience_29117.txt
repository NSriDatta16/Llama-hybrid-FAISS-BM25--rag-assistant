what machine/deep learning/ nlp techniques are used to classify a given words as name, mobile number, address, email, state, county, city etc

I am trying to generate an intelligent model which can scan a set of words or strings and classify them as names, mobile numbers, addresses, cities, states, countries and other entities using machine learning or deep learning. I had searched for approaches, but unfortunately I didn't find any approach to take. I had tried with bag of words model and glove word embedding to predict whether a string is name or city etc.. But, I didn't succeed with bag of words model and with GloVe there are a lot of names which are not covered in the embedding example :- lauren is present in Glove and laurena isn't I did find this post here , which had a reasonable answer but I couldn't the approached used to solve that problem apart from the fact that NLP and SVM were used to solve it. Any suggestions are appreciated Thanks and Regards, Sai Charan Adurthi.
