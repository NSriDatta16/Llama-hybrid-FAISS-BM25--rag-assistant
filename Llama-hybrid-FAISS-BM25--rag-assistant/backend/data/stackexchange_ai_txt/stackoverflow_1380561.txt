In most cases folks just declare a record with a layout that is reproducable on both ends and use that. It is only when you have more complicated needs that you have to do anything more fancy than that. For varying length strings, I'd probably just implement them as a series of length and then length bytes of data. In Cish languages you could probably get by without the length by leveraging the null terminator. Nothing more complex than that is really needed.
