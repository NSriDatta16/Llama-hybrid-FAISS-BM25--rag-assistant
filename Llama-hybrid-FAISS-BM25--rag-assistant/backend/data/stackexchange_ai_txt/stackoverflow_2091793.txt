Eurekaaa!! Got it... This one works... When you grag drop the usercontrol or load it via the LoadControl method use a 'tilde' in its path. E.g. this.LoadControl("~/MyUserControl.ascx"); The same applied for a control dropped on a page. Add the tilde to the declarative path of the user control in the aspx page. We can call this as a bug in VS2005 and is fixed in VS 2008. Reply me if this dosen't work or needs more explanation. Alternatively, don't forget to mark this as answer.
