Just for clarification, the primary colours you learn at school are incorrectly given as red, yellow & blue. In fact they are Cyan, Yellow & Magenta, just like your inkjet printer. As the previous posts state, Cyan, Yellow & Magenta are the subtractive prime colours; you see what the pigments reflect. Red, Green & Blue are the additive primary colours that CRTs, Plasmas & LCDs use.
