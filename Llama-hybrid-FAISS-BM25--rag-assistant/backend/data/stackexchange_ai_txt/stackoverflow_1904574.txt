I wouldn't worry about any of this. After having played with Google App Engine for a while now, I've found that it scales quite well for large data sets. If your data elements are large (i.e. photos), then you'll need to integrate with another service to handle them, but that's probably going to be true no matter what with data of that size. Also, I've found BigTable relatively easy to work with having come from a background entirely in relational databases. Finally, Django is a somewhat hidden, but awesome, "feature" of Google App Engine. If you've never used it, it's a really nice, elegant web framework that makes a lot of common tasks trivial (forms come to mind here).
