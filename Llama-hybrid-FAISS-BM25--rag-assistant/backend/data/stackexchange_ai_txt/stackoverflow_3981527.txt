.NET does support a call-interception architecture, if you are willing to live by some constraints (namely, deriving from ContextBoundObject, among other things). You can find a full description of how to do this in the MSDN magazine artcile titled "Decouple Components by Injecting Custom Services into Your Object's Interception Chain". Also, you might want to consider abstracting out your classes into interfaces and then intercepting the calls by forwarding them through your interface implementations. Finally, take a look at WCF. It has a very well-defined interception architecture (don't let the fact that it's web services fool you, you can simply create your own channel transport which is a null channel) which you can leverage to do exactly what you want.
