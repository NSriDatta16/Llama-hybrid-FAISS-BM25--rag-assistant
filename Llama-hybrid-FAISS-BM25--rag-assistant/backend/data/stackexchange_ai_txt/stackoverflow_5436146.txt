Undefined symbol with g++

I have implemented the tutorial example of boost for the asio library, but with seperation through a header file: server.cpp server.h I build both files with another .cpp file in the following way: g++ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include -L/usr/local/lib -fPIC -lboost_system -shared -o libagent.so agent.cpp server.cpp When using the shared library I have compiled, I get: java: symbol lookup error: ./libagent.so: undefined symbol: _ZN14tcp_connection6socketEv What seems to be the cause for this error? ldd -d gives me no dependency misses.
