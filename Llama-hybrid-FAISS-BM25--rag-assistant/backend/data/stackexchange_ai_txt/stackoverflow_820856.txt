Mod rewrite / clean urls problem

I've been using a drupal 4.7 installation for many years, and have had a recent problem crop up. That is, the rewritten URLs are now displaying these characters: ?q= in every drupal generated URL as follows: http://sitename.com/?q=path/alias , where before it would be: http://sitename.com/path/alias . My best guess as to why this might be happening, is that I recently began using some PHP code to add context-specific link styling within a few sideblocks. Here's the code: href="internal/link/alias">Internal Link Or more recently: '; $alias = url($path, array('absolute' => TRUE)); ?> href="internal/link/alias">Internal Link Could this be the problem? If so, any ideas about fixes?
