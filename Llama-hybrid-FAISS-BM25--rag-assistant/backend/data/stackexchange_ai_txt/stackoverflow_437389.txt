Select all but the first character in a string

How can you return a string minus the first character in a string in MySQL? In other words, get 'ello' from 'hello'. The only way I can think to do it is to use mid() with the second offset being larger than the string could possibly be: select mid('hello', 2, 99) But I'm convinced there must be a more elegant way of doing it. Is there?
