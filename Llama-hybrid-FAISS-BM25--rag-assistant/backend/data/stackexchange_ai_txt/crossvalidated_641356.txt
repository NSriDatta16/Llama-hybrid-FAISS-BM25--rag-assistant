You want the model specification that approximates the data generating process well enough. If your percentage changes have nonzero means (which is plausible in contexts with nonzero average growth), consider using type="const" , otherwise type="none" may be fine. (Presence of a linear trend in percentage changes would be unusual in most contexts that I can think of, so type="trend" and type="both" are unlikely to be a good fit; these would lead to overfitting.)
