You can't do this with regular expressions because it's recursive. (That answers your question, now to see if I can solve the problem elegantly...) Edit: aem tipped me off! :D Works as long as every [ is followed by / . It does not verify that the string is in the correct format. string temp = text.Replace("[/", "["); string[] elements = temp.Split('/').Select(element => element.Replace("[", "[/")).ToArray();
