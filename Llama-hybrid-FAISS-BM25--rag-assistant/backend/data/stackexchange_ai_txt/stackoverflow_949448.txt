Multivariate mapping / regression with objective function

Overview I have a multivariate timeseries of "inputs" of dimension N that I want to map to an output timeseries of dimension M, where M I[t] " and the output vector " O[t] ". Now if I knew the optimal mapping of pairs , I could use one of the standard multivariate regression / training techniques (such as NN, SVM, etc) to discover a mapping function. Problem I do not know the relationship between specific pairs, rather have a view on the overall fitness of the output timeseries, i.e. the fitness is governed by a penalty function on the complete output series. I want to determine the mapping / regressing function " f ", where: O[t] = f (theta, I[t]) Such that penalty function P(O) is minimized: minarg P( f(theta, I) ) theta [Note that the penalty function P is being applied the resultant series generated from multiple applications of f to the I[t] 's across time. That is f is a function of I[t] and not the whole timeseries] The mapping between I and O is complex enough that I do not know what functions should form its basis. Therefore expect to have to experiment with a number of basis functions. Have a view on one way to approach this, but do not want to bias the proposals. Ideas?
