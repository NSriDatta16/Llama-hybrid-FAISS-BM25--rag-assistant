Which cointegration test to apply when variables are I(1) and I(2)?

I am working on a 35 sample size data time series, and after applying ADF and PP test two of my variables are integrated of order 1 I(1) and one is integrated I(2). Which cointegration approach should I apply before testing for causality between the variables?
