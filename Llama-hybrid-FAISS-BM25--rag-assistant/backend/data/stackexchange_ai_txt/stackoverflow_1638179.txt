I never actively tried TDD on an RTL design, but I had my thoughts on this. What I think would be interesting is to try out this approach in connection with assertions. You would basically first write down in form of assertions what you assume/expect from your module, write your RTL and later you can verify these assertions using formal tools and/or simulation. In contrast to "normal" testcases (where you probably would need to write directed ones) you should have much better coverage and the assertions/assumptions may be of use later (e.g. on system level) as well. However I wouldn't fully rely on assertions, this can become very hairy. Maybe you can express your thoughts on this as well, as you are asking for it I guess you carry some ideas in your head?
