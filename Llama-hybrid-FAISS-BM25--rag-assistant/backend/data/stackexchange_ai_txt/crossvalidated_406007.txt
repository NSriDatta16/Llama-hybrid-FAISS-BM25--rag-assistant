Correlated component scores after PCA with varimax rotation in Stata

I have a dataset with 6 personality traits for 155 individuals that are highly correlated. To get rid of multicollinearity (and potential noise in the original variables) in my regression analysis, I thought of first running PCA, since some of the 6 variables can "theoretically" be aggregated into 3 constructs. In an attempt to get uncorrelated component scores, I followed this post and mean-center my original variables: Obs Mean Std. Dev. Min Max q3_avtrustfac 155 4.18e-10 .4014286 -1.101315 .8117283 q3_avcompefac 155 -5.62e-09 .4458447 -1.391796 .8011859 q3_avatrfac 155 3.44e-09 .5891259 -1.773446 1.676078 q3_avdomfac 155 -7.24e-10 .5023187 -1.689295 1.119483 q3_avpassfac 155 -4.13e-09 .6270763 -1.611541 1.34176 q3_avopenfac 155 -6.80e-09 .652431 -1.90456 1.281211 q3_avtrust 155 4.49262 .4014286 3.391304 5.304348 q3_avcompe 155 4.72513 .4458447 3.333333 5.526316 q3_avatr 155 3.963922 .5891259 2.190476 5.64 q3_avdom 155 4.052931 .5023187 2.363636 5.172414 q3_avpass 155 4.176758 .6270763 2.565217 5.518518 q3_avopen 155 4.631832 .652431 2.727273 5.913043 The first six variables are mean-centered and the latter 6 are the original 7-Likert scale original variables. Next, I run the PCA Stata commands (requiring 3 components), using varimax rotation and retrieving the predicted scores: pca q3_avtrustfac q3_avcompefac q3_avatrfac q3_avdomfac q3_avpassfac q3_avopenfac, comp(3) rotate, varimax blanks(.3) predict pc1 pc2 pc3, score corr pc1 pc2 pc3 And rerun the above code with the original set of 6 variables. Both outputs lead to the exact same correlation table: pc1 pc2 pc3 pc1 1.0000 pc2 0.7262 1.0000 pc3 0.4553 0.5339 1.0000 What I can't understand is why after mean-centering my data (i.e. variables ending with "fac" in the descriptives table above), I still get correlated component scores.
