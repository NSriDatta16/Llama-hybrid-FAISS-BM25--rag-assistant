I'm unsure which of two variables should be my dependent/independent variables?

Let's say I have 100 different samples of child speech. Let's say I want to see if children use more abstract words later on. Let's say I also want to control for the length of the words. (These aren't my real research questions, but comparable examples.) For each sample of child speech I take the the average abstractness of the words uttered. I also take the average length of the words uttered. I also have the age the child was at the time. So I have data like this below: a What I am confused about is whether it makes sense to have age be a predictor, or the dependent variable? I can imagine two potential models: m1: Age = Abstractness + Length m2: Abstractness = Age + Length My initial thought was m1, but after trying to graph it, m2 seems more intuitive. Thanks!
