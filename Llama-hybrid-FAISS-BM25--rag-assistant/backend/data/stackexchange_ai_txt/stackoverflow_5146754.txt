Can't get TcpCatcher to capture SSL traffic

I am trying to use TCPCatcher to capture & decrypt my gmail SSL traffic and it's not working for me. In Tunnel SSL mode nothing is being captured and the page renders fine. The Firefox add-on seems to set the regular http proxy only. Below are my TCPCatcher & Firefox settings. In the Monitor SSL mode I either get a "The connection was reset" or a "The proxy server is refusing connections" error. I managed to get it to work in Transparent Proxy mode where I modify the hosts file. I am trying to get the non transparent mode to work. I never get the untrusted cert page as mentioned in this tutorial . Is there a setting not set properly? (Note: if you know of other free sniffers which decrypt SSL traffic I can take a look at them. Other than Fiddler. I don't think WireShark decrypts SSL. )
