Sounds like what you want is a hierarchical model: you would have a country-level effect, and nested within that would be a location-level effect. I've only ever skimmed through it, but the Gelman and Hill book seems to be quite highly regarded in this area: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/ As for whether this sounds Bayesian: this is one area where the distinction between Bayesian and non-Bayesian techniques becomes very blurred. Personally, I find it easier to think of these models in Bayesian terms, because then you don't need to get bogged down in making the distinction between fixed and random effects.
