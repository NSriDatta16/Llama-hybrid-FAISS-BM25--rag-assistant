How to organize Eclipse - Workspace VS Programming languages

I use Eclipse for programming in PHP (PDT), Python and sometimes Android. Each of this programming languages requires to run many things after Eclipse start. Of course I do not use all of them at one moment, I have different workspace for each of those. Is there any way, or recommendation, how to make Eclipse to run only neccessary tools when opening defined workspace? e.g.: I choose /workspace/www/ , so then only PDT tools will run I choose /workspace/android/ , so then only Android tools and buttons in toolbars will appears Do I have to manually remove all unneccessary things from each of the workspace? Or it is either possible to remove all?
