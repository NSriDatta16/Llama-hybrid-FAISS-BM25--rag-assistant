Flex 3 - Equals sign (=) in TextInput control Is displaying as a plus sign (+) in Firefox

When I deploy my Flex application and browse to it in Firefox (3.0.8), typing an equals sign into a TextInput control results in a plus sign. In Chrome and IE, an equals sign works as expected. Also, when I run the Flex project locally in Firefox, the equals sign works properly. I have tried deploying the SWF on a different server but the equals symbol is still being converted to a plus sign in Firefox. Here is the CSS applied to the TextInput control: TextInput { color: #333333; fontSharpness:"200"; fontAntiAliasType:"advanced"; fontSize: 12; font-family: Arial, "Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro", "ヒラギノ角ゴ Pro W3", "ＭＳ Ｐゴシック", sans-serif; } Besides CSS, there have been no other modifications to the control. Any ideas?
