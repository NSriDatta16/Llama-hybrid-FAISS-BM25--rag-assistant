How to keep dynamically populated datasets to stay with the program?

I have a winform application that uses some referenced web services to get data. The data returned is an array of objects that I loop through and add to a dataSet. When I call the service, it can often take 2 or 3 minutes to get all the data. If the user exits the program and comes back later, I don't want them to have to re-download all the data again. When I run the app in debug mode, there's no persistence of the downloaded information; which worries me. I'm still in "development mode", so I haven't really put together an installer yet to test if the information stays with the application. I'm curious about a couple of things: Does the data stored in the dataset remain after the user exits? If not, what would you recommend on how to accomplish this? I've considered XML for storage; is that the best option when you have 9-10 MB of data? Edit: Final Outcome: OK - here's the final outcome (thank you everyone for your quick response) When the application exits, I call a function to save the data. Here's a snippet: using System.IO; using System.Runtime.Serialization; using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary; FileStream fs; IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter(); //activities if (actList.Length > 0) { fs = new FileStream("activities.bin", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None); formatter.Serialize(fs, actList); fs.Close(); } //users if (userList.Length > 0) { fs = new FileStream("users.bin", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None); formatter.Serialize(fs, userList); fs.Close(); } The userList and actList parameters are List objects that came from the web services call. another thing I implemented (slightly off topic) is to create an application setting to save when the user last did a download from the web service. It's saved as Properties.Settings.Default.last_downloaded If the user clicks the download button, they are prompted with the date they last performed the download and are given a chance to say "no". Thanks again for your help!
