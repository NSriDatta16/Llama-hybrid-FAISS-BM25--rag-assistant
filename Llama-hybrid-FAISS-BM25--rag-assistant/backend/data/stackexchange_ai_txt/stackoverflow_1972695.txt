Just to be clear - the problem isn't inner DIVs extending beyond the outer DIV (the clear on the footer should take care of that unless there's something weird) - and instead you're looking for the outer DIV to take up the whole viewport size, with its footer always at the bottom of the viewport? If so, what you're most likely looking for is a sticky footer. Check out this solution here , it's quite simple and relatively elegant (at least given that this isn't a very easy problem). It uses a 100% height and negative bottom margin on the wrapper, the negative bottom margin matching the height of the footer.
