"If a primary key exists in the table, compacting re-stores table records into their Primary Key order. This provides the equivalent of Non-maintained Clustered Indexes, and makes the read-ahead capabilities of the Microsoft Jet database engine much more efficient." ACC2000: Defragment and Compact Database to Improve Performance "New compacting method. Compacting the database now results in the indices being stored in a clustered-index format. While the clustered index isn't maintained until the next compact, performance is still improved. This differs from Microsoft Jet 2.x where rows of data were stored the way they were entered. The new clustered-key compact method is based on the primary key of the table. New data entered will be in time order." New Features in Microsoft Jet Version 3.0 What neither of these articles tells you is something that must be observed: that if a UNIQUE constraint (or unique index) exists on NOT NULL columns then this will be used in lieu of the PRIMARY KEY . What I haven't been able to ascertain is how ACE/Jet picks one if there are multiple UNIQUE constraints on the table: first created? first column's ordinal position? first NOT NULL column's ordinal position? Your guess is as good as mine.
