I'm happy I posted my question although I already had a solution because I got several alternative solutions. Thanks for all your answers. Using another parser such as eXpat or the maybe smaller (not so powerfull but enough for my needs) TinyXML could actually be a good idea (and make it easier to port the program to another operating system). Using an #import directive, apparently a Microsoft specific extension to simplify the use of COM, is also interesting and brought me to the following web page MSXML in C++ but as elegant as in C# , which explain how to simplify the use of msxml as much as possible.
