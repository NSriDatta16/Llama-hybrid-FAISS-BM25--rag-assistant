ADF vs. DF what is the difference between augmented and the standard Dickey-Fuller test?

ADF test supposed to remove the all the structural effects (autocorrelation) in the time series and then tests using the same procedure as DF test. Could anybody explain in simple terms what is the difference between those two tests?
