I don't know if this will fix your problem, but at the very least it will reduce the size of your page a little: instead of the script being repeated for each loop iteration, move it outside the foreachs, and add a class to the divs that you want to make draggable. So something like: IID ?>" id="catdraggable IID ?>" style="position: absolute; top: SliderTop ?>px; left: SliderLeft ?>px;"> The data-yourid attribute is so you can read it later, and it's valid HTML5. And at the end, the following script (only one time, i.e. after the endforeach s): $(function () { $(".yourclass").draggable({ stop: function (event, ui) { p = $(this).position(); $.post("/admin/set_slider_image_position", { id: $(this).attr("data-yourid"), top: p.top, left: p.left, context: 'cat' }) } }); });
