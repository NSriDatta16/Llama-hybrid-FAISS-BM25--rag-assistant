Average and maximum size of directories

I have a directory and a bunch of sub-directories like this: - directory1 ( sub-dir1 , sub-dir2 , sub-dir3 , sub-dir4 , sub-dir5 ...........and so on, hundreds of them...) How do I find out what is average size of the sub-directories? And how do I find what is the maximum size of the sub-directories? All using Unix commands... Thanks.
