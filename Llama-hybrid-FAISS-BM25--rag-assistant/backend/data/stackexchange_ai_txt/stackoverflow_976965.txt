@cloudhead has answered this well, but if you want to alter multiple css properties at one time it would look like: $("div").css({'font-weight': 'bold', 'font-size': '3em'}); Alternately, you could use jQuery's chaining method. Not as efficient, but it's a nice taste of the kind of flexibility jQuery has. $("div").css('font-weight', 'bold').css('font-size', '3em'); I encourage you to look at the jQuery Tutorials to get a better sense of what jQuery can do.
