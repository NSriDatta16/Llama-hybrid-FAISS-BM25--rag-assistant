Spring-MVC Common Model Attributes Used in Tags or Page Fragments

It's common to have many pages in a website that request the same model attributes, for example, a header that renders the current users name, or a column that needs a few server based pieces of information. ... ... ... The simplest solution is that every controller method you write that returns views that use the header, or footer also add all of attributes needed by components contained within it, but as the site grows it can become difficult to handle, particularly when you start dealing with pages that don't all have exactly the same components. Is there a way to encapsulate the logic that adds to the model based on sub-pages or tags?
