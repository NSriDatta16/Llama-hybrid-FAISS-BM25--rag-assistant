I might do some BFI solution first, then perhaps look to generalize it or at least reduce it to a table-drive loop. So, if it's exactly these shapes, and not a general solution, I think you should proceed sort of like this: Derive the coordinates of the blue rectangle . I suspect one thing that's confusing you is that you have each individual x and y for the blue rect but you can't easily loop through them. Derive the coordinates of the midpoint of each rectangle edge. You are going to need this because you care about quadrants. It will be trivial to do this once you have done 1. Write different code for each 1/2 rectangle edge. There is no doubt a more clever way but this will get working code. Make it more elegant now if you care. I betg you can reduce the rules to an 8-row table full of things like 1, -1, or something like that.
