What the paradox is There is a mixture of wine and water. Let $x$ be the amount of wine divided by the amount of water. Suppose we know that $x$ is between $1/3$ and $3$ but nothing else about $x$ . We want the probability that $x \le 2$ . Without a sample space or probability model, we have no way to calculate probabilities. So we have to decide how to model the problem. The Principle of Indifference states that if we have no reason to favour one outcome over another, then we should assign them the same probability. This means that we should say that every possible value of $x$ is equally likely. Therefore, the probability that $x \le 2$ is $(2 - 1/3)/(3 -1/3) = 5/8$ . (If you are not comfortable with continuous probability, we could do another version in which $x$ can only take on the values $1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 5/3, 2, 7/3, 8/3, 3$ . Then the probability would be $6/9$ . This version will lead to the same paradox.) That's fine, the answer is $5/8$ . But now, what would happen if we decided to use the same model, but for the ratio of water divided by wine? Call this $y$ . Then $y = 1/x$ . Now, if we assume that all values of $y$ are equally likely, we want the probability that $y \ge 1/2$ . But this is $(3 - 1/2)/(3-1/3) = 15/16$ , (or $8/9$ in the discrete version.) The paradox is that that these two values are not equal. So, how should we assign the probability that $x \le 2$ ? Should it be $5/8$ or $15/16$ ? It depends on our model. But why would we favour one model over the other? The Principle of Indifference tells us to choose either model, but they give different answers depending on which liquid is called "water" and which liquid is called "wine". Why it matters for Bayesian statistics In Bayesian statistics, every calculation is based on choosing a prior distribution for the parameters of interest. For example, if we wanted to make some inference about the wine/water problem, we would have to decide a prior distribution on the ratio of wine and water. Often we want to choose the prior distribution which implies "no prior knowledge", which is usually a uniform or flat prior, which assumes all values are equally likely. But we have just seen that when we look at things in a different way, "all values of $x$ are equally likely" becomes "all values of $1/x$ are very much not equally likely", so it seems that there is no way to assign a prior distribution of "no information about the value of $x$ ". This is rather alarming, since all our calculations will depend on assumptions which we didn't intend to make. Resolution of the paradox The paradox has been touted (for over a century) as a refutation of the Principle of Indifference. Statisticians are happy to say that the Principle isn't valid, and this may be true, but if we can't use the Principle of Indifference, then we can't actually take random samples from anything at all, because even in a computer, sampling is ultimately based on counting the number of possible outcomes among equally likely outcomes. So what is wrong with the paradox? The key here is that we do have some prior knowledge about the ratio $x$ of wine to water. Namely, that it is the ratio of wine to water . In other words, if $z$ is the proportion of water in the mixture, then $x = z/(1-z)$ . So saying that all values of $x$ are equally likely is the same as saying that all values of $z/(1-z)$ are equally likely, which seems like an odd thing to assume. If instead, we assume that all values of $z$ are equally likely, then we get the answer $5/6$ , and the paradox vanishes. This is what Mikkelson is getting at in his paper. Assuming that all values of $z$ are equally likely is a bit like saying "every molecule in the mixture is equally likely to be wine or water, and we are indifferent as to which it is" which seems like a reasonable assumption for this particular situation. Alternatively, we could view the situation as putting a prior on $x$ proportional to $1/(1+x)^2$ . This is called the Jeffreys Prior. Jeffreys was a physicist who had the idea that priors ought to be chosen in such a way as to be invariant to reparametrisations like this. So he would have said that, if we know the quantity $x$ is a ratio, it's natural to choose this prior instead of any other one. I am not claiming that I have a resolution of the paradox, or that it's not important. We should definitely be careful about what priors we use and which assumptions we are implicity making. I'm just saying that choosing a prior is more or less the same as choosing a statistical model for something, and we should be careful about choosing these too. It's a bit unfair to Bayesians to say: "Your choice of prior inevitably leads to a contradiction, but I can choose to model some quantity with a normal distribution or whatever, and it's fine because I can't be bothered to think about these issues." Notes Information Geometry It would be nice if statistics could be made "coordinate-free" so that it doesn't depend on parametrisations. I believe the subject that attempts to do this is called Information Geometry, and it hasn't been found to be of much practical value so far, but you never know. The Gibbs Paradox The Principle of Indifference is fundamental to statistical mechanics, which is the branch of physics which describes the behaviour of gases and things. In statistical mechanics, we assume that each possible configuration of particles is equally likely; this is a fundamental assumption which underpins all calculations. This is relevant to the above for two reasons. In the wine/water problem, statistical mechanics would say that the answer is $5/6$ . A physicist would find it very weird to say something like "Let's assume that every possible ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in this container is equally likely." The second reason is that a paradox involving the Principle of Indifference actually happened in statistical mechanics. It had to be resolved by assuming that particles are indistinguishable, otherwise the theory fails to agree with practical experiments. I am not sure of the details, but you can read up on it under the search term "Gibbs Paradox". The indistinguishability assumption was not theoretically justified until quantum mechanics was developed.
