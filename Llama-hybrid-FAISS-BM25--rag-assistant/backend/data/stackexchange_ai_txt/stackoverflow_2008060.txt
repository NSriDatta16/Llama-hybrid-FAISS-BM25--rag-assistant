Define __MyCompanyName__ in Xcode per project?

I've seen how to define the __MyCompanyName__ macro value that displays in all header comments in XCode by defining it globally via a terminal command: defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions '{"ORGANIZATIONNAME" = "My Company";}' However, I do work under multiple company names and would like an easy way to switch this depending on what project I'm working on. I realize that I can just write a simple shell script to do this, but then I still have to remember to run it every time I open a project. Am I missing an easy way to define this per project statically somewhere? (This seems like a silly hoop to have to jump through... Apple, hello?)
