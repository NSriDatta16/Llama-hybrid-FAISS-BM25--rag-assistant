Intuition of Random Walk having a constant mean

I am very new to time series analysis. A random walk is defined as $Y_t=\phi Y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$ , where $\phi=1$ and $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise. It is said that process is non-stationary for its variance is not constant . However, the mean is constant . I am having a hard time understanding the "mean is constant" because when I plot a random walk process in R, I can see the variance is clearly changing , but to me the mean is also changing because there is a trend. What does it exactly mean when they say random walk has a constant mean? There are mathematical function that proves it but I want to understand more intuitively. Really appreciate your help. set.seed(1) TT
