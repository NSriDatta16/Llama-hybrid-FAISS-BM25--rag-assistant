What is the best hypothesis test method for a sample dataset with values less than 0.1?

I have a dataset with attributes X, Y, W, and Z. X is the predictor, Y is the outcome, Z is the confounder and W is the mediator. I have defined 1 STL formula for each attribute denoted by f(X), f(Y), f(Z), and f(W). I have the following relationship between the satisfaction time of the formulas T(f(Z)) I have evaluated the truth value of these formulas using a real values time series dataset, hence I have a boolean dataset. Then I calculated the indirect effect, direct effect, and spurious effect for each time step. Now the values of my sample datasets are between -0.1 and 0.1. Also, my sample size is less than 10 (I have less than 10 time steps). Take direct effect as an example, I want to test if there is disparate treatment or not. My null hypothesis is that there is no disparate treatment which is equivalent to saying that the average of the direct effects over time steps is zero. The alternative hypothesis is that the average is not zero. Since the values are already close to zero, the t-test using p-values did not do well at all. In other words, the p-values suggest that there is no disparate treatment while when I calculate the direct effect using the real-valued dataset, I do have disparate treatment. Any advice on this matter would help a great deal.
