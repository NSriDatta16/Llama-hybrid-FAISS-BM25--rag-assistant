I'd like to add that of the three algoritms mentioned so far (mergesort, quicksort and heap sort) only mergesort is stable. That is, the order does not change for those values which have the same key. In some cases this is desirable. But, truth be told, in practical situations most people need only good average performance and quicksort is... quick =) All sort algorithms have their ups and downs. See Wikipedia article for sorting algorithms for a good overview.
