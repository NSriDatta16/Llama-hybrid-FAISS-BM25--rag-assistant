Despite the arguments against using pseudo-r-squareds, some people will for various reasons want to continue using them at least at certain times. What I have internalized from my readings (and I'm sorry I cannot provide citations at the moment) is that if both C&S and Nag. are below .5, C&S will be a better gauge; if they're both above .5, Nag. will; and if they straddle .5, punt. Also, a formula whose results often fall between these two, mentioned by Scott Menard in Applied Logistic Regression Analysis (Sage), is [-2LL0 - (-2LL1)]/-2LL0. This is denoted as "L" in the chart below.
