Why eliminate them? Sounds like you've created a realistic benchmark. That code would have the same kind of variability when used in the wild as well. Probably worse since you're likely to have eliminated disk and CPU cache latencies. Using Jon Skeet's approach, creating conditions that gives you the best possible result, will only leave you with a result that makes you feel good but is never achievable. If an absolute number is important, calculate the median, not the average.
