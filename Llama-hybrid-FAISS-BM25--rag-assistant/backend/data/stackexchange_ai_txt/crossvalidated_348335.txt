Accidently I've the same type of problem: Although my objective is to create a prediction interval for the sum of predictions $\hat{Y}$ instead of the mean of predicted values. I also found out there's less literature about this topic (just on prediction intervals for point predictions of nonparametric methods such as this one: Bootstrap prediction interval , although you can also use quantile regression techniques in this case). What I've tried to do is the following. For $i=1$ to $N$ bootstrapped versions of the testset: Make individual predictions $\hat{Y}$ on the (labeled!) testset and aggegrate (e.g. averaging or summing) these predictions to $\hat{Y_{tot}}$. Now calculate $Y_{tot}$ (which is computable since the individual $Y$ values in the testset are also known). Then write the relative error $e_i=\frac{\hat{Y_{tot}}-Y_{tot}}{Y_{tot}}$. Now extract the $\frac{1-\alpha}{2}$ and $\frac{1+\alpha}{2}$ quantiles of the vector of ordered $e_i$'s, this gives you insight in the $\alpha$% prediction interval for some new $Y_{tot}$; namely $P(\frac{\hat{Y_{tot}}}{1+e_{\frac{1+\alpha}{2}}} \leq Y_{tot} \leq \frac{\hat{Y_{tot}}}{1+e_{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}})=\alpha$ Although, theoretically, this methods seems valid I still have problems regarding stability and convergence which I don't manage to solve (for example varying error bounds when my testset varies in size)...
