The best compromise between functionality and clarity IMO is Raganwald's andand . With that, you would do: params[:company].andand[:owner].andand[:name] It's similar to try , but reads a lot better in this case since you're still sending messages like normal, but with a delimiter between that calls attention to the fact that you're treating nils specially.
