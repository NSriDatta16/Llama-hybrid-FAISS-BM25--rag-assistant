Is there a white noise which is not ergodic?

Is there a white noise which is not ergodic? How is the ergodicty of a white noise tested? Thanks! Note: A white noise is defined as in Time Series: Theory and Methods By Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis : Definition 3.1.1 . The process $\{ Z_t \}$ is said to be white noise with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$ , written $\{Z_t\} \sim WN(0, \sigma^2 )$, if and only if $\{ Z_t \}$ has zero mean and covariance function $$\gamma(h) = \sigma^2, \text{ if }h=0; $$ $$\gamma(h) =0, \text{ if } h \neq 0.$$ I believe it is the most common definition of white noise. Also I don't see how it implies ergodicity.
