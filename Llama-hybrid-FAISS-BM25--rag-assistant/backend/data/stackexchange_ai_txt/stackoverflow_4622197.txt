Batch Conversion Domain to IP

I have a list of domains I would like to convert to their respective IP. Let's say: domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com I would like to get the IP of each of these domains, such as: domain1.com -> 111.111.111.111 domain2.com -> 222.222.222.222 domain3.com -> 333.333.333.333 I'm using a Perl script I found online and adding my domain list where it says : echo " " | perl -MSocket -lne' my $address = ( split /:/ )[ 0 ] or next; my $number = inet_aton $address; my $ip = inet_ntoa $number; print "$address -> $ip"; ' This works, but some of the domains on my list have expired and no longer have IPs, in which case I get the following error message: Bad arg length for Socket::inet_ntoa, length is 0, should be 4 at -e line 4, <> line 9. I'd like to have a printed list that also tells me if a domain is unassigned. Example: domain1.com -> 111.111.111.111 domain2.com -> 222.222.222.222 domain3.com -> 333.333.333.333 domain4.com -> Unknown Host My list is fairly long: I have about 500 domains to organize and clean-up. What would be the best way to get the IP of each domain? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
