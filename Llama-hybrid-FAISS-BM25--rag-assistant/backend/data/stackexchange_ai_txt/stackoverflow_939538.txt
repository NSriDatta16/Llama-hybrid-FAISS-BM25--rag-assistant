How do you execute a JavaScript function when the page has fully rendered?

How would you go about executing a JavaScript function when the page is fully rendered (Displayed) I know that the onLoad event executes when the page is loaded but Before it's rendered. I've previously solved this problem by using a timeout with a 0 interval, which seems to work usually, but seems a little inelegant to my delicate sensibilities. Is there a proper way to do this? I'm using prototype as my JavaScript framework so answers that involve that are helpful, however I would have thought that this would be built into JavaScript.
