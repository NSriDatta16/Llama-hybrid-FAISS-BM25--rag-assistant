Removing php array duplicates with regard to a few specific indexes

Suppose I have a multi-dimensional array with 100's of sub-arrays. The sub-arrays always have at least 3 indexes, but can have more. I'd like to remove from the big array all the sub-arrays which are duplicates of others in regards to those three indexes . Example with an array that only has two sub-arrays: array(array(0 => 'a', 1=> 'b', 2 => 'c', 3 => 'd'), array(0 => 'a', 1=> 'b', 2=> 'c', 3=> 'z')) one of the sub-arrays would be removed, because the first 3 indexes match even though the 4th does not. I'm looking for the most elegant/efficient solution.
