I prefer the Cobertura plugin to lcov because it presents the results directly in each build report and doesn't copy the entire source code for each build. The information they present is very similar. Unfortunately, it doesn't support gcov directly, but there is a Python script called gcovr that produces Cobertura-compatible output for Jenkins. This article explains how to set it up. You can also run both coverage tools on each build, since they both use the same input from gcc.
