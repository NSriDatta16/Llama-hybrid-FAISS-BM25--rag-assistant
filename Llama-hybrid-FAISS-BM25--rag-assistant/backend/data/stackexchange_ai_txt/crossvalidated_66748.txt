Write $f_t^*$ for the optimal production level. You already assume that this is a deterministic function of price, $f_t^* = a+bp_t$. Next, you have to assume a relation between optimal and actual production - and what will be the model to estimate $a$ and $b$ will depend on this assumption. You say that you now that actual production tends to optimal production with some delay and noisily. As user @fredrikhs essentially pointed out, one way to describe this is to specify $f_t= g\left(f_t^*, \frac ct\right) + \epsilon$ say simply , $f_t= f_t^* +\frac ct +\epsilon_t, \epsilon_t=$ white noise. Substitute the deterministic relation for $f_t^*$ into this to get $$f_t =a+bp_t+\frac ct +\epsilon_t$$ You have observations on $f_t$ and on $p_t$ and you know $t$- you can run a regression to estimate $a$ , $b$ and $c$. Then you can start worrying about the quality and reliability of your results, these being time series, obviously non-stationary for the first 3.000 days , etc.
