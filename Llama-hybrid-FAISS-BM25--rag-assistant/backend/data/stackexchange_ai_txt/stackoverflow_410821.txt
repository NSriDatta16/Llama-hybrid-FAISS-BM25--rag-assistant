What come in mind is sessions. Sessions are stored on server and it goes something like this: to set variables in session: to retrieve variables from session on other page: more on sessions at http://www.php.net/session But I would really encourage you to leave frames and tables and use css for element positioning - it is so much easier and you get more readable html.
