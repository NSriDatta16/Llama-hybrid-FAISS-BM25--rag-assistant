Paying off technical debt in Agile

If you are using agile, the idea is to always be doing incremental refactoring and never build up large technical debt. that being said, if you have an agile team that is taking over software that has a decent amount of technical debt, you have to fit it in somewhere. Do you go and create developer user stories . .for example . As a developer, i have 50% test coverage over the business logic module so i have confidence in delivery As a developer, the application supports dependency injection so we can swap out concretions and be more agile in the future. or is there another best practice for cleaning up this code technical debt
