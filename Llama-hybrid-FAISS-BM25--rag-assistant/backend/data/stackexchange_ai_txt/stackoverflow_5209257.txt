I like Robert's answer. I would also add a wrapper around the left, right, center and footer. Here, I set the id to "page": Text Text Text footer Then, you can also add the style for the "page": #page { min-width: 600px; } This way, if the user shrinks their browser down to a very small size, the content still looks good.
