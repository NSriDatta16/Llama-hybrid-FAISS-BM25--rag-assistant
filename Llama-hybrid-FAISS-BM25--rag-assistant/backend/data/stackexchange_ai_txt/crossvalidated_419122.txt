Your claim sounds similar to the idea underlying the Hosmerâ€“Lemeshow test. This test has been shown to be sensitive to the choice of groups, and also to the group cutoffs themselves. I've put some details below but I think the answer to your question is "you are right - the IV formula is not invariant to the number of bins" After looking at your formula for IV, this is basically the average log-likelihood value based on using a logistic regression with 1 categorical/factor variable. To briefly show this, let $n_i$ be the number of observations, $a_i$ be the number of events, and $b_i=n_i-a_i$ be the number of non-events, and $G$ be the number of groups ( $G=2,5$ in your examples). Then the logistic regression likelihood is given as $$L(p_{a1},...,p_{aG})=\sum_i a_i \log(p_{ai})+b_i\log(p_{bi})=\sum_i n_i(f_{ai}-f_{bi})\log\left(\frac{p_{ai}}{p_{bi}}\right)$$ where $f_{ai}=1-f_{bi}$ is the observed proportion of events, with $p_{ai}=1-p_{bi}$ is the probability of an event under the model. The MLE estimates are $\hat{p}_{ai}=f_{ai}=1-\hat{p}_{bi}$ . Substituting these MLEs into the likelihood gives $$L(\hat{p}_{a1},...,\hat{p}_{aG})=\sum_i n_i(f_{ai}-f_{bi})\log\left(\frac{f_{ai}}{f_{bi}}\right)=\sum_i n_i IV_i$$ I think this is probably where the claim of invariant comes from, as IV is a group "average goodness of fit" statistic. But this clearly does not apply as a universal rule. It requires the relationship to be monotonic. ie proportion of increases/decrease as the predictor group increase - group 5 violates this in your example - you get a "V" shape if you plot % vs group number. I expect you might find a different pattern again if you did a "maximum #bins table" where $G$ is equal to the number of distinct values $x$ takes. This condition also requires you to be collapsing the groups over the "flat" parts of your data. e.g. if group 1-3 proportions are all equal, then the IV you get will also match when you combine the groups into 1 group.
