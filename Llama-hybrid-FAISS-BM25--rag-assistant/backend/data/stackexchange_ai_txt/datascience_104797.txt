Actually yes ! The most important thing is that your dataset contains high resolution images. You can recreate low resolution images with a home made algorithm or you can use the low resolution images (or crops of these) provided in the dataset. In this video : Image Super Resolution: SRResNet and SRGAN , someone is creating a super resolution gan from the div2k dataset which have both high resolution images and low resolution images.
