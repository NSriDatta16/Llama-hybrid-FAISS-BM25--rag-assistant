How to calculate alpha reliability of a scale (factor) when it is expressed in factor scores?

I am doing a Principal Axis Factor Analysis, I found two factors and saved the factor scores for each, using the regression approach (as in the SPSS option by default). My question is, how do I calculate the reliability of each of my two factor scores variables now? In other studies, I already used factor analysis and computed "factor scores" (scale scores) manually by simply adding or averaging the ratings on the original items. As I manually computed factor scores, I chose the items to calculate for each factor score (I chose those with the best factor loadings on each factor). Then I also calculated the Cronbach's alpha on these same items (which sum is my factor score). And now I'm in doubt: because this time I have factor scores as automatically computed/saved by a factor analysis program. I guess all the items have contributed in some way to compute the factor scores, but I don't know how, and likely that they gave unequal contributions. So, how do I know which of the items I should calculate the Cronbach's alpha on?
