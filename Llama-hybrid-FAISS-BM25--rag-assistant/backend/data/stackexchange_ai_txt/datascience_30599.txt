I fall on same issue with RMSE which by the way may be a good complementary choice of MAE. Thus in order to measure error prediction on multidimentional output the way i implemented was as follow. Measure the index score per dimension then do the average on all dimensions which gives a single scalar value. If your data isn t on same scale, apply a standardization on it. And in order to have same order of magnitude on all your output dimensions you also can divide each column by their corresponding test set standard deviation before applying the mean reduce.
