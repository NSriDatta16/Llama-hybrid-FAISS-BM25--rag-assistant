You should not be doing any separate t-tests, even if you have an interaction. You are throwing away valuable information. You have 4 groups. Separate t-tests only use the data from 2 of those groups at a time. You are essentially throwing away the data from the other 2 groups, which can be used to estimate the within group variance. Instead you can do simple effects tests. I don't know what software you use to do analysis, but the easy way to do that in R is to change your coding for the predictors. Main effects are obtained when you have sum-to-zero contrasts (e.g. -1 and 1 for the 2 levels of factor A, and -1 and 1 for the 2 levels of factor B). If you want the simple effect of A at a particular level of B, you dummy code B with 0 as the level of interest (e.g. -1 and 1 for A, 0 for level 1 of B and 1 for level 2 of B). Then switch the dummy coding of factor B to get the effect of A at level 2 of B. The model will always be the same summary(lm(dv~A*B,data=dat)) . You'll notice the interaction effect is the same, because the interaction effect does not depend on how the factors are coded. The Effect of B will also be the same, because it is the difference attributable to that factor when A is 0, which held constant (0 is the mean of A: (-1+1)/2=0, so its the average effect of B across the levels A, which is the same as the main effect). The only thing that will change is the effect for A. Regarding your confusion, Jeremy gives a good way to think about why you may have significant simple effects when you don't have a significant interaction. Put shorter, imagine the difference between level 1 and 2 of factor A at level B1 is equal to 1. It is significant with p=.05 (exactly). The difference at B2 is.9999. It's p value will be larger (p Finally, your question really seems to be, "How do I conduct factorial/mixed ANOVA analysis with interactions." Lots of books offer step-by-step guides. They are not identical, but most are similar. I suggest Keppel and Wickens "Design and Analysis." Regarding this stage of the analysis, essentially, if you have a significant interaction, do simple effects tests. If you do not, interpret the main effects. You have a (possibly) significant simple effect and a (possibly) non-significant simple effect. However, you cannot statistically conclude that the two are different from each other. Thus, you should not be interpreting them separately. I said possibly before, because you'll have more power in the simple effects tests compared to your separate t-tests. However, without the interaction, you're really left with main effects anyway.
