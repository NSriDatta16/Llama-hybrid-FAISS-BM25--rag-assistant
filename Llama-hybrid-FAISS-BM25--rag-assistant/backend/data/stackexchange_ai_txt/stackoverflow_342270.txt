Generating a Protocol Buffers definition

I have a large set of XML files of a propriatary schema -the XML files define binary communication protocol (message structure). I'd like to leverage Google's protocol buffers technology. I am using existing code to load the XML files into an object model (in memory). I'd like to generate a .proto file from that object model. so basically what I am looking for is code/library (in C#/.NET) that represents the .proto file format as an object model and can save that object model into a .proto file. I took a look at Jon Skeet's dotnet-protobufs, I think I understand what it does (generate c# code based on .proto files) However, I didn't figure out if I can use it for my project (it probably has the .proto format object model there, but probably only code that can parse this format and not write it out)
