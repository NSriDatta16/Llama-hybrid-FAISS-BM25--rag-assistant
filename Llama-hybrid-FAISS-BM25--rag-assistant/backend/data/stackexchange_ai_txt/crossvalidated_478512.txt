Is your EPI variable a binary variable taking the values 0 or 1? Then the glm() function the way you used it here will fit a binary logistic regression model relating this binary variable to the predictors of interest. Before you report the results from this model, note that R posts a concerning warning message that fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 have occurred . If you examine the standard errors for your estimated regression coefficients, you will note that the standard error for ami.typeCRI is huge compared to the other standard errors. Same for the confidence interval limits! This could be a sign that you have very few observations in the category CRI of your ami.type predictor variable. You may have no choice but to combine this category with one of the other categories: DRIP or the reference category used in your model. After combining, you can refit the model with the new version of ami.type to see if R will stop posting the pesky error message. Once you get a glm model with no more warnings, you can check the model diagnostics (e.g., using the DHARMa package). Presuming the model diagnostics look fine, you can report the odds ratios produced by the model and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals: round(exp(cbind(OR = coef(LM), confint(LM))),2) Then you can say things like: The results of the multiple binary logistic regression indicated that, all else being equal, subjects given pre-medication "T" had higher odds of having the outcome "EPI" than subjects given pre-medication "X" (OR = 1.92 ; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.45; p = 0.027). Subjects who had a larger body weight (kg) had lower odds of having the outcome "EPI" than subjects with a lower body weight (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.78, p = 0.0265). I made up the numbers just to give you an idea of how you would report your findings in terms of odds ratios, thereby using language involving odds. The medical literature is full of papers which report this type of model.
