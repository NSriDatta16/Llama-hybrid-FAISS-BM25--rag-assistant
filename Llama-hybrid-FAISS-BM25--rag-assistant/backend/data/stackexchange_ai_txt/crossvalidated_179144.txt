R : Parallelising auto.arima()

I am parallelizing the execution of auto.arima() to forecast 500 Route time series, initially I did setting up a parallel token in auto.arima to be TRUE and number of cores to be 10. It did not impact the execution time but just increased the processing calculations to 10 times more, hence taking more time. Then I did something like this: modelsPetrol The code works fine, with less time, but I am struggling to check models, like summary (modelsPetrol[[1]]) gives an error subscript out of bounds.
