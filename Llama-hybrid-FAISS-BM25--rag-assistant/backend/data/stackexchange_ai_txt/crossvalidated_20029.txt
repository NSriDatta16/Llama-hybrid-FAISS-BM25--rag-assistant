Ordered logistic multilevel regression in imputed dataset

Is there any way to calculate an ordered logistic multilevel regression in an imputed dataset? I have tried Stata’s GLLAMM ( Generalized Linear and Latent Mixed Models ), but that won’t work with the mi estimate, post: command prefix. Should I “estimate anyway”, or is there a better way to do it, preferably R or Stata? > mi estimate, post : gllamm q18 [...] , link(ologit) f(binom) i(country) eform mi estimate: command not supported gllamm is not officially supported by mi estimate; see mi estimation for a list of Stata estimation commands that are supported by mi estimate. You can use option cmdok to allow estimation anyway. Also, suppose my multilevel model has only two levels, i.e. workers nested in countries. IIRC, in the case of linear OLS regression, such multilevel model would be identical to a ordinary model that includes country dummies. If I use that workaround with ordered logistic regression, will my results be biased?
