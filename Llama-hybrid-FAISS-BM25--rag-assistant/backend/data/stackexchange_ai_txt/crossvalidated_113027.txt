Standardization isn't required for logistic regression. The main goal of standardizing features is to help convergence of the technique used for optimization. For example, if you use Newton-Raphson to maximize the likelihood, standardizing the features makes the convergence faster. Otherwise, you can run your logistic regression without any standardization treatment on the features.
