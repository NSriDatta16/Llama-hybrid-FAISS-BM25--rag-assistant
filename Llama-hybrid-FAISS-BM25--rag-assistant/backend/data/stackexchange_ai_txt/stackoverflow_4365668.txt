the problem is when I need to use getName(). the object that I pass to this function are com.opensymphony.user.UserManager and com.atlassian.jira.ComponentManager, both with getName() method. You want duck typing . Java doesn't have it. You're out of luck. Since presumably those classes don't implement an interface with the method you need and you can't change them, your options are: Come up with some overengineeded design pattern Pragmatically forget about clean OO design and just use instanceof
