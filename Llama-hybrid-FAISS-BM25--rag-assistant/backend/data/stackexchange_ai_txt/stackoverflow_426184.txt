Go "missing" -- yes. I'm not exactly sure how ClickOnce handles updates but I've seen where a new release would not have the same data directory associated with it (or it wouldn't move the contents forward). I was able to find the old file manually and copy it forward myself when necessary so for the user's application data I required them to specify a destination that they could easily set if the app lost the link to it (which was stored in IsolatedStorage).
