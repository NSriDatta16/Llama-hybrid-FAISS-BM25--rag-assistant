I'm typing this from a machine that's behind a proxy. I'm not "hiding", it's how my organisation (and most others large enough to have a server) works. I don't have a fixed IP address: it's allocated dynamically. So I can't see how knowing my "current" IP address is going to help, since it'll be different tomorrow. Heck, I may be connected via a different proxy tomorrow (I work for a large organisation)! At home, I have several machines connected through a router. Again, I don't have a fixed IP address: it's allocated dynamically by my ISP. It's a large ISP, so there's probably a proxy server somewhere upstream. So I think what you want is not technically possible. What kind of application would make it "likely that people will attempt to hide what their client IP address is" anyway? What problem are you trying to solve?
