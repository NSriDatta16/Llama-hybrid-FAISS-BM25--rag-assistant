I thought this would be a simple issue to resolve. Instead, it is turning into a greek tragedy. The provider, Thawte, apparently thinks it is useful to require all certificate actions to occur on the same machine and browser that the request was initiated from. Unfortunately in my case I did it from a Windows7 machine. Due to some MS nonsense that means when I obtained the certificate I cannot export it with the private key. That is only possible on Win2000 an XP. So I need to use a 7 year old OS to do something fundamental for my business. This is mind-blowing. It turns out that now I am waiting for the third request of the certificate to be fulfilled.
