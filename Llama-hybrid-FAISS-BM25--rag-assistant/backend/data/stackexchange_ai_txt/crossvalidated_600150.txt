"Credible Intervals in the Bayesian setting seem to have more advantageous interpretations compared to Confidence Intervals in the Frequentist setting" - this is true only if the prior being used in the Bayesian setting is reflective of the true state of nature. If you use a "garbage" prior, you get garbage credible intervals. If you use a non-informatibe prior, you get an interval that is only credible if the non-informative prior is a reasonable prior for the problem at hand. To put it another way, non-informative priors are not used more often because there are not that many real-world problems where non-informative priors are reasonable for the problem at hand. To put it yet another way, there is no free lunch. By the way, if you really want a true confidence iterval, you can use a set-based minimax estimate under 0-1 loss.
