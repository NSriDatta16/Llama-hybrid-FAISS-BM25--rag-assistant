Trouble replacing text in jQTouch

I have the following block of code in a jQTouch app I'm working on: Sample Text Reset When writing my ResetValue method, the following jQuery syntax does not work: $("MyValue").html("Changed Text"); However, if I use the "classic" method, the following text does work: var value_block = document.getElementById("MyValue"); value_block.innerHTML = "Changed Text"; Is there something I'm missing with jQTouch or jQuery in general that is preventing the jQuery style code from working? Note: I've also tried "wiring up" the click event to the paragraph (instead of using onclick directly in the tag) and get the same result.
