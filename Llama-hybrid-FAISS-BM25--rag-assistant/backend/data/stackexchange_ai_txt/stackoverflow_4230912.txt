Note: I won't accept my own answer for a while because I'm genuinely curious about other (better) approaches. The way I got out of this was hardly elegant: # stash F, G, H - can't simply reorder them before D, E since they depend a lot on D, E for i in {1..3}; do git reset HEAD^; git stash; done # wipe out the weird non-merge D and E commits git reset --hard HEAD~2 # pull to merge D, E again git pull # restore F, G, H for i in {1..3}; do git stash pop; git commit -a; done
