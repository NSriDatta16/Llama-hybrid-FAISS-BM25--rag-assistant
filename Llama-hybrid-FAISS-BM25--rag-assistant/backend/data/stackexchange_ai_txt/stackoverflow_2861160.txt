WinAPI magic and MONO runtime

I'm trying to get the same result of a .NET application (see the link Hide TabControl buttons to manage stacked Panel controls for details), but using the MONO runtime instead of the MS .NET runtime. Pratically, when the custom control is executed using the MONO runtime, the underlying message is not sent to the control, causing the tab pages to be shown... Is there a portable solution which is elegant as the linked one? If it is not possible, what are possible workarounds (apart from removing/adding tabs at runtime)?
