I don't know a ton about chess notation but it looks like you can encode these moves as pairs of categories in some way. Then every move is a time step in your (input) sequence. What you could try to do is use a seq2seq model to map your input sequence (the game progression) to the output sentence. I do think that modeling your inputs as a recurrent unit will be very possible, but predicting raw text output might be difficult to extract properly just because the signal is so thin and difficult to capture. You could look into classifying these comments into a few categories and turning it into a RNN classification problem, which might lead to better results.
