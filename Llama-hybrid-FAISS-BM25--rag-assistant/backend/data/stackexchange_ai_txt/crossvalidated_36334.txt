I think this question has been addressed a few times before although not in the context of your paper. Even though the likert scale is ordinal, some people here argue that average scores can be looke at as numerical (interval). Ascribing to that theory the variance of the averages has some meaning. Also a Likert scale even though it is discrete the individual scores could be thought of as interval if you believe that respondents think the change from 2 to 3 is the same as from 3 to 4 etc. This may be a stretch. Of course if the raw data were normally distributed you could use the F test for comparing two normally distributed variables. Unless the sample size is large it is difficult to reject homoscedasticity. it has also been pointed out that the F test is not robust to depatures from normality. So it is safer to use a robust test. Levene's test is one of the most common ones and there are modifications to it that have been proposed. Still you may be uncomfortable treating ordinal data as though it was were interval. So maybe a nonparametric test based only on ranking the data or on permutations would be suitable. then you really are asking if the distributions have different scales. There are apparently three well-known nonparametric tests for equality of scale in two distributions with well-known properties and some new one appearing in the literature. A Google search using "nonparametric tests of scale" turns up a lot of interesting links. There is even one that discuss whether or not Likert scales should be viewed parametrically or nonparametrically with a paper like yours instigating the discussion. Do the search. But to help out here are links to a few papers. Full pdfs are not available Mathur Klotz Penfield .
