Anisotropy is a problem if you treat the embeddings as vectors in Euclidian space. If your vocabulary ends up effectively in a tiny volume inside Euclidian space, then you shouldn't treat the vectors as Euclidian vectors. This is consequential for distance metrics used in your problem. This also means that perhaps the embedding could be compressed (shortened), that it has too many dimensions. The authors claim that the entire vocabulary's embeddings' distribution is not isotropic.
