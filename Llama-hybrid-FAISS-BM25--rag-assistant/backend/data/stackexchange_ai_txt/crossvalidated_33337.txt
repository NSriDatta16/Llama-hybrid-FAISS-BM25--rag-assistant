Is this an unbiased estimator for standard deviation of normal distribution?

Suppose we have $n$ samples, with mean $\mu$. Calculate the average absolute distance from $\mu$, i.e., $$ y = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |X_i - \mu| \>. $$ Then, take as an estimate of the standard deviation $$ \tilde \sigma = y\frac{1}{1-1/n}\sqrt{\pi/2}$$ Is it unbiased?
