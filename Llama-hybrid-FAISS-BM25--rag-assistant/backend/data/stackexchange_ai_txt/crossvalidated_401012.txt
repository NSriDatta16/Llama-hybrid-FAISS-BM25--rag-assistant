I'm not sure what you are asking either, but here is a way to sample these random variables. We can rewrite your random variables as $$X_1= \ \ 10 U_1+10,$$ $$X_2= \ \ 20 U_2+20,$$ $$X_3 = 100 U_3 + 50,$$ where the $U_i$ are uniform $[0,1]$ . Now the sum constraint is rewritten as $$10U_1+20U_2+100U_3+80=100,$$ or $$U_1+2U_2+10U_3=2.$$ We can sample uniformly over the relevant space by using the R package 'hitandrun', which "generates a Markov Chain whose stable state converges on a uniform distribution over a convex polytope." I used this R code: library(hitandrun) # Sample uniformly from u1 + 2*u2 +10*u3 = 2 with # 0 = 0)) stopifnot(all(x Here is some sample output, where I've converted it back to your $X_1, X_2,$ and $X_3.$ X1 X2 X3 Sum 11.5317 22.9209 65.5474 100 13.7872 21.5719 64.6409 100 16.0213 25.4983 58.4803 100 16.6402 26.5761 56.7837 100 14.5796 30.4687 54.9516 100
