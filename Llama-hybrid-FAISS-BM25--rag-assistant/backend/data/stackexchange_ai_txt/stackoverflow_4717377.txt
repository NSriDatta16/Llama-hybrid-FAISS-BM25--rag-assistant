How important avoiding the round trip cost is to you depends on a few things. First, how many round trips are you making? If you're making 3 or 4, you can probably ignore the advice if heeding it would be painful. Second, how costly is the round trip for you in your setup? If a roundtrip to the db takes 100 ms, that's to be avoided much more seriously than if it only takes 2 ms. Third, how time-sensitive is the process that needs to do the queries? If you're making a user wait, you should really pay attention to this - users hate to wait! If you're using an Ajax process that runs behind-the-scenes and does some work, maybe it's less important (though you'll still have to watch out for timeouts, maybe). Basically, Google's advice is good, in that wasted time is wasted time. However, depending on your specific case, wasted time may be more or less serious to you, your system, and your users.
