In that case you would use an if/then/else. You cannot do this with a switch, either. The idea of a switch statement is that you have a value V that you test for identity against N possible outcomes. You can do this with an if-construct - however that would take O(N) runtime on average. The switch gives you constant O(1) every time. This is obviously not possible for ranges (since they are not easily hashable) and thus you use if-constructs for these cases. Example if value1 val: do_some_stuff2() Note that this is actually smaller than trying to use a dictionary.
