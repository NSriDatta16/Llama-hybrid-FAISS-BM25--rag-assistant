One side point to note about normalization: A fully normalized database is space efficient, but is not necessarily the most time efficient arrangement of data depending on use patterns. Skipping around to multiple tables to look up all the pieces of info from their denormalized locations takes time. In high load situations (millions of rows per second flying around, thousands of concurrent clients, like say credit card transaction processing) where time is more valuable than storage space, appropriately denormalized tables can give better response times than fully normalized tables. For more info on this, look for SQL books written by Ken Henderson.
