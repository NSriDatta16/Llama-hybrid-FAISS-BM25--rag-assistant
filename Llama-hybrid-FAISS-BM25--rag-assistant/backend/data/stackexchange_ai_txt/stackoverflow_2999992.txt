Call me old-school, but I still think the most pragmatic way to do this is to use double entry. Two data entry clerks enter their surveys, then swap stacks and enter the other clerk's surveys. Whenever your system detects a difference between the two, it throws up a flag - then the two clerks put their heads together and decide on the correct answer (or maybe it gets reviewed by a more senior research staff member, etc.). Combined with some of the other suggestions here (I like mdma's suggestions for the GUI a lot), this would make for a low-error system. Yes, this will double your data entry time (maybe) - but it's dead simple and will cut your errors way, way down. The OMR idea is a great one, but it doesn't sound to me like this project (a national, 52-page survey) is the best case for a lone hacker to try to implement that for the first time. What software do you need? What hardware is available to do that? There will still be a lot of human work involved in identifying the goofy stuff where an interviewer marks all four possible answers and then writes a note off to the side - you'll likely want to randomly sample surveys to get a sense of what the machine-read error rate is. Even then you still just have an estimate of the error rate, not corrected data. Try a simpler method to give your employer quality results this time - then use those results as a pre-validated data set for experimenting with the OMR stuff for next time.
