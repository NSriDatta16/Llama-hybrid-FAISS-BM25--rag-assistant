How to include predefined set of netbeans platform modules in maven project?

I am working on maven netbeans platform project consisting of several modules. I need to depend on some modules (say java.source module), but when I try to run the application, it reports, that required modules are not installed. And event despite I have dependency on java.source declared in my pom.xml I think, that I have to tell maven somehow, to install (and turn on) these modules in the final assembled application before my module is loaded. How could I do something like this? UPDATE: When I try to create complete netbeans application project from maven artifact and add Java Source API as a dependency into pom.xml... when I run the application, window with following message appears: Warning - could not install some modules: Editor Library 2 - None of the modules providing the capability org.netbeans.modules.editor.actions could be installed.
