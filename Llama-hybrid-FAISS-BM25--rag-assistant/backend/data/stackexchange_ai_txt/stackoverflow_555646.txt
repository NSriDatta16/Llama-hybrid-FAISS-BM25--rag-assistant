if you use something like Notepad to view the contents of the .jnlp file, you'll see all the information it uses to run. Look for main-class (on the application-desc node). This is the java class containing the main method. For more information you should refer to http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp for the specification of jnlp. From here you could create a batch file with a proper classpath for running the application. But, you are breaking away any of the advantages of using the jnlp method. So you'll need to keep that in mind. There is also a section 'resources' in the jnlp file which will show you jar files it requires and other webstart jnlp's. You should be doing some checks outside of the actual application though. If these are similar machines, then it's very likely something is different. Defrag needed? Network? Maybe the java-vm itself is taking too long to load.
