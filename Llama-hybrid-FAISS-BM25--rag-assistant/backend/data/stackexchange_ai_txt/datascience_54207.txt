First, make sure, you have the same vocabulary in your word2file and in your Keras code. If you Keras Tokenizer , you can simply call fit_on_texts with the text actually being the vocabulary. Load your word embeddings as numpy matrix (just read all the numbers and then call np.array ). When creating the Embedding layer , call set_weights and set the loaded matrix and set trainable to False . You can find more at Keras blog but I am not sure how up to date it is because it is from 2016.
