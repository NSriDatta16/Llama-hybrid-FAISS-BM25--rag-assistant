Localizing Exception Messages using Spring

I want to localize the exception messages thrown from POJO classes using Spring. I have a Spring MVC application through which I can add books. If the added book's title is null the implementation class throws an Exception. I want to localize this. I know I can use the localeResolvers in the JSP pages and I have done that already. Can I leverage this to pick up localized error messages in the POJO? If so how do I inject the locale resolver (Cookie or Session) or locale which was set on the Cookie/Session into the POJO class? addBook method throwing exception public void addBook(IBook book) throws Exception { if (book.getTitle() == null || book.getTitle() == "") { throw new Exception("Title is null"); } I want the throw new Exception("Title is null") ; to be something like String msg = rBundle.getMessage(propKey) throw new Exception(msg); where rBundle is a bundle object which knows its locale and the properties file from which it should pick the value for propKey my controller class method which receives the form submission @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST) public String processSubmit( @RequestParam("siteLanguage") String siteLanguage, @ModelAttribute("book") Book book, BindingResult result, SessionStatus status, HttpServletRequest arg0) { logger.debug("Adding a Book"); Locale loc = RequestContextUtils.getLocale(arg0); if (result.hasErrors()) { return "error.htm"; } else { try { Author author = new Author("Gabriel Garcia Marquez"); book.setAuthor(author); library.addBook(book); } catch (Exception e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return "redirect:home.htm"; } } Is this possible? Or is it better I control the loading of java ResourceBundle for the respective locale. Thanks
