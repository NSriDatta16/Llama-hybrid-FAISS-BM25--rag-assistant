Disable pan and zoom on Windows Mobile Explorer 6

I have a web page that is used with mobile devices to take signatures, but the signature component doesn't work well in windows mobile 6. When moving the stylus across the component, the screen will pan. I have reduced the viewport size using but even though this stops the screen panning, the signature still does not work correctly. I assume that the stylus movements are still being captured for panning and zooming & are not being sent to the activex component. Is there any way to turn off the panning so that mouse movements are correctly sent to the active-x component? A test signature screen can be seen here... http://prague.dynamicselect.co.uk/cctest_engweb/sigtest.asp
