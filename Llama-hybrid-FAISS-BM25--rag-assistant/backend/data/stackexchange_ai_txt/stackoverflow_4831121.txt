Gant build scripting, how to retrieve a task that I want to execute

This is in grails, but I don't think anything specific to grails applies. I have a Gant script that looks something like this: includeTargets The idea is I'm trying to run some unit tests with jacoco code coverage. The target to run the tests is defined in TestApp.groovy ( allTests() ) and can be imported and run just fine, but the coverage task from jacoco wants the allTests() task added to it as a child task. It needs to "wrap" the task to run the tests. The Ant xml equivalent for what I'm trying to do is this: So I guess what I'm looking for is a way, in Gant, to get a Task from a target definition, and pass it along to the coverage task (I can do coverageTask.addChild(theRunTestsTask) ... coverageTask.execute() if necessary). This is an obscure one, hope somebody can help we with it.
