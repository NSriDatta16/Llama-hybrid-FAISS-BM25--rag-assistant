Building on @Emma Jean's response, Your created data frame is not multilevel in the sense that person (the grouping variable) and female are at the same level. In order for your data to accommodate a random slope, you would need to measure a variable that varied within person. It could be anything - mood or cortisol or pocket change - as long as it is measured repeatedly. So although you measure each of your persons on multiple occasions, person Alice always has a value of 1 on female, Bob always has a 0, Catherine always has 1, and David always a 0. In a multilevel model with such data, you can model the association between female and each person's y-intercept (essentially an average of their three observed y values). Below is your code with the addition of a time-varying variable (mood): library(lme4) set.seed(1234) person If you look at the data frame, you will see that mood varies within persons, so it is time-varying. In the multilevel framework, such time-varying variables can be investigated as having associations with the outcome that are allowed to vary across groups (i.e., persons). I did not create the mood variable with careful consideration of building such unique associations, and not surprisingly, none were found and I get convergence warnings when trying to estimate the random slope for mood. Another important feature of time-varying variables, is that you can calculate summary statistics on them that then become group (person) level variables. So with time-varying mood: myDF $pmn.mood y : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 1 ... $ person : Factor w/ 4 levels "Alice","Bob",..: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 ... $ female : int 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ... $ mood : num 4.5 3.5 4 2.1 3 3.5 1.6 2.8 4.3 4.6 ... $ pmn.mood: num 4 4 4 2.87 2.87 ... These summary variables can be included, along with their time-varying analog, in your multilevel model as a person-level predictor of the random intercept: m2 If I calculated a person mean for female, the value for the person mean variable would be the same as their value on female and would not be permissible as a predictor in a model that also had female.
