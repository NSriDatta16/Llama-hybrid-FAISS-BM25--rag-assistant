You can use the VLOOKUP function in an Excel worksheet to help finding "missing" data in a different sheet. For example, take the following two worksheets: Sheet1 ------ A B C 1 aa 2 bb 3 cc 4 dd . Sheet2 ------ A B C 1 aa 2 bb 3 dd Add the following formula to cell B1 in Sheet and drag the formula down through cell B4 : =IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!$A$1:$A$3,1,FALSE)),"MISSING FROM OTHER SHEET","") Sheet1 should indicate items that are missing from the other sheet in column B , like so: Sheet1 ------ A B C 1 aa 2 bb 3 cc MISSING FROM OTHER SHEET 4 dd
