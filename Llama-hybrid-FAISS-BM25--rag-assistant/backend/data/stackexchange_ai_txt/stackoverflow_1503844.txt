This is a known bug . The correct behavior would be to show an error that states that the --username and --password options are not supported when using an external authentication mechanism like SSH, instead of silently ignoring those options. To fix your issue, pass your 'foo' username as part of the URL: svn+ssh://foo@host/repo/project and use something like ssh-agent to cache your credentials, thus avoiding the password prompt.
