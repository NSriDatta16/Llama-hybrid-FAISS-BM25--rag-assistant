A more generic version (that doesn't depend on the where clause and hence limits your overall results): SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN average IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) As null_num, SUM(CASE WHEN average IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_null_num FROM users It's not better then the specific queries presented by other answers here, but it can be used in situations where using a limiting where clause is impractical (due to other information being needed)...
