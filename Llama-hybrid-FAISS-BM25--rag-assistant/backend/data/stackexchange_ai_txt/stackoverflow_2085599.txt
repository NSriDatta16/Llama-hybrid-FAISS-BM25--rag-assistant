If the strings are of arbitrary length, and of arbitrary count, you could try the Aho-Corasick algorithm, which is simple to implement and scales at O(n) of the length of the search text, and performs searches on all strings simultaneously. Alternatively, if the number of strings you're looking for are small, try the Horspool algorithms, which is exceptionally easy to implement and less than O(n) on average per string.
