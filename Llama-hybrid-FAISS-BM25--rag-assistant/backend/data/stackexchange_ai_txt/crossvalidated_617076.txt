In the example below, I am able to score chance-level accuracy at a particular threshold (needed to convert your continuous predictions to discrete categories) despite what looks like a low square loss. # Taken from: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/46525/247274 library(pROC) library(MLmetrics) set.seed(2023) N r$thresholds[i]) yhat Overall, this logistic regression model, along with a decision rule of using $0.9868599$ as the threshold for categorizing outcomes, scores chance-level accuracy. However, the square loss of the logistic regression model seems rather low at $0.08799204$ , and the ROCAUC is quite high at $0.9468$ . Consequently, I am inclined to believe your results to be possible.
