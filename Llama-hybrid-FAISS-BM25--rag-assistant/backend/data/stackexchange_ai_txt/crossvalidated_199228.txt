If your pattern repeats exactly (as you commented), then we are dealing with finite population and it is quite easy to calculate probabilities. Is such case the only thing you need to do is to enumerate all the possibilities and count the cases where proportion of $1$'s is exactly $50\%$. For example, while using subsequences of length $10$ probability of observing five $1$'s is $0.27$. n that returns > summary(allSeq) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0 3 5 5 7 10 > mean(allSeq == round(k/2)) [1] 0.27 However if your sequence does not repeat exactly, than this solution is only as valid as representative is your sequence for the whole population. Moreover, in such case different methods may be more appropriate (e.g. time-series models, or treating your sequence as Markov chain - as described by mef , etc.).
