Statistical test or simple A/B testing

Let's say I have two samples from some population. One sample is the control group, the other is the treatment group. Apart from the treatment, the samples should be, on average, equal. I also have some binary metric that I want to compare. What is the appropriate statistical test for testing the hypothesis that the average of my metric is greater in the treatment group?
