Determining break point/threshold in species richness in relation to land cover from multi-species occupancy models in R

I am conducting research in which I would like to see if I can detect a threshold response in mammal species richness in relation to the surrounding level of forest across study sites. I plan to use multi-species occupancy modelling methods using a bayesian approach in R to determine species richness in relation to the forest cover covariate, but I am a bit stuck on how I would then proceed to determine break points/thresholds in the species richness across sites in relation to forest cover. I have done a bit of a research into methods/tools for determining breakpoints (such as Muggeo's segmented package in R); however, as I am admittedly very naive still when it comes to these methods (and R in general) I am wondering if anyone has suggestions for how I could both use these multi-species occupancy modelling methods to determine species richness in relation to the forest cover covariate, and also determine if there is a threshold relationship between species richness and forest cover in any sites using tools in R? Thanks very much!
