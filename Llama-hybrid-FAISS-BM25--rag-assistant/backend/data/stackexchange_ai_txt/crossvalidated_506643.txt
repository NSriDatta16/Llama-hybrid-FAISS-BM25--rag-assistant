Handling the imbalance is worth trying; the usual techniques are reviewed here: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/06/7-techniques-handle-imbalanced-data.html . Before doing that, consider changing the cutoff for class probability from its (presumed) default of 0.5. In other words, predict hospitalization only if the P(hosp) returned by the random forest model is greater than (for instance), 0.75 (and predict nonhospitalization otherwise), and see how that affects your confusion matrix. If you're using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier , call the predict_proba method rather than predict . And if none of these help, it may be that your input features are simply not predictive for hospitalization.
