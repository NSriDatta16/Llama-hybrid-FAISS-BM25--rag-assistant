Ok, I have re-read everything here and looked at the image. There is only way way to do this really, and it's been somewhat stated. You have to normalize your sampling and then apply a moving polynomial average formula to the n results. The math to do this properly is intense, which bring us to the question of what are you speed requirements? The formulas for interpolation are here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation Once you have normalized or "re-shaped" each line into a predetermined sample rate, then you can average them. Have a look at this answer too: Which algorithm can efficiently find a set of points within a certain distance of a path?
