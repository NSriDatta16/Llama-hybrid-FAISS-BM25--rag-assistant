This is an issue with certain fonts on windows, specifically Verdana, from my experience. I spent about three days looking for float bugs and such to solve this, three years ago. It occurs mainly with the capital 'w' character, but can also be a problem with 'v' too, and only with cleartype disabled. The best solution is to use text-indent:1px; on your paragraphs, if you feel you need to implement a fix.
