What options for FLV players do I have for embedding video on a business site?

I'm currently putting together a site for a client, and really want video, and here I am with no experience with video in websites outside of embedding youTube videos. They had their hearts set on the Vimeo player, but it appears as though their lisence (even for vimeo plus) does not allow its use in anything even vaguely commercial. Does anyone know of a good alternative? Preferably its controls should hide onMouseOut and it should look pretty sleek (like vimeo)
