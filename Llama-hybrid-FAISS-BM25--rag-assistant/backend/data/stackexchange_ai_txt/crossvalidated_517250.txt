In which of the following scenarios is it appropriate to use line charts to display the data?

I am trying to understand when it is appropriate to use a line chart to display the data in a data set. It is my understanding that the x-variable should either be continuous, or should represent time. I am comfortable using line charts whenever the time variable is continuous (or near continuous) and the line segments drawn between data points function as some sort of interpolation. However, I am not quite comfortable justifying the use of line charts when the x-variable is time-related, but in a sequential rather than a continuous manner. In those cases it seems like the line segments are there only for increased readability. I don't know where I can find a definite source that could settle these matters. In which of the following scenarios would it be inappropriate to use a line chart? i) The number of pancakes sold in January, February, ..., December. ii) The temperature at noon on Monday, ...., Sunday iii) The average temperature on Monday, ...., Sunday iv) The highest measured temperature on Monday, ..., Sunday v) The level of rainfall (measured in millimeters) on Monday, ..., Sunday. vi) The number of hours spent studying on Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday. vii) The number of murders, by year (..., 1989, 1990, ...) .
