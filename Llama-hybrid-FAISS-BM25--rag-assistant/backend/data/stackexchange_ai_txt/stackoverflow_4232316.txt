In PHP, how should I shorten long strings in headings and paragraphs so they fit inside fixed boundaries?

When building websites I'm forever chopping up strings to make them display nicely as headings and paragraphs. I use the substr function to chop-off unwanted characters and then add in ellipses. For example: if ( strlen ( $mystring ) > 22 ) { echo substr( $mystring,0,21 ).'...'; } else { echo $mystring; } This works pretty good most of the time, but it is far from perfect. Check out how the shortened headings look on one of my sites . You can clearly see a lot of inconsistency in how the shortened headings look. Surely, there is a better PHP method/ technique?
