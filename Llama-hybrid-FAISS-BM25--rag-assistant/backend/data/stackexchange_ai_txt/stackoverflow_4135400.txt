Implement HTML response on WCF-based RSS/ATOM if useragent is IE?

I'm looking at the Astoria blog's RSS feed and it appears that they do something to make the RSS feed look webpage like, instead of the standard RSS XML feed. I'm guessing they check the useragent and alter the response accordingly. How can I offer a similar "nice" rss feed that looks good to web browsers and still works for RSS readers as well.
