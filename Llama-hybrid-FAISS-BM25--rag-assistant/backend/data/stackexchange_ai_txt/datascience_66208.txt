How to convert Scikit Learn logistic regression model to TensorFlow

I would like to use existing Scikit Learn LogisticRegression model in the BigQuery ML . However, BQ ML currently has a hard limit of 50 unique labels and my model needs to handle more than that. BQ accepts TensorFlow models , which do not seem to have this limit. How can I convert existing Scikit logistic regression model to TensorFlow model?
