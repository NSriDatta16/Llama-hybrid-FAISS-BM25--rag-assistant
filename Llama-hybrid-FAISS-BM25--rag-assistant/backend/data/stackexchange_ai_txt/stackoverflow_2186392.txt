Self join of time series data

I need some help with what I think should be a fairly simple self join query. It just needs to combine the matching start time and end times from two records into one record Say I have the following in a table Time Event 08:00 Start 09:00 Stop 10:30 Start 10:45 Stop 11:00 Start 11:15 Start 12:00 Stop 12:30 Stop I want a view like this StartTime Stoptime 08:00 09:00 10:30 10:45 11:00 11:15 12:00 12:30 Notice it should find the closest matching start or end time. If for some reason there is not a matching event it should leave it blank. Thanks,
