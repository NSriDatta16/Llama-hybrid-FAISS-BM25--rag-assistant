Adjusting the p obtained from a Logistic Regression with 50% prevalence of Disease to the population with 10% prevalence

I have a question regarding Logistic Regression: My dataset consists of a case-control dataset of 100 sick cases and 100 healthy controls (Both fictitious Gaussian distributions. Thus, the prevalence is 0.5. For simplicity purposes for this query, I am using only one variable (x) and its coefficients B0 and B1. Using those coefficients and a given value of x, I generate the probability (p) of being sick but only for the dataset with 50% prevalence. However, I want to calculate the p for the population at large, which has a prevalence of Sick = 9%, but I cannot find the way to do it. Could someone here give me a hand?
