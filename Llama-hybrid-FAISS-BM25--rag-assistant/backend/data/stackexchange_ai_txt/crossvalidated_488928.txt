Black represents the parameter weights. Blue represents the bias terms (kind of like the intercept in linear regression). To get the value of a neuron (black circle) towards the right, take the value in the circles to the left, multiply by the weight on the connecting line, and add up those values for all circles pointing towards your circle. Weâ€™d typically use a nonlinear activation function, too, such a ReLU, though you have not indicated what you used (if any). I recommend writing out the full equation of this small neural network, and I hope no one ruins the fun for you before you try to work through it. EDIT $g = \text{activation}\big(0.01803 + 2.31748d + 1.00955e - 2.24362f\big)$ Use this to unpack the other six neurons. Then write $g$ in terms of the three predictor variables.
