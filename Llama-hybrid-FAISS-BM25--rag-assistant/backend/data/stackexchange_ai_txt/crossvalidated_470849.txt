Time series with additional features

Hello everyone! I have dataset that contains columns: date feature1 feature2 Y I need Y prediction to next several values (date, feature1, feature2). Y tends to fall over time (maybe exponentially) and Y(date) to some extent is a time series. It is desirable to obtain a simple model solution based on statistics. It is really ? Or for best predictions need use machine learning methods ?
