How to add multiple query folders in LINQPad?

In the lower left corner of LINQPad, there is an area for display queries. One tab is My Queries and another one for Samples. I could not find a way to add more than one folder like in My Queries, just like one in Samples tab. I tried right click and checked all the menu items. I'm not sure if I can change XML settings to include more than one folders in My Queries to organize my codes. How can I have multiple query folders in LINQPad?
