The dsPIC33F/PIC24 allows you to enable/disable the watchdog timer in software. When the FWDTEN configuration bit is set (default), the watchdog timer is always enabled. If you wish to control WDT in software, clear the FWDTEN config bit and enable watchdog timer as needed by setting the SWDTEN bit in RCON register. See paragraph 9.3.1.1 in 33F ref. manual - Section 09. Watchdog Timer and Power-Saving Modes - dsPIC33F/PIC24H FRM for further information.
