I think you need to just use multinomial regression to fit the transition probabilities based on your variables. see eg Statistical Inference for Discrete Time Stochastic Processes - 2.3 Extensions of Markov Chain Models Models based on the Logistic Regression . ie for each starting state you predict the probability of going into the different next states.
