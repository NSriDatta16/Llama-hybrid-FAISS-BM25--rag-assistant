Is it possible to host the clientaccesspolicy.xml file with the ASP.NET Development Server?

I have a solution with two service projects (one is hosting a unit test silverlight application and other is providing the services being tested). Because of cross-domain policy, I have to publish the primary service site to IIS before the unit test site can consume a service. Is it possible to host the clientaccesspolicy.xml file on ASP.NET Development Server so I can run these without needing to do an IIS publish first? OR, does Visual Studio provide a more elegant solution?
