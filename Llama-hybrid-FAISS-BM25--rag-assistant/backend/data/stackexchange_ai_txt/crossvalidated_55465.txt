Step-by-step example of predicting time series with ARIMAX or ARMAX model?

Could someone give me a step-by-step example of time series prediction using ARIMAX or ARMAX model? The example doesn't need to be long or complicated. It could be for example forecasting temperature with past data of only ten values (e.g [15, 16, 17, 15, ..., 12]) You don't have to calculate autocorrelation etc. step-by-step but I need it to be clear A) What are you doing and why, B) Which data you're using to get what etc.. For example, I would like to see the procedure of finding AR-, MA-, and X- lags, possible integrations, finding the error terms $y_i - \widehat{y}_i = e_i$, solving the coefficients for AR-, MA- and X-parts and making the predictions.
