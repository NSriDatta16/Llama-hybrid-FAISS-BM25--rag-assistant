Least-squares fit of PCA scores on original variables

I have 100 vars, and I want to do factor analysis using variables var15-v25. To do that first I extracted the variables into another object (say f ), & then run the principal component analysis. Now I want to merge PCA scores with the original dataset to run regression using PCA scores as predictors. Can anybody please suggest me the method to merge these 2 datasets. The code I used are the following: spss_data_factor
