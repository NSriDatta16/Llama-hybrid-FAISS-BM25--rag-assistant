First of all, theres nothing in your Excel file that executes when the file is being copied. At most, you'd be able to hook into an event which disabled or removed the macros when people saved the document somewhere else, from inside Excel, using the "File->Save As..." menu item, but if they drag and drop the file using Windows Explorer, you're out of luck in that regard . However, have you thought about simply making all those macros check if this is actually the document that is supposed to be saved in that place? Like this (note, I'm altogether unfamiliar with Excel macro syntax at this point so this will probably be wrong, but you should get the idea): IF NOT DocumentLocation = "R:\LGS\FINANCES\ThisSpreadsheet.XLS" Then Exit Sub END This way, the macros are still there, and will still execute, but they will essentially do nothing for everyone else. Would that be an acceptable solution for your case?
