I've used Subversion in a corporate setting before with great success. I haven't personally used Git in a corporate environment, but with distributed offices it sounds like a good fit. Expect a big "hump" while everyone gets up to speed, but moving off VSS is definitely a good idea. We never looked back when we moved from VSS to SVN. I would encourage you not to skimp on training up on the new system. Get a few smart folk to read the documentation for whichever system you pick - and read it thoroughly . Then work out how you're going to use that, and communicate that appropriately. Suggest which bits of the documentation everyone else really needs to use, and give them enough time to read it. Source control shouldn't be done on a "press return and hope" basis :)
