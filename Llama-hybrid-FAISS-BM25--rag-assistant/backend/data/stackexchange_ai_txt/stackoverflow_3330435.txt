Is there an SQLite equivalent to MySQL's DESCRIBE [table]?

I'm just getting started learning SQLite . It would be nice to be able to see the details for a table, like MySQL's DESCRIBE [table] . PRAGMA table_info [table] isn't good enough, as it only has basic information (for example, it doesn't show if a column is a field of some sort or not). Does SQLite have a way to do this?
