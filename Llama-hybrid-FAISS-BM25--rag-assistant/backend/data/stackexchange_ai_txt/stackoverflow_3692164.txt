I would create AdminController in each module, then route rewriting the paths like this: /admin/module1 => module1/AdminController /admin/module2 => module2/AdminController Then leverage Zend_Auth and Zend_Acl . You will also need controller plugin which checks the credentials from Zend_Auth and a Authorization controller with login form. But it all depends on your application.
