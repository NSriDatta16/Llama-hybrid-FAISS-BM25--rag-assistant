How disk space is allocated for an edited file

Assume I save a text file in the HDD disk storage(assume the disk storage is new and so defragmented) and the file name is A with a file size of say 10MB I presume, the file A occupies some space in the disk as shown, where x is an unoccupied space/memory on the disk AAAAAAAAAAAAA xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Now, I create and save another file B of some size. So B will be saved as AAAAAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx - as the disk is defragmented, I assume the storage will be contiguous. Here, what if I edit the file A and reduce the file size to 2MB. Can you say how the memory will be allocated now. Some options I could think of are AAAAAA xxxxxxxxxBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx or AA xxx AA xxx A x A xxBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx or a totally new location freeing up the bigger chunk for other files. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB AAAAAA xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx or is it any other way based on any algorithm or data-structure.
