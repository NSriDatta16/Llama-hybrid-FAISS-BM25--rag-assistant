Analogue of spectral gap but for *smallest* eigenvalues/singular values

The difference between the largest eigenvalue and the next-largest of a graph Laplacian (equivalently, of the random walk Markov chain on the graph) is the spectral gap, related to the Cheeger constant, etc. Is there any interpretation of the difference between the smallest two eigenvalues of the graph? I am equally interested in the interpretation of the gap between the smallest and next-smallest singular values of a matrix.
