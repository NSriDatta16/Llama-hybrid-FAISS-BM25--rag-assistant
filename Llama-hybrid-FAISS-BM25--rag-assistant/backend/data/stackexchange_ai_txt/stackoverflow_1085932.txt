Hi I'd go for a third party grid control from companies like Infragistics, DevExpress or Telerik. Another option would be to build a usercontrol that is able to display one post and put that control into a vb.net repeater control (which ships with the vb.net powerpack). However I'm not sure how good the last solution actually works, as I just read about it, but never tried it.
