Can you switch to TLS or SSL HTTP sessions? That'd reduce the chances of sniffing the URLs. If you generate extremely complicated per-user URLs then you could have some level of faith that clients cannot simply guess URLs for content they have not purchased. For example, instead of offering your new content via: http://ns6string.example.org/app-content/spanish/verbs/ offer it on a different URL: http://ns6string.example.org/app-content/sarnold/ 646718ae5d25cac14775ca7074cf4808/b493881b4376a5162a38114d1bd2d88a I generated those ridiculous URLs with: $ echo "sarnold spanish" | md5sum 646718ae5d25cac14775ca7074cf4808 - $ echo "sarnold verbs" | md5sum b493881b4376a5162a38114d1bd2d88a - Each user could get their own piles of horrible URLs, and it'd take more than the average amount of effort to reverse it. (Of course, for this simple example, if I just bought the "spanish verbs pack", I might stand a good chance of guessing the URL format. Not much you can do about that, as no matter how complicated you make it, someone with debugger access or plenty of free time could probably figure out the URL obfuscation mechanism.) Which is why I picked simple mechanisms: TLS and hashing ought to be fast enough to develop that you don't waste too much of your time working on protecting your content rather than writing new features or fixing those last few annoying bugs.
