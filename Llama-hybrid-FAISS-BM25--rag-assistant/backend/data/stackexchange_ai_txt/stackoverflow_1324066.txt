When you have a situation that involves wiring up awkward legacy classes with constructors that "do stuff" like setting up listeners, I usually wrap the legacy wotsit in a custom Spring FactoryBean . This would have all the necessary setters, and only instantiates the target object when Spring has finished wiring up the circular dependencies. Don't be afraid of circular dependencies, Spring handles them elegantly as long as object instantiation and injection is fairly passive. Make good use of @PostConstruct and/or InitializingBean to let Spring's lifecycle do the hard work for you.
