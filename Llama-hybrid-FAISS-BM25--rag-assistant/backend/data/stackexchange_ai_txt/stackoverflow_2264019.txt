Is there a way to use a custom control in the designer and avoid the GAC?

There is a great library I found here . It's AeroWizard done in Windows Forms, and it handles Aero Basic elegantly. What is awesome is it's supposed to have designer support. When I attempt to open any of the WizardPages in the sample in the Form Designer, I get this error: Could not find type 'Aero.Controls.MainInstructionsLabel'. Please make sure that the assembly that contains this type is referenced. If this type is a part of your development project, make sure that the project has been successfully built using settings for your current platform or Any CPU. The library is referenced in my project under Aero.Controls and Aero.Wizard , so I'm not really sure what's going wrong. Do I need to GAC register an assembly to have designer support? Edit: I just checked with reflector, here are the references Aero.Controls mscorlib System System.Drawing System.Windows.Forms user32.dll Aero.Wizard mscorlib System System.Drawing System.Windows.Forms dwmapi.dll gdi32.dll user32.dll uxtheme.dll Nothing besides the native Dlls concerns me, but I don't see how those would prevent the Form from rendering in the Designer. Here is a screen-shot from the designer: alt text http://www.ceasetopanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/compile-error.jpg
