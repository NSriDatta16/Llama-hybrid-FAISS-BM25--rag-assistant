I'm doing much the same thing: central server probably running MS SQL server and distributed systems though these are running Linux. We opted to do the data transfer in XML and use sqlite on the distributed systems. It's early days but seems to be going well so far. There are .net bindings for sqlite. The reason we chose sqlite were: because it doesn't need any database management, which would be tricky on the remote systems. It seems very widely used: for example firefox uses sqlite for local storage. We can use it on Windows and Linux. It's supposed to be good at not losing data if there's an unexpected power outage.
