Check for any int type in C#?

I have a function that, among other things, takes in an object and a Type, and converts the object into that Type. However, the input object is often a double, and the type some variation of int (uint, long, etc.). I want this to work if a round number is passed in as a double (like 4.0), but to throw an exception if a decimal is passed in (4.3). Is there any more elegant way to check if the Type is some sort of int? if (inObject is double && (targetType == typeof (int) || targetType == typeof (uint) || targetType == typeof (long) || targetType == typeof (ulong) || targetType == typeof (short) || targetType == typeof (ushort))) { double input = (double) inObject; if (Math.Truncate(input) != input) throw new ArgumentException("Input was not an integer."); } Thanks.
