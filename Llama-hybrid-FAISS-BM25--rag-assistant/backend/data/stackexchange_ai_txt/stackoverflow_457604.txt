There are plenty of options for storing translations: TMX : A relatively new XML format for translations. Seems to be gaining in popularity. Gettext is another open format for translations. Been the de-facto standard for a long time. ini files - easy to edit, very simple format PHP files (arrays) - easy to edit for PHP programmers, good performance CSV format - relatively simple to use. I'd suggest you use something like Zend_Translate which supports multiple adapters and provides a basic approach to embedding translations in your application.
