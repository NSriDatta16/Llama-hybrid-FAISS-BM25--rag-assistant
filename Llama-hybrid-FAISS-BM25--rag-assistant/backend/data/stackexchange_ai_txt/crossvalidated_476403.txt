I used permtest.betadispers function from the vegan package to test whether or not the within-group variance is statistically different amongst 4 groups. The p-value of permutest the difference in variance is significant. I used the plot function to create the following: Given that there is a large extent of overlap in the plot, is it still coherent with the permutest?
