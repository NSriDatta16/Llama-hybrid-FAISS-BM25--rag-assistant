I extract a simple case : choosing between three hotels $H_1,H_1,H_2$ depending on their prices $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. This sounds like multinomial logistic regression but is not (as far as I can see). Like, in multinomial regression, the feature vector is $X=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and there are three "fixed" categories (even if they are not the same hostels, it does not matter). But in multinomial logistic regression the linear predictor associated to each category depends on the whole $X$. In terms of utility function, it's like the utility function of each hostel would depend on all $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. Actually, in your model, the utility function of $H_1$ depends only on $x_1$ : $\beta x_1$. More than this the utility function of $H_2$ depends on $x_2$ with the same coefficient (no reason why the "second" hostel should be treated differently from the first one) : $\beta x_2$ One solution is to get inspired by multinomial logistic regression and build your own model. I use the same notations as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression . The intercept can be dropped because it plays a redundant role (with $Z$). Call $h$ the choice variable (outcome) with values in $\{1,2,3\}$. The model can be: $P(h=k)=\frac{1}{Z}e^{\beta x_k}$ with $Z$ being the re-normalization coefficient equal to $Z=\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^3e^{\beta x_k}$ Now when the number of hostels varies, no problem, call $n$ the number of hostels: $P(h=k|n\text{ choices})=\frac{1}{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n e^{\beta x_k}}e^{\beta x_k}$ Then you can find $\beta$ with MLE. NOTE : this question may be strongly related to your problem : Alternatives to the multinomial logit model . What I described seens to be exactly conditional logit
