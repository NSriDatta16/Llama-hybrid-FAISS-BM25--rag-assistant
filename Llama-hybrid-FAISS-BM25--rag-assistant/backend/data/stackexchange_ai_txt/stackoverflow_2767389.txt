Referencing a theorem-like environment by its [name]

I am using ntheorem to typeset a set of conditions. In my preamble I have: \theoremstyle{empty} \newtheorem{Condtion}{Condtion} When I want to typeset a condition, I write: \begin{Condtion}[name] \label{cnd:nm} foo foo foo \end{Condition} The name appears boldface on the same line as the start of the text of the condition, with no number or anything. Perfect. What I want to do now is refer to the condition by some variant of the \ref command, \ref calls the number [which is not displayed anywhere else] \thref writes "Condition n" for the nth condition \nameref writes the name of the SECTION of the label. a zref solution was suggested here , but seems unsatisfactory and unwieldly. Any suggestions on a simple way to do this? (Even a simpler zref solution would be nice) At the moment I've just defined a \newcommand for each condition and use that rather than citing the condition itself. This is semantically opaque and just unsatisfying... (edit: I emailed one author of ntheorem, Wolfgang May, and he explained that there isn't really a way to do this within ntheorem, since the [name] option isn't recorded.) (edit: This isn't a dupe as suggested in the comment, since I'm interested in referencing an environment by its optional name command, not referencing the section/chapter it sits in.)
