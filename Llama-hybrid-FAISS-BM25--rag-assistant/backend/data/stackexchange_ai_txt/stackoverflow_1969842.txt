Storing information within the web application folder does not always work . Some application servers do not expand the deployed WAR file and hence there is no "working directory" for a web application. Some sys admins also prevent web applications file system access (that depends on the security manager policies). Temporary files should be used for, well, temporary data . Data which can be reconstructed on demand. Do not use temporary files which ought to be downloaded by users. E.g. when your system thinks it should clean up temporary files or when you restart the application server, the user still wants to download this files although they might be deleted in the mean time. The right place to store such data is the database . Your documents are not really temporary in the means of temp files. Use a database to store the documents and use the database as a cache for documents. You can then implement your own cleanup strategy. It also serves as a persistent storage, so you don't have to worry about server restarts. Also, you can have additional meta-data in there, such as last access time or an access counter and easily provide the user with a list of documents he created. If your document processing library requires a java.io.File for manipulation, only then store the document from the database into a temp file, start the processing and read it back into the database.
