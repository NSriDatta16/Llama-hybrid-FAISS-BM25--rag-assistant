You can simulate the iPhone user agent in Safari 5 if you set up the Developers menu item in Preferences>Advanced. The webkit engine in Safari 5 is similar to iPhone's browser so most of the HTML 5 stuff works the same. As a bonus the Developer's tab allows you to debug JavaScript and some CSS (not so well supported).
