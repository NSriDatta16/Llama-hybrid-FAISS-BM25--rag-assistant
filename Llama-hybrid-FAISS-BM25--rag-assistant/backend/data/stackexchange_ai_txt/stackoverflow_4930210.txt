How would you most efficiently store latitude and longitude data?

This question comes from a homework assignment I was given. You can base your storage system off of one of the three following formats: DD MM SS.S DD MM.MMM DD.DDDDD You want to maximize the amount of data you can store by using as few bytes as possible. My solution is based off the first format. I used 3 bytes for latitude: 8 bits for the DD (-90 to 90), 6 bits for the MM (0-59), and 10 bits for the SS.S (0-59.9). I then used 25 bits for the longitude: 9 bits for the DDD (-180 to 180), 6 bits for the MM, and 10 for the SS.S. This solution doesn't fit nicely on a byte border, but I figured the next reading can be stored immediately following the previous one, and 8 readings would use only 49 bytes. I'm curious what methods others can come up. Is there a more efficient method to storing this data? As a note, I considered an offset based storage, but the problem gave no indication of how much the values may change between readings, so I'm assuming any change is possible.
