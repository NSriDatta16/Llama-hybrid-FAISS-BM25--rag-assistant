That Wikipedia article writes, The process $X(t)$ is said to be mean-ergodic or mean-square ergodic in the first moment if the time average estimate $${\hat {\mu }}_{X}={\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}X(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$$ converges in squared mean to the ensemble average $\mu _{X}$ as $T\rightarrow \infty.$ The problem is that $\hat\mu$ becomes more and more variable as $T$ increases. This becomes apparent when $X(t)$ is the discrete Binomial random walk described in the question, because the time average is $$\hat\mu(X) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^T X(t) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^T \sum_{j=1}^i Z(i) = Z(1) + \frac{T-1}{T}Z(2) + \cdots + \frac{1}{T}Z(T).$$ Notice how the early terms persist: $Z(1)$ appears with coefficient $1$ and the coefficients of the subsequent $Z(i)$ converge to $1$ as $T$ grows. Their contributions to the time average therefore do not get averaged out and consequently the time average cannot converge to a constant. In the context and notation of the Wikipedia article, let's prove this result by finding the mean and variance of the time average. The expectation of $\hat{\mu}_X$ is $$\mathbb{E}(\hat{\mu}_X) = {\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}\mathbb{E}(X(t))\,\mathrm{d}t = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T 0\, \mathrm{d}t = 0.$$ Therefore its variance is the expectation of its square, $$\eqalign{ \operatorname{Var}(\hat{\mu}_X) &= \mathbb{E}\left(\hat{\mu}_X^2\right)\\ &= \mathbb{E}\left({\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}\mathbb{E}(X(t))\,\mathrm{d}t \ {\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}\mathbb{E}(X(s))\,\mathrm{d}s \right) \\ &= \left(\frac {1}{T}\right)^2 \int_0^T \int_0^T \mathbb{E}(X(t)X(s))\,\mathrm{d}t \mathrm{d}s \\ &= \left(\frac {1}{T}\right)^2 \int_0^T \int_0^T \min(s,t)\,\mathrm{d}t \mathrm{d}s \\ &= \left(\frac {1}{T}\right)^2 \int_0^T \left(\int_0^s t\,\mathrm{d}t + \int_s^T s\,\mathrm{d}t\right)\mathrm{d}s \\ &= \left(\frac {1}{T}\right)^2 \int_0^T \left(\frac{s^2}{2} + (T-s)s\right)\mathrm{d}s \\ &= \left(\frac {1}{T}\right)^2 \frac{T^3}{3} \\ &= \frac{T}{3}. }$$ Because this grows ever larger as $T$ grows, $\hat\mu_X$ cannot possibly converge to a constant as required by the definition of ergodicity--even though it has a constant average of zero. Whence Wikipedia writes (to quote the passage fully), An unbiased random walk is non-ergodic. Its expectation value is zero at all times, whereas its time average is a random variable with divergent variance.
