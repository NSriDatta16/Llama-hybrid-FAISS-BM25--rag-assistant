Winforms app which must include some freehand drawing

We have a customer who needs some simple forms (probably we would be creating a simple Winforms app for them) but there is a requirement to capture a mix of input fields plus some freehand drawing. It's the freehand drawing which worries us. They will be using a tablet pc with stylus. The customer is running Office 2007. This project needs to stay simple. We were thinking of embedding a OneNote element into our Winforms (is this even possible?). I have to admit to not having used OneNote but have a vague idea that it's the "kind of thing that would do freehand capture", which is why I mention it here. The embedding is a priority since we don't want the UI to involve dropping out into something else. I think. Or else some other free or low cost alternative. Any suggestions?
