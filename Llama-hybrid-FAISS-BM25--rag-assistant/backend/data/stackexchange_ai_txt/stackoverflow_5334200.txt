My bet is that this isn't a CSS issue. My guess is that its a png issue. Depending on which version of IE you're using the rendering will be different. The early days of PNG in IE were not pretty. Especially with regards to transparency. I'm not sure why you're using this approach. I would recommend using a fully-css approach instead. You should use the following css properties to adjust a css background color to the desired transparency: filter: alpha(opacity=50); /* internet explorer */ -khtml-opacity: 0.5; /* khtml, old safari */ -moz-opacity: 0.5; /* mozilla, netscape */ opacity: 0.5; /* fx, safari, opera */ I think you'll find this approach to be much cleaner and easier in the long run with more universal output. EDIT: As it was pointed out there is a glitch with my above recommended approach however it might be easier to get your current approach working using the techniques described here: http://www.daltonlp.com/view/217
