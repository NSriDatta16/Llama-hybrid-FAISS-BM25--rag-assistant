It seems like you might want datetime's "time" type, which doesn't care about date. import datetime ist_time = datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=5, minutes = 30) # Turn this into a time object (no day information). ist_time = ist_time.time() if datetime.time(9, 55) I'm sure there's a more elegant way to handle the timezone adjustment using tzinfo, but I have to confess I've never dealt with timezones.
