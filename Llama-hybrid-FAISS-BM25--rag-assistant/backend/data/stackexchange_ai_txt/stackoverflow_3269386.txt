Here's one: #!/bin/bash rm -rf newdir mkdir newdir for fspec in *.[ch] ; do indent "${fspec}" -cp33 -di16 -fc1 -fca -hnl -i4 -o "newdir/${fspec}" done Then , you check to make sure all the new files in newdir/ are okay before you copy them back over the originals manually: cp ${newdir}/* . That last paragraphe is important. I don't care how long I've been writing scripts, I always assume my first attempt will screw up and possible trash my files :-)
