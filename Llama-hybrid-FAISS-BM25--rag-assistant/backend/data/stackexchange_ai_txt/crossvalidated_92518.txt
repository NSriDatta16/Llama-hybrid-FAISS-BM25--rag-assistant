NB the deviance (or Pearson) residuals are not expected to have a normal distribution except for a Gaussian model. For the logistic regression case, as @Stat says, deviance residuals for the $i$th observation $y_i$ are given by $$r^{\mathrm{D}}_i=-\sqrt{2\left|\log{(1-\hat{\pi}_i)}\right|}$$ if $y_i=0$ & $$r^{\mathrm{D}}_i=\sqrt{2\left|\log{(\hat{\pi}_i)}\right|}$$ if $y_i=1$, where $\hat{\pi_i}$ is the fitted Bernoulli probability. As each can take only one of two values, it's clear their distribution cannot be normal, even for a correctly specified model: #generate Bernoulli probabilities from true model x mod #make quantile-quantile plot of residuals qqnorm(residuals(mod, type="deviance")) abline(a=0,b=1) But if there are $n_i$ replicate observations for the $i$th predictor pattern, & the deviance residual is defined so as to gather these up $$r^{\mathrm{D}}_i=\operatorname{sgn}({y_i-n_i\hat{\pi}_i})\sqrt{2\left[y_i\log{\frac{y_i}{n\hat{\pi}_i}} + (n_i-y_i)\log{\frac{n_i-y_i}{n_i(1-\hat{\pi}_i)}}\right]}$$ (where $y_i$ is now the count of successes from 0 to $n_i$) then as $n_i$ gets larger the distribution of the residuals approximates more to normality: #many replications per predictor value n mod #make quantile-quantile plot of residuals qqnorm(residuals(mod, type="deviance")) abline(a=0,b=1) Things are similar for Poisson or negative binomial GLMs: for low predicted counts the distribution of residuals is discrete & skewed, but tends to normality for larger counts under a correctly specified model. It's not usual, at least not in my neck of the woods, to conduct a formal test of residual normality; if normality testing is essentially useless when your model assumes exact normality, then a fortiori it's useless when it doesn't. Nevertheless, for unsaturated models, graphical residual diagnostics are useful for assessing the presence & the nature of lack of fit, taking normality with a pinch or a fistful of salt depending on the number of replicates per predictor pattern.
