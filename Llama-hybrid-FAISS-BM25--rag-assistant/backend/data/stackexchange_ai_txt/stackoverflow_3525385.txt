You could collect all the favorites to a list and pass them all at once to the next activity when the user finally wants to switch the page. Or of course, you could simply make the list a public static member which the favorites can access, or - my preference here - save all the favorites with a 3rd party which can also handle permanent storage of it. That way you also isolate some dependencies: the recipes page doesn't and shouldn't need to care about who uses the favorites data and how. Likewise, I don't assume the favorites page is interested in when a favorite is pressed, but what favorites exist when it needs to show them.
