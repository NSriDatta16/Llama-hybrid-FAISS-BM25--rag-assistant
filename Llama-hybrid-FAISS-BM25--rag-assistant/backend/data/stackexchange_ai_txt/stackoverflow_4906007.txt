But use the line of code above, every item in ObjectList has 'storage' pointing to the same memory location (essentially sharing the storage). If you've written proper copy-constructor for MyObject (and MyType if it also contains pointers), then that would not happen, because ObjectList is initialized with the copies of what you pass. By "proper" I meant copy-ctor which does deep-copy , instead of shallow-copy ! See this: What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?
