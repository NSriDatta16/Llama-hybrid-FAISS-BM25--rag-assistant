Test which time series is closer to zero

I have two time series, A and B, which represent reactions of subject A and B to a certain medication measured at different point in times. I want to formally test that the reaction of patient A is statistically smaller than patient B. Since reactions are coded such that they can be both positive and negative even for the same patient, I am interesting in showing that reaction of patient A is statistically closer to zero than that of patient B. At first, I though to take absolute values of both series and perform a Welch test, but in this way I mechanically bias the standard deviation and the mean of the series in a way that is not what I want: e.g. if A has reactions -2 and 1, and B has 1 and 1, the mean reaction of A is smaller than B (-0.5), but if I take absolute values and look at the means it seems instead that A has a bigger reaction (1.5). Somebody knows a formal test for my hypothesis?
