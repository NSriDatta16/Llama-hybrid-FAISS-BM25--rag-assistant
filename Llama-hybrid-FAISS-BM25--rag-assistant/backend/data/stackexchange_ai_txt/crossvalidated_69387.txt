This sounds like a functional data problem; the individual paths could be see as realisations from some underlying smooth curve (function) that you wish to estimate. Jim Ramsay has a nice website on FDA with various examples, which may give you a flavour of what FDA is and what it can do. Looking at @whuber's comment (in the gis.se Q&A) regarding the autocorrelation, that reminds me of some work of Rob Hyndman (@RobHyndman, also of this parish) on functional time series. This is not the same thing as @whuber mentions (the functional timeseries would view the individual realisations as being observed sequentially in time, i.e. the series of tracks represent a time series), but might give you ideas for how to consider handling the autocorrelation in the data. As for principal curves, the smoothers that are fitted to each variable and that describe the location of the curve along that dimension are essentially plugin components of the technique, at least in the way Hastie & Steutzle originally described the method. You could quite easily adapt the principal curve code in the R package princurve to use a plugin smoother that fitted curves allowing for residual correlation, for example by basing the smoother plugin on the gamm() function from the mgcv package, which can apply certain correlation structures for the covariance matrix of the fitted model. Doing this is not too hard, technically; I've done this myself recently to use Poisson GAMs as the smoothers instead of simple smoothing splines. If this looks like some half-baked suggestions, it is; I offer them as some observations seeing as the Question hadn't been Answered yet.
