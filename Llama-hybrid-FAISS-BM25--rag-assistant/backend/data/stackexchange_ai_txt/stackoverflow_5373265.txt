Custom MKAnnotation Image goes back to default when I attempt to drag

I've got a bunch of MKAnnotations that don't need dragging. I set this by [pin setDraggable:NO] . I'm having an issue when I touch the annotation and (accidentally) drag off an annotation, it instantly looses it's custom image and changes back to the default red pin. How do I prevent this from happening?
