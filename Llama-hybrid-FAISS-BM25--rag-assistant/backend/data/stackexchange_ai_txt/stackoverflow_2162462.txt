I think it's because of memory reallocations: ToList cannot know the size of the collection beforehand, so that it could allocate enough storage to keep all items. Therefore, it has to reallocate the List as it grows. If you can estimate the size of your resultset, it'll be much faster to preallocate enough elements using List (int) constructor overload, and then manually add items to it.
