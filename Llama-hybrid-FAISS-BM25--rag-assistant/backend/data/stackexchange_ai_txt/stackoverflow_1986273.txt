Spring Dynamic List Binding

I have a typical scenario - I have read many articles on this and dynamic addition seems to work fine. I could not get elegant solution for dynamic delete. A Web Form is simulating a User. User can have name and List of phoneNumbers. phoneNumbers can be added dynamically using Javascript at client side. Dynamic addition of phoneNumber into phoneNumbers is not a problem - Thanks to LazyList / AutoPopulatingList. Dynamic Deletion is kind of an issue. Let's say the web form was rendered with phoneNumbers as {1,3,5,7,9}. Using Javascript the user removes {1,3} without submitting the form. Now when the form is submitted user.phoneNumbers should automatically have {5,7,9}. Somehow, Spring MVC just doesn't contain the updated list. I am using annotation based controllers. Gurus any help?
