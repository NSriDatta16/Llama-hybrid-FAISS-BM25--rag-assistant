I did a bit of browsing on the web and I came across this example project . You might also check out the AI-Depot website here . Probably the reason there are not so many working examples is because AI decision algorithms, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and decision trees get very complex, very quickly. Most developers of such algorithms, at least the algorithms that are stable and actually work, are very protective of their IP. And, for good reason. In any case, hope this helped. Let It Be Known
