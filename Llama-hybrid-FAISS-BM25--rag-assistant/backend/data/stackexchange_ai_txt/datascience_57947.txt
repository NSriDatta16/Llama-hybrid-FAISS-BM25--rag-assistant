Training the document page layout and classifying good/bad layouts

I have a use case where I am supposed to get the coordinates of each block element in a page (whether its paragraph, image, table) where I train a model to understand how they are placed in a given page where some documents are with good layout and other with bad ones and I want to train this and throw in some coordinates of a new document and try to understand whether it has a good layout or a bad layout, I want to understand how I can achieve this using some deep learning techniques ? can someone suggest me an approach for solving this? Was trying to workout with RNN but not sure if that's the correct approach.
