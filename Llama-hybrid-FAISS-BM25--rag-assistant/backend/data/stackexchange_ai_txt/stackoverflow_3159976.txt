Neural networks, how do they look in coding?

Basically i know the concept of a neural network and what it is, but i can't figure out how it looks when you code it or how do you store the data, i went through many tutorials that i found on google but couldn't find any piece of code, just concepts and algorithms. Can anyone give me a piece of code of a simple neural network something like "Hello World!"?
