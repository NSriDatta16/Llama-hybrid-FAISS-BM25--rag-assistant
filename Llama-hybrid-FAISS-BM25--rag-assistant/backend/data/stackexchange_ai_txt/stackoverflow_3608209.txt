960 grid system - nested grids have layout problem

I've just started developing a hobby site for myself, and trying to use the 960 css grid system to layout my html elements on screen. I got the basic idea and just implemented a skeleton website here on my server There are several questions I've got so far: Home Fake1 Fake2 Fake3 log in faq LOGO, TITLE and SLOGAN all go here! I am using a grid 12 based template, hence the total number of "grids" on each "row" should be 12. However, I can only make the two elements on the same "row" with total number of grids added up to 11, but not 12. If I change the #user_panel"'s class to "grid_3 prefix4", then that would actually take this element to the next line, which breaks everything. Another thing is, although the first-level elements such as the top_bar and title_bar are on the right position (you can confirm that using a handy Firefox plugin gridfox ), with exact width of 940px, the nested grids are not in positions they are supposed to be (a bit away from the designed positions). I am new to this css grid system, is there a better way to manage the nest elements? I have to say some of the sample websites on the 960.gs are quite amazing to see :) Thanks for any suggestion in advance! Updated Info Okay, based on the answer below, I reckon it is still possible to use colored borders when debugging the nested grids, there is an adhoc way to "cheat": .grid_insider { border : 1px solid red; margin : -1px; /* this will stop the element from 'expanding' its space */ }
