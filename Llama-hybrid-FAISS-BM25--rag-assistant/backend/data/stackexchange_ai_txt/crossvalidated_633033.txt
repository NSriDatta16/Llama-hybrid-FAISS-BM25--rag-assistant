Specifically for random forest, if we grow enough trees, the out-of-bag predictions approximate the average prediction error (the error estimated using a test dataset) of a random forest. So, we don't really need a test dataset in that case. This result is shown in Tomoshige Nakamura's (2023) presentation: https://math.bu.edu/BKT2023/slides/Nakamura-variable_importance_for_causal_forest.pdf
