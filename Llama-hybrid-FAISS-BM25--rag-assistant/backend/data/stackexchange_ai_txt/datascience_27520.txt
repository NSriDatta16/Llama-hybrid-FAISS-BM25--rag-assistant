Training Neural network classifier using string inputs

My thesis topic is about building a (deep) neural-network classifier to classify the type of a place. I am given both labels and some inputs in string type. So for example the label "Supermarket" might have a feature like "Food". How should I feed my string input features to the neural network? In other words, is there any efficient way to substitute those string inputs with numerical values knowing that there are A LOT of them?
