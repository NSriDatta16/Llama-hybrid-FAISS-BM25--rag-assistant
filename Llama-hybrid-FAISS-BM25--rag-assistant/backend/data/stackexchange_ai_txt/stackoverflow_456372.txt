I think by saying classes, you should mean objects. Classes are nothing but place where you can put in your objects. The OOP paradigm is so successful for a reason. Once you've have that 'aha!' moment when you think you've finally understood the concept of OOP, you can start programming in a much more organised fashion. I've programmed in Visual Basic 3 for a long time, so I had a lot of experience with functional programming, then coming to VB5 and discovering objects was an immense relief because I could relate real-world entities into my code, and it helped a lot. That's the entire point of it, recreating real-world entities in your code. It makes reading and working easier cause you can pick up something and do stuff with it, or do stuff to it.
