Yes, prior measurement should be included because it explains variance in your outcome and therefore, it will increase the sensitivity of your test. Also, it will make you more sure that you measured the treatment effect, and not just which group had higher/lower average volume already before treatment. Another possibility is to test volume change instead of volume after treatment, but as far as I know, using the prior measurement as a covariate is the preferred option because it's more sensitive.
