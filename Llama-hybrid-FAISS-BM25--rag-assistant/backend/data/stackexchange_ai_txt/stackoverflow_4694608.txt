GLSL Checkerboard Pattern

i want to shade the quad with checkers: f(P)=[floor(Px)+floor(Py)]mod2. My quad is: glBegin(GL_QUADS); glVertex3f(0,0,0.0); glVertex3f(4,0,0.0); glVertex3f(4,4,0.0); glVertex3f(0,4, 0.0); glEnd(); The vertex shader file: varying float factor; float x,y; void main(){ x=floor(gl_Position.x); y=floor(gl_Position.y); factor = mod((x+y),2.0); } And the fragment shader file is: varying float factor; void main(){ gl_FragColor = vec4(factor,factor,factor,1.0); } But im getting this: It seems that the mod function doeasn't work or maybe somthing else... Any help?
