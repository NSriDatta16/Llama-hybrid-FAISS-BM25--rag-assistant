J(2)EE, strictly speaking, is a set of API s (as the current top answer has it) which enable a programmer to build distributed, transactional systems. The idea was to abstract away the complicated distributed, transactional bits (which would be implemented by a Container such as WebSphere or Weblogic), leaving the programmer to develop business logic free from worries about storage mechanisms and synchronization. In reality, it was a cobbled-together, design-by-committee mish-mash, which was pushed pretty much for the benefit of vendors like IBM, Oracle and BEA so they could sell ridicously over-complicated, over-engineered, over-useless products. Which didn't have the most basic features (such as scheduling)! J2EE was a marketing construct.
