easiest to use a discrete time survival model, aka any probabilistic classifier (eg logistic regression or xgboost) , which predicts probably of churn in next period, given didn't churn until then. Then you can calculate any arbitrary payoff as the sum of probability of churning at each period x payoff at each period (for example)
