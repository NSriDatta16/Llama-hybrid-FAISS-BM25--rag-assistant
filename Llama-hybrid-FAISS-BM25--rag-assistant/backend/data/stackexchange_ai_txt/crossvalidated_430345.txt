Groups of correlated time series prediction

Consider two group of time series $X$ and $Y$ . Both $X$ and $Y$ contain time series $\{x_0,..., x_N\}$ and $\{y_0,..., y_N\}$ , respectively. Within each group, the time series are correlated and also there is correlation across the groups so that $(x_i, y_j)$ have non-zero correlation. The times series in $Y$ is sparely populated and $X$ has complete information. How might I design a model to fill in the missing data in $Y$ ?
