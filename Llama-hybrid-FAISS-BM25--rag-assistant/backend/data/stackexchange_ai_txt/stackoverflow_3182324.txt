Citrix IE detection

We have a website, which many users are accessing through Citrix. Certain things (namely video) drag down the Citrix server so much that I don't even want to try launching a video if the user is connecting from that. Is there some way (on the web server end) of detecting if the browser that's connecting is being hosted by citrix? Everyone will be using IE 7 or 8 if that is relevant. I did a dump of all the request parameters and scanned through window.* and window.navigator.* but didn't seem to find anything.
