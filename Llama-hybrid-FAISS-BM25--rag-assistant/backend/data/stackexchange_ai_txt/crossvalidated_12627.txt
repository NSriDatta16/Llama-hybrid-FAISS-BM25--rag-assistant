Can an observed variable be the parent of a latent variable in a Bayesian network?

This may be a silly question, but I'm not seeing a clear answer in any of the usual sources. I'm preparing to build a Bayesian model to fit with BUGS/JAGS, currently working through the model logic in plate notation. I have a few kinds of observed variables, and several latent variables. I know that a Bayesian model has to be a DAG. What other conceptual constraints are there on the network? In particular, can an observed variable be the parent of a latent variable in a Bayesian model? Thanks, and happy fourth of July to all the Americans out there.
