Optimise SVM to avoid false-negative in binary classification

I am training an SVM binary classifier using Scikit learn. Due to the nature of my problem I need to avoid false negatives. As nothing is free I am okay getting a higher rate of false positives in order to reduce the number of false negatives. How can we do that (ideally with Scikit learn)? In other words, how can we minimise false negatives using an SVM classifier ? Is there some way to tune hyper parameters in order to favor false positives over false negatives?
