Best way to access a control on another form in Windows Forms?

First off, this is a question about a desktop application using Windows Forms, not an ASP.NET question. I need to interact with controls on other forms. I am trying to access the controls by using, for example, the following... otherForm.Controls["nameOfControl"].Visible = false; It doesn't work the way I would expect. I end up with an exception thrown from Main . However, if I make the controls public instead of private , I can then access them directly, as so... otherForm.nameOfControl.Visible = false; But is that the best way to do it? Is making the controls public on the other form considered "best practice"? Is there a "better" way to access controls on another form? Further Explanation: This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, Best method for creating a “tree-view preferences dialog” type of interface in C#? . The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface. Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a "who's on first" kind of way.)
