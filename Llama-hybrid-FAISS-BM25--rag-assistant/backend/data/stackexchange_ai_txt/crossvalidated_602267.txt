Are the assumptions of collinearity and no influential observations relevant when all predictor (independent) variables are categorical?

In order to run a simple linear model (e.g. using lm() function in R) I am under the impression that the following assumptions must be met: Normality of residuals Homoscedasticity No collinearity (independent variables independent of one another) No evidence of serial-autocorrelation No evidence of unduly influential observations Linear relationship between X and Y All observations of Y are independent of one another Would I also be correct in assuming that assumptions 3, 6 and 5 are irrelevant when all independent variables in the model are categorical? In particular, with regards to assumption 5, I thought that these observations can be identified by calculating Cooks distance for each observation and seeing whether or not it exists above a threshold value. Cooks distance requires leverage in order to be calculated however I am confused how this can be calculated when the independent variables are not continuous? I apologize if this is a silly question as my knowledge of statistics is mostly self-taught.
