I discussed my issue with calculating accuracy of the result of my experiment with my colleagues and some professors at my University and one of them had a very simple and interesting solution that I want to share. First let's make it clear what did I wrong. I have made direct measurements and processed them to calculate my result. So in the end I made an indirect measurement of average vaporization rate. So normal aproach would be to find out how accurate were all te factors that were used to calculate the end result. Then use the gaussian propagation of uncertainty to calculate how accurate my results are. But instead of doing it, I calculated uncertainty of values half way through getting to end result and then didn't know what's next. So in my case: Ignore the uncertainty of the slope angle, calculate the uncertainty of vaporisation rate in one swoop. To calculate the propagation of uncertainty one would need to formulate a single formula where you enter all measured data and the end result pops out, then calculate derivatives for all variables. But not always it is possible. In my case there was no single formula, it was rather a step by step calculation. But there is a way to make ones life much simpler: There is one pre condition - the whole calculation should be parametrically connected. It means if I would change some input values, then the end result would be recalculated. So using "isert a trendline" option in excel and then typing the slope of regression line for further calculation is not possible. You have to calculate regression line parameters yourself and then link to them in further calculation. Then you make a fixed copy of the end result per copy -> paste -> only values after that you chande value of one input parameter by a small amount. For example increase weight of one measurement by dm = 0,1 g . Then make another fixed copy of the freshly calculated result. Substract both results from another to get dE (E stands for end result). You divide dE/dm and voil√† there you have a derivative for weight. You continue for all input data and proceed with the gaussian propagation of uncertainty. It may look suspicous to you, this skipping of analytical derivation and doing it numericaly, but it is commonly used when dealing with complex systems like when calculating a power plant and it gives just the same results as analitycal approach.
