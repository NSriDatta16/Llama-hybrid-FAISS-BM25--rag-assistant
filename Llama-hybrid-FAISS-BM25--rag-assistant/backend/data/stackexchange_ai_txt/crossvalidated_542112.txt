Average time to win "Catch (Chase) the Ace!"

Catch (Chase) the Ace! is a popular lottery card game that is often played to win large sums of money and to donate funds to worthy charities. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_the_Ace_(lottery) Gameplay involves a standard 52-card deck. The objective is to select the Ace of Spades. According to the Wikipedia Article: The jackpot accumulates from week-to-week until it is won, and the game is then over. Each week participants buy lottery tickets. The funds from ticket sales are divided into three parts. Typically the organizers keep 50% (donated to charity), the winner of the weekly lottery takes 20%, and the remaining 30% goes into the jackpot. The lottery winner also then draws a card from a deck of playing cards and wins the accumulated jackpot if the ace of spades is drawn. If not, the reduced deck is kept for the following week's game, and the jackpot rolls over to the next week. I'm interested in the mathematical/probabilistic aspects of the game and so wrote a quick R simulation. # Playing Card Alphabet cards $",jackpot, "\n \n") break } else { cat("\n Outcome: Sorry, you didn't select the Ace of Spades! Better luck next time! \n Payoff: $ ",(0.20 * payoff)) # 20% of ticket sales goes to winning ticket holder each week } cat("\n Proceeds donated to charity: $",(0.50 * payoff), "\n \n") # 50% of all ticket sales goes to charity } cards I wondered about the mean time to winning. So I tried it out, simulating 10000 runs. Mean number of weeks to win (similarly, cards to draw) mean(replicate(10000, catch.ace(ticket.price = ticket.price, max.num.tickets = max.num.tickets)$week)) The answer is around 26 (52/2) weeks (similarly, 26 cards to draw), which is about 6 months. My question : Is there an easy way to arrive at a closed form expression for the expectation and other quantities (such as the variance)?
