Why 13 places in ROT13?

I understand the reasons for and against ROT13, but I'm wondering why specifically people have chosen 13 places to shift the alphabet? I understand it's halfway around, but is there an elegant reason to go -that- far, but not 12 or 14 spots? It seems to me like making each letter "as far away" as possible from its starting position only is meaningful to a human who might recognize "close" characters (although I doubt this is possible/probable). Anyone know the answer to this?
