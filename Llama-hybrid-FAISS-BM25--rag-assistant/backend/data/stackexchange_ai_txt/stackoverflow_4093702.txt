Native events are fired directly by the browser - events like clicks, mouseovers, keypresses, etc. To receive those events on a Widget, you have to specifically sink the events. The generic events are, well, more generic. For example, I've created a SaveEvent and a DeleteEvent for my own use, that get fired when certain UI conditions are met. They are farther away from the browser and would never get fired directly by the browser. I think you should stick with the more generic events when you can. On the other hand, if you're creating a custom widget that you can't make out of other widgets - for example, if you want to build a slider that the user can click and drag - you'll need the DOM events.
