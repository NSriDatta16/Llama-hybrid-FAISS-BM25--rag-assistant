Where is the Shape located on Canvas?

Say I put a Shape on a Canvas like this: Canvas.SetLeft(myShape, 50); Canvas.SetTop(myShape, 30); canvas.Children.Add(myShape); After that, myShape was drag & dropped on this Canvas. How can I determine the current myShape coordinates ? For example, before the drag & drop I would like to get (50,30). Thanks !
