Recommendations for Master courses in Data Science in Europe

I am hoping somebody can help a (hopefully) future data scientist: I am looking for a Master course in data science at a school in Europe. I have a Bachelor in Media Management (PR & Communication) and have then worked for several year as a market place manager for an international online retailer. I am now looking to pivot more into the data science part of this and am searching for a suitable master program. Given that I do not come from a mathematics or computer science background I need a master program that focusses more on teaching how to apply known methods with existing tools rather than prepare me to implement the data science methods from scratch or to do in depth research on developing new machine learning algorithms. Can somebody recommend any courses that would work for me? Many thanks in advance for your help. Edit 1: I should probably add that I speak English and German.
