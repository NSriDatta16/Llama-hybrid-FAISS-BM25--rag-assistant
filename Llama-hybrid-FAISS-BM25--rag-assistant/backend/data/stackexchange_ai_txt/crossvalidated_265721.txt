This is probably not the most elegant solution, however it is very straightforward. Use another "for" loop and save the results in a list. runs = 100 Res = list() for(k in 1:runs){ set.seed(123) N=1000 U=runif(N, min=0,max=1) X= matrix(0, nrow=N, ncol=2) for (i in 1:N){ if(U[i] The command > Res[[1]] will now give you the results of the first simulation. Please note that by setting set.seed(123) inside the for loop, every simulation will yield exactely the same result.
