I agree mostly with Paul Betts, Ryan and Dan. Really, it's up to the developer, you can either keep the default alignment symanic's which Robert noted about (Robert's explanation is just the default behaviour and not by any means enforced or required), or you can setup whatever alignment you want /Zp[##]. What this means is that if you have a typedef with floats', long double's, uchar's etc... various assortments of arrays's included. Then have another type which has some of these oddly shaped members, and a single byte, then another odd member, it will simply be aligned at whatever preference the make/solution file defines. As noted earlier, using windbg's dt command at runtime you can find out how the compiler laid out the structure in memory. You can also use any pdb reading tool like dia2dump to extract this info from pdb's statically.
