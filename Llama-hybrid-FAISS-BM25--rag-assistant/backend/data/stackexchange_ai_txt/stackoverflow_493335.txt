Drawing massive amounts of data in NSView, or something else?

I have hundreds of thousands of points of time series data that I want to represent to the user. My current solution is to render said data to a PNG with a 3rd party library and then load that PNG into a NSImage and display it in a scroll view. This works great, except that: NSImages more than 32k pixels wide don't display properly I want to be able to zoom into the data quickly and easily Reading to and writing from disk is stupid My current attempt is to directly draw NSBezierPath s to a NSView . The view renders beautifully, but very, very slowly, even if I only draw a limited subset of points at a time. And every time I scroll I have to re-draw which is also slow. I'm certain, as a relative Cocoa newbie, that I'm missing some better ways to do this. What's the "right" way to do it?
