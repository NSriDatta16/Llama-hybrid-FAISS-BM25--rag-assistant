Call Another Source File

I'm building a program(in 16-Bits) using Assembly(nasm as the assembler), but as I love to have things organized in different source files. Let's think I have 2 sources, one called main.asm and another one called source2.asm , but I want to call the source1.asm content in the middle of main.asm . How could I do this?
