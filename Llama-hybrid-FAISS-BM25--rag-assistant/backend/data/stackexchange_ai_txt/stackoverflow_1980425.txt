MVC user created values -- Is reflection my only hope?

Is it possible to determine if a controller exists before attempting to return the View? In my scenerio, my action value in my URL represents a user created value, and the id represents the controller. i.e. http://mysite.com/systems/WIN1234/Configure ...where WIN1234 is dynamically routed to the Configure action. Because I would like to keep my URLs completely hackable, I would like to determine if Configure exists before... return View(action) ...where action is my passed in string containing Configure . The first thing that pops into my head is looking at the assembly using reflection, but before I go that far, and because of my wet ears in MVC, I would like to know if there is a more elegant way to make this determination. i.e. ...something like: if(DoesControllerExist(action)) return View(action) ...where DoesControllerExist is a built in MVC function. Any of you experts have any ideas? Thanks, George
