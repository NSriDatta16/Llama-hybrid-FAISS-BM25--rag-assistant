I want to make a web browser, but I'm not sure where to start?

I want to use WebKit as the layout/rendering engine, and I want to code it in Java. I am having troubles finding any useful info. I saw this question here which cleared things for me slightly, but I need more to get started. I would like to know: If I can use Java? Where can I find documentation on how to work with and use WebKit? ( I am looking for something like the Java API ) Is there a WebKit build compiled for Linux? ( Specifically Ubuntu/Debian ) My plan thus far: Learn to use/interact with WebKit and its components specifically JavascriptCore. Create the UI, etc. in Java and create a basic browser. ( For now, I want to create a basic window that can display a webpage correctly. ) Sorry if this isn't very clear. I am still hatching ideas, and I am not really sure what I want to find or need in order to move forward. Edit: I just came across this question here . I want to do something like that; so I guess what I am wondering is how do I go about embedding an engine like this into an application that I make myself? I also forgot to mention that I am willing to do this in other languages. ( By this I mean C++ )
