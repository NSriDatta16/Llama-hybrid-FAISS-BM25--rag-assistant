The confusion has already been clarified in the comments above, but I would like to provide an answer so that this thread can be closed. R's function prcomp() takes as an input a data matrix with variables in columns. In your example you have variables in rows, which results in center=T argument not working correctly (it centers columns, not rows) and renders PCA invalid. The solution is to transpose the data matrix.
