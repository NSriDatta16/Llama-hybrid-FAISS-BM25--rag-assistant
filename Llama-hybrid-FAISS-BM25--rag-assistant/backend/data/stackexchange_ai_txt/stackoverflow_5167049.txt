On you're specific page, you'll have to detect if the browser which is loading the page is a mobile one or not -- and, if it is, redirect the user to another page. In order to detect if a user is using a mobile browser, you can use solutions such as WURFL . But note that it's the browser itself that's indicating if it's a mobile one... so that information is not to be trusted. Several mobile browsers allow the user to change the User-Agent that's sent to the server -- quite often, that feature used because the user feels his choice is better than the webmaster's one (I'm the best placed to judge if I want to see the mobile website, or the non-mobile one !) Generally speaking, you should : Detect if a user is using a mobile device If he not is (and is on the mobile website) , suggest him to visit the normal website If he is (and is on the normal website) , suggest him to visit the mobile website. But : Never trust the User-Agent. And let each user the choice.
