Wilcox.test for testing count based data in R studio large W

I'm doing a textmining project about a videogame review dataset. I divided de reviews into a positive (reviewgrade > 8) and negative (reviewgrade 0 13249 1 1565 2 292 3 65 4 19 5 6 6 4 7 3 8 2 9 1 Name: positive: gameplay, dtype: int64 0 5043 1 348 2 66 3 18 4 8 5 3 Name: negative: gameplay, dtype: int64 For example this are the distributions of the amount of reviews which have a certain amount of mentions of gameplay related words. There are for example 1565 reviews with precisely 1 mention of a word related to the category gameplay. Now I want to use this data to determine if on average gameplay gets mentioned more in negative context than in positive or vice versa. Because the data is not normal distributed, I assumed a t-test is not appropriate, and found online that a Mannâ€“Whitney U test might be suitable. > wilcox.test(positive $gameplay, negative$ gameplay, alternative = "two.sided", conf.int = TRUE) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: positive $gameplay and negative$ gameplay W = 43702925, p-value I do however get a very high W value, which doesn't seem to be correct. Is this not the appropriate test, or am I interpreting this wrong?
