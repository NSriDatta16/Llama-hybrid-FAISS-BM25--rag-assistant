If you use " as text in XML, you need to escape it, else it is considered markup. So xml.dom is right in escaping it, since you've asked for a text node. Assuming you really want to insert a piece of XML, I recommend to use createElement("hello") . If you have a fragment of XML that you don't know the structure of, you should first parse it, and then move the nodes of that parse result into the other tree. If you want to hack, you can inherit from xml.dom.minidom.Text, and overwrite the writexml method. See the source of minidom for details.
