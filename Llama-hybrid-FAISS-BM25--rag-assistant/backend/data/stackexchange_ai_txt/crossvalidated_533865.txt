Neural Network Architecture for Image to Image Supervised Learning?

I have a task where I would like to create a supervised learning model where each training record of X,y is a pair of images. e.g. learning a transformation from an image to an image. Is there a standard neural network architecture for such a learning task? I can see hypothetically RNN/Transformers (as a sequence to sequence task), CNNs (due to use of images), or GANs (used for generating images). Ideally something with a published pretrained model I could leverage for transfer learning? Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this sort of question. Any help much appreciated!
