I think you're asking about payloads . Edit: From your use case, it sounds like you have no desire to use this metadata in your search, you just want it there. (Basically, you want to use Lucene as a database system.) So, why can't you use a binary field? ExtraData ed = new ExtraData { Tag = "tag", Type = "personal" }; byte[] byteData = BinaryFormatter.Serialize(ed); // this isn't the correct code, but you get the point doc.Add(new Field("myData", byteData, Field.Store.YES)); Then you can deserialize it on retrieval.
