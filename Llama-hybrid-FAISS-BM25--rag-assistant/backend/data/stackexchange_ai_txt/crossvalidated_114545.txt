With Random Forests, is it possible to provide an error term for each variable or each sample?

I'm wondering if there are any implementations of random forests that allow one to provide error terms for the inputs. An error term could be based on a per-variable basis, or on a per-sample/variable basis. If an error term was specified on a per variable basis, we would let the random forest algorithm know that "this variable $A$ has a sampling error of $\pm 5\%$, whereas this variable $B$ has a sampling error of $\pm 10\%$". If an error term was specified on a per sample/variable basis, we would specify the error terms on all individual samples. We would let the random forest know that "for sample 1, variable $A$ has a sampling error of $\pm 5\%$, and variable B has a sampling error of $\pm 8\%$, whereas sample 2, variable $A$ has a sampling error of $\pm 6\%$ and variable $B$ has a sampling error of $\pm 12\%$". I am particularly interested in implementations in R, C++, C# or Python.
