Pure PCA will have no effect. If you run PCA, estimate a VAR on the principal components (PCs) and convert the estimated coefficients on the PCs to the coefficients on the original variables, you will get the same coefficient values as from simply running a VAR model on the original data. Even if you skip 3. and use the model from 2. for forecasting, you will still get the same forecasts as from the simple VAR on the original data. The intuition is that PCs span the same space as the original variables; thus a projection on the PCs will have the same residuals and the same proportion of explained variance as a projection on the original variables.
