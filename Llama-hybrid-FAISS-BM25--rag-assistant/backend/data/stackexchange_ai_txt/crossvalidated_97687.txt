Sampling from Bayesian regression predictive posterior

I have the following problem: I want to obtain a predictive posterior distribution for the target logistic regression variable $y$. That is to say, given a combination of explanatory variables $X$, I want to obtain the conditional distribution $P(y|X)$ from the model. Am I correctly supposing that I need to sample a Bayesian model via MCMC to correctly approximate the predictive posterior? Or is there any easier way? What would the best approach to such a problem be? Also, given that I effectively have thousands of dummy explanatory variables, is it even possible to handle such a huge parameter number through sampling methods? I would really appreciate any help here.
