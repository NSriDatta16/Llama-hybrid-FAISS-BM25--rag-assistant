Why wouldn't the default Control Adapter mappings work on Chrome or Safari?

I have confirmed that my Control Adapters are not triggering in Chrome and Safari. I've debugged, and the breakpoints inside the adapters just don't get hit in Chrome/Safari, when they work perfectly find in Firefox/IE. So, for Chrome/Safari, IIS is just ignoring the mapping. My AdapterMappings.browser file looks like this: [...adapters here....] This should provide mappings for all browsers, correct? I used the Charles proxy to check what user agents were being sent. They are: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.1.249.1064 Safari/532.5 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.22.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Safari/531.22.7 Any idea why this would be? Everything I've read tells me that my browser mappings are correct? And, as I said this works for IE/Firefox, so I know my configuration is technically correct.
