Sudden increase or decrease in time series

There is a call center which records the number of complaints against a service on daily basis. For example, the values below show the number of complaints for the last 6 months of a service: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun 020, 030, 010, 030, 045, 065 Question: How one can find sudden increase/decrease in number of complaints for a service over a period of time OR sudden increase/decrease in number of accidents/births/tourists/students/etc in last 6 months? sudden increase/decrease should be adjustable for sudden and increase/decrease . I need help and suggestions to figure out possible solutions. Edit # 1 This approach has to be automated. A computer program will analyze a certain window of historic data and will identify sudden increase or decrease. So basically there are two problems: A modal to identify sudden change Quantification of the modal Time plot or Linear Graph can be used to plot the changes. But I don't know how to quantify this plot/graph. Any suggestion in this area will be helpful. Edit # 2 I received following advice from someone. Hope it help Take your deltas: 10, -20, 20, 15, 20 and find the mean and std dev of their absolute values. The numbers outside of say two standard deviations that are big numbers show you sudden increase/decrease. The small ones outside of two standard deviations show unusual stability. The rest are just your normal slow drift. I only see slow drifting in these numbers. Edit # 3 As shown in this picture, the red line is a normal condition for last 6 months while blue line indicates a sudden increase in last 4 months of 6 month window. Edit # 4 Instead of rephrasing this whole question, i have posted a new question as How to quantify increasing nature of dataset . I will delete this question.
