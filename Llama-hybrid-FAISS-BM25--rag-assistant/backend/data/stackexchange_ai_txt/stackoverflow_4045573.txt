I do not think there is a way to customize the rounding mode used by the numeric functions. (Though I could be wrong) You may have to dip into java for customized rounding behavior Update My mistake. I thought the need was for something basic masks did not already provide. Oh, well. Maybe this example will be useful to someone anyway .. Update Added HALF_UP rounding mode example (Note: The Locale handling is quick and dirty. I am sure there is a more elegant way of doing it..) Input #input# HALF_EVEN #Formatter.format(input)# HALF_DOWN #Formatter.format(input)# HALF_UP #Formatter.format(input)#
