Data embedding in a binary image using python

I'm new to python and I'm attempting to improve on an existing method of embedding data in a binary image with minimal visual distortion. The current method that I am trying to implement needs to have a 3x3 moving window that centers on each pixel and analyses the smoothness of the area within the window and the amount of black and white clusters. This information would then be passed into a decision module that will decide on the best pixel to alter in order to embed data. I've played around with PIL and numPy, but without much success so any suggestions to get me started would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
