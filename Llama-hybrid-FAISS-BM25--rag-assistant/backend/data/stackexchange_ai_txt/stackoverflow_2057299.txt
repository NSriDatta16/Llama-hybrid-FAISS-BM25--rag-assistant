As you can imagine, that's not a simple subject. So I would partition it this way: minimally, your question comprises two aspects of security: Authentication: knowing who your calling party is Authorization: knowing what that calling part is allowed to do You have different options for both. For ex. you can handle authentication through multiple standards like WS-{Security|Trust|etc} and, in the other end, authorization through AzMan roles (which BTW doesn't scale very well). With respect to technology, I agree with other posts, you should opt for WCF. That allows you to leverage those standards and present you more options for the different aspects of security, including auditing.
