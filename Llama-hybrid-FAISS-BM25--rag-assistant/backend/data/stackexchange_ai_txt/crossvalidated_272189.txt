The issue with reconstruction error given in the user20160's answer is that any set of principal components that spans the same subspace will have the same reconstruction error. If your goal is reconstruction, then that's fine. But, if you want any smaller subset of your principal components to be as good as possible for reconstruction, which is what PCA also promises, then that solution doesn't help you. In fact, you can quantify how good a set of principal components is even if the components span the entire subspace. Here's how. Set everything up the same way as in user20160's answer. However, let's centre everything so that we can forget about the means. Let $S$ be the variance of the data: \begin{align} S &\triangleq Var(x) \end{align} I will also use the same notation as user20160 except my $W$ is going to match the cited paper below: \begin{align} W &\triangleq \Gamma^{-\frac12}U^T \end{align} My $U$ is user20160's $W$. It is the orthogonal matrix that the rotates the directions of greatest variation to the principal axes; these are the eigenvectors of the variance matrix $S$. $\Gamma$ is the magnitude of the variances in each direction; these are the eigenvalues of $S$. With this definition, $W$ is a whitening transformation, and we want to know how good $W$ is. Let the variance matrix defined by the test data be \begin{align} S' \triangleq Var(x') \end{align} Define the cross-covariance matrix \begin{align} \Phi &\triangleq Cov(y', x') \\ &= Cov(Wx', x') \\ &= WS' \end{align} Define the sum of squared-cross-covariances: \begin{align} \phi_i &\triangleq \sum_{j=1}^d \Phi_{ij}^2 \\ &= \sum_{j=1}^d Cov(y'_i, x'_i)^2. \end{align} Then, it has been shown† that PCA is the unique whitening transformation that maximizes $\phi_i$ subject to the constraint that they are in decreasing order. On the training data, this sum would be maximized. On the testing data, this sum of squared-cross-covariances quantifies how good your components are. † A. Kessy, A. Lewin, and K.
