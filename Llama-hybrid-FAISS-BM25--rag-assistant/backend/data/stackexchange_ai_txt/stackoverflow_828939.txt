From my own personal experience I refactor because I find if I make software the way I want it made from first go that it takes a very long time to create something. Therefore I value the pragmatism of developing software over clean code. Once I have something running I then begin to refactor it into the way it should be. Needless to say, the code never devolves into a piece of unreadable tripe. Just a side note - I did my degree in software engineering after reading some material from Steve Mcconnell as a teen. I love design patterns, good code reuse, nicely thought out designs and so on. But I find when working on my own projects that designing things initially from that point of view just doesnt work unless I'm an absolute expert with the technology I'm using (Which is never the case)
