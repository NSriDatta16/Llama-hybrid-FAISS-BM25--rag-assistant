You mentioned you have not done hyperparameter tuning as of yet, but I would be curious to know how deep you are letting your trees grow, as this would obviously materially affect your results. You also mentioned you have a smaller dataset here, so this type of results is to be expected, given the sensitivity (high variance) of DTs. I would strongly suggest you take a look at using Random Forest classification as opposed to regular decision trees, which doesn't requite too much additional complexity in code, but should address the issues related to the high variance of decision trees you are seeing here. Additionally, though most still do so, you can actually get away without doing cross-validation for Random Forests, as you can just look at the OOB score Hopefully that's helpful!
