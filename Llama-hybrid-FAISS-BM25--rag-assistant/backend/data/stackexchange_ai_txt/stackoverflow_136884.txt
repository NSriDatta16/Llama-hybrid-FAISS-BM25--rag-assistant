How do I simultaneously (1) keep a from taking up all available width and (2) make it collapse margins with its neighbors?

Is it possible to have a simultaneously (1) not take up all available width and (2) collapse margins with its neighbors? I learned recently that setting a div to display:table will stop it from expanding to take up the whole width of the parent container -- but now I realize that this introduces a new problem: it stops collapsing margins with its neighbors. In the example below, the red div fails to collapse, and the blue div is too wide. This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around. This is a div with 100px margin all around and display:table. The problem is that it doesn't collapse margins with its neighbors. This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around. This is a div with 100px margin all around and display:block. The problem is that it expands to take up all available width. This is a paragraph with 100px margin all around. Is there a way to meet both criteria simultaneously?
