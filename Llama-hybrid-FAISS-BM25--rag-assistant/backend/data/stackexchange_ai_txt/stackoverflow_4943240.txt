Embedding a JS file in Silverlight Class Library

I am trying to create a Silverlight class library which needs to call a few Javascript methods. I have put these methods in a single .js file and have added it to the project. But when I try to call any of the methods in the js file, I get a FailedtoInvoke error. I understand that this problem can be solved by adding a reference of the JS file in the head section of ASPX or HTML page. But I am developing a class library and so that is not possible. Does someone know how to tackle this issue? I am using Silverlight 4 and Visual Studio 2010.
