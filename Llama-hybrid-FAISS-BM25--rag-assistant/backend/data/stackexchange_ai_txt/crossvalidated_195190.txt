I analyzed each imputed dataset separately with the complete command. I averaged all the coefficients. However, to calculate the SEs, I used the formula from this site ( http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/suppl/2010/01/06/3.1.98.DC1/HeDS.pdf ). Specifically, I averaged the variance of my coefficients across all my imputed data sets + (1+1/number of imputed datasets) x the between imputation variance. Finally, I square rooted that answer.
