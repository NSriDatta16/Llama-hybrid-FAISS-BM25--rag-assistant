What is the easiest FLV player for embedding video on a website?

I have video that I've converted to FLV format. I'd rather host it on my own site than use a service like YouTube. What is the easiest player to use? I'd like to just put the .swf file of the player somewhere on my server, and give it the video as a parameter.
