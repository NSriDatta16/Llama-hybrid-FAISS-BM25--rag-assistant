OSX Security Unlock Issue using Bamboo

We are using Atlassian Bamboo to build iPhone apps. We run bamboo remote agent on an OSX Server to build. The script used here was modified to fit our needs. The problem is that for some time the build will be successful then after awhile, we will receive a failed build. This error message will be displayed. security: SecKeychainOpen /Users/admin/Library/Keychains/login.keychain: CSSM_ERRCODE_INTERNAL_ERROR The temporary fix to this is to restart the bamboo agents (.jar) then it will work for a while then we will receive this error again. How do we resolve this issue? Thanks
