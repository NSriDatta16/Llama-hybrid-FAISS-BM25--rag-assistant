What are the common tricks in eclipse when working with jsp files?

I looked through this list of “Hidden” features/tricks for Eclipse?" , but it doesn't have anything for web-developement (jsp). A very useful list of tricks for a general eclipse user! I work with jsp pages in Eclipse Ganymede , and I would like to find out a list of shortcuts commonly used to facilitate development. I always seem to struggle with the following, among other issues: always traverse a directory tree to find a file (no Ctrl-shift-t just like java classes) search is always ends up with either ctrl-f or searching the entire project I would appreciate if you guys list tricks for eclipse, specifically for web-development (jsp/tomcat) I am a noob, so don't hesitate to list anything even if you think it is TOO NOOB!!! Thanks
