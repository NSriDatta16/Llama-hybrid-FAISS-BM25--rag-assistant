In case you still need an answer to this, the problem is that you probably have an old ssh key loaded in your ssh-agent. To check your currently loaded keys, use the following command: ssh-add -L First remove that key from the agent with (remember sudo): sudo ssh-add -d Then, add the new key (the one with yournewemailaddress) with ssh-add /path/to/your/private/key/file This should fix the problem.
