If loops and recursion are not allowed, pick up fibonacci sequence definition and do it by hand... it is ridicolously boring and uninteresting but it is the most straightforward solution in those restrictions. a = 0; // 0 b = 1; // 1 a = a + b; // 1 b = a + b; // 2 a = a + b; // 3 b = a + b; // 5 and so on: b holds the n-th and a the (n-1)-th number. (Copy-paste a = a+b; b = a+b; how many times you need...) Copy-pasting fragments of code is allowed? ... ( edit ) ... Of course this answer just shows how ridicolous stuffs can get if we put too much rescrictions. If you don't know recursion, you have to learn it, definitively. Or stick into fine mathematics (as other answer shows), but recursion is a powerful tool programmers should know anyway, and the recursive approach is more intuitive than using mathemathical "tricks".
