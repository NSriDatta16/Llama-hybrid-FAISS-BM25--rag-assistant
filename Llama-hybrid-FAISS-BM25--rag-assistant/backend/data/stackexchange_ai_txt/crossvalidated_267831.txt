Presumably, you could add the time-component as an additional feature to your sampled points, and now they are i.i.d.? Basically, the original data points are conditional on time: $$ p(\mathbf{x}_i \mid t_i) \ne p(\mathbf{x}_i) $$ But, if we define $\mathbf{x}_i' = \{\mathbf{x}_i, t_i\}$, then we have: $$ p(\mathbf{x}'_i \mid t_i) = p(\mathbf{x}'_i) $$ ... and the data samples are now mutually independent. In practice, by including the time as a feature in each data point, PCA could have as result that one component simply points along the time feature axis. But if any features are correlated with the time feature, a component might consist of one or more of these features, as well as the time feature.
