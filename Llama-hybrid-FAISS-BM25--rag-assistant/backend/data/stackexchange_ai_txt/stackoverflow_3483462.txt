CHAR(5) vs. INT

INFORMIX-SE 7.1: Assume that col5 CHAR(5) will only contain numbers from 00001 to 99999: a CHAR(5) column uses 5 bytes of storage, how many bytes does an INTEGER use? Does a UNIQUE INDEX on an INT column perform faster than a CHAR(5)? Is SELECT MAX() on an INT column faster than MAX() on the col5 CHAR(5)?
