I think you're confusing two different semantic responses - one is telling the client that you successfully created a resource, and where it is. Whether the client goes to fetch it or not is a different story. The second is telling the client that it has sent the wrong location URI for a resource it's requesting - and that it should try again, but with a different URI. A 303 is appropriate in this case - in fact, it's explicitly recommended for this: (from rfc ) It is primarily used to allow the output of a POST action to redirect the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the information corresponding to the POST response in a form that can be separately identified, bookmarked, and cached, independent of the original request.
