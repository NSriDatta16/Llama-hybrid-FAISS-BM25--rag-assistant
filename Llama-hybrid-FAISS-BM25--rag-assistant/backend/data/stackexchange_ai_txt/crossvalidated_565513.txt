"fixed but random" is not a common term with a clear consensus about it's meaning. The occurance of the term in the English literature is not common and half the time it is part of the phrase "not fixed but random" Note that 'fixed but random' is not a contradiction when 'fixed' and 'random' relate to different things. But which relations, that depends on the context. Searching for the term on Google scholar I see several cases where 'fixed' refers to the situation where an object of study is fixed. And the 'random' part refers to the situation where this fixed state has been generated random. For instance here We are in a typical situation of the quenched disorder [3,4] when the motion of particles in a fixed but random environment is considered. That is why inevitably we are faced with an averaging procedure, which helps us to pass to the macroscopic transport equation. $$$$ We have a fixed realization $b(x)=b(x_n)=b_n$ of a random process (well depths) with the probability distribution $P(b)$ A situation of 'fixed but random' could also be the situation with Bayesian statistics where we use a prior distributions to express the probability distribution of some value which in reality may be a fixed value. Another situation of 'fixed but random' could be in description of random number generators. These can come up with a fixed sequence every time, but the numbers have a random character. So this combination 'fixed but random' may occur and the meaning depends on the context. What it means for your econometrics case is not clear (since it is broad). It requires the specific context in order to say anything more about it.
