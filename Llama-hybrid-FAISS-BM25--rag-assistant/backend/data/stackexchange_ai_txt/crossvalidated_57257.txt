Under which conditions do Bayesian and frequentist point estimators coincide?

With a flat prior, the ML (frequentist -- maximum likelihood) and the MAP (Bayesian -- maximum a posteriori) estimators coincide. More generally, however, I'm talking about point estimators derived as the optimisers of some loss function. I.e. $$ \hat x(\,. ) = \text{argmin} \; \mathbb{E} \left( L(X-\hat x(y)) \; | \; y \right) \qquad \; \,\text{ (Bayesian) }$$ $$ \hat x(\,. ) = \text{argmin} \; \mathbb{E} \left( L(x-\hat x(Y)) \; | \; x \right) \qquad \text{(Frequentist)}$$ where $\mathbb{E}$ is the expectation operator, $L$ is the loss function (minimised at zero), $\hat x(y) $ is the estimator, given the data $y$ , of the parameter $x$ , and random variables are denoted with uppercase letters. Does anybody know any conditions on $L$ , the pdf of $x$ and $y$ , imposed linearity and/or unbiasedness, where the estimators will coincide? Edit As noted in comments, an impartiality requirement such as unbiasedness is required to render the Frequentist problem meaningful. Flat priors may also be a commonality. Besides the general discussions provided by some of the answers, the question is really also about providing actual examples . I think an important one comes from linear regression: the OLS, $\mathbf{\hat{x}} = (\mathbf{D}'\mathbf{D})^{-1}\mathbf{D}'\mathbf{y}$ is the BLUE ( Gauss-Markov theorem ), i.e. it minimises the frequentist MSE among linear-unbiased estimators. if $(X,Y)$ is Gaussian and the prior is flat, $\mathbf{\hat{x}} = (\mathbf{D}'\mathbf{D})^{-1}\mathbf{D}'\mathbf{y}$ is the "posterior" mean minimises the Bayesian mean loss for any convex loss function. Here, $\mathbf{D}$ seems to be known as data/design matrix in the frequentist/Bayesian lingo, respectively.
