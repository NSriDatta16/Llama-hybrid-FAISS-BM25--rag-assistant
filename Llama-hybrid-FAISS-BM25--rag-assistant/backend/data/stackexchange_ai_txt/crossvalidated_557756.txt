Can HAR models also be applied on non-volatility data?

Currently, I am trying to forecast several cash flows of accounts receivable and payable of a company. I want to apply the HAR model due to the simple structure of the model; it incorporates the short-term effects of the data by adding the daily and average weekly and monthly effects to the model. Furthermore, since several products are underlying the cash flow data, it could also be the case that the cash flows for the different products have different volatilities, referring to the Heterogenous Market Hypothesis. Therefore, I was wondering whether you could also apply the HAR model on data different from (realized) volatility. However, in literature and on the internet, I can only find applications of this model on volatility. Therefore, I was curious whether this model can also be used outside of this application or that you have to transform the data in order to apply the HAR model to the data. Can someone please help me?
