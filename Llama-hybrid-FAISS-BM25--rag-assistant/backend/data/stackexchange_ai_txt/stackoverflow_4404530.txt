How do I perform a text search of a Squeak 3.7 image?

I have an image that runs on the 3.7 version of Squeak - I'd like to do a text search for strings and fragments of strings, over all classes, categories and selectors in the image. Is there a built in tool I can use for doing this sort of thing?
