I don't like formatting on the client so I always try to return HTML from AJAX callbacks unless I really need data for a choice list, for example. The reason for that is I have a rich toolset on the server (ASP) for creating HTML and nothing on the client. I use a custom 'dynamic page' on the server which contains a 'dynamic control' that holds the template for the data I want to format. Only the contents of that control are emitted from the page. The web service that AJAX calls merely does: return Execute(some-dynamic-page). Arguments to the web service are passed to the dynamic page either in the HttpContext bag or on the query string. I find it easier to create a new dynamic page template on the server using drag and drop controls than using a client template or xml transformer. I haven't used any or the Jxxxx templating tools though - maybe they ease the pain. Using that method, you can use the same separation (MVP/MVC, or simply code-behind) that you normally would.
