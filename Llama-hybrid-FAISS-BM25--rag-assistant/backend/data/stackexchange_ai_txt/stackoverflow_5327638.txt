Fast/Efficent Pixel Access in Magick++

As an educational excercise for myself I'm writing an application that can average a bunch of images. This is often used in Astrophotography to reduce noise. The library I'm using is Magick++ and I've succeeded in actually writing the application. But, unfortunately, its slow. This is the code I'm using: for(row=0;row The code averages 10 images by going through each pixel and adding each channel's pixel intensity into a double vector. The function avg then takes the vector as a parameter and averages the result. This average is then used at the corresponding pixel in stackedImage - which is the resultant image. It works just fine but as I mentioned, I'm not happy with the speed. It takes 2 minutes and 30s seconds on a Core i5 machine. The images are 8 megapixel and 16 bit TIFFs. I understand that its a lot of data, but I have seen it done faster in other applications. Is it my loop thats slow or is pixelColor(x,y) a slow way to access pixels in an image? Is there a faster way?
