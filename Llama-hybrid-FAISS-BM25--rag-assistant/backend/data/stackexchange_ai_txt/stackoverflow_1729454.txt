I'd go with the JQuery UI datepicker. You can customize the date format and language to fit your need and perform actions like restrict the selectable date ranges and add in buttons and other navigation options. In addition to this there are a variety of keyboard shortcuts that are quite nice when you get used to them. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ Used to use both ASP.net AJAX calendar control but would often have CSS formatting issues and weird cases with client side required field validators not working properly. Since then, the jquery datepicker has proven to be a better fit in instances where I use it. You can find a good tutorial on how to use the jquery datepicker it here: http://elegantcode.com/2008/05/06/using-jquery-datepicker-in-aspnet/
