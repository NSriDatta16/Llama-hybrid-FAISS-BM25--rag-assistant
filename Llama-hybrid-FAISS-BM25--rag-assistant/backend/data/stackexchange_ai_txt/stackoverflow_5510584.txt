The Address setter must be public if you want the model binder to be able to successfully bind it: internal EntityRef _address; [System.Data.Linq.Mapping.Association(ThisKey = "AddressID", Storage = "_address")] public Address Address { get { return _address.Entity; } set { _address.Entity = value; AddressID = value.AddressID; } } Personally I would recommend you using view models instead of passing those models to and from the views.
