Yes, there’s a lot of research done on recovering from misspellings. The seminal probabilistic framework is Probability scoring for spelling correction by Church and Gale, which takes a Bayesian noisy channel approach. It’s really very straightforward to implement. (In your case, you’d only allow substitutions errors, not insertions or deletions.) More things to consider... Word embeddings are not a reasonable foundation for a strategy of recovering from spelling errors of the kind you’ve shown. An alternative way of framing the problem is as a “c-test”, which has a long history in psychometric literature: building a model of the individual character gaps. As a final avenue to explore, notice that your misspellings always superficially resemble the right letters. OCR (optical character recognition) has to deal with this problem all the time: picking the right letter based on the scanned page, but also based on the surrounding context.
