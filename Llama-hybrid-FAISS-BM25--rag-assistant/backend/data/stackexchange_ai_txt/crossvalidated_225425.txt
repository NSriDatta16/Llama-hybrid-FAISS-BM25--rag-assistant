Off the top of my head, the only other reasonable possibility I can imagine are partial dependence plots . [...] a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots redefine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Basically it plots the mean expected response of your model given inputs partial variation (e.g. a curve is plotted with the mean response versus values of one feature, that's why it's partial). But with only two dimensions plotting the actual probability surface sounds more fun.
