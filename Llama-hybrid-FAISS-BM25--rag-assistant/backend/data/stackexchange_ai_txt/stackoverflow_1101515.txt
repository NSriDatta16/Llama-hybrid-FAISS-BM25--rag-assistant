The last time I had that kind of problem I made an include directory out of my public_http root folder, and added its path to the include_path ini configuration. Had no more trouble including files. You can even add folders inside that custom include_folder for organization. Say, you have header.php, footer.php, calendar.php and menu.php as "template" includes, and some functions/classes includes such as encription.php, authentication.php, permissions.php. You could store them all in your include folder such as: custom-include-folder template header.php footer.php calendar.php menu.php libs encription.php authentication.php permissions.php And you include directly using include 'template/header.php
