@rlb: There is no mention of anything related to this issue on that MSDN blog page... @Joel: I have the same issue as you. Are you by chance using Resharper? I am, and my colleages who are not using it don't have this problem. Check out this page . My work-around (until I find something better) is to copy the element with all its attributes from Visual Studio to a text editor, edit the style attribute in the text editor, then copy the whole thing back to Visual Studio, pasting over the still-selected element. Not exactly the most elegant, but better than not being able to edit inline styles â€” or giving up resharper...
