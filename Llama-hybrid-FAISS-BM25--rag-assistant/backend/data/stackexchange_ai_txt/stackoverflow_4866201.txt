Can I use C++ functions in Visual Basic?

I'm kinda new to programming, but I have made quite a good library for calculating Math problems like Quadratic Equations and many other. Now I met a friend, and hes programming a little in VB, and we were thinking if it is possible to import my functions from C++ to his code, so he can call them, when they are needed, so we can make a calculator? How can we do that? Janman Edit: My friend is using VB.net Edit: My library is organized in free functions.
