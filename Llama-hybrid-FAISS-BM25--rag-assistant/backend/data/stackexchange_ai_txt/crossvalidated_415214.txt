Which model with multiple samples by subject and one response by subject? glme?

I have a few variables (continuous or ordinal) and multiple samples from the same subjects (n=10 for now). The number of samples by subject varies from 1 to 50. Samples are not repeated measure s in space and time. I would like to know if there is a relationship between the response (binary) to a treatment and some measured variables and to make a model that predict response for new subject. To be clear, the response is associated with a subject (not the sample): the subject respond or not to the treatment. Iâ€™m not a statistician but I guess that making a simple logistic regression (even weighted ) is not accurate as the multiple samples by subject might not be independent and prediction of response with new subjects with multiple samples will not be possible. So I start looking at Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models, but in all the examples I found the samples of a same subject can have different treatment response. So is glme a good model in my case? If not what would be the good model? I probably can summarize the sample from the same subject (not that easy with ordinal variables) but I feel I could lose information and statistical power. Thanks a lot. This is my R code: library(lme4) ml
