Interpreting seasonality in ACF and PACF plots

So, I am looking my raw time series dataset, which is non stationary. I initially used the log transformation to stationarize the dataset. The plot the graph(down below). It is obvious that there is still a seasonal component to the data from the ACF plot. I then tried to use differencing to remove the seasonal component. That resulted in me getting the plot below I feel stuck here. How do I proceed from here ? How do I interpret the seasonality of the Log differenced plot and model the data ?
