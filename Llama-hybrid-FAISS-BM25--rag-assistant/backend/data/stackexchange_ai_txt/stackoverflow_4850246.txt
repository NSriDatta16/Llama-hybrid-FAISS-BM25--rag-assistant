jquery draggable

I'm using jquery to drag some divs around, and at the end when i release the div i set it to position fixed and i give it the coordonates event.screenX and event.screenY but this method isn't working as good as i want, the coordonates seem to have some sort of offset and i can't figure out how to get pass this.Could anyone suggest a better solution or a fix? Thanks! heres a demo http://jsfiddle.net/xtGSL/7/ you can see that if moved the box simply jumps out of sight, on a larger page you are still able too see it the offset is around 40px
