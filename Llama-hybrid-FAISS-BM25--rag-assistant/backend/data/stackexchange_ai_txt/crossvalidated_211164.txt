Behaviour of neighbouring points in LOESS smoothing when data is not uniformly distributed

The purpose of loess is to create an 'average' value of the response for any $x$, by using points in the region of $x$ to create a local regression line. From what I understand, picking the smoothing parameter essentially chooses the proportion of closest data points to use in the local regression. The response values at these data points are then weighted by distance from $x$. What happens if the data is not uniformly distributed in $x$? For example, in this dataset the points are less dense in the region $x \in [0, 20]$. (This is scatter.smooth in R with span = 0.25 and degree = 0 , a weighted moving average). For reference the kernel density estimate is: Does this mean that individual points in the sparse region have more weight on the local regression at that point? What implications does this have for picking the smoothing parameter, to take into account regions of dense data and sparse data? Are there any other concerns I need to worry about?
