Headers in OperationContext

I'd make a little project (WCF + REST) and I have a small problem. I want make my Authorization and Authentication class. My Authorization class: //validate api key public class BasicAuthorization : ServiceAuthorizationManager { public override bool CheckAccess(OperationContext operationContext, ref Message message) { //some code } } My Authenticate class // validation user login & password public class BasicAuthentication : ServiceAuthenticationManager { public override ReadOnlyCollection Authenticate( ReadOnlyCollection authPolicy, Uri listenUri, ref Message message) { //some code } } I have too some config file The code in class is unimportant - is not a problem. My problem is how to get Headers from operationContext or message class. How i say before, i make this in rest, so i want manual set Authorizaion header / www-authenticate header, but application doesn't see it. I turn on the Fiddler2, and try put any header for example : Content-Type: application/xml Authorization: Basic bla23rwerfsd3== User-Agent: Fiddler Host: localhost:59305 And the message.Headers / operationContext.Headers doesn't has any my header (has only other one), no Authorization, no Content-Type
