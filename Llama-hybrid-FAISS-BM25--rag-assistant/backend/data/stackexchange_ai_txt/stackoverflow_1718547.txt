JQuery draggable: scroll not working when helper: clone is used

I have a folder list type of situation where I can drag items from one folder to another using jquery draggable/droppable. Folder items are draggable and folders are droppable. These are in a div that is small enough to show a vertical scroll bar. I have "scroll: true" set on the draggable items so that they can cause the div to scroll. When I also use 'helper: "clone"' on the draggable items, the scrolling no longer works. What am I doing wrong? Here's some very simplified code: drop here drag me drag me drag me drop here drop here drag me drag me drag me drag me drop here drop here drop here drop here // draggable and droppable in here: $(function() { $(".draggable").draggable({ // commenting the line below will make scrolling while dragging work helper: "clone", scroll: true, revert: "invalid" }); $(".droppable").droppable({ accept: ".draggable", drop: function(e, ui) { // todo } }); });
