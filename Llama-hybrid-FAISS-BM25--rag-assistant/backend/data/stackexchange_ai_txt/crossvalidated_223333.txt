When you create logistic regression model, you estimate the values of the coefficients ($\beta$'s) that allow you to predict your dependent variable. Let's say you create your first model, and we name it m1 , which was built using your first dataset, let's name this ds1 . Now, m1 was created using all the values in ds1 , and so if you update the dataset, your model has already been created and your estimates remains static forever unless you do something about about it. In your case, you are getting new data, but that can be interpreted in two ways. Let's say you have a categorical variables with levels $a$, $b$, $c$ and then your data set ( ds1 ) gets updates to ds2 in one of the following two ways: Some of the subjects in your study change between $a$, $b$ and $c$, in which case, if your model is robust then you don't necessarily have to update your model as you have already accounted for the effects of those 3 levels. If on the other hand they are updated because they were incorrect , then you should definitely update your model (by rebuilding it). A new level $d$ has been added to your categorical variable. This is another case where you should definitely rebuild your model because your model is not accounting for that new level and won't be able to give you an actual prediction. The only way to update your model is by rebuilding it again by using your new data set, so that you would have a new model m2 which was built on the data set ds2 . Hope that helped!
