Ranked tag recommendation for university courses

Our system allows an admin to manage a database of university courses. These courses have multiple fields, like the department, a title, and a description. I am adding the ability to add learning objectives to a course. To simplify the problem, let's say that learning objectives are just tags. Courses can have more than one learning objective associated with them. So a course like CHEM 101 might have "chemistry", "technology", "science", and several others. Assuming I can reduce a course to a set of features, (using keywords/stemming/nlp, I suppose?), what kind of problem is this and what algorithm would you suggest? It seems very similar to a classification problem, but I want to provide a sorted list of suggestions with the most relevant at the top.
