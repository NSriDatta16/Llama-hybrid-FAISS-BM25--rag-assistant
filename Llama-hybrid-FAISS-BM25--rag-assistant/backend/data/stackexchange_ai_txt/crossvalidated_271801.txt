See the matlab documentation . The interpretation: a column from the p x p coeff matrix returned by pca() provides weights for constructing a component from the original n x p data. Matrix-vector multiplication of X coef[ j ] yields component scores[ j ], where X is the data matrix, and coef[ j ] is the j-th column of matrix coef. If you have a general interest in visualization of high dimensional data, check out "manifold learning methods". This article seems to provide an overview.
