Normally the "cleansed" version of the file system that the Keychain's Get Info dialog presents to you won't allow you to access the hidden /usr/bin directory, but I found a way around this. Get normal Finder windows to show all files. If you aren't aware of how to do this, check out this article . In a normal Finder window, navigate to /usr/bin Drag bin over to the Places area in the sidebar. Now bin is a shortcut you can access from anywhere. From within the Keychain's Get Info -> Access Control pane, click the "+" button to open the find application dialog. Click the bin that is now under the Places on this sidebar. Navigate to and select codesign. Click the Save Changes button.
