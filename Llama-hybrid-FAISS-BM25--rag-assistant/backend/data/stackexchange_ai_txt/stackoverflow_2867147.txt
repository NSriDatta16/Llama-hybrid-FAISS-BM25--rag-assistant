How to make the UIWebView render the standard version of a webpage instead of automatically being redirected to the mobile version?

The server in some ways redirecting all the request into its mobile version, in which it lacks information, I want to render the page in the standard version using the UIWebView. What would I have to do? I have tried to set the "User-Agent" of the NSURLMutableRequest to Safari but it does not work. Any ideas why? NSMutableURLRequest *mutableRequest = [request mutableCopy]; [mutableRequest setValue:@"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.1 Safari/533.4" forHTTPHeaderField:@"User_Agent"];
