This looks like a homework problem. I assume the course is over now. The contrast asked about is #3, with coefficients 1 for the bright group and -.5 for each of the other two groups. The difference between the mean for the bright group and the average of the other two is in the Value of Contrast column. The p value or significance associated with it is .001 using separate variance estimates.
