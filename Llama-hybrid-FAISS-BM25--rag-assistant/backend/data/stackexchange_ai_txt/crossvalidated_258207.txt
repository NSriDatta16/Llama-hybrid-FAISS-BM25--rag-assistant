One thing to consider would be to re-formulate your model to be hierarchical with some dependence structure that allows you to borrow strength across experiments for parameter estimation. There are many ways to this, and how you create these dependence structures is problem specific. But to give you an idea, a simple and ubiquitous example of this kind of thinking is the eight-schools problem presented in the book Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al. A simpler solution you might consider is using a power prior . In a nutshell, a power prior uses a scalar parameter $a_0$ to weight the historical data relative to the likelihood of the current data. $a_0=0$ corresponds to no weight on the historical data, while $a_0=1$ corresponds to the prior for the new study being the posterior from the previous study. $0
