jquery-based xml editor that uses xml Schemas

I'm in need of a web-based xml editor that uses xml schema documents to control the addition of elements and attributes. For example, providing drop-downs for sub-elements when the allowed sub-elements are listed in the schema document. And if an element type is "date," providing a date picker. In addition, it needs to be extensible, so I can create my own element types. For example, an "HTML" type I can define to bring up an instance of CKEditor for editing. I've actually written one of these in the past, but not with jquery. I'm about to start over, but it seems like something like this may already exist. If not a full-fledged tool, then any useful libraries I can leverage would be appreciated as well. Thanks very much, and I hope this question isn't too vague or off-topic. Thanks! Don Undeen
