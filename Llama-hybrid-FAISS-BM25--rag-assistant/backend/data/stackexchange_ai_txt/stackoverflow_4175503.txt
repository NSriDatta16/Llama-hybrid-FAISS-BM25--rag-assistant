You can probably find a lot of Single Sign On libraries or modules to help you with the SSO part, but you'll probably have to manually have them talk to the same tables and fields to make it work. I would suggest you start with setting up your simple SSO with facebook, google and the others for your user information to external services like MailChimp and then google for third-party addons with 'single sign on' as keywords for whatever application you need to have working together.. This could enable you to extend your magento, wordpress or whataver installation to communicate with eachother.
