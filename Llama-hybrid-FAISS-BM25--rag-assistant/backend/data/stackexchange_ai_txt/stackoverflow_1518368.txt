A bit of background before recommendations. I have always organized real security work into application security and network security. If you want to setup firewalls and run nmap, test wireless installs, parse logs and do more sysadmin-y stuff get into network security. If you enjoy finding bugs get into application security. We are basically overpaid QA and your time will be spent trying to find the security issues in an application. Most work for application security these days is web applications. As for roles you can work in a company's security team, or as a consultant. So first I would say you want to be more then a wireless security dude because that is a bit of a narrow focus. If you want to do wireless security work you will have the most luck as a consultant and most of your days will be installing wireless for a company securely or doing a quick assessment of their existing wireless setup. If you have a programming background I would recommend looking into application security, you get to break stuff in clever ways instead of building it. Some things to google, phrack, owasp and the bible of our industry "the art of software security". If you read that book you might agree with the assessment of security knowledge being a collection of trivia, on each security assessment you look into your trivia and try and figure out ways to break the thing you are looking at. Your first step should indeed be setting up a webserver and vulnerable website and try and break into it, try xss, try sql injection, scan it with nmap and see what ports are open. look into the webgoat project which is a collection of intentionally flawed software just for this purpose.
