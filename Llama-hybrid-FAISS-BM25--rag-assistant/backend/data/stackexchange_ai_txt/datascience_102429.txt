100% Accuracy and 0 loss in image classification

I am working on image classification using CNNs and the pretrained model VGG16, my dataset has 3 classes with almost 900 images per class. after traning for 5 epochs my model reached 1 accuracy with 0.00073 train-loss , val-loss=0.00000, val-accuracy=1. Is it normal to reach 100% accuracy ? I have to add that my images per class are very similar so this makes the learning easier. The evaluation on my test set is: 100% accuracy, loss = 0.0000. Here is my traning and learning curves.
