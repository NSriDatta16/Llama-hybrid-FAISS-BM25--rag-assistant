iText having issues with Anchors (clickable but nothing happens)

I'm trying to create a simple table of contents (the document is only 4 pages long). The issue I have is that while my mouse does turn into a hand, when I click it nothing happens. And yes the targets are on another page. creation of a table of contents line: Chunk chunk = new Chunk("Contact information"); chunk.setLocalGoto("Contact information"); document.add(new Paragraph(chunk)); One of the targets: Anchor anchor = new Anchor("Contact information", font1); anchor.setName("Contact information"); Chapter chapter = new Chapter(new Paragraph(anchor), 1); chapter.setNumberDepth(0); document.add(chapter); The Goto String matches with the Anchor name so I don't see what I'm doing wrong.
