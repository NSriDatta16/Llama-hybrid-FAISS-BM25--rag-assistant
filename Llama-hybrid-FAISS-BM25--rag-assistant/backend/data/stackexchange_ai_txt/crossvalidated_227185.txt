CRF equivalent in deep learning

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is a typical solution for a sequence labelling/segmentation problem. For example, a sequence is a string and CRFs are used to label each word as being a part of a company name, a location, an event, etc. What is currently the state-of-the-art equivalent in the deep learning community to CRFs for sequence labelling/segmentation? CRFs have several implementations, including C++ and Java. Does an implementation exist on the deep learning side?
