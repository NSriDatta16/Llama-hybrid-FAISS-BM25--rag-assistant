I am guessing the 'learning' here means, acquiring new tips and tricks, grapsing new technology in the market and stay up to date with the trends in technology. From my experience it is taking around 20% time for learning, and it is mainly because I work on all latest technologies from Microsoft like WPF/Silverlight/Surface. But this % of time will really depends on your personal interest/ organizational interest and the type of career growth you are looking forward to. And if your job is merely converting domain/business logic to the code which doesn't involve critical technology roadblocks then it might be close to 0% time you need to spend on learning.
