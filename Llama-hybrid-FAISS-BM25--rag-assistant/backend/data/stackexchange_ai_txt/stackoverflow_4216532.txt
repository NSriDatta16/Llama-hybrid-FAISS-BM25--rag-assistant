Django and Pylons are the two most popular Python frameworks that will allow you to rapidly build your own CMS and youtube like video hosting site. Django http://www.djangoproject.com/ Pylons http://pylonshq.com/ Making your own site instead of relying on a CMS is really going to be your best bet because you will have to figure out a lot of other things like how to convert the uploaded video to FLV that won't a part of the core CMS functionality. There are a lot of other considerations like leveraging a cloud CDN to deliver your video content that just doesn't exist out of the box in any framework that I can think of, even those written in different languages.
