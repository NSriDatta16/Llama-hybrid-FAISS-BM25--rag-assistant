Machine Learning Engineers and engineering focused Data Scientist are the same, but not all Data Scientist are engineering focused. About 5 years ago almost all Data Scientist were engineering focused, e.g, they had to write production code. Now, however, there are many Data Scientist roles that are for most part: playing in Jupyter notebook, understanding data, making pretty graphs, explaining to clients, managers, analysts... They don't do any engineering. And I believe that term Machine Learning Engineers came up to underline that this an engineering position.
