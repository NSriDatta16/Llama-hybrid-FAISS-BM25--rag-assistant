Taking first differences and then running PACF?

If I first difference my non stationary time series data and then run a PACF to find the optimal lags to be 2 and 3 only, does this mean I found the best lags for my ORIGINAL data or only for my differenced data? In other words, when I difference the data and run a PACF, are the results for my original data or for my differenced data, or for both? I’m having a hard time finding any information on this elsewhere. My goal is to understand my original data, not the differenced data. It’s my understanding you can first difference the data and use all the results you get as estimates for your original data.
