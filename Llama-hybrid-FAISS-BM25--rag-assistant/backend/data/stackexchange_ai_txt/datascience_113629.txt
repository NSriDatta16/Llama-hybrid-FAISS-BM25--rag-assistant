How can I join the regions from individual estimators in a random forest?

I have an sklearn random forest which contains 3 estimators or trees. For a particular sample, I’ve used the “decision path” feature to extract the individual estimators’ decisions which are a set of constraints. I now have tuples as follows for each of the 3 estimators. I wanted to know how I could join the “set of constraints” of all the individual estimators to get a combined decision region, i.e., a region where all points inside when passed to the RF will map to that particular sample (class). I am looking for the region to be as precise as possible. In the overlapping regions, the lower probability should be selected. Any help or insights would be appreciated. Thank you!
