I don't know if it applies in your environment, but you might consider whose time is "right", the client or the server (or if it even matters)? If all clients and all servers are not sync'd to the same time source there could be the possibility, however slight, of a client getting an unexpected result when syncing to (or from) the server using the client's "now" time. Our development organization actually ran into some issues with this several years ago. Developer machines were not all sync'd to the same time source as the server where the SCM resided (and might not have been sync'd to any time source, thus the developer machine time could drift). A developer machine could be several minutes off after a few months. I don't recall all of the issues, but it seems like the build process tried to get all files modified since a certain time (the last build). Files could have been checked in, since the last build, that had modification times (from the client) that occurred BEFORE the last build. It could be that our SCM procedures were just not very good, or that our SCM system or build process were unduly susceptible to this problem. Even today, all of our development machines are supposed to sync time with the server that has our SCM system on it. Again, this was several years ago and I can't recall the details, but I wanted to mention it on the chance that it is significant in your case.
