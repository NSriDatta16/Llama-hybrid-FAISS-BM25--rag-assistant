Get sum of elements of an Array in C# using generics

I want to write a method which can take an arbitrary array of a numeric type and return the sum of all the elements between startIndex and endIndex. This is what I have: private static T SumArrayRange (T[] scores, int startIndex, int endIndex) { T score = 0; for (int i = startIndex; i But the compilation fails with these 2 errors. Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'T'. Operator '+=' cannot be applied to operands of type 'T' and 'T' Is there any way I can force T to be only one of the numeric types (long, double etc.)? Or is their a more elegant way of solving this?
