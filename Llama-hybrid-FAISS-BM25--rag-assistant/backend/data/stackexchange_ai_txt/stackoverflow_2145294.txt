Selecting an abstract of n words including HTML tags with XSLT

I want to select an abstract, along with HTML format elements using XSLT. Here is an example the XML: The European Journal of Cancer (including EJC Supplements), is an international comprehensive oncology journal that publishes original research, editorial comments, review articles and news on experimental oncology, clinical oncology (medical, paediatric, radiation, surgical), translational oncology, and on cancer epidemiology and prevention. The Journal now has online submission for authors. Please submit manuscripts at http://ees.elsevier.com/ejc and follow the instructions on the site. The European Journal of Cancer (including EJC Supplements) is the official Journal of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the European CanCer Organisation (ECCO), the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR), the the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) and the European School of Oncology (ESO). Supplements to the European Journal of Cancer are published under the title EJC Supplements (ISSN 1359-6349). All subscribers to European Journal of Cancer automatically receive this publication. To access the latest tables of contents, abstracts and full-text articles from EJC , including Articles-in-Press, please visit http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09598049 ScienceDirect . How do I get say 45 words from it, along with HTML tags in it. When I use substring() or concat() it removes the tags (like etc.).
