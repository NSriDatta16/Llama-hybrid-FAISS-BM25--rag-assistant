R LASSO always include some coefficient and question about data partition

I have limited statistic knowledge but I am trying to conduct logistic regression by using a data with 300+ predictors. So I decided to use glmnet and LASSO. Below please see my code: fit.lasso = glmnet(x, y,family="binomial",alpha = 1) plot(fit.lasso, xvar = "lambda", label = TRUE) cv.lasso = cv.glmnet(x,y,family="binomial",alpha = 1) plot(cv.lasso) coef(cv.lasso) cv.lasso$lambda.min bestlam = cv.lasso$lambda.min lasso.pred=predict(fit.lasso,s=bestlam,newx = x,type = "response") I have two questions and appreciate any helps. (removed since it was more related to purely programming question) I have used CV to select lambda but I didn't partition the data into training and testing. Is it necessary since I have already used CV? I will need the lasso.pred to compare with actual to calculate the prediction accuracy. Thank you in advance!
