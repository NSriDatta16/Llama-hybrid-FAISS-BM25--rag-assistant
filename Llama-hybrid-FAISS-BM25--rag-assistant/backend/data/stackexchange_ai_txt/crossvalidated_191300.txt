How to use RMSE when having data normalization?

I am new in machine learning and I am studying time series prediction using neural networks. Pseudocode 1: norm_data = normalize(raw_data) train_data_in, train_data_out, test_data_in, test_data_expected = split(norm_data) net = trainNeuralNetwork(train_data_in, train_data_out) output = net(test_data_in) print(rmse(test_data_expected, output)) Pseudocode 2: norm_data = normalize(raw_data) train_data_in, train_data_out, test_data_in, test_data_expected = split(norm_data) net = trainNeuralNetwork(train_data_in, train_data_out) output = net(test_data_in) den_output = denormalize(output) // Added den_expected = denormalize(train_data_expected) // Added print(rmse(den_expected, den_output)) My doubt is which code is correct ? I have to denormalize the data to apply the RMSE or not ? Many articles that I've read did not mention if the benchmark on results section was normalized or not, and if the RMSE(the papers that I've read show the efficiency through rmse) was calculated on normalized data. I want to know this because I am measuring the efficiency of my neural networks comparing the RMSE of my results with the RMSE of the papers. Thanks !
