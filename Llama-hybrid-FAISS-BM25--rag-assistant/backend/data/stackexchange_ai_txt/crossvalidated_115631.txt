Can binning a continuous predictor or DV variable improve large data sets fit?

I read that averaging and binning a continuous predictor variable is in general a bad idea because it's always better to fit the continuous relationship through splines, poly and all of that. Sure, I agree, especially for smaller, accurately measured data sets. But what about big data and exponential distributions, where noise is more frequent and we don't necessarily want to skew the coefficients towards the center of the distribution, where we have most of the observations (although less interesting for our analysis)? Doesn't binning the predictors and the response variable reduce noise and improve our analysis for the full distribution?
