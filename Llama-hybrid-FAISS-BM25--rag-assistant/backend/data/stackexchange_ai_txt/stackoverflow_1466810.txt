How to draw a progress bar inside a list widget in Qt

I want to have a list of items that need to be processed in a QListWidget . Similar to Windows Media Player CD import, there should be a progress bar for every item in the list. Now there seems to be a way to do this by creating a regular progress bar, using QPixmap::grabWidget() to save its appearance in a QPixmap and then adding this QPixmap as Icon to the QListWidgetItem via QListWidgetItem::setIcon() . However, this seems to be horribly wacky. Do you know a more elegant way to achieve a progress bar inside a list widget?
