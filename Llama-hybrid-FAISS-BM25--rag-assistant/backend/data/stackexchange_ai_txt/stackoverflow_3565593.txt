Now I can't help you with that, I may be able to help with a secondary question beneath it, do I want to use it? If you just want to know of the speed, just ignore my comment. All I can say is please be very smart about when to use the ternary ? : operator. It can be a blessing as much as a curse for readability. Ask yourself if you find this easier to read before using it int x = x == 1 ? x = 1 : x = 1; if (x == 1) { x = 1 } else { x = 2 } if (x == 1) x = 1 else x = 1 Yes It looks stupid to make the code 100% bogus. But that little trick helped me analyse my readability of code. It's the readability of the operator you look at in this sample, and not the content. It LOOKS clean, but so does the average toilet seat and doorknob In my experience, which is limited, I have seen very little people actually being able to quickly extradite information required from a ternary operator, avoid unless 100% sure it's better. It's a pain to fix when it's bugged aswell I think
