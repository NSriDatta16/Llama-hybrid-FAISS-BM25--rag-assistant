I'm giving another answer, since more details about data were given. From the initial question it seemed that some quantiles are observed but that is not the case. The data is calculated in the following form. Calculate the total income of all population Divide population into income groups Calculate the total income of population in groups defined in previous step. Report for each group the proportion of total income in the group relative to total income of all population. Suppose the population income is distributed according to unknown distribution function $F$. For the data the following income groups are defined: Population with income in a range of $[0,F^{-1}(0.1))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.1),F^{-1}(0.2))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.2),F^{-1}(0.4))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.4),F^{-1}(0.6))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.6),F^{-1}(0.8))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.8),F^{-1}(0.9))$ Population with income in a range of $[F^{-1}(0.9),\infty)$ For each of this range the following proportion is reported: $$\frac{n_r\int_{l_r}^{u_r}xdF(x)}{N\int_{0}^{\infty}xdF(x)},$$ where $n_r$ is the number of people in a range $[l_r,u_r)$ and $N$ is the total population. The nominator of the fraction is number of people in a range times the average income in the range. Denominator has total number of people in the range times the average income. Since the ranges defined are quantiles, proportions $n_r/N$ are known, i.e. for the first two and the last two ranges the proportion is equal to 0.1, for the rest 0.2. The integral in nominator can be expressed in more convenient form: $$\int_{l_r}^{u_r}xdF(x)=\int_{F(l_r)}^{F(u_r)}F^{-1}(u)du$$ The most obvious way to fit the data would be to integrate $F^{-1}$ numerically to a given range (or calculate the integrals analytically, which might be a challenge). Then calculate the proportions and fit them using your criterion of choice, least squares, least absolute deviations, etc. Note that one proportion is redundant since the proportions sum to one. Another caveat is that you need to know average income of the population, which is not given in the data.
