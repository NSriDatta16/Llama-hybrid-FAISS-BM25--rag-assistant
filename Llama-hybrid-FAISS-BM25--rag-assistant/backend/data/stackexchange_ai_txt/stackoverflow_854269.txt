Javascript Object Confusion

I've confused myself nicely here. My scenario is as follows: function DesignPad() { function EditBar() { ... this.removeHandler = function() { **// how do I call Dragger.removeAsset** } } function Dragger(){ ... this.removeAsset = function() {} } this.init = function() { this.editBar = new EditBar(); this.dragger = new Dragger(); } } var dp = new DesignPad(); ... I can't seem to call Dragger.RemoveAsset . I understand the why, my question is how do I call it? I'm trying to keep like-things separated (e.g. Dragger / EditBar) but I seem to get all sorts of mixed up in my event handlers. Any suggestions, good reading materials, etc. on this stuff?
