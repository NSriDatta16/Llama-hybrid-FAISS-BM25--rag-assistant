It seems that you want to embed a silverlight application into your own desktop application. I didn't do it myself, but it seems somewhat related to Host silverlight in the Windows.Forms... Also try googling for "embedding silverlight in winforms". One possibility would be to embed a web-browser control and load the silverlight app into it. PS: There is certainly no direct equivalent of your code since ATL is a C++-technology ...
