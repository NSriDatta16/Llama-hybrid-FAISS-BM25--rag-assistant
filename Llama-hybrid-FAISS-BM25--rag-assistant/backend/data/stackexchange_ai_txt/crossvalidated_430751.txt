One way to approach the problem is look at citation and co-authorship networks in statistics journals, such as the Annals of Statistics, Biometrika, JASA, and JRSS-B. This was done by: Ji, P., & Jin, J. (2016). Coauthorship and citation networks for statisticians. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 10(4), 1779-1812. They identified communities of statisticians and used their domain understanding to label the communities as: High-Dimensional Data Analysis (HDDA-Coau-A) Theoretical Machine Learning Dimension Reduction Johns Hopkins Duke Stanford Quantile Regression Experimental Design Objective Bayes Biostatistics High-Dimensional Data Analysis (HDDA-Coau-B) Large-Scale Multiple Testing Variable Selection Spatial & Semi-parametric/Non-parametric Statistics The paper includes a detailed discussion of the communities along with decompositions of the bigger ones into further subcommunities. This may not entirely answer the question, since it's concerning the fields of researching statisticians rather than all fields, including ones which are no longer active. Hopefully it nonetheless is helpful. Of course, there's other caveats (such as only considering these four journals) which are discussed further in the paper.
