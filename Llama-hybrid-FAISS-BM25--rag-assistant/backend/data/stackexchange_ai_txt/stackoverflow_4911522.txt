If you don't mind frameworks and look for more elegant way, look into Zend_Auth - it handles authentication and all session stuff that needs to be done under the hood. It allows you to plug in either session storage or any other mechanism for the auth data persistence. So I would say authentication and storage should not be tightly coupled but the former has to define interface to the latter and take session as an option.
