Sure - make options an array of strings and use .join('') rather than += every time through the loop. Slight performance bump when dealing with large numbers of options... var options = []; $.getJSON("/Admin/GetFolderList/", function(result) { for (var i = 0; i ', result[i].Name, ' '); } $("#theSelect").html(options.join('')); }); Yes. I'm still working with strings the whole time. Believe it or not, that's the fastest way to build a DOM fragment... Now, if you have only a few options, it won't really matter - use the technique Dreas demonstrates if you like the style. But bear in mind, you're invoking the browser's internal HTML parser i*2 times, rather than just once, and modifying the DOM each time through the loop... with a sufficient number of options. you'll end up paying for it, especially on older browsers. Note: As Justice points out, this will fall apart if ImageFolderID and Name are not encoded properly ...
