Inverting the Fourier Transform for a Fisher distribution

The characteristic function of Fisher $\mathcal{F}(1,\alpha)$ distribution is: $$C(t)=\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha +1}{2}\right) U\left(\frac{1}{2},1-\frac{\alpha }{2},-i t \alpha \right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha }{2}\right)}$$ where $U$ is the confluent hypergeometric function . I am trying to solve the inverse Fourier transform $\mathcal {F} _ {t,x}^{-1}$ of the $n$-convolution to recover the density of a variable $x$, that is: $$\mathcal {F} _ {t,x}^{-1} \left(C(t)^n\right)$$ with the purpose of getting the distribution of the sum of $n$ Fisher-distributed random variables. I wonder if someone has any idea as it seems to be very difficult to solve. I tried values of $\alpha=3$ and $n=2$ to no avail. Note: for $n=2$ by convolution I get the pdf of the average (not sum): $$\frac{3 \left(12 \left(x^2+3\right) \left(5 x^2-3\right) x^2+9 \left(20 x^4+27 x^2+9\right) \log \left(\frac{4 x^2}{3}+1\right)+2 \sqrt{3} \left(x^2+15\right) \left(4 x^2+3\right) x^3 \tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 x}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\right)}{\pi ^2 x^3 \left(x^2+3\right)^3 \left(4 x^2+3\right)}$$, where $x$ is an average of 2 variables. I know it is unwieldy but would love to get an idea of the approximation of the basin distribution.
