as an aside to the main thrust of his question, I would recommend you looking at ASPNET_REGSQL to configure your SQL database to handle .Net's built-in membership / profile / role abilities. It would remove a lot of shag and hassle for creating / updating users, etc. I've not used profile an awful lot, but it allows you to "tack on" extra attributes to your user, e.g. AccessCode. If you're dealing with an existing DB structure which already does user authentication etc., you could create a custom Membership provider which would leverage the existing db tables and stored procedures.
