Right now you are declaring your own version of CreateProcess(). Since you did not provide the body (code), the linker doesnt know where to check to find the function to execute. In order to call CreateProcess from kernel32.lib, you need to include the proper headers #include If the compiler doesnt know windows.h then probably Platform SDK for windows isnt installed correctly. you will also need to link with the proper lib #pragma comment(lib, "kernel32.lib") You should also read the documentation about createprocess since it takes a gazillion of parametetrs BOOL WINAPI CreateProcess( __in_opt LPCTSTR lpApplicationName, __inout_opt LPTSTR lpCommandLine, __in_opt LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes, __in_opt LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes, __in BOOL bInheritHandles, __in DWORD dwCreationFlags, __in_opt LPVOID lpEnvironment, __in_opt LPCTSTR lpCurrentDirectory, __in LPSTARTUPINFO lpStartupInfo, __out LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation ); You should search for CreateProcess examples across the interwebs and maybe consider switching to c++ since you're on windows
