NN type/architecture needed for inverse covariance matrix approximation

The idea is to construct a neural network (NN) that takes N series of financial returns as input and returns the (approximation of the) inverse of the sample covariance matrix (an N times N matrix). I was wondering if there are any heuristics/rules of thumb for the architecture (depth, width) and type (convolutional, recurrent etc.) of NN suitable for such a task.
