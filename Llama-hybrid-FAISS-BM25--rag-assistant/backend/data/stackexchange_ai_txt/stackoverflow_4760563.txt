Tab Controls and their child windows

I'm using a control tab (Windows class "SysTabControl32") to organize GUI elements in an application I'm developing. In the past I've captured the TCN_SELCHANGE event and then, on a per GUI element basis, decided what should be visible or not. This is quite fine for small applications with only dozens of GUI elements, but my current project is more complex. I'm hoping there is an easier solution. What I'd like to have is the tab control with multiple tabs. Each tab will have a GUI element "wrapper" that I can show/hide individually and have all the corresponding child elements become visible/hidden. I have read that I should use dialogs to do what I'm describing, but cannot find any examples. Are dialogs the way to go? If so where can I find a simple example? If not, what should be done here?
