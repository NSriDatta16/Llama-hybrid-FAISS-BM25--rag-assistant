You probably need to do something about it, because using the data without dealing with it will make extremely strong assumptions (depending on the analysis method that might be missing completely at random, or that these days had an average of the whole year, or of the last non-missing day, all of which is most likely quwstionable). If you know why the data are missing that would help (e.g. no record created if the count was zero, someone randomly lost the notepad or spilled coffee over it etc.). It would also help, if you had data from another source for the missing days, you could e.g. do some form of multiple imputation (you may have to create your own) across multiple data sources and the mussing data would be much likely to be missing at random conditional on the other data.
