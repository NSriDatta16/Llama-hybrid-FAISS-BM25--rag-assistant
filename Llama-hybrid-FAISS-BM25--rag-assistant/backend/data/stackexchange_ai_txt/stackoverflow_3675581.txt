You can do this pretty easily using Team Foundation Build. There are even zip and ftp Activities that ship with VS and are ready to use. If you want a tool to make it easyer then I would recommend Final Builder . This tool inegrates into Team Foundation Build with an Activity that runs after Build and Test that you can do pretty much anything in. It has FTP and Zip Activities ready for dragging and dropping.
