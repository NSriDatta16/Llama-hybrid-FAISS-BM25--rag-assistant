Another option would be to apply an established Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to the raw images. After converting the raw images to plain text, put the relevant data into a tabular dataframe. Once in a tabular dataframe, fit a deep learning or traditional machine learning model can be fit. It can be tempting to build an end-to-end deep learning system. However, some problems are best solved by combination of subsystems. Those subsystems could include human expertise, rules, traditional machine learning, and just a small amount of deep learning.
