You can use the tabsshow event on the tabs to bind the drag'n'drop stuff, http://jsfiddle.net/kMZPR/1/ : function initDnD(event, ui) { if(ui.index != 2) return; jQuery(".sortable .target").sortable({ opacity: 0.5 }); jQuery(".sortable .item, .toolbar .item").disableSelection(); jQuery(".toolbar .item").draggable({ connectToSortable: ".sortable .target", helper: "clone", revert: "invalid" }); jQuery('#tabs').unbind('tabsshow', initDnD); } jQuery(function() { jQuery("#tabs").tabs({ selected: 0 }).bind('tabsshow', initDnD); }); Note that this unbinds the event as soon as it has done its work, there's no need to keep calling this over and over again; this is also why the tabsshow event handler is in a separate named function BTW. Also, it looks like the jQuery-UI tabs don't call the tabsshow event handlers for the initially selected tab. If you want the "Three" tab selected initially then it looks like you're better off doing it by hand rather than through the options: jQuery("#tabs").tabs().bind('tabsshow', initDnD); jQuery("#tabs").tabs('select', 2); // Ensure that the event gets triggered You're not doing anything like this in your example, just something that you should be aware off. This is a fairly common technique when you're dealing with things that need to be fully realized/visible/positioned before they can have extra functionality added.
