I don't know if this is relevant because I don't really know what your file looks like. But you should be aware that std::string is likely to have a considerable space overhead when storing a very short string. And if you're individually new-ing up char* for very short strings, you're also going to see all the allocation block overhead. How many strings are you putting into that vector, and what's their average length?
