i'm using GridSearchCV to find parameter C for SVC() classifier present in sklearn.svm . I'm not getting the optimal result desired

this is a screenshot of my code. i used abc.best_estimator_ (my GridSearchCV model) to find out best results. As you can see grid has values of C=1 and C=100 along with other values. abc.best_estimator_ says C=1 is the best value. For cross checking i tried using different values of c and here i'm getting a better score for C=100. I was getting similar results while finding gamma also, but later on i commented out gamma so as to focus on C only. Any idea why is this happening? Am i doing something wrong?
