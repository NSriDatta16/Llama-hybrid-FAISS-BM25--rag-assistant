3d rotation using flash

this is a post with a lot of questions so please be patient with me. im a newbie website and flash programmer and my programming experience is mostly on c and python. however, when i saw the 3D CAR MODEL dynamic flash image i immediately wanted to make my own. im not sure if the link is working for you but what the image does is revolve about the x-y-z axes. to begin my barrage of questions (sorry): in my very limited understanding regarding making flash , i believe there are several programs for doing this. so in your opinion what is the lightest flash making program to create 3d images? my application would be like this: a separate program sends the angular position to the dynamic image to the flash image. so is this possible with flash: data from a separate program controlling a flash image? lastly, since my intended application would run on a website, am i legally (and is it even possible) allowed to attach the said input-dependent 3d image on a website? forgive me for asking too many questions. thank you for reading my post.
