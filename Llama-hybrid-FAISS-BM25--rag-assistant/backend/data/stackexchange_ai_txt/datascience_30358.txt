predict_proba compared

I want to predict the probability that an individual credit_balance is more than value N is true I need to compare 3 classification methods: Logistic regression, Least discriminant and quadratic discriminant. For 1 sample prediction I get predict_proba for each of them with different values, how can I decide which model is the best for my prediction? linear regression predict_proba result is [[0.93227393 0.06772607]] LDA predict_proba is [[0.94144572 0.05855428]] QDA precit_proba is [[9.99999999e-01 1.24419207e-09]] What parameters should we look at to decide which classification is the best to predict the model?
