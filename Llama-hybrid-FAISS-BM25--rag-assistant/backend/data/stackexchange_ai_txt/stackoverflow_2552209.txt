Java Audit table logging, MySQL equivalent of CONTEXT_INFO

I am looking for the MySQL equivalent of CONTEXT_INFO that is present in SQL Server. Or any other session variable like thing using which I can pass the username to the trigger. I am currently working on logging table data for audit. I need to pass the username of the logged in user to the delete trigger. Any ideas? We are deleting the rows from the table in a few cases and marking them as deleted in others. Any alternate solutions are welcome. I thought of using AOP but it could prove problematic when deleting a cascade. I want to look into Hibernate Interceptors, not sure at this point if that works. If I can find the MySQL equivalent of CONTEXT_INFO, my job is done and elegant as well. Thanks, Julia.
