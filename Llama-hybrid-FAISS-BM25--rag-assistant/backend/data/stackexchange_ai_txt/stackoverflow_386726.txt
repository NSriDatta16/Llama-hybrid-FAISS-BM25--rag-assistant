At my work we use Hudson and here's some of the points I like about it: Good amount of useful plugins like integrated Checkstyle, FindBugs, Cobertura and so on - heck, we even put Continuous Integration Game to our Hudson! Runs Ant scripts, for us this means we can use our custom Ant scripts which we use to build our entire app to make Hudson first check CVS for changes, if any present then build the actual app, then run the project's unit tests and if any of these phases fails, Hudson marks the build as failed and spams several emails to everyone and their mother about how evil this one person who commited these specific changes to CVS is because he broke the build :) And then some things I don't like: No way to mass manage build results. We recently had to remove about 300 builds by hand from build history because there wasn't a tool for it. That's 4 clicks per build so it took a bit of time. Web UI gets slow rather fast for some reason and some plugins eat a lot of memory.
