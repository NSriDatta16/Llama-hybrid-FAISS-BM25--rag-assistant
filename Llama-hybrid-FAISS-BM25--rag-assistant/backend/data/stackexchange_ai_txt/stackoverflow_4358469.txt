How are byte variables stored in memory?

I'm reading a book about C# ( Pro C# and the .NET 4 Platform by Andrew Troelsen ) and I've just read this paragraph: Changing the underlying type of an enumeration can be helpful if you are building a .NET application that will be deployed to a low-memory device (such as a .NET-enabled cell phone or PDA) and need to conserve memory wherever possible. Is it true that bytes use less memory? Aren't they stored on 4 bytes for performance reasons? I remember reading the latter somewhere but I can't find any info about it, not even in the C# specification.
