I believe this has been answered on a related site, Stack Overflow . The bottom line is that your data isn't structured to reflect a time series. EDIT: One question would be why are you using an SVM to do regression? There may be methods better-suited to your data type. But assuming you have a reason for using SVM... You were "predicting" the next value of Y based on the current value of X (which we'll assume are evenly-spaced values and don't really matter per-se). Instead, you need to predict the next value of Y based on the latest K values of Y. (Experiment with different K.) For example, say you decide to predict a day's value based on the values of the previous two weeks (14 days). In that case, if you are predicting day 29, you'd use the values of days 15..28, and if you are predicting day 30, you'd use the values of days 16..29, and so on. The training set x is thus a vector of vectors of length 14: Day 1..Day 14, Day 2..Day 15, etc. And the training set y is thus a vector of scalars: Day 15, Day 16, etc.
