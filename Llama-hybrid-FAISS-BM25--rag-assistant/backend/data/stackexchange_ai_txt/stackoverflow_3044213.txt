jquery insert a html block so it starts before the target and ends after the target - is this possible?

I understand you can add insert blocks of html before and after a target using before() , insertBefore() , after() and insertAfter() . I tried to do something similar to this $(document).ready(function(){ $("p").before(" "); $("p").after(" "); }); paragraph But the inject seems to automatically create closing tags for me, is there a way around this? Cheers
