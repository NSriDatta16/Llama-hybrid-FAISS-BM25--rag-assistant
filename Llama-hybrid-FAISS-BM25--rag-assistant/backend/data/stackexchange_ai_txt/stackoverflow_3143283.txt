Prism shell template, two instances of ShellView being created

Started with a default Prism Shell project and all was working as expected. I began making changes and modifications and now the application is started twice. protected override DependencyObject CreateShell() The above override is only called once. The constructor(s) in the ShellView are being called twice. Once for the default constructor and once for a constructor taking an instance of the ShellViewModel . Not sure what exactly is causing this however my hunch is that something was inadvertently modified and a trivial solution awaits...
