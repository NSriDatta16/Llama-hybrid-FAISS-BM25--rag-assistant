Calling organize imports programmatically

I'm trying to execute 'OrganizeImports' programmatically on files that I'm editing programmatically. My code looks like this: final ICommandService cmdService = (ICommandService)PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService (ICommandService.class); if (cmdService != null) { final Command cmd = cmdService.getCommand(IJavaEditorActionDefinitionIds.ORGANIZE_IMPORTS); final ExecutionEvent execEvt = new ExecutionEvent(cmd, Collections.EMPTY_MAP, compileationUnit, null); PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage(); ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace(). Display.getDefault().syncExec(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { try { //cmd.executeWithChecks(execEvt); cmd.execute(execEvt); } catch (Exception e) { getLogger().severe("organize imports failed: " + e.getMessage()); } } My problem is that OrganizeImportsAction executes on the current selection which is not the same as the compilation unit I'm editing. I would like to set the selection programmatically on the compilation unit but I don't know how to do that. Or maybe there is another way to trigger OrganizeImports. thanks, stefan
