nonlinear least square optimization for Logistic Regression

Generally I have trained a logistic regression model with: glm_model After that I will again make a non-linear optimization with the minpack.lm package from R in order to get better results. a_coef = 0 b_coef = 1 c_coef = 4 d_coef = 7 minpack.lm::nlsLM(response ~ a + b/(1 + exp(-(c + d * score_glm))), data = data_new, start = c(a = a_coef, b = b_coef, c = c_coef, d = d_coef), control = list(maxiter = 1000)) Could this be a valid procedure in order to get better results?
