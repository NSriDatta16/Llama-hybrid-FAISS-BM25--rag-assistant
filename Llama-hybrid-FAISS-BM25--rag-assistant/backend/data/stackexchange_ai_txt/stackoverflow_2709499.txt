Unicode Kangxi radicals range 2F00â€“2FDF not displayed on iphone device, but in simulator

Kangxi radicals in the range 2F00-2FDF (see link text ) are not displayed correctly on the iPhone device. They appear as a crossed-out box. In the simulator they display correctly. I tried the system font and also the [UIFont fontWithName:@"STHeitiTC-Medium" size:24]; ... Is the unicode codepoint coverage limited on the iphone (in my case OS 3.1.3)? How to make those radicals appear??? Thx
