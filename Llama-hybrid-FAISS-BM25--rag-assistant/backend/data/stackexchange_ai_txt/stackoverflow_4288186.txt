The datastore doesn't keep track of inheritances like this. Each Entity has a single "kind". If you wanted all of the animals to be of the same kind, you could have a property that indicates which sort of animal (Giraffe or Mouse) it is. So, you'd make each new entity an Animal , but then set the "type" property or whatever to Giraffe or Mouse. You lose some of the nice features of inheritance this way, which is a drag.
