Your question is a bit disjointed, so I'll offer a few thoughts in a similarly scattershot fashion. First, to the distinction you're making between "predict the outcome class" and "know the risk factors," the only way to get to the latter is through the former. A risk factor is just a feature that helps us assess the risk of something, and in binary classification, the "something" is the outcome of interest. So we can only reliably identify risk factors by trying to predict (or really just sort or classify) the cases and seeing which features help us do that the best. Second, in binary classification, it does not matter which class you choose as the reference class. The results will be the same either way, so it's mostly about making it easier to interpret and present the results the way you'd like. Third and related, in binary classification, any factor that helps you predict one class ipso facto helps you predict the other. You aren't trying to assess risks of two different and potentially unrelated outcomes; you are trying to sort cases according to the presence or absence of a single outcome. So it's a zero-sum situation, and risk factors relate to both classes inversely. Fourth, p-values offer one way to identify important risk factors, but they aren't the only way. In fact, p-values can be poor guides to predictive power---see this paper for one discussion and illustration of why---and if you're talking about "risk factors," that's probably what you really care about. Instead of p-values, you could use cross-validation to see which features provide the most predictive power alone and in combination, or use something like LASSO regression or Bayesian model averaging to partially automate that search. Fifth, you mentioned the proportions of outcomes in your sample, but you didn't say anything about sample size, and that should be an important factor in your choice of methods. If you have data describing hundreds or thousands of cases, you've got a lot of options. If you only have dozens of cases, however, you'll need to keep it much simpler. Last but not least, in your situation, it's really important to make sure that measurement of any variables you include in the analysis occurred before the decision on whether or not to admit the patient . Otherwise, you've got an endogeneity problem that will likely bias your results in unhelpful ways.
