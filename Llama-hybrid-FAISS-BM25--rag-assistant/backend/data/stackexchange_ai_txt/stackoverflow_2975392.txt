the purpose is that if i drag a thumbnail very fast over another one, the mouse leaves the current-thumbnail and it triggers the hover of another thumbnail. this is actually a rather buggy effect. so i wonder how i could solve this problem! the UI of my website works like this: If i rollover a thumbnail it gets layered on top (z-index++), the thumbnail gets resized a little bit bigger and it's draggable. So currently if there lie like 10 thumbs randomly on my webpage and i drag them around really fast it works properly but somehow it feels a little bit buggy due to the fact that if i drag the images too fast the dragged image doesn't really follow the speed of the mouse - so a hover-out is triggered. Therefore i want to disable EVERYTHING set with jquery (hover event, and the abilty to drag) from all thumbs except of the current dragged one. sounds complicated i know! ;) maybe someone gets it!
