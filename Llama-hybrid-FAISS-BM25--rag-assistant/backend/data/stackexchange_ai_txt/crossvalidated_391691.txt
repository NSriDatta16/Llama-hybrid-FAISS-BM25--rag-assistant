Stationarity is an issue mainly for ARIMA models. The "I" in ARIMA stands for "integrated". To make a series stationary using the ARIMA method, you difference it . After the model is estimated and forecasts are generated, the final step is to (re)-integrate the series to obtain forecasts that are close to the original data. This applies for other methods besides ARIMA, for example Neural Networks or other ML methods: If you use some transformation to normalize or stationarize the data, then the final step in the forecasting process will be to reverse transform the data accordingly.
