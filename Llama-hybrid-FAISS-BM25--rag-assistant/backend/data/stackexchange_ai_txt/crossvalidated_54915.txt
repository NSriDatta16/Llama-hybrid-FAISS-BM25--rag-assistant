Grouping samples by clustering or PCA

If I have 5 binary variables with values for 100 observations to give me a 5x100 matrix. y1 y2 .... y100 x1 0 1 .... 1 x2 0 0 .... 0 x3 1 0 .... 0 x4 1 1 .... 1 x5 0 0 .... 0 I want to put the observations into fairly homogeneous groups based on their values from x1 to x5. I can try PCA. However, failing any obvious groupings from PCA, what's the best way to group my samples? Should I just have a go at the various means of clustering? How do I assess the homogeneity of the resultant groups? Sorry if my questions are a bit vague, so another question may be: What do I need to find out about my data in order to answer the questions above?
