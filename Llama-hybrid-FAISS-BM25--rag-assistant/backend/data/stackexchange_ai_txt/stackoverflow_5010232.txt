jquery image hotspots

I'm looking for a jquery script that lets me add hotspots to an image. They way I imagine it to work is like this. I can drag an image to a location on the image. The location = the dragged image X Y coordinates is retrievable. Thats it, does anyone know of a script that can help me do that?
