What use is four posterior densities? I would have thought you wanted one. It would be a weighted average of them, but perhaps difficult to find the weights. If $p$ is the probability of a head then, if my calculations are correct, The prior density is proportional to $p^2(1-p)^2$ from your Beta distribution; The likelihood given $3$ or fewer heads from $12$ attempts is proportional to ${12 \choose 0}(1-p)^{12}+{12 \choose 1}p(1-p)^{11}+{12 \choose 2}p^2(1-p)^{10}+{12 \choose 3}p^3(1-p)^9$ ; and the posterior density is proportional to the product of these, but needs to integrate to $1$ over $[0,1]$ which suggests to me a posterior density of $$\dfrac{185640}{1271} p^2(1-p)^{11}\left(1+9p+45p^2+165p^3\right)$$ which is in a sense a weighted average of $\operatorname{Beta}(3,15)$ , $\operatorname{Beta}(4,14)$ , $\operatorname{Beta}(5,13)$ and $\operatorname{Beta}(6,12)$ densities, but I do not see a quicker way which involves calculating the weights required In the chart below, the information from the observation has shifted the red prior density to the blue posterior density
