using merge in R to fill in the NA in a data.frame

I have a dataframe a that a few cells' information is missing, I have gathered the missing data and created another dataframe b afterwards. Usually I fill in the missing data by the following code: for (loop.b in (1:nrow(b))) {a[a[,"uid"]==b[loop.b,"uid"],"var1"] This works OK for me, but what if b is having lots of rows? Then the explicit loop will make the process slow. Is there any more elegant way for doing this kind of "missing data replacement" work? Thanks.
