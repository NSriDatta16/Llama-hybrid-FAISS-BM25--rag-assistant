Several projects use GCC/G++ as a "day-to-day" compiler for normal use, but every so often will check to make sure their code follows the standards with the Comeau C/C++ compiler . Their website looks like a nightmare, and the compiler isn't free, but it's known as possibly the most standards-compliant compiler around, and will warn you about things many compilers will silently accept or explicitly allow as a nonstandard extension (yes, I'm looking at you, Mr. I-don't-mind-and-actually-actively-support-your-efforts-to-do-pointer-arithmetic-on-void-pointers-GCC). Compiling every so often with a compiler as strict as Comeau (or, even better, compiling with as many compilers as you can get your hands on) will let you know of errors people might experience when trying to compile your code, things your compiler allows you to do that it shouldn't, and potentially things that other compilers don't allow you to do that you should. Writing ANSI C or C++ should be an important goal for code you intend to use on multiple platforms, and using the most standards-compliant compiler around is a good way to do that. (Disclaimer: I don't have Comeau, and don't plan on getting it, and can't get it because I'm on OS X. I do C, not C++, so I can actually know the whole language, and the average C compiler is much closer to the C standard than the average C++ compiler to the C++ standard, so it's less of an issue for me. Just wanted to put this in here because this started to look like an ad for Comeau. It should be seen more as an ad for compiling with many different compilers.)
