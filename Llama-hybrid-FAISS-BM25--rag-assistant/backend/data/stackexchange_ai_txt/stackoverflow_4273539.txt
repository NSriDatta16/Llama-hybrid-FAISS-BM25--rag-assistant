Android service running after pressing Home key

I have an Android service, created in OnCreate of first Activity of the application using StartService(). I need this service to be running throughout the life span of the application ie, all the activities in the application. But the service should not consume the resources after user pressed Home key or Back button. Is there any elegant way to do that other than stopping the service in onPause() method of all the activities?
