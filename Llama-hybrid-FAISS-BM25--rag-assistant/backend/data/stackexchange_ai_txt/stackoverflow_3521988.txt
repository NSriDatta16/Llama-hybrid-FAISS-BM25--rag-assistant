Firstly, i mean, Joshua Nozzi is completely right about how is to embed an app with a framework! But log4cocoa as a little different and could only realize that because it is an opensource code able for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/log4cocoa/ . The framework could be used with this configuration by adding a "Copy Files build phase, but instead "Frameworks", select "Products Directory" as the build phase's destination, then drag the framework to that "Copy Files build phase. The difference among this, and the other frameworks relies in this build variable: installation directory .It has as default value: "/Frameworks . This variable can be accessed by right clicking on the log4cocoa(first item in the targets list), then select "Get Info" and finally "build". To use it as "normal" framework rebuild it after you have edited the "installation directory" value to "@executable_path/../Frameworks" or if you are going to embed a framework with it, you would prefer "@loader_path/../Frameworks"
