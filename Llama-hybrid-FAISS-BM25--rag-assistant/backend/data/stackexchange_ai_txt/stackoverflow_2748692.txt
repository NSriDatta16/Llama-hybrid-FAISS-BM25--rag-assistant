As big as amazon.com? Amazon has poured millions of hours into their web site, and they have had to deal with a myriad of issues: Massive volumes of traffic. This alone encompasses a world of scaling challenges that would have most architects running screaming from the building. An incredibly diverse business allowing sales, marketing, I.T., delivery chain, partners, suppliers, corporate and private customers, dozens of LOBs, etc., etc., all to interact with the web site. The site must work across platforms , browsers, countries, tax and legal agencies, currencies, regional sales and marketing arms, etc., etc. An army of programmers, architects, designers and testers working on infrastructure, UI, business integration, performance, security, privacy, data management, data mining, auditing, etc., etc., all working to contribute to a common customer experience. In the face of all this complexity, their seamless integration has, I suspect, been built at a gargantuan expense. Is this really what you meant?
