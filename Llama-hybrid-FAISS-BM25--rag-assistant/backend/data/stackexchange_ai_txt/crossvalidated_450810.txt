How to approximate a Hermitian matrix with a transposed cross product of a single matrix?

I have a complex square matrix, and wish to learn latent factors (equally weighted latent factors, so not SVD) from this matrix. Given a Hermitian matrix A of dimensions n x n , how can I find a matrix V of dimensions n x k such that VV^T approximates A as closely as possible? I tried Bayesian MCMC factorization using the CoGAPS algorithm, but surprisingly the resulting U and V matrices were nowhere near identical, and as a consequence the results were confusing. I have also tried SVD, but the problem here is that individual latent factors in the input matrix are often combined at high singular values. To be clear, this is a real world problem I am solving and I'm failing to find any precedent. I appreciate any suggestions. I am doing my analysis in R, but am looking for the most computationally reasonable algorithm as this will be done on a 25000x25000 non-sparse matrix.
