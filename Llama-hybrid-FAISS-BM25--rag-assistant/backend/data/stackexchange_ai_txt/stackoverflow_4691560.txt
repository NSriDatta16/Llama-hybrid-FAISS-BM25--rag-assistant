Turn a collection of headings, paragraphs and lists into one hyperlink

Is there a valid non js way to turn a collection of headings, paragraphs and lists into one url? (like in advertisements?) Fresh Bread Delivered to your door Daily Fresh Bread This does not validate and I do want the href to be display as block element (so also the space around the text is clickable). Cheers
