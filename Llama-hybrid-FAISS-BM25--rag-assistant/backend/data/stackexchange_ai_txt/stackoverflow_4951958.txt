There are two parts to this: Why a fragment identifier instead of a real page? Because they are overusing Ajax . Instead of linking to a new page, they link to a non-existent or dynamically generated fragment of the current page and then use JavaScript to change the content. Why start the fragment identifier with ! Because Google will map it onto a different URL so you can serve up a special alternative version just for them. This allows the content to be indexed by search engines.
