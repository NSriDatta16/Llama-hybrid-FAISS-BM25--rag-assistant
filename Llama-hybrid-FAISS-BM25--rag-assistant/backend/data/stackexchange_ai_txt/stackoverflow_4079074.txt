First circle of R hell. 0.1 != 0.3/3

Possible Duplicate: Numeric comparison difficulty in R Hello All, According to "R Inferno" paper. I'm right now in the first circle of R hell. This is where pagans expect 0.1 == 0.3/3. Paper recommends using all.equal function for such cases, however I need to check ">=" or " > .1 >= .3/3 [1] TRUE > .1 Is there a similar function to all.equal that checks inequalities? Thank you, Ilya
