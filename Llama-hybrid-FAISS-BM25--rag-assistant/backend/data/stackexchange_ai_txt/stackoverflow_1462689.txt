Can you explain why nullable=True would not be the solution? To me it seems useless to store empty strings in the database and I would not encourage it. If there is no data than choose the more efficient type for the database. Personally I think the Django solution in case of strings is wrong since it does not really support NULL in CharFields. If you want to store NULL in a CharField you will have to do it manually in the code.
