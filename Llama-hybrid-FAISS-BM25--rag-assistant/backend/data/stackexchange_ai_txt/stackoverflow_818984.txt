The threads window, from Debug -> Windows -> Threads. You can Freeze and Thaw threads, and switch the active thread. This is awesome when debugging or replicating an issue with a multithreading application. You can drag & drop the yellow "Next Statement" arrow to another place. When the program resumes, it will resume execution at that statement. You can add it to the toolbar, a blue arrow called Set Next Statement, but it's not there by default. You can "undo" the navigation you did, like scrolling, going to another file, or jumping to a reference. The shortcut is ctrl-- (control minus.) That way you can jump into a function, examine the code there, and go back to where you were without looking.
