Why is it difficult to sample from Energy Based Models?

I am trying to understand the following claim which is made in the Deep learning book by Goodfellow et. al about a toy energy-based model (with the apparent motivation of introducing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods): To understand why drawing samples from an energy-based model (EBM) is difficult, consider the EBM over just two variables, defining a distribution $p(a,b)$ . In order to sample $a$ , we must draw from $p(a|b)$ , and in order to sample $b$ , we must draw it from $p(b|a)$ . It seems to be an intractable chicken-and-egg problem. This sounds strange to me as I don't understand what prevents us from computing one of the marginals, say, $p(a)$ by marginalising over $b$ , sampling from $p(a)$ and then sampling from $p(b|a)$ . I don't really see why we have to deal with the chicken-an-egg problem that the author mentions. Why is my reasoning wrong?
