Creating NSArray of objects from a Text File

I am trying to create an NSArray of Strings from a text file. Here's the code i've been using: NSString *title = @"facts"; NSString *type = @"txt"; NSString *seperation = @"/n"; NSMutableArray *factArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithArray:[[NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:title ofType:type] encoding:NSMacOSRomanStringEncoding error:NULL] componentsSeparatedByString:seperation]]; But it seems to give some extra objects with no text in, i need to fix this. Just if it helps this the text file I've been using it with: /nFeet sizes in England are measured in Barleycorns. /n Elephants laugh and cry. /n Trousers kill 12 people a year. /n The lion that roars in the MGM logo is called Volney. /n The wife of a Sultan is called a Sultana. /n Brad Pitt's real name is William. /n There are more than 5000 ladybird species. /n US lavatories are 100 times more dangerous than British ones. In 1996, 43,687 Americans were hospitalized after toilet disasters. /n The statue of liberty is made of bronze and was given to the Americans by the French. /n The Irish gave bagpipes to the Scots as a joke. It back fired! /n Your foot is the same length as the distance between your wrist and elbow. /n A rat can swim non-stop for 72 hours. /n The odds of being killed in a car crash in Britain are the same as being killed in an accident inside your own home: 1 in 10,000. /n In 1996, 12 people in Britain were rushed to hospital after a paperclip incident. /n
