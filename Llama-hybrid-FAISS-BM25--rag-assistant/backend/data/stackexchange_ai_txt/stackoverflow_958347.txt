HTML Tidy, Web Editors WYSIWYGs and html fragments

BACKGROUND: WYSIWYG HTML editors tend to be both "intuitive" and "smart". Intuitive means someone can reasonably edit HTML without knowing the inner guts of how HTML tags actually work. Smart means that the user does not have to worry about adding the HTML or HEAD or TITLE tags, because the editor does that for them. PROBLEM: These days, you can no longer assume that someone editing HTML is actually working with a stand-alone HTML file. With content management systems, for example, someone may be editing HTML inside a TEXTAREA control of a web browser. Moreover, the HTML in the textarea may not be a complete HTML document, but just a fragment of HTML where the HEAD and TITLE tags dont need to be supplied, because they are coming from within the content mangement system or somewhere else. QUESTION: Is there a WYSIWYG HTML editor out there that is smart enough NOT to put HTML and HEAD and TITLE tags into an html fragment, for cases where the user is needing to supply only a fragment of the BODY of an html page?
