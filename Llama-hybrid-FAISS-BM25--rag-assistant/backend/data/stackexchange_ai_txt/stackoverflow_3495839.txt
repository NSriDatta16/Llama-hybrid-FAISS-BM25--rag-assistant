From this interesting article , an excerpt: Java has the null type. Pre-JLS3, the null type was not officially the subtype of any type, and the null reference was not officially a value of any type except the null type. A decree made the null reference castable to any reference type for pragmatic reasons. (This is similar to the decree that makes List assignable to a List formal parameter even though List is not a subtype of List. You know the decree as capture conversion.) JLS3 defines the null type as a subtype of every type, so it looks an awful lot like Bottom.
