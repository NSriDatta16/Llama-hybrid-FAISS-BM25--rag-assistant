You need to minimize the amount of your code (specifically - the number of files) that depend on that header file. Other than that you can't do much - when you need to change the header you will face recompilation of everything that includes it. So you need to reorganize your code in such a way that only a select files include the header. For example you could move the functions that need its contents into a separate source file (or several files) and only include the header into those but into other files.
