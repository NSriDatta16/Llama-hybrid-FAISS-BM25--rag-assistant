It doesn't want another source file, it wants a project file. Visual Studio needs a bunch of information to know how to compile and debug your source code. Things like which optimization settings to use, where to look for the boost headers, that sort of thing. Try this: go to File->New->Project... and pick a win32 console application. In the next wizard, go to Application Settings , and check "Empty Project", and hit OK. Now you have empty project and solution files which you can copy/paste wherever you want them; to debug, just open the .sln file, drag in your single .cpp file, and hit F5.
