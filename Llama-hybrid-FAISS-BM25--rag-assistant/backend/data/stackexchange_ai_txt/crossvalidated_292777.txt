For (standard) logistic regression, there is an assumption being made that the true decision boundary is linear. This isn't the case with your data, because the chance of being "wrong" does not strictly increase with Age or with Office# since you have upper and lower limits. Using logistic regression after adding squared terms should improve your classifier (approximate a square decision boundary with an ellipse), though a better model would be something like nearest neighbors or decision trees/random forest; the latter would also quickly rule out the other predictors making a difference. (Incidentally, the predictors are not independent for naive Bayes, since SSN should be highly correlated with Age ).
