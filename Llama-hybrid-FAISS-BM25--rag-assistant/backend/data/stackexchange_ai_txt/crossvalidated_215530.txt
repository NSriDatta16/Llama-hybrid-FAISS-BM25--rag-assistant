Causal Graph using Bayesian Network

I am currently doing a project in which the dataset is a lung cancer dataset. There is a training file which consists of 7 unnamed parameters (Attributes) and each of them have around 1000 values which are binary. for example the file is somewhat like this, 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 This is just a sample representation. The original file has thousands of such values. There is a target file which consists of target values which can be either 1 or -1. 1 indicates that there is lung cancer and -1 indicates that lung cancer is not present. The target values are for each rows of the training set. I want to form a causal graph from this much data given which should use the Bayesian approach. Any other approach is also appreciated. Can someone please enlighten me on this problem.
