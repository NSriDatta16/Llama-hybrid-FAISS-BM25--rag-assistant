How to detrend exponential time series in R?

I am on my early stages of learning detrending. In R, when I see a linear trend, I use diff() function. Which, if I had the time series in a sheet of paper, I see it like "flipping the paper". I checked ?diff hoping for a parameter, but there isn't one... is there an R function to achieve detrending for an exponential trend?
