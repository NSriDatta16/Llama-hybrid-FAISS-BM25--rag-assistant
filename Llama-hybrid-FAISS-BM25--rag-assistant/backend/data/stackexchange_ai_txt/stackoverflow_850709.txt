Detecting which version of IE is installed on your OS in C#?

I am currenting manintaining a windows service that programmatcially generates a HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse objects for retrieving the response message of the request. The UserAgent property of the HttpWebRequest was hard coded to use IE 6 as the browser agent. Is the a way to programmatcially detect which version of IE is installed on the server hosting the service? It is currently hosted on a Windows Server 2003 machine and might be installed on a Windows Server 2008 machine.
