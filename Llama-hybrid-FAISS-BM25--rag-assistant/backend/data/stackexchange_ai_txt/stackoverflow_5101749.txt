They're neither, they're macros. A constant would look like this: const int square_size = 28; The difference between a macro and a constant here is that the constant has a type while a macro is simply some text fragment that gets inserted at the place where it's mentioned before the compiler is parsing the source code. And a literal is something like 28 or @"This is a string" , that is a value.
