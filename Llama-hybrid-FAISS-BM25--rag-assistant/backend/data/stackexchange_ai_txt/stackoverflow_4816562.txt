Check out http://www.thinkbottomup.com.au/site/blog/Embedding_DLR_Scripts_in_XAML_Part_1 for a really good tutorial on doing this. The only shortcoming in his example is the way he defined the routed event handler only allows you to define a single event to be handled but it was easy to modify it to define a collection of events instead. IMHO this is a great way to move UI behavior into the view but I'll probably be slammed by the purists for saying it.
