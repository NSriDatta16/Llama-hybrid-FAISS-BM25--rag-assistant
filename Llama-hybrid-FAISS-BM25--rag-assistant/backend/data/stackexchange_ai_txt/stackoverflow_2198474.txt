VB.NET Select Case Compiler Optimizations?

Does the VB.NET 2008 compiler selectively optimize Select Case Statements? For example, a Select Case Statement with a sufficient quantity of integer cases could be organized as a binary search. I ask this because I am curious whether or not I should opt for a Select Case in place of If Statements with multiple Else If's where integers or other basic data types are being compared.
