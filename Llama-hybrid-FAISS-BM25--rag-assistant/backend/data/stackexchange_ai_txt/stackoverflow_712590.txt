select * from TimeList1 where StartTime >= '8:00AM' and EndTime Less than or equal, not greater than or equal. Though really, that doesn't work like you expect when your columns are of type varchar. Use a time or datetime type. The first two paragraphs don't explain a thing as far as I can see. The last paragraph contains a flimsy explanation of the problem. â€“ Jonathan Leffler In the original post, before you edited it, the OP had as his select statement, select * from TimeList1 where StartTime >= '8:00AM' and EndTime >= '9:00AM' I was responding to that. My response may be "flimsy", but I wanted to address the obvious problem and get the guy moving forward.
