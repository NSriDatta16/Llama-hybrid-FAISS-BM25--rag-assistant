Treebank Tokenization Penn Treebank (PTB) tokenization is a reasonably common tokenization scheme used for natural language processing (NLP) work. You can find a sed script with the appropriate regular expressions to get this tokenization here . Software Packages However, most NLP packages provide ready to use tokenizers, so you don't really need to write your own. For example, if you're using python you can just use the TreebankWordTokenizer provided with NLTK . If you're using the Java based Stanford Parser , it will by default tokenize any sentence you give it using its edu.stanford.nlp.processor.PTBTokenizer .
