Time series forecasting of parking occupancy

I would like to forecast parking space occupancy for several parking lots. My dataset contains information on the date and time of entering/exiting cars, parking capacity and price. Is it possible to use time series modeling to predict when occupancy rates of the lots will increase/decrease throughout the day?
