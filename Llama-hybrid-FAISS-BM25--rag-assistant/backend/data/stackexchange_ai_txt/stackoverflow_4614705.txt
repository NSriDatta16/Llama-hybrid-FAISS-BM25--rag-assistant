In Magento how do you get the database name?

How do you get the database name from Magento? I have seen functions like the one below that can get the table name. $orderItemTable = Mage::getSingleton('core/resource')->getTableName('sales/order_item'); I was hoping that there was some sort of function like this: Mage::getSingleton('core/resource')->getDatabaseName(); Thanks in advance for any ideas.
