example@example.com?subject=example&body=%e5%85%ad The short answer is no . Characters must be percentage-encoded as defined by RFC 3986 and its predecessors. RFC 2368 defines the structure of the mailto URI. #include "windows.h" int main() { ShellExecute(0, TEXT("open"), TEXT("mailto:example@example.com?subject=example&body=%e5%85%ad"), TEXT(""), NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL); return 0; } The body in this case is the CJK character U+516D (å…­) encoded as UTF-8 ( E5 85 AD ). This works correctly with Mozilla Thunderbird (you may need to install additional fonts if it does not). The rest is up to how your user-agent (mail client) interprets the URI. RFC 3986 mandates UTF-8, but prior specifications did not. A user-agent may fail to interpret the data correctly if it pre-dates RFC 3986, has not been updated or is maintaining backwards compatibility with prior implementations. Note: URLEncode functions generally mean the HTML application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding. This will probably cause space characters to be replaced by plus characters. Note 2: I'm not current on the state of IRI support in the Windows shell, but it's probably worth looking into. However, some characters in the query part will still need to be percent-encoded.
