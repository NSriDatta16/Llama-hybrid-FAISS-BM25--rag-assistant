Rendering (streaming) HTML into Pane

My program generates results concurrently. I want to append each result, as soon as it enters the swing-thread, to a pane which shall render the result's html-fragment like: Is the JTextPane the right component? Are there problems with my "streaming-nature" of displaying the information; e.g. the output will be generated step by step, as soon as new results come in, which could require a full parse-and-render each time. Is there some full fledged HTML rendering component in Java (CSS!!) ? Or any other way to display Information in a structured, easily formatted way like HTML+CSS provides?
