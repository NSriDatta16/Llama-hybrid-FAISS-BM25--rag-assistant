You can simply calculate conversion_rate , $$ P = {n_r \over n}, $$ so that $P_1 = 0.03$, $P_2 = 0.03$, and $P_2 = 0.029$, but it's better to add a correction for total number of views. One way to correct is to add "dummy" views (e.g. $1000$), so $$ P' = {n_r \over n + 1000 }. $$ Ads with a large number of views see their modified conversion rate alter very little from their real rate, but ads with relatively few views will see their modified percentage move considerably toward low values. This is known as " Bayesian averaging ". In effect, the ads with many views will rank higher than ads with the same percentage but fewer answers.
