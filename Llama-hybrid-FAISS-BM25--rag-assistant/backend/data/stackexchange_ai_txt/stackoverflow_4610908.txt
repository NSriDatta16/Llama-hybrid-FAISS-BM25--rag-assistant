This answer was originally a comment to Dan's answer, but after looking at your code I felt compelled to give a full answer. You really need to take a closer look at the Boost.Asio examples and understand how they work. Pay special attention to the asynchronous examples, it doesn't look like you've grasped the concepts of object lifetime and how the handlers work. Particularly, you should master single threaded programs before jumping into multiple threads. When you've conquered that, you should use a thread pool invoking io_service::run instead of an io_service per thread. It will ultimately make your program's logic easier to understand. You also should look into valgrind , there's a slew of errors in your code like this one: ==19853== Invalid read of size 4 ==19853== at 0x10000D0E4: handler(std::string const&, std::string const&, std::string const&, unsigned int) (in ./a.out) ==19853== by 0x10000D5E6: main (in ./a.out) ==19853== Address 0x7fff5fbff398 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
