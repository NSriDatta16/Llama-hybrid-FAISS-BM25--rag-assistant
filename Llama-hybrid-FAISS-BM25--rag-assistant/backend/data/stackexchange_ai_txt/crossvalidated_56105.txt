Yes, there are other methods based on rejection sampling Marrelec, G. and Benali, H. (2004). Automated rejection sampling from product of distributions. Statistics and Computing Volume 19, Issue 2, pp 301-315. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02892062 The authors claim that this method is efficient. From there, we show that an automated selection of both the comparison function and the upper bound is possible. Moreover, this choice is performed in order to optimize the sampling efficiency among a range of potential solutions. In my opinion, although this is a nice and ingenious method, if the $f$ and $g$ are not too complicated, then the use of MCMC algorithms might be easier to implement.
