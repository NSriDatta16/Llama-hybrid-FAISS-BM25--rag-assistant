One aspect I wanted to direct your attention to is the choice of your development framework. If your framework supports MVC (model-view-controller) separation, then it's very natural for a developer to work on the M and the C, while the designer (CSS/HTML professional) works on the V component. This creates a great workflow and a good separation of responsibilities - and you can work on two separate files at the same time! They're on HTML peppered with some tags, you're on the logic.
