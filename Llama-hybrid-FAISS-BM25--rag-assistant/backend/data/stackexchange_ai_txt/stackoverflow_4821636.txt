If your code is within your QLabel -derived class, childAt() is not the right function. That would return a child widget contained within your label. It doesn't sound like that is what you are trying to do, but correct me if I am misunderstanding. The object you want to copy is this , but "copy" can have many meanings in c++, and I am not sure exactly you are trying to do. You will probably have to implement it yourself, perhaps with a method called clone() that creates a new instance of your class and populates the values you need to reproduce. I suspect, though, that there is a better way to implement the drag and drop functionality you are looking for without a copy.
