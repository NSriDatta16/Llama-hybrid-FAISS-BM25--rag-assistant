According to Lütkepohl (2005), p. 14-15, if we have a $K$ -variate VAR(1) process of the form $$ y_t = \nu + A_1 y_{t-1} + u_t, $$ then the unconditional mean is $$ (I_K-A_1)^{-1}\nu $$ (where $I_K$ is an identity matrix of dimension $K\times K$ ) and the unconditional covariance for lag $h$ (i.e. $\text{Cov}(y_t,y_{t-h})$ ) is $$ \sum_{i=0}^\infty A_1^{h+i}\Sigma_u {A_1^i}' $$ where $\Sigma_u$ is the covariance matrix of the error term $u_t$ . Then the unconditional variance can be obtained by taking $h=0$ in the above expression. The same applies to VAR( $p$ ) after having expressed the process in its alternative $Kp$ -dimensional VAR(1) representation. These results are obtained using the vector moving-average (VMA) representation of the VAR(1) process. References Lütkepohl, Helmut. New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis.
