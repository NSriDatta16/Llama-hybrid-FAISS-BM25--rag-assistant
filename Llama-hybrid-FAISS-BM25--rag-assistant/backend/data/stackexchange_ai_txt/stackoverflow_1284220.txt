#d1 {float: right; clear: left; width: 24%; /* it should fit inside the 25% margin between right-side of div #2 and the boundary of the page with a small (1%) gutter between the two divs */ } #d2 {width: 50%; position: absolute; top: 0; /* or whatever... */ left: 50%; /* used in conjunction with margin to centre the div */ margin: 0 0 0 -25%; /* moves div left */ } A line of text, floating to the right And here, several lines of text which I want to center. demo page: here Having had my attention drawn to the following: Now, what makes this a problem is that I cannot change the floating div; I only control the second div with the text that I want to center. Furthermore, I do not necessarily know the floated div's width and height. I cannot use javascript. I cannot use absolute positioning because I don't have any control over the parent blocks, and I don't know which of them have non-static positioning. And I really don't want to use a table, unless there is no other alternative. #d2 {clear: both; width: 50%; margin: 0 0 0 25%; } #d1 {clear: both; float: right; } This sort-of achieves your aims, but it means that both divs will not be horizontally-adjacent; they'll be where you want them, but on different horizontal levels.
