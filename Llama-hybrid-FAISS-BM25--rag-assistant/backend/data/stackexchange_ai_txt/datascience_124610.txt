How to deal with a small extra cluster in a tabular data?

I am working on a high dimensional tabular dataset with 1600 features and 9440 rows. No matter how I select the features, when I try to project my data into a 2d or 3d graph using dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP or PCA, I can see there are two clusters of data. One of them is a bigger cluster with the majority of the data and the other one is a smaller cluster causing the accuracy to drop. If I remove those small clusters, I get a very high accuracy of over 99%, but I cannot drop the rows as it's a requirement. I used an elliptical envelope algorithm to remove the second cluster. Now I've tried all the common scaling methods like StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, Robust Scaler and a few more. Nothing seems to work. I am out of methods to use and need suggestions to improve my model. Any inputs are appreciated. I am working on a supervised learning model.
