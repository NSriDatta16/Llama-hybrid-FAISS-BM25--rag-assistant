What are the equations involved in calculation of the parameters of embedding layer?

I'm trying to perform sentiment analysis on some data using keras.I'm using embedding layer and then LSTM. I know that embedding layer decreases the sparsity of the one hot encodings of the words and its parameters are trained while back-propagation, but I don't know the mathematics of its implementation. Thanks in advance.
