What is the distribution of the sample variance of the Skellam distribution?

I want to estimate the parameter $\mu$ using the difference between two Poisson distributions with the same parameter, i.e. a Skellam distribution with $\mu_1=\mu_2 = \mu$. I can calculate the variance of the Skellam distribution as the average variance over multiple samples, however, depending on sample size and some good/bad luck, I have quite a bit of error in my estimate (red crosses in the figure below); the variance should be $2\mu$. If I knew what distribution I was looking for, I could fit that instead to hopefully get a more robust estimate. Why am I doing this if I appear to know $\mu$? In my application, I only know $\hat{\mu}=\beta_1\mu+\beta_0$, so I need a second estimate of $\mu$ to find out the betas.
