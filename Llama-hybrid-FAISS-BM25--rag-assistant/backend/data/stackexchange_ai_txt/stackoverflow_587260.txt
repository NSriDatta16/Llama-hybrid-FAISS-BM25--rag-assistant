Offering up your employer's meeting room and taking the time to organize your user group sounds like a good start to me. The user groups I've attended get consulting companies and recruiters to sponsor meetings with free pizza and raffle prizes in return for a few minutes to pitch attendees at the start of each meeting. Beyond that, get creative. Start a website with a forum, invite speakers to talk about new tech, etc.
