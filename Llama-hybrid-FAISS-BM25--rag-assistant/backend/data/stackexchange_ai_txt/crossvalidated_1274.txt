Best way to show these or similar count data are not independent?

[0,1,0,2,4,1,0,1,5,1,4,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,2,2,1,2,4,1,4,1,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,1,1,2,1,1,0,0] What is the best way to convince myself that these data are correlated? that no univariate discrete distribution would approximate them well? that a time series model is necessary to better estimate the future distribution of counts?
