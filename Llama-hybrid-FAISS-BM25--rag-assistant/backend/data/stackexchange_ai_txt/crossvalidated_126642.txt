Novelty and Outlier Detection for Multi-label Data

I met a problem of using novelty and outlier detection for my multi-label data. For example, I have got some training data that is not polluted by outliers. However, the training data are with multi-labels, let's say the data is with 150 cases with 50 labelled with class A, 50 labelled with class B, and the rest labelled with C. My testing data contains outliers, and it also contains good data that can be labelled with A, B or C. Is that possible to use something like 'One Class SVM' to distinguish outliers from good data (mixed with label A, B and C)? Or it can only deal with one class like distinguishing good data labelled with A from outliers? Thanks. A.
