This is not a full answer, but while these two $\text{argmin}$'s look very similar, they are fundamentally different in a way: the Bayesian one minimizes the expression with respect to a single value (that is, the value of $\hat x(y)$, depending on $y$). But the Frequentist one has to minimize the loss function with respect to a single value for every value that $x$ could take, without knowing $x$. This is because the minimum of the function $f(x,\hat x)=E(L(x-\hat x(Y))|x)$ depends on $x$, even though we have to minimize it without knowing $x$. (note that if we would simply minimize $f(x, \hat x)$ w.r.t. $\hat x$, we would simply get the minimizing value of $\hat x = x$.) The Frequentist problem is therefore undefined. I am not sure whether it is even possible to make it well-defined.
