Your solution here is really unit tests of your queries combined with continuous integration . You have queries in the form of JDBC code. It's easy enough to write unit tests to connect to your relevant databases and run the queries in such a manner that you at least see if they execute, even if you don't care about the results, which is the standard you're talking about. Arguably you can extend this to measure the performance and/or the results but I find these sorts of tests are extremely fragile and tend to break very, very quickly as more changes inevitably happen.
