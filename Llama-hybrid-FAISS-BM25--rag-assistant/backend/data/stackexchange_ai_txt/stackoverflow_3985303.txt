Do you really need both Email_Addresses and Email_Address_Relations tables? I would go about it differently and just set up the Email_Addresses table. Like that: id module_id (record_id) module email_address created modified And then both Users and Organizations hasMany Email_Addresses through module_id , and Email_Addresses belongsTo Users and Organizations .
