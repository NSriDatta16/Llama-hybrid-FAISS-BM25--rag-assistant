Word 2007 VSTO wants to intercept certain document changes

I have developed Word 2007 VSTO in VS2010 using C#. I want to be able to receive notifications about some of Document 's collection changes, e.g. InlineShapes . I am also eager to intercept (be notified of) Insert/Picture or when a file is being dragged and dropped onto a Document . Is that possible? I have spent a significant time looking for solution and searching resources everywhere but to no avail. It seems Outlook allows more flexibility in this area.
