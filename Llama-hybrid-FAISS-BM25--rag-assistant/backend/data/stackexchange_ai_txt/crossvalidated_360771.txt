High likelihood meaning $E_{x \in X}[P(x;\theta)]$ is high, where $P(x;\theta)$ is the distribution over images that the VAE specifies. This corresponds to minimizing the KL-divergence between $P(x;\theta)$ and the ground-truth distribution, which is a good thing. The generated samples are blurry because VAE can only produce samples of the form $\mathcal{N}(f(z;\theta), \sigma^2 I)$. However, what people normally visualize as the output of a VAE is in fact just the decoder without the output noise: $f(z;\theta)$, which is the mean of that distribution. Obviously, viewing just the mean of a distribution will give you a blurred view of the actual output, and viewing the sample with added noise will provide something which looks excessively noisy. The reason for this is that adding independent gaussian noise is not a great model of how images are naturally generated, yet it is assumed implicitly by using MSE reconstruction loss. You pretty much always want both when training generative models.
