Your jvmarg to Ant for javaagent looks correct. Are you using Java 6 or a JVM that otherwise supports the Attach API? It looks like you have to also pass -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote to enable it for older versions of Java. I'm assuming you need it because the exception says "the target VM does not support attach mechanism". For IBM JDK 6 it appears you need to specify -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=yes .
