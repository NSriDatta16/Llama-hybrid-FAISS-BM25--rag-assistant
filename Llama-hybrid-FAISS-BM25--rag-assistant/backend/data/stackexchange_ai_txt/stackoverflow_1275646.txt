Python 3 and static typing

I didn't really pay as much attention to Python 3's development as I would have liked, and only just noticed some interesting new syntax changes. Specifically from this SO answer function parameter annotation: def digits(x:'nonnegative number') -> "yields number's digits": # ... Not knowing anything about this, I thought it could maybe be used for implementing static typing in Python! After some searching, there seemed to be a lot discussion regarding (entirely optional) static typing in Python, such as that mentioned in PEP 3107 , and "Adding Optional Static Typing to Python" (and part 2 ) ..but, I'm not clear how far this has progressed. Are there any implementations of static typing, using the parameter-annotation? Did any of the parameterised-type ideas make it into Python 3?
