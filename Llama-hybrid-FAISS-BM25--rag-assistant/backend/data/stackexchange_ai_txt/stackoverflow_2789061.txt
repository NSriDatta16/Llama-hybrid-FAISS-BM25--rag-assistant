I actually had a go at this last year. I got something working, though I wouldn't claim it had any elegance or charm to it, nor was it fully functional. If you want to convert equations to MathML, rather than full LaTeX conversion, then you could use itex2MML. If you can load extensions into your PHP, it's possible to compile itex2MML with PHP-bindings and use it natively in scripts. The Makefile might need a bit of hacking to get all the configurations right. Links: PHPLaTeX itex2MML with PHP-bindings
