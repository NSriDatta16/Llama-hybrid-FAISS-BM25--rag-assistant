$m_1$ - known average in the first subgroup $m_2$ - unknown average in the second subgroup $m$ - known total average $n_1$ - number of points in the first subgroup $n_2$ - number of points in the second subgroup $n$ - number of points in total You have $$n \cdot m = m_1 \cdot n_1 + m_2 \cdot n_2$$ So... $$m_2 = \frac{n \cdot m - m_1 \cdot n_1}{n_2}$$
