SAS Nested Likelihood Ratio Test for a Logistic Model

Using SAS Studio (online, student version)... Need to do a "nested likelihood ratio test" for a logistic regression. Entirety of instructions are: "Perform a nested likelihood ratio test comparing your full model (all predictors included)to a reduced model of interest." The two models I have are: Proc Logistic Data=Project_C; Model Dem (event='1') = VEP TIF Income NonCit Unemployed Swing; Run; and Proc Logistic Data=Project_C; Model Dem (Event='1') = VEP TIF Income / clodds=Wald clparm=Wald expb rsquare; Run; I honestly have no idea where to even start. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!
