I thought I'd attempt to answer my own question with details on how I'd over come this solution. It was based on an article on a blog article by Dan Meineck . Is summary, I think my concept of having multiple services for each of my root business entities was misguided. Instead I exposed a single service which implemented several DataContracts eg public partial class DeviceService : IDeviceService, IUserService { } Because device service is created as a partial class this allowed me to separate the services, well I say separate, they are still the same service but it allowed me to separate them into separate files and give some structural organisation to the service. The last piece of the implementation was to declare two end points in the service definition eg I'm not experienced in WCF enought to say if this is "correct" solution or not, but it's working a treat for my requirements. If anyone else has a better solution I'd love to hear it! Cheers
