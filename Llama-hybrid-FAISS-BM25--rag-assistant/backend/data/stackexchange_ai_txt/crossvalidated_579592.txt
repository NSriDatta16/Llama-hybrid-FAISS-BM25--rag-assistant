The fundamental difference between Generative Model and Discriminative Model is, one is learning about $ P(X,y) $ while discriminative model is learning $ P(y|X) $ According to this definition, Logistic Regression is not a generative model. For your example "create a vector x that maximizes $ P(y=i|X=x)$ ", it was not a generative model at all. Since it still learn nothing about $ P(X,y) $ Taking a real life example, suppose we got a logistic regression model that predict whether the image is a photo of cat. (Usually this is CNN ,but the logic is the same) The image $ X $ that maximize $ P(y= cat| X=x) $ is an image that consist of different feature of cats (e.g. tail, eyes) everywhere inside the image. Certain is maximize the probability of being classified as a cat, but you never see this image in reality. Mathematically speaking, if $ x^* =argmax(P(y= cat| X=x))$ , $ P(x^*,y) $ can still be very low.
