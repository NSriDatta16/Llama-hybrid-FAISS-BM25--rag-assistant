Measuring Statistically Significant Lift in Weekly Sales (Using T-Test)

I am trying to measure a statistically significant lift in sales and want to confirm appropriate methodology Test Design Created "Matched Markets" of 20 stores (10 in control vs. 10 in test) Source Data (represented as total sales during test period): Control Test 100 185 125 180 135 170 130 172 140 190 170 177 165 165 160 197 162 185 134 196 Methodology I am running a one-tailed t-test since I do not know the SD of the population and we are hypothesizing that Test is greater than control. Based on this, I am calculating a p-value of .00003 with the result is significant at p I want to confirm a t-test is appropriate here and I am not violating any assumptions around populations (since the stores in test vs. control are in different states) or anything else. I also wanted to confirm whether you are ALSO able to declare significance since the average of the test group (181.7) is greater than the Confidence Interval of control at 95% (calculated to be (142.1 Â± 14)
