What is probability estimates calibration?

I am going through this where the author is talking about calibration of prediction estimates of a neural network. I tried to find an intuitive explanation of what, why and how regarding calibration but couldn't find any. Can someone please explain it in most intuitive way before diving into the mathematics of it?
