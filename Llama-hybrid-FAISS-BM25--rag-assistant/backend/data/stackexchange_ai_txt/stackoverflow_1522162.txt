Set-Cookie and Expires headers differ

I'm trying to enable Expires headers for images as recommended by YSlow. I'm sure I had this working before but now when I check YSlow it says they are not being cached. For my .htaccess, I have tried: ExpiresActive on ExpiresDefault A0 ExpiresDefault A29030400 Header append Cache-Control "public" and ExpiresActive on ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 month" ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 month" ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 month" ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access plus 1 month" http://www.seoconsultants.com/tools/headers.asp outputs the following for one of my images: HTTP Status Code: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 05 Oct 2009 20:12:04 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.63 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.63 OpenSSL/0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 mod_bwlimited/1.4 PHP/5.2.8 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.8 Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=5d11f4d8aa37ceee6605786e59ff4f0f; path=/ Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Set-Cookie: lastlogin=1254773024; expires=Mon, 02-Nov-2009 20:12:04 GMT Connection: close Content-Type: image/jpeg The Set-Cookie part looks correct but the Expires header is not. How do I set Expires correctly and why do they differ? I have double checked that mod_expires and mod_headers are enabled.
