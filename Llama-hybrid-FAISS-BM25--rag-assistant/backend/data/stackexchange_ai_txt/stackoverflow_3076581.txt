Microsoft Web Protection Library Can you have your own whitelist? + other questions

If the Microsoft Web Protection Library can have custom white-lists http://wpl.codeplex.com/ I am also wondering do you need to do anything special to get it to work with asp.net mvc? I am going through it's methods and I see AntiXss..::.GetSafeHtml AntiXss..::.GetSafeHtmlFragment Method AntiXss..::.HtmlEncode Method AntiXss..::.JavaScriptEncode Method AntiXss..::.UrlEncode Method Is there something that does all these in one command or do I have to determine line by line which one to use?
