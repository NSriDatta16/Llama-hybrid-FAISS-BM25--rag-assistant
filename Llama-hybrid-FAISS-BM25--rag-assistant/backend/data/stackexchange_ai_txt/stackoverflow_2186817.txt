iTextSharp + FileStream = Corrupt PDF file

I am trying to create a pdf file with iTextSharp. My attempt writes the content of the pdf to a MemoryStream so I can write the result both into file and a database BLOB. The file gets created, has a size of about 21kB and it looks like a pdf when opend with Notepad++. But my PDF viewer says it's currupted. Here is a little code snippet (only tries to write to a file, not to a database): Document myDocument = new Document(); MemoryStream myMemoryStream = new MemoryStream(); PdfWriter myPDFWriter = PdfWriter.GetInstance(myDocument, myMemoryStream); myDocument.Open(); // Content of the pdf gets inserted here using (FileStream fs = File.Create("D:\\...\\aTestFile.pdf")) { myMemoryStream.WriteTo(fs); } myMemoryStream.Close(); Where is the mistake I make? Thank you, Norbert
