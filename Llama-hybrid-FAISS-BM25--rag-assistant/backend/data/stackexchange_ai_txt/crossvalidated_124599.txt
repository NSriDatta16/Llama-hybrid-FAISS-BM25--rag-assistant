Analysis where dependent variables are proportions

I have a set of demographic data (age, race, social class, etc.) for selected geographic areas. These independent variables are each proportional in each type, i.e. Area A: White 70%, Black 20%, Asian 5%, Other 5%... so each type sums to 1. I have a series of dependent variables for which I wish to test the strength of correlation with these datasets. I am slightly inexperienced with statistical testing, but I am right in assuming I cannot use 'standard' tests (i.e. the ones I learnt in Stats 1!) with proportional independent variables as they are bounded? Initial research has led me to logistic regression ( http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/proportion.htm ), but clearly this is for the dependant, not independent side - is this on the right track?
