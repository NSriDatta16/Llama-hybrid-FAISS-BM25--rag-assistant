You may not be able to achieve this in Views directly as it does not support subqueries. My SQL came out like so: SELECT node.nid AS nid, node.title AS node_title FROM node node LEFT JOIN og_uid og_uid ON node.nid = og_uid.nid WHERE (node.type IN ('campaign','setting','system')) AND node.nid NOT IN (select nid from og_uid where uid = 1); It is said you can programmatically forward the results of such a query into the Views system for theming. Maybe a special handling of the argument Organic Groups:Member of a Group, Exclude Argument option? I also posted to d.o in hopes of pushing the issue conversation onward.
