As mentioned in bug 224145#c34 , I don't see any way to enable stuff except for what is in the p2 UI. And I see no update stuff there at all - not even in the list of things to install. p2 don't even seem to have enable/disable functionality, only install/uninstall. In other world, in the P2 universe (since Eclipse 3.4) , there doesn't seem to be a "disable" process, and the word was not used in the Ganymede Plan or Galileo Plan .
