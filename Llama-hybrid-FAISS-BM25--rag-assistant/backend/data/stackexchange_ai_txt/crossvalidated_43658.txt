For visualisation of models or data, R plus the various additional packages should be sufficient, as @StephenKolassa suggests. If you're going to do econometric things, I guess you might still pick another language either because you want to do a lot of something that R does not offer or make particularly easy, or you want to to make your existing procedures go faster. For the first task, maybe you want to learn how to use BUGS, JAGS or STAN to run MCMC models more easily. For the second you basically want to learn C or C++. It's possible that you'll find it easier to construct and work with arbitrary model-based quantities of interest if you happen to have a posterior sample of all your unknowns to hand. This is a less appreciated advantage of working within a sampling or MCMC-oriented language. Obviously if you're not happy with things Bayesian this is irrelevant.
