Two best practices: Never expect input from the outside to correct. Make it transactional (imports all or rolls back) If possible, leverage a third-party API or library like this http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx or this http://sourceforge.net/projects/javacsv/ to greatly reduce reinventing to wheel. If you're sticking to C and can do C++ consider this approach: How can I read and manipulate CSV file data in C++?
