I think that you've got the basic idea: a "sliding window" approach where a network is trained to use the last k values of a series (T n-k ... T n-1 ) to predict the current value (T n ). There are a lot of ways you can do this, however. For example: How big should that window be? Should the data be preprocessed in any way (e.g. to remove outliers)? What network configuration (e.g. # of hidden nodes, # of layers) and algorithm should be used? Often people end up figuring out the best way to learn from their particular data by trial and error. There are a fair number of publicly-accessible papers out there about this stuff. Start with these, and look at their citations and papers that cite them via Google Scholar, and you should have plenty to read: Frank, R. J. and Davey, N. and Hunt, S. P. Time Series Prediction and Neural Networks . Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, 2001. Volume 31, Issue 1, pp. 91-103. J.T. Connor, R.D. Martin, and L.E. Atlas. Recurrent neural networks and robust time series prediction . IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, Mar 1994. Volume 5, Issue 2, pp. 240 - 254.
