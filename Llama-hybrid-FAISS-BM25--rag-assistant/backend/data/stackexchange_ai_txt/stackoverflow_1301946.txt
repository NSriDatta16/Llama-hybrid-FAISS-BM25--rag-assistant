I don't know about Canada, but here in the Netherlands such webservices are only available to government related organisations, insurance companies, healthcare providers, etc. I'm actually working with such a service at the moment. It's not just number validation. It allows retrieval of name, address, date of birth and so on based on the number. It's unlikely something like that will be public. See also this privacy FAQ . Read it. It also contains information on valid uses for SINs.
