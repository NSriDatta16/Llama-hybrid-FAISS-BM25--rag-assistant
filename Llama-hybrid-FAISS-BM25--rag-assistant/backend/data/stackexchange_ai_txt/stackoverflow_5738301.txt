It is usually a very bad idea to do case folding this way, it really only works for 7-bit ASCII. What you ask is possible, and even easy to do, but I'll mention some other ways to uppercase your data first. Easiest way: Move function upper-case(my-src-field) To my-tgt-field Very easy way: Inspect my-field converting 'abc...z' to 'ABC...Z' End-Inspect Hard way, to add one to 01 char-temp pic x: 01 my-working-storage. 02 char-temp-area. 03 filler pic x. 03 char-temp pic x. 02 char-temp-9 redefines char-temp-area pic s9(4) comp . Then you can: Move 'A' to char-temp Add +1 to char-temp-9 And char-temp will contain a 'B'. As others have mentioned, Cobol is not nice about single byte binary math, so you have to make your character fit in the low byte of a binary number, in this case a 2 byte binary number.
