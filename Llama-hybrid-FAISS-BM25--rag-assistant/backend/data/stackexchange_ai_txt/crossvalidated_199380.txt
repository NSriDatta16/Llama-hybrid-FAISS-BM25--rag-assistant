There are two ways to solve the problem: Either by formulating your z-statistic in terms of the sum of normal variabels, or based on the average average value of the normal variables. Your problem begins at the latter appproach, but there is one step that is not correct. You have specified that $\bar{x}=3468$, indicating that the maximal average weight of the persons on the raft is 3.4 thousand pounds before it sinks (the bar normally denotes average). In order to use the proceduree you have chosen, $\bar{x}$ should be the maximal average weight of 17 persons on the raft (meaning their total weight should not exceed 3468. The maximum average weight is then $3468/17=204$ pounds. Inserting this into your z-statistic gives: $Z=\frac{\sqrt{17}(204-187)}{29}=2.41$ The associated p-value can be found in a table where $P(sinks)=1-P(Z
