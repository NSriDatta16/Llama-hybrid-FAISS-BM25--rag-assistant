imageWithData: doesn't take some arbitrary data and interpret it as an RGBA uncompressed texture. It takes a data that contains bytes of a recognized image format (like JPG, PNG, or TIFF), parses thoses and decompresses the images appropriately. In order to do what you want you need to create a CGContext which is appropriately configured (row bytes, pixel format, etc), either using the memory you already have allocated as its backing storage, or by asking it for its storage and then copying your bytes into it. Once you do that you can use all of the CGContext related functionality, including the ability to create a UIImage from that context.
