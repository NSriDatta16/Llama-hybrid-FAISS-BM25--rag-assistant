There are already publications that try to apply machine learning techniques in cancer research. It is usually for identifying specific types of cancer that respond to specific treatments. Check pubmed for oncology and machine learning. Also, cancer research is typically well-funded. For proper understanding, you'll have to study first linear algebra, then statistical regression and then machine learning. As a personal note, I started my studies with a specific goal like you. I ended up with something completely different and feel great with it.
