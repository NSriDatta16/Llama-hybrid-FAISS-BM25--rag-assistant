What is considered a large (medium, small) input for simple feedforward neural networks?

What would be considered a large (or medium or small) number of input neurons for a feedforward neural network? While I am trying to do phoneme detection using inputs of 3200 sound-samples, I became curious how to categorize input sizes of a simple 3 layered ANN (input - hidden - output).
