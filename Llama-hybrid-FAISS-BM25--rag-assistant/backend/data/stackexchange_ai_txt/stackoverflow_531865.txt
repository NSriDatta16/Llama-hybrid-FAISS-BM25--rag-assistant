Basically, you can't. XmlSerializer is strictly constructive. The only interesting thing you can do to customize XmlSerializer is to implement IXmlSerializable and do everything yourself - not an attractive option (and it will still create new instances with the default constructor, etc). Is xml a strict requirement? If you can use a different format, protobuf-net supports merging fragments into existing instances, as simply as: Serializer.Merge(source, obj);
