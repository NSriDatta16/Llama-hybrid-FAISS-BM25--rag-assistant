Why am I getting array elements with "0"? (See pastie inside)

Hey there. Java beginner here :) Well, I'm having a few troubles with this program: http://pastie.org/private/sfqqnqwxtpgtuhswpqepw 1) I want my program to split up the "input" array into an oddList, evenList and negativeList set of arrays. However, when splitting it up, it is adding a bunch of elements as "0". 2) 0 needs to be added only to the oddList. 3) I can't figure out how to add the average from averageAndGreater() to the end of the array. Thanks :)
