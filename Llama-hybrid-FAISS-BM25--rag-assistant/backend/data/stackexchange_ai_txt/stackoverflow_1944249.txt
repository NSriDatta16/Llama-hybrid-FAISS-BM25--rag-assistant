Depends on if you subscribe to the "tables are for tabular data" or the "tables are for layout" school. If you prefer to use your tables for tabular data, and the paragraph is not tabular data the "p" is valid, if tables are for layout, and you have the "p" tag reserved for other layout semantics then its not required. Short answer is, its really up to you. :)
