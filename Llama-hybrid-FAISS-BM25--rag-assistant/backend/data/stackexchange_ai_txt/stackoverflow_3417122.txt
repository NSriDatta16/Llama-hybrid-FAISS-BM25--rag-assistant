How to use Eclipse to create released signed apk?

I have been a Java programmer/instructor since Java was Oak (which is the development name for Java). Where can one find how to use eclipse to sign an app for release? I have found several how to docs/web sites , but not detailed enough for a newbie to this android world. I have a screen that comes up that wants the Alias , organizational unit, etc... what are valid values for these entries? Thanks in advance for any assistance.
