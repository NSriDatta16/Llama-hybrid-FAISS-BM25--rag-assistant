I will just address question 2. I have some doubts about how well the author knows his subject if he really said it the way you have presented it. PCA is applied to the sample just like EFA and CFA. It simply takes a list of n possibly related factors looks at how the points (samples) scatter in n-dimension space and then gets the first principal component as the linear combination that explains more of the variability in the data than any other linear combination. Then the second looks at orthogonal directions to the first to find theone out of those that explains the most of the remaining variability and so on with the 3rd and 4th. So sometimes one can take just 1-3 components to describe most of the variation in the data. That is why factor analysis and principal componet analysis are described according to 1 and 2 in your statement.
