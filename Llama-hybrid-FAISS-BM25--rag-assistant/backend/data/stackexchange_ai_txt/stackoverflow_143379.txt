I had a similar problem right after the update. It turned out that I had been getting the connectors (the base connector and both the SVNKit and JavaHL connectors) from the Polarion site that had "ganymede" in the URL. Instead, I should have been using the general URL. Checking my current configuration, you should be using this update URL: http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/ The one I had been using, that should be deprecated if you are using it, is: http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/ganymede-site/ Note the difference. Once I changed that, I was able to download the 2.0.3 versions of the connectors, and Subversion again worked for me.
