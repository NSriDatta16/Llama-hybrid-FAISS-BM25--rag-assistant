How to compute posterior predictive distribution given only the sample mean, sample size and the range of values?

Suppose the only information I have about a variable $x$ is as follows: The mean, $\bar{x}$ The sample size, $n$ The values used to calculate $\bar{x}$ were from a particular interval that ranges, say, from $a$ to $b$. In other words, this is a truncated distribution. Here is what I need: Step 1: Compute posterior distributions for the parameters of a suitable underlying distribution, about which we know that: its sample mean is $\bar{x}$ $\bar{x}$ was calculated based on $n$ observations (however, the observations themselves are unavailable to us) the distribution is constrained, i.e. its values can only vary from $a$ to $b$ Step 2: Using the above posterior distributions of parameters, simulate a predictive distribution of $\tilde{x}$ Step 3: Use that predictive distribution of $\tilde{x}$ in further analyses. To put this into context, the problem relates to a product's ratings given by customers at a website. Those ratings can only vary from 0.1 to 5.0 (yes, on a continuous scale). I know that the average rating is, say, 3.5, and this value is based on, say, 50 votes (but I don't know the individual ratings). Essentially, my task is to reconstruct the most likely distribution that generated the original unobserved ratings. I'm not sure it's possible given the limited information at hand, but I'd love to hear experts' opinion. One of the options I was thinking about is to use a triangular distribution to approximate the original distribution of ratings. From the practical point of view, that might do. However, how could I incorporate the uncertainty about the mode (i.e., $\bar{x}$) in my simulations (i.e., how could I take into account the sample size that my sample mean is based on)?
