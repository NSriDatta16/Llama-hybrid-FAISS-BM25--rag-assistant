Apparently, it's generally considered not to be cool to have an exit button (or menu item, or whatever) in your Android app. Apparently, this is because your application doesn't really exit. It's only minimized out of the way, and presumably, the OS will take care of it eventually. However, if what you're doing requires some level of clean-up when you're done doing it, this is what I think I know about that: Pay careful attention to the various Android "Life Cycle Methods", especially what kicks them off. Life cycle methods include onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), and onStop(). There's also onDestroy() -- the complement to onCreate() -- but I don't currently use it. These methods are called in response to various events (like pressing the Home button), but what was important in my case was that minimizing the application calls onPause() and maximizing it calls onResume(). Hence, I needed to call my set up and tear down methods from those locations, and NOT, for instance, from onCreate() and onDestroy(). There is a function called finish() that I used to use all over my code. Now it's only in the method that's called to handle loss of communication with my external device. I believe the results of calling finish() are exactly the results of pressing the Home button -- so, it's just a way to "press" the Home button in software. The long-winded conclusion to all this is the Home button absolutely WILL hide your application from the user's view. You cannot trap this key press -- no matter how badly you want to add some sort of, "Are you sure??" functionality. However, the app's been minimized, not closed, and this can either be good or bad. If you've written your start up and shut down code properly (and added it to the proper life cycle methods), you won't blow things up, and your user will be able to easily return to your app once they've learned to long press the Home button to see a list of minimized apps. With any luck, I suppose, they'll blame their frustration on Google, and not on you...
