To the best of my knowledge no. SVD and PCA are both linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. Some nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms are e.g. LLE, Kernel-PCA, Isomap, etc. About t-SNE I would like to add a point. It reduces the dimensionality (and does it pretty well!) but it is only for visualization and can not be used in learning process ! So be careful putting all these next to each other. In other words, they are all dimensionality reduction algorithms however, PCA and SVD can be used for feature extraction but t-SNE can not. All can be used for visualization purposes (in EDA). I certainly recommend reading this answer . Probably the fact that "the square roots of the eigenvalues of $XX^‚ä§$ are the singular values of $X$ " confused your friend that it's a nonlinear method. Hope it helps. Good Luck!
