Considering only the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test and not the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (which assumes symmetry of the distribution), the Wilcoxon two-sample test is a special case of the proportional odds semiparametric ordinal logistic regression model. When you use this model, not only can you adjust for other variables, but you can handle arbitrarily many ties in Y all the way to the extreme case where Y has only two value (binary logistic model). Thinking about this from a modeling perspective also exposes the assumption needed for the Wilcoxon test to be optimal: the logit of the cumulative distribution function for Y stratified by group results in two parallel curves. These need not be linear as in parametric models. This is equivalent to saying that there is a function of Y such that the transformed distributions are shifted by a constant, and the transformed difference has a logistic distribution. Examples are given in the nonparametric statistics chapter of BBR . Models unify tests.
