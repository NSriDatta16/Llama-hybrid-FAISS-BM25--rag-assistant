Standardizing dummy variables for variable importance in glmnet

I've used glmnet to build a binomial logistic regression model and I'm now trying to determine the importance of the variables in the model. I've read a few posts about how to get the standardised coefficient values from the model, for example: Variable importance from GLMNET Standardized coefficients & glmnet Initially I've approached it by standardizing all variables in my model matrix, both continuous and dummy variables, and setting standardize = FALSE . As noted in this ( pdf ) free example chapter on dummy variables in regression (in section 7.4), there is no value in standardizing coefficients of dummy variables if the aim is interpretation. My question is: Is standardizing dummy variables (as well as continuous) and examining the magnitude of the standardized coefficients a valid approach for determining variable importance? Can I say that if a standardized coefficient for a given dummy variable is larger in magnitude than a standardized coefficient for a given continuous variable, the dummy variable is more important?
