Testing the spatiale autocorrelation on the residuals of the mixed-effect logistic regression

I have temporal blocks in my data frame, so I took the effect of time dependency through a random intercept in a glmer model. Now I want to test the spatial autocorrelation in the residuals but Iâ€™m not sure if the test procedure based on the residual is the same as for the fixed-effect models since now I have time dependency. As follow, I show how I proceeded: library(lme4) library(ape) GLMM_MODEL $X, Data$ Y))) #IN UTM Data.dists.inv
