I found the following links. The concensus seems to me, don't do it. Asynch IO explorer Waiting on a file handle When an I/O operation is started on an asynchronous handle, the handle goes into a non-signaled state. Therefore, when used in the context of a WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects operation, the file handle will become signaled when the I/O operation completes. However, Microsoft actively discourages this technique; it does not generalize if there exists more than one pending I/O operation; the handle would become signaled if any I/O operation completed. Therefore, although this technique is feasible, it is not considered best practice. Egghead Cafe : Use ReadDirectoryChangesW in overlapped mode. WaitForSingleObject can wait on the event in the OVERLAPPED struct. You can also use the API WaitForSingleObject() to wait on a file change if you use the following change notification function: FindFirstChangeNotification() http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/fileio/fs/findfirstchangenotification.asp http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/waitforsingleobject.asp An interesting note on "evilness" of ReadDirectoryChangesW: http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2005/10/07/478396.aspx
