You should do something like this. I assume that out_color is declared as out vec4 out_Color: Compile shaders and attach them to the program. glBindFragDataLocation(program, 0, "out_Color"); glLinkProgram(program); glUseProgram(program); GLenum drawBuffers[1] = { GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 } glDrawBuffers(1, drawBuffers); Setup FBO. The it should work, if it doesn't, post your fragment shader and more source code. By the way, i should also say that creating a deferred renderer to learn GLSL is not a good idea. There are easier ways to learn GLSL.
