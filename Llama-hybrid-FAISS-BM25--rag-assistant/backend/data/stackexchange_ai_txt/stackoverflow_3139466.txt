So basically you want vertical scrolling within the table view, but paging for horizontal swipes? If you can live with 3.2+ compatibility (on iPhone 4.0 actually), I'd try: - stick with standard components and no fancy extra handling - use a UISwipeGestureRecognizer and add this to your table view - if the gesture recognizer fires, then check if it is a horizontal swipe, and if so change to pages programmatically Of course the whole concept only works if no swipe gestures on cells are needed - i.e. for deleting. But this is valid for all approaches, of course. Prior to 3.2, you really need to get your hands wet with the touch handlers. Subclassing UITableView and and overriding touchesBegan: etc. there would be my first try (and recognizing horizontal swipes and calling the paging), although the whole solution is ugly.
