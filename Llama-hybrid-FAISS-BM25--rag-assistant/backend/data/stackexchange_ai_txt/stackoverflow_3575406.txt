Here is what I would do. Make a test report. Link it to one of the 2 databases. Drag some fields from your source into the report. Can you preview this test report? If not, that datasource may be the problem. Do the same thing with the other datasource. If both reports work fine, make a new test report that joins the 2 datasources. If this doesn't work, then your 2 data sources may not be matching up in some way.
