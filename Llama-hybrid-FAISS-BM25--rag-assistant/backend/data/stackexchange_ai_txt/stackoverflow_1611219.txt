It is possible to pin solution files to the recently used file list. First make sure you already have Visual Studio pinned to the Start Menu. Next, drag the Solution file on to the Start Menu so that it is pinned in the main list. Now select the the Recently Used Files button for Visual Studio so that the list is showing. Drag the solution file from the main list into the recently used file list. You can now remove the solution file from the main list.
