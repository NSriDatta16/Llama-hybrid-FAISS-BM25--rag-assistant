Embedding MySQL Database into application in C#

I am currently looking into developing an application in C#. The application will need to use a database backend but I was wondering if it possible to embed a database into the application itself. I.e. the user would not need to install MSSQL or MySQL onto the computers separately to my own app but instead install my program and the database is installed with it. If possible I would like to use something like a MySQL Database but not needing the user to install the MySQL Server. Is there a free option to resolve this problem. Thanks for your help
