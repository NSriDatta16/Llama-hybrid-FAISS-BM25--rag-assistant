How to query (xmla) the size of an OLAP catalog in MSAS2008?

I would like to be able to query against an SSAS2008 instance and get a listing of all the catalogs that exist in it, as well as their respective storage sizes. In Management Studio, I can right click on the catalog and go to its properties, which retrieves this data, so I know it exists somewhere. A query that has some of the information I need is below: DBSCHEMA_CATALOGS
