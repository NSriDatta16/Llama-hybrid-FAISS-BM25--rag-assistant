Just to give a clean, up-to-date answer to this: Select an interface object, then "Editor | Arrange | Send to back/front/etc", OR Select the window object, then click on 'Window' above the interface editor and select the objects it contains This pic shows where to click: Or you can expand the object browser, use the disclosure triangle on the window object, and select from the list there: http://i.imgur.com/041xz.png If the option to send to front/back is greyed out, try double-clicking the object to select it. Thanks to Bryce Thomas for this suggestion in the comments Alternatively, the objects are listed from back to front in the order that they appear in the object browser list. Drag an object in the list to the last slot in the list to bring it to the front, for example.
