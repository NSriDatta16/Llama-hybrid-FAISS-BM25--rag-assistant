Do Bayes factors require multiple comparison correction?

As the title: Do Bayes factors require mutliple comparion correction? For more context, I am calculating very many likelihood ratio tests and I am thinking about how to handle multiple comparison correction. I thought Bayes factors might present a solution - if I am presenting the results in the Bayes factor evidence scale then I think correction should not be required? Computing full Bayes factors for every test with MCMC would be difficult (but not impossible - although I am not sure how to chose priors really), but following Wasserman (2000) , it seems that BIC can be used to approximate the Bayes factor. So it seems to get around my multiple comparisons difficulties I can simply add the $\frac{d_f}{2}\log n$ term to my log-likelihood ratio, exponentiate it and call it a Bayes factor which I can present without correction. It seems too good to be true, so what am I missing? My view is that it pushes the inference step to the reader instead presenting the Bayes factor evidence (which is of course exactly what I want to do, philosophically I don't see the need for assigning every point in an image a precise p-value) - but is this likely to be acceptable to reviewers? (The application is in neuroimaging)
