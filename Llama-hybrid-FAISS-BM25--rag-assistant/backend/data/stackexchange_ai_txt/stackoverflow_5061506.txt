The three most commonly used selection methods are proportional ("roulette wheel"), tournament, and ranking. There's no definitive list of these because, as the previous responder noted, new schemes and variants are proposed all of the time (but don't necessarily catch on). Also keep in mind that each of these can have elitist variants, where the best individual is guaranteed to be selected, that generation gaps are often used, and that proportional selection often uses some form of scaling. For one attempt at a general classification system of selection schemes, see: Thomas BÃ¤ck and Frank Hoffmeister. (1991). Extended selection mechanisms in genetic algorithms. In Belew and Booker (eds.), Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, pp. 92-99. Morgan Kaufmann. Hope that helps. -Ted Belding www.beldingconsulting.com
