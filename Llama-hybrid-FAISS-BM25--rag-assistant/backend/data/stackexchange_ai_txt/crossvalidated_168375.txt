I'm probably too late to this discussion for anyone to notice this, but I think it is a shame that no-one has pointed out the fact that the most important difference between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches is that the Bayesians (mostly) use methods that respect the likelihood principle whereas Frequentists almost invariably do not. The likelihood principle says that the evidence relevant to the statistical model parameter of interest in entirely contained in the relevant likelihood function. Frequentists who care about statistical theory or philosophy should be far more concerned by arguments about the validity of the likelihood principle than about arguments over the distinction between frequency and partial belief interpretations of probability and about the desirability of prior probabilities. While it is possible for different interpretations of probability to coexist without conflict and for some people to choose to supply a prior without requiring others to do so, if the likelihood principle is true in either a positive or normative sense then many Frequentist methods lose their claims to optimality. Frequentist attacks on the likelihood principle are vehement because that principle undermines their statistical world-view, but mostly those attacks miss their mark ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08394 ).
