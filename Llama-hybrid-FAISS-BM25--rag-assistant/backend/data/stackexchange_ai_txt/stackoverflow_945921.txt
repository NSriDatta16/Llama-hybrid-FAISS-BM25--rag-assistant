Ordering is often naturally important. Imagine if XHTML paragraphs were randomly reordered, for example. Attributes, however, are naturally a "property bag" - a set of values rather than a sequence. That's also why you can't repeat attributes with an element declaration but you can repeat elements with the same name. This is just part of how XML is designed. Properties and elements are different in many ways, not just ordering. Sometimes it makes sense to treat elements as being order-independent, but what that means will depend on the exact situation. It would be wrong, however, to treat one situation where ordering doesn't matter as a blanket justification that it should never matter.
