I haven't worked with CakePHP, but my impression of it isn't too good. If you're after a Railslike framework for PHP, I think you may be better off looking into Symfony . It's probably a bit more complicated to get started with, but the whole project seems much better organised than CakePHP. Of course, take with a grain of salt, since these things are quite subjective.
