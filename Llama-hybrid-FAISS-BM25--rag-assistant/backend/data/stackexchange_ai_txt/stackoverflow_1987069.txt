I like to try to organize functions as point-free style compositions as much as possible by doing things like: func = boo . boppity . bippity . snd where boo = ... boppity = ... bippity = ... I like using ($) only to avoid nested parens or long parenthesized expressions ... I thought I had a few more in me, oh well
