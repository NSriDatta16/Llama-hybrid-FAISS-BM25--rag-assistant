How are filters and activation maps connected in Convolutional Neural Networks?

How are the activation maps at a given layer connected to the filters for that layer? I'm not asking about how to do a convolutional operation between the filter and the activation map, I am asking about the type of connectivity these two have. For example, say you wanted to do full connectivity. You have f number of filters and n number of activation maps in a given layer. You wold get f * n number of activation maps in the next layer, and the number of activation maps would increase with each new layer. This is the way I assume it is done. Or you could say each filter is connected to just one activation map. In this case, the number of filters would equal the number of activation maps, and every layer would have the same number of filters and activation maps. This is the current architecture of my network, and it seems to learn fine. The main source of my confusion is looking at diagrams of convnets I see online. Some of them have the "full connection" between filters and activation maps, such as this - In the first layer you have 4 activation maps, and presumably 2 filters. Each map is convolved with each filter, resulting in 8 maps in the next layer. Looks great. But here we have an architecture that doesn't make sense to me - How do you go from 6 maps in the first layer to 16 in the 2nd? I can think of ways to get 16 maps from 6, but they wouldn't make any sense to do.
