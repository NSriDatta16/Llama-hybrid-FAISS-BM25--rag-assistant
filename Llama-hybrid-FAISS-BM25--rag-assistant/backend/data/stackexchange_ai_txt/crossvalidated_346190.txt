From a holistic standpoint, your courses of action will differ depending on what you are ultimately trying to achieve. When a time series is non-stationary, it means that the mean, variance, and autocorrelation are not constant. Therefore, this type of time series becomes harder to forecast. It is often the case that a differencing method is used to make the series stationary and then run the prediction. You should also note that while you used robust standard errors to attempt to correct heteroscedasticity, this does not necessarily mean that you have fixed the problem of autocorrelation/serial correlation. You should test again with the Durbin-Watson test, and it may be necessary to difference the series to eliminate autocorrelation. As another answer mentioned, these tests cannot be applied on residuals. A residual is simply the difference between the forecasted value and actual value (also known as an error term). These values are distinct from the values in the time series itself. Cointegration is an indication of whether correlations between two time series are significant or simply due to change. It occurs when two time series are non-stationary but a linear combination of them makes them stationary. i.e. if you first-difference both and they are stationary, it indicates that they both follow an AR(1) process and your time series are cointegrated. Bear in mind that the ADF test may indicate stationarity, but this will depend on the lag length that has been specified. The p-value may be significant at certain lag lengths but insignificant at others. Moreover, while your residual graph still shows slight trends (e.g. from t 10-20). A true stationary series would look more like this, for example: My first course of action would be to test for autocorrelation once again, and you may need to apply a differencing technique depending on whether stationarity is still present or not.
