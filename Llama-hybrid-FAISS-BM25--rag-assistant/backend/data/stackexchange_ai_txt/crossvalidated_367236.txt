The coefficients of a logistic regression cannot be directly interpreted as odds-ratio. One possible way to interpret them is to get back to the definition of a logistic. If the estimated coefficients are $\beta$, the predicted probability for a user with characteristics $X_i$ is $$ \hat p(X_i) = F(X_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-X_i \hat \beta}} $$ Now, to get to your questions. $\beta_3$ is the coefficient reflecting the marginal effect of being in Paris rather than in Rome (as you guessed, the interpretation of $\beta_3$ should be done with respect to the reference category: Rome). From there, you can either compute the marginal effect of being in Paris (rather than Rome), say from someone in the normal age group: $$ \hat p(normal, Paris) -\hat p(normal, Rome) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_3}} - \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_0}} $$ or you can compute the odds-ratio (see the definition of the odds ): $e^{\beta_3}$ Both Paris and London have positive coefficients. Considering only these point estimates, we can say that users in Rome tend to convert less than in Paris and London. With the current version of the model, this is true for users from all age groups. If you want to say something about how the conversion of young users differ by city compared to other old users (say), you would need to introduce interactions ($Rome*young$, $Rome*normal$, $Rome*old$, $Paris*young$, etc) and estimate the coefficients relative to all interactions.
