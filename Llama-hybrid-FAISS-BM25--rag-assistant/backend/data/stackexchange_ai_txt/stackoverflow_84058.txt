Is .NET a write once, run anywhere (WORA) platform like Java claims to be?

I remember Sun's slogan so vividly... "Write Once, Run Anywhere" . The idea being that since programs are compiled into standard byte codes, any device with a Java Virtual Machine could run it. Over the years, Java seems to have made it onto many platforms/devices. Is this the intention or was it ever the intention of .NET. If so, what kind of efforts are being put forth to make this a reality?
