Is it a good idea to cache data from web services into a database?

Let's assume that Stackoverflow offers web services where you can retrieve all the questions asked by a specific user. A request to get all question from user A can result in the following json output: { { "question": "What is rest?", "date_created": "20/02/2010", "votes": 1, }, { "question": "Which database to use for ...", "date_created": "20/07/2009", "votes": 5, }, } If I want to manipulate and present the data in any ways that I want, will it be wise to dump it in a local database? At some point, I will also want to retrieve all answers for each question and store them in a local database. The workflow that I'm thinking is: User logs in. Web services retrieve all questions asked by the logged in user, dump them in a local database. User wants all answers for a specific question, another web service does the retrieval and dump them in a local database. After user logs out, delete from the local database all questions and answers from that user.
