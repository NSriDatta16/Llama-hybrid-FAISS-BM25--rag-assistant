Yes, it's possible. The idea is called padding . This is used a lot in NLP. Simplistic example: we want to do sentiment analysis. Each sentence is one observation. Each word (or token) is a feature. You see this coming: all sentences are of different lenght. We choose an arbitrary max_length: if shorter, then add 'empty' values to those extra 'slots'; if longer then cut the sentence. To generalize: we choose an outer join set of features, so that this set includes features of most observations. Then the 'empty' slots are padded with a simple rule, or advanced imputation. Back to your vision example: images of different sizes. We choose a standardized size, then scale each image to that size accordingly (e.g. upscale with interpolation, downscale with kernel filter). The NN will accommodate your 'padding' technique to learn the true patterns of pixels, given enough data. Hope this helps.
