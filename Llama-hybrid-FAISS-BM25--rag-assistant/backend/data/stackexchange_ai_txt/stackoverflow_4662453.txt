I am not aware of any way how to do this directly in NH. ISession does not provide it, ICriteria neither. IResultTransformer just converts simple entities and lists of entities to lists. Of course there is workaround: CreateQuery ("select CustomerId, FullName from Customer") .ToList () // since now working on real objects .ToDictionary(x => x.CustomerId, x => x.FullName) However, this is not ideal since you convert results to list just to be able to convert it to dictionary. So there is one additional transformation degrading performance.
