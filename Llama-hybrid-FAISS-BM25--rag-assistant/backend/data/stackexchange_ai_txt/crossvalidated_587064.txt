Does it ever make sense to use the sum of the pre and post measure means?

Say I quantitatively measure a specific trait of each of the students in a group so that each of the students receive a score. The average score of the group is $X_0$ . After a treatment, I measure a gain, and the average score of the group post-treatment is $X_1$ . In most cases, what's interesting is the difference between $X_0$ and $X_1$ (analyzing the effectiveness of the treatment), but does it ever make sense to use the sum of $X_0$ and $X_1$ for any non-trivial purposes? If so, what is the meaning of $X_0 + X_1$ ? In addition, any references concerning this topic would be greatly appreciated!!
