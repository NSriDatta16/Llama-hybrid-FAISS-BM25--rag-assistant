String Storage and Retrieval in Android

I have a program that has items with 3 attributes. Name(String) : Count(String) : Amount(String) Currently I am writing the database when someone is trying to access a section then reading from the database. The writing is taking too long. So my question is how can I perhaps create a nested array where I can say if name = carrot then print carrot['count'] and carrot['amount']. I am very new to Java so some sample code would be great. Or any other suggestions that you may have as far as tackling this issue.
