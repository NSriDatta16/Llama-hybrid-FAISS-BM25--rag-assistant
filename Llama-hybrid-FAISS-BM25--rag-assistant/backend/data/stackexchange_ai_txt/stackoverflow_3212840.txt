Apple call this "ad hoc distribution". There are many guides around, eg: http://bluxte.net/musings/2009/05/17/ad-hoc-distribution-iphone-application . As Marcelo said, you'll need the udid from the ipad - this can be seen in itunes, connect the device and click on the 'serial number' field under the device summary. It is a lot easier using the most recent versions of xcode - once you have the certificates sorted out, there's a "build and share" feature in xcode that'll build the necessary .ipa file and automatically attach it to an email. To get to this, use the "build and archive" entry in the 'build' menu, then in the organizer window, select 'archived applications', then the date you just built, then 'share application....', then 'email...'.
