Seasonal adjustment, any major organisation uses STL?

X12 is used by the US government and TRAMO-SEATS by EU governments. Is there any major organisation that uses STL? Since X12 is more widely known than STL, I would like some supporting arguments that STL is as good as X12, apart from some numerical experiments I can run myself.
