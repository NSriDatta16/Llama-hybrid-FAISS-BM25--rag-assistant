Sliding Window Normalization

I've been reading about time series forecasting and many approaches use a sliding window method. What I don't get about it is how to properly normalize your data. Most codes I've seen so far normalize the data before slicing the windows and that doesn't seem right, because every input will rely on an information that exists outside of it (mean and standard deviation). When I'm about to make a prediction, all I have is a single window. If I'm going to normalize it, I have to do it using it's own data, otherwise I'd have to know what were the statistics used when fitting the model, so that my input stays in the same "scale" as the training data, but I don't see people worrying about that. So, in my understand, every window should be normalized after the slicing, using it's own data, and not before, relying on the whole dataset. Is that correct?
