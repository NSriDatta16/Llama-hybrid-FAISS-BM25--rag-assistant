Big Data is defined by the volume of data, that's right, but not only. The particularity of big data is that you need to store a lots of various and sometimes unstructured stuffs all the times and from a tons of sensors , usually for years or decade . Furthermore you need something scalable, so that it doesn't take you half a year to find a data back. So here's come Big Data, where traditional method won't work anymore. SQL is not scalable. And SQL works with very structured and linked data (with all those Primary and foreign key mess, innerjoin, imbricated request...). Basically, because storage becomes cheaper and cheaper and data becomes more and more valuable, big manager ask engineer to records everything. Add to this tons of new sensors with all those mobile, social network, embeded stuff ...etc. So as classic methods won't work, they have to find new technologies (storing everything in files, in json format, with big index, what we call noSQL). So Big Data may be very big but can be not so big but complexe unstructured or various data which has to be store quickly and on-the-run in a raw format. We focus and storing at first, and then we look at how to link everything together.
