In regard to jeerose's comment: http://www.aclevercookie.com/aclevercookiecom-breached-problem-resolved/ It has been brought to my attention by visitors that their virus protection goes off when they come to this blog. I investigated the matter and found that harmful code had been injected into the source of the site. This has been resolved and measures have been taken to increase the security of the site. Thanks for the report, and I apologize for the alarm. Which doesn't seem to be true. As my antivirus still fires when opening that site
