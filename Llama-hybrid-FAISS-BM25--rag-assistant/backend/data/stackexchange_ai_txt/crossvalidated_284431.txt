How to fix serial correlation in a cross sectional data set

I am doing my thesis at the moment and I needed to check the BLUE assumptions for my data set. I am doing my thesis on trying to explain IPO underpricing and my data set consists of 100 companies who did an IPO. I have found second order correlation via the Breusch- Godfrey test in stata and I was wondering if anyone here knows how to fix this. The research I have done so far tells me that is it extremely rare for a data set like this to have serial correlation, but it happened. As newey-west standard errors only work for time series and I don't have that I have absolutely no clue on how to fix this.
