You have count-data , i.e., a time series that is integer-valued and nonnegative. ARIMA doesn't really make a lot of sense in this case, since it assumes non-integer data and in principle can yield negative values. You may want to look at earlier threads tagged both "count data" and "time series" . Unfortunately, standard forecasting textbooks offer only limited guidance about count data time series, especially series that exhibit obvious trends, like yours. In your case, I would try fitting a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression, where you could regress your sales on a trend regressors. This would disregard any integer autoregressive behavior, but with just 33 observations, fitting two parameters (intercept and trend coefficient) for a Poisson regression or three parameters (the same, plus an overdispersion coefficient for a NegBin regression), I don't think expending yet another degree of freedom for potential AR effects is worthwhile. Alternatively, you may want to look into integer ARMA models, or INARMA. Mona Mohammadipour wrote a Ph.D. thesis on these a few years ago, but haven't seen them much used in the count data forecasting community. Or you could look into count data forecasting methods that explicitly model obsolescence, which is what comes to mind at seeing your series decay to zero. Prestwich et al. (2014, IJF ) and Teunter et al. (2011, EJOR ) are two recent publications proposing such methods.
