The issue is with the extra UIView you have in there. It isn't needed, and I think the touch events aren't getting enabled. I tried out the code and it didn't work like you said. Then I changed the EditorViewController to this, and it works now (all I did was to remove the extra UIView) dragging and select links now works. - (void)loadView { NSLog(@"loadView called"); webView = [[UIWebView alloc] init]; webView.frame = CGRectMake(20, 40, 728, 964); webView.delegate = self; webView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor]; self.view = webView; }
