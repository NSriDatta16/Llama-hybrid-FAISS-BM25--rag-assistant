Change combobox with rating values to a 5 Star system in my rails app

Right now I have a 5 star rating system in my application, but the way I have the users to vote is through a combo box with the values raging from 1-5. I'd like to change this combo box for a 5 star rating system (It can be post) doesn't have to be ajaxful. I have taken a look at this gem https://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating and I already got displaying the static "rating" column number from the database into a set of stars, but the I can't seem to get it working for the vote... Any suggestions?
