Ensemble time series prediction from two separate models

I have two different forecasts that are produced by ARMA models using two different data samples. The difference between the two data sets is their size: one used data from 2013-2014 and another used just 2014. I want to ensemble the two forecasts together for a better result. Are there any algorithms to do that?
