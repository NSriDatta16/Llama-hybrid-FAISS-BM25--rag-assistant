Logistic regression programs will not run on such data. There will be a division by 0 problem. However, there has been work done on estimating the true probability when you only have data at one level. I have not looked at this literature in a while, but there was a paper by Agresti and Coull "Approximate is better than exact for interval estimation of binomial proportions" American Statistician vol 52, p 119-126. They give a relatively complicated formula and also a simple approximation of adding 2 "successes" and 2 "failures" and then proceeding as usual. Another option is the "rule of 3" which says an approximate 95 \% CI for p = 1 is given by 1 - 3/n and 1. However, this does not really do what logistic regression does. Rather, either of these solutions wind up measuring the frequency of different vectors.
