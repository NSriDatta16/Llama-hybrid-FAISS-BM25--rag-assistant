Sensitivity of regression methods to outliers

I am interested in having an approximate idea of the different sensitivity of regression methods to outliers. A kind of "user guide" or manual to use. I know linear regression is sensitive to outliers, and I suppose this is also valid to non-linear regression (am I right?). I also know that boosting methods are sensitive, too. And I have read that neural networks are relatively robust to outliers. What about Support Vector Regression? Could you please confirm these and give an intuition of the sensitive of different regression methods to outliers? It would be nice to have a kind of ordered list of methods from more sensitive to less sensitive: method_1 > method_2 > method_3... if this is possible (that perhaps not). Thanks.
