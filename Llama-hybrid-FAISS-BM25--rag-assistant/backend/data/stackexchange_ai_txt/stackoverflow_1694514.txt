I Found a nice solution, but I would like to hear something that is more elegant. Within the UriMapper section I have added another UriMapping: By doing so, all navigation in the format of "/UserDetails/XXX will be navigated to same page, UserDetails.xaml. So now my HyperlinkButton is generated with a NavigateUri with the needed format: NavigateUri="/UserDetails/1234" Now, on the UserDetails.xaml page, in the OnNavigatedTo method, I can parse the Uri parameter (e.Uri) and load the User details accordingly.
