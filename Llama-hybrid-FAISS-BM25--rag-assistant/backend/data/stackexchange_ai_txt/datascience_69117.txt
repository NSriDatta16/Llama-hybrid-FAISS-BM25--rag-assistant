ValueError: Error when checking input: expected embedding_1_input to have shape (4,) but got array with shape (1,) numpy related

I am trying to predict the pretrained model of keras Machine translation but i get the error and i could not solve or find suitable answer and it seems everyone gets this error code model = load_model('model.h5') single_x_test = ['how are you'] model.predict(np.array(single_x_test, ndmin=0)) ValueError: Error when checking input: expected embedding_1_input to have shape (4,) but got array with shape (1,)
