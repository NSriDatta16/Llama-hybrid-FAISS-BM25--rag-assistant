will_paginate + ajax deletion

I've got a list of resources that I show on a paginated list using will_paginate . I haven't customized anything, here's my view: "item_li", :collection => @items%> Items is calculated like this on the controller: @items = Item.find(:all) The generated code is a simple html list with the pagination navigation links at the bottom: Item 1 Item 2 ... Item 10 Previous 1 ... I have included a "delete" button on my items. When that link is pressed, there's an ajax call to the server and the item disappears from the list (the will is replaced by "" ) My problem comes with the navigation links. Say that I had items 1 to 10 on the first page, items 11 to 20 on the second, etc. Say that I delete items 1, 2 and 3 on the first page. And then I press "next". The server will "recalculate" the list of items; since I removed 3 of the previous list, it will return items 13 to 22. In other words, items 10, 11 and 12 don't appear on the first page nor the second. How can I solve this in a simple, elegant way? So far the only solution I could find was reloading the whole page after each deletion, but then using ajax becomes pointless. Thanks a lot.
