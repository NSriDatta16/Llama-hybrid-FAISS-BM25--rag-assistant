sIFR Cause initial page load to stall?

I just recently launched my blog, and I think that sIFR is causing intial page loads to stall, basically causing an internal 500 error or timeout. The URL for the site is http://gothamblack.com/ For the life of me, I cannot determine what is going on. I am currently running the latest version of sIFR, with the replacement of the parseSelector to use "$" to leverage jQuery. Other details are: Expression Engine CMS, Mint stats, and a modified htaccess to compress files (which might be another issue if it conflicts? but I don't see how). I relocated the sIFR replacement calls to a global.js file to minimize the file requests, and that is called last in the stream. My JS files are at the following: modified sifr min with parseSelector: http://gothamblack.com/source/scripts/sifr.js global javascript file: http://gothamblack.com/source/scripts/global.js The modified htaccess file has the following commands: # Set Language and Character Set AddDefaultCharset utf-8 AddLanguage en-gb .en # Cache images and set default on everything else ExpiresActive on ExpiresDefault A259200 ExpiresByType image/gif A1209600 ExpiresByType image/png A1209600 ExpiresByType image/jpeg A1209600 # Set css and js so they can be gzipped AddType application/x-httpd-php .css AddType application/x-httpd-php .js # Expression Engine related Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On # site routing RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.gothamblack\.com$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://gothamblack.com/$1 [L,R=301] # Expression Engine related routing RewriteCond $1 !^(enginecore|feeder|images|mint|source|themes|favicon\.ico|robots\.txt|index\.php) [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L] If anyone has ANY ideas as to what I can do to troubleshoot this, that would be greatly appreciated. I tried looking at firebug when the page loads, but I cannot seem to pinpoint what it is spinning its wheels on when there is a stall. Thanks again for the help!
