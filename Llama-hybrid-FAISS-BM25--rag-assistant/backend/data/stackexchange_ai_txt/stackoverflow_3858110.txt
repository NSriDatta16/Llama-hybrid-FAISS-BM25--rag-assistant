Calculate the "mask" M : 10 raised to the power of index , where index is a zero-based index from the right. If you need to index from the left, recalculate index accordingly. Calculate the "prefix" PRE = x / (M * 10) * (M * 10) Calculate the "suffix" SUF = x % M Calculate the new "middle part" MID = value * M Generate the new number new_x = PRE + MID + POST . P.S. ruslik's answer does it more elegantly :)
