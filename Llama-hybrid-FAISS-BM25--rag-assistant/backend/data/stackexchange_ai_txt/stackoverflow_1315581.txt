MySQL Get rows between months

I'm trying to SELECT the visitors of my site per month for the current year. For every different IP/user_agent combination there will be added a row per minute. To track the hits and the unique visitors. My scheme looks like this: CREATE TABLE `stats` ( `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `domain` varchar(40) NOT NULL, `ip` varchar(20) NOT NULL, `user_agent` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `domain_id` int(11) NOT NULL, `date` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, `referrer` varchar(400) default NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 Now i would like to get all the unique visitors for all the months of a given year. But i would like to make the unique visitors only unique for 24 hours. So not for the whole month. It would be possible to just use date >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH), but this will jump to 2008 Dec after 2009 Jan. So it should only show the months of a given year. Are there function to do the same for a month (count the visitors per week, so 4 rows with the first until the fourth week)? Thanks!
