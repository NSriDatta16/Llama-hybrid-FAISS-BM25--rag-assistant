It's really going to depend on what your data look like, and what features you have selected. In some ways, this is still an open question, and one occasionally sees it in critiques of SVMs (i.e. novice users don't have a good intuition for how to tune the parameters). If you want to start with a principled approach, this paper might be a suitable starting place. If you just want to do the tuning and get things working, you can start fiddling with the parameters a bit. When I was learning this several years ago, I found setting one parameter to one, and then varying the other by order of magnitude provided a good feel for their effects.
