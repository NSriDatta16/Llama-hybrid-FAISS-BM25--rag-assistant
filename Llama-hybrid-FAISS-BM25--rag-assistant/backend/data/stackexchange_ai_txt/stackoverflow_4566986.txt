can hudson show code coverage with a maven2 project

So the question is: is there a way to have the cobertura test coverage graph be shown on the front page of a project, similar to the test trend graph, with a maven2 project? refs: cobertura graph in hudson How to generate Cobertura Code Coverage Report using Maven from Hudson If not, is this a bug I should report to them, do you think? Thanks! -r
