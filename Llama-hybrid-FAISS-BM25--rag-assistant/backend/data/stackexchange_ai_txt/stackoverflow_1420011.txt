Is it possible by just doing using Java? Quite so, the "only" thing you have to do is define an instrumentation agent which supplies an appropriate ClassFileTransformer , and you'll have to use reflection to invoke the added methods. Odds are this isn't what you want to do, though, but it's doable and there's a well-defined interface for it. If you want to modify existing methods you may be interested in something like AspectJ .
