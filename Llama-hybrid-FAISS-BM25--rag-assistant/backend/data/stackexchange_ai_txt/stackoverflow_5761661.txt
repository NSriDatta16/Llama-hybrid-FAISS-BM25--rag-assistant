An out of memory occurs when you are trying to use more memory than the maximum allowed heap size. Note however that Android's GC currently does not defragment the heap and it seems that's the issue you are running into. Your heap may have a lot of memory available, but fragmented in small chunks. If the VM cannot find a chunk big enough for the allocation are you trying to do, an OOME will happen.
