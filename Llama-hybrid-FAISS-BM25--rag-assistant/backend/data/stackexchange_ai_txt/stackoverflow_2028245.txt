Excel VBA development best practices

We are an ISV with experience developing and distributing desktop applications written in VB6. We are now developing tools as Excel spreadsheets containing VBA code. These will be downloadable free for various users including local government organisations. We've rarely distributed spreadsheets outside our own organisation before. What best practises should we follow, and are there pitfalls we should watch out for? I'm aware of the following. Digitally sign the spreadsheets with Authenticode . Any advice about that? I'm worried IT departments might impose security rules that will prevent the users downloading spreadsheets containing macros even if they are signed. Does that happen? Making sure code works on different versions of Excel (2000, 2002, 2003, 2007). Any advice? Password-protect (lock) the spreadsheets. Weak protection is better than nothing, and it's not a disaster if someone gets the source code anyway. Version control . ...maybe I should just read the definitive book ?
