On the form: And a simple validation: validate(form){ if(!form.package[0].checked & !form.package[1].checked){ alert("select something please"); return false; } Assuming that you check box are named 'package' and there are only two options. The return false will stop the form being submitted if no checkboxes are selected. There are of course more elegant ways of doing this, but this will work:-)
