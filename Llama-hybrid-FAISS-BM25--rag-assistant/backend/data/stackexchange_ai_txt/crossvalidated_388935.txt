You can't look at the increase in IND - it's a dichotomous variable (or should be). The most intuitive way to interpret logistic regression is to look at the odds ratios, not the parameter estimates you have shown. The odds ratios show how the odds of the dependent variable change with a unit increase in the independent variable. You can get R to show you the ORs, or you can calculate them yourself: They are $e^{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is your parameter estimate.
