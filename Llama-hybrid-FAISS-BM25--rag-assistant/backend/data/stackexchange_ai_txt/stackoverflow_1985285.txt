How to vertically center a child element of arbitrary size inside a floated parent element (of known size)?

How to vertically center a child element of arbitrary size inside a floated parent element (of known size)? display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; no longer seems to work when the element is floated. I created an SSCCE here: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/center-vertically-inside-float Without float , everything works as it should. But as soon as the parent element is floated , the vertical alignment fails. Any ideas how to work around this? Edit: I should’ve added that the child elements are supposed to be images. In my example page I’m using paragraphs, since I assumed I could apply whatever CSS those p elements needed to img elements with display: block; as well. (Fail.)
