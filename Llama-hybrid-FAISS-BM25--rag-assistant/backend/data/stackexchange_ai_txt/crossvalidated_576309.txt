Appropriate test for categorical independent variables with sub-level

I am stuck on how to analyse my data. I have one dependent variable and a number of indepen dent variables which are divided into further sub-categories. Some of the options for the value of an independent variable have other sub-levels than others. Concretely, my variables are organised as follows: var name levels sub-levels sub-sub levels sub-sub-sub levels post-processing no yes author grouping ignore one multiple document grouping augmentation no yes fraction 0.7 fraction 0.5 validation A B feature selection no yes method1 10 a 10 b 10 c 15 a 15 b 15 c 20 a 20 b 20 c method 2 10 a 10 b 10 c 15 a 15 b 15 c 20 a 20 b 20 c I've ran experiments with every possible combination of levels, and now I want to analyze which factors are important. However, I'm unsure how to deal with the fact that for example post-processing: no can occur, and post-processing:yes, author grouping, ignore , can occur but not for example post-processing: no, author grouping or post-processing: yes, document grouping, ignore . I was thinking of concatenating some factors, so then I'd get things like post-processing: no versus post-processing: yes_author_grouping_ignore versus post-processing: yes_author_grouping_one but then I don't know how to extract back out the effect of e.g. ignore versus one . Any help is much appreciated as are any questions if I need to clarify further!
