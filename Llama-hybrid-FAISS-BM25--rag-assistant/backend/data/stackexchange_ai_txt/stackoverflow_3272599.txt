Can you turn off (specific) compiler warnings for any header included from a specific location?

I've got a third-party library that generates a ton of warnings, even under /W3. Is there a way for me to tell the compiler, "disable C4244 for any file included from this directory, or its subdirectories"? Of course, I don't want to disable the warning in our own codebase, nor do I want to have to track down every possible include and wrap it with #pragma warning(...
