How can I best adjust my database to record the amount of rounds per fight and the round/minute a fight ended?

I'm storing statistics of what time a fight was ended in, if it ended at all . Not all fights end and the ones that don't become decisions. Example: Kitao defeated Jones via submission (keylock) at 2:14 of round 1. From this piece of data, I want to store 3 things: if the fight ended, the time in which it ended if the fight ended, in which round did it end The complex part of this, however, is that because I am tracking fights from multiple organizations, not every organization had a consistent amount of minutes per round so I can't make a column for secondsPerRound . So it seems like I need to create a separate table that tracks all possible combinations of rounds/minutes... example a fight_rounds_types table: id organization_id num_rounds 1 9 5 2 10 3 and a minutes_rounds mapping table? id fight_rounds__types_id round_num mins 1 1 1 5 2 1 2 5 3 1 3 5 4 1 4 5 5 1 5 5 6 2 1 10 7 2 2 5 8 2 3 5 Then with this type of fights table schema: CREATE TABLE `fights` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `event_id` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, `winner_id` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, `referee_id` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, `championship_match` enum('1','0') DEFAULT '0', `weight_class` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, `finish_id` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, `loser_id` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `w` (`winner_id`), KEY `e` (`event_id`), KEY `f` (`finish_id`), KEY `l` (`loser_id`), CONSTRAINT `l` FOREIGN KEY (`loser_id`) REFERENCES `fighters` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE, CONSTRAINT `e` FOREIGN KEY (`event_id`) REFERENCES `events` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE, CONSTRAINT `f` FOREIGN KEY (`finish_id`) REFERENCES `finishes` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE, CONSTRAINT `w` FOREIGN KEY (`winner_id`) REFERENCES `fighters` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=9 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 I could add a foreign key to the fight_rounds id, and for the things I want to track: minute, if the fight ended round, if the fight ended I would make a tinyint column, round_ended which can be NULL, as well as a time_ended column, and a foreign key reference, fight_rounds_types_id which would reference the type of minutes/rounds rules to use. My questions are: Is my schema for fight_rounds_types and minutes_rounds ideal in regards to normalization? Or is there a better way I can design this? What column type can I use for a time_ended column? I want to track say, 2:14 . I ended up using TIME for now, is that ideal?
