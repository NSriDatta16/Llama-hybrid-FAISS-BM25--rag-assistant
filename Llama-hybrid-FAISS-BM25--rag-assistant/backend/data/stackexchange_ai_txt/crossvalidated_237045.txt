Yes, by all means interpolate, smoothly if you can, as a first step to getting a curve shape. The 24 hour temperatures if they are meant to be end of day averages and if they are changing linearly in time, occurred 12 hours sooner than at the end of the day. Similarly, if the six hour temperatures are given at the end of that time period, and if they changed linearly with time, actually represent occurrences three hours earlier. For different shaped temperature curves, this deconvolution of temperatures will have temporal offsets to earlier times that are approximately 1/2 of the measurement interval, with the exact proportion depending on the functional shape, moreover, in the non-linear temperature case, the shape of the curve will also be distorted by smoothing, i.e., temporal averaging. It is theoretically possible to correct for these effects, but with 24-h averaged data, one cannot reconstruct the more or less sinusoidal day versus night temperature variations. With six hour readings, one can reconstruct diurnal variations, if not exactly. To know what the effect is, one examines the integral of a candidate function from t-tm to t, where tm is the time period of averaging. The correction needed is then found by fitting the results of integration to the data, and looking up what that means before integration. I am sure there are more general ways of doing this deconvolution, but cannot think of any offhand. So, we need to know if the six-hour temperature are snapshots at those times or averages. Also, we need to know how overcast it is going to be to deconvolve for the correct diurnal temperature variation, whether or not a cold or hot front is moving in to upset our calculations, if there is precipitation, what the wind speed and air temperature versus temperature of the ground, or water we are over is, along with the relative humidity. In other words, to even get a good local time temperature from a 24 hour prediction, we need a lot of data processing and lots of models. So, a lot depends on how accurately you need to process your data, and which factors you want to account for while doing it. Advice, start simple. Add factors as it becomes obvious they are needed.
