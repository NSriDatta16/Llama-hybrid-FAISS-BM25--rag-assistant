I am not really clear what it is that you are trying to achieve from the current UI (are you looking for branch offices? other companies? etc?) I am not a big fan of using pure geographical proximity to define regions. For example, if one company operates in NYC, it could have an office in NJ which could well be as far as the moon. On the other hand, for a company in anchorage, an office in Vancouver could still be within the region. Unfortunately, state boundaries are fairly meaningless too. For example, I live in western PA, and can tell you that while Pittsburgh and Philly are in the same state, they could be different countries for all that matters, and most companies have offices in each. If your project is lamp based, why not just let a user click a point on the map, and based on that ask him what he means (e.g., nearest city, entire county, entire state, entire country?. If you then need to define the entire region, you can perhaps use some sort of a grab tool to click or delineate all the other regions that could be part of it? Either way, present your offices as pushpins on the map, and then maybe have a list on the side the way that standard google maps handles searches. It may be a lot of work, but if it's an important form, users may prefer that over manual text entry or selections from a list.
