If you print repr(send) and repr(received) instead of just printing sent and received , you'll have a much clearer idea about exactly what you're sending and what you're getting back in return (so you can check if @theatrus' suggestion is correct, etc, etc, and at all times clearly see what you're doing). This is close to one of my favorite pragmatical principles: whenever printing or logging a string that might possibly be in error, always print its repr (or %r instead of %s , if that's how you're doing the formatting), never just the plain string itself (or its %s , which does nothing to it). Over and over again, if you don't use the repr , you'll waste substantial amounts of time debugging problems that you can't really see because the characters that snuck into the string by mistake and are therefore causing said problems aren't showing clearly in the logs (non-printing characters, control characters, and so on). So, always use repr to display or log strings unless you're 100% certain that they are perfectly correct and predictable -- get into the habit, it isn't any harder than not doing it once you are in the habit, and over the years you will have many occasions to thank this little, simple principle.
