One of the main reasons for using wxWidgets over certain other widget libraries is that wxWindows is cross-platform compatible. Embedding IE would destroy that. This means that (a) it's probably not a great idea (even if you're not writing for cross-platform now, you may change your mind in the future), and (b) you won't find many other people doing it, so tutorials and examples will be hard to come by. My suggestion would be to consider a cross-platform browser instead of IE; Firefox seems like the obvious choice. With that in mind, I did a quick google for you and came up with this, which seems like it may be a solution for you: http://www.kirix.com/labs/wxwebconnect.html Hope that helps. [EDIT] Of course, a Firefox-based widget would give you much better CSS/JS/HTML rendering than current versions of IE, so that's another good reason to use it instead. [EDIT] Revisiting this answer because I stumbled upon a Webkit widget, which might also be worth checking out. Here's the link I just found: http://wxwebkit.kosoftworks.com/ (I know this doesn't change anything for the OP, but it might be helpful for anyone else who finds this page)
