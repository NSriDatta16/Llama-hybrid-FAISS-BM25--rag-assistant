I got is. You use backreferences, import re smallBig = re.compile(r'[a-z]([A-Z])') ... cleanedString = smallBig.sub(r'\1', dirtyString) This removes the small letter but keeps the capital letter in cases where the ' ' of html tags were stripped and you sit with text like pSome new paragraph text /p Quick and dirty but it works in my case.
