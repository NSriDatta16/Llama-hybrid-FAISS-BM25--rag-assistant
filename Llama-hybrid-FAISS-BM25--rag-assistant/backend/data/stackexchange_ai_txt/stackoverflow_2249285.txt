Django Master-Detail View Plugins

Let's say I have 3 django apps, app Country , app Social and app Financial . Country is a 'master navigation' app. It lists all the countries in a 'index' view and shows details for each country on its 'details' view. Each country's details include their Social details (from the social app) and their Financial details (from the financial app). Social and Financial both have a detail view (for each country) Is there an elegant way to 'plug' in those sub-detail views into the master detail view provided by Countries? So for each country detail page I would see 2 tabs showing the social and the financial details for that country.
