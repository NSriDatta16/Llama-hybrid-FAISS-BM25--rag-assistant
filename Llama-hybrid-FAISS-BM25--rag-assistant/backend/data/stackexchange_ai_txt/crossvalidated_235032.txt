Any use of non-rectangular-shaped kernels in convolutional neural networks? Especially when analyzing game boards

I have been reading a pile of papers on convolutional networks and reinforcement learning. I remember seeing an important paper with a non-rectangular shape of the convolution layer (the green shape in this silly drawing). But now I cannot find it. It might have been something similar to the AlphaGo paper or reinforced learning on a game board. Can any one suggest or guess which paper it was?
