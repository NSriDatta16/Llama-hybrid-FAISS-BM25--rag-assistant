MySQL replication and Django FileField

I have MySQL replication setup, and it replicates nicely the database data. However, I also use FileField and ImageField, and have file loaded onto the FS. I probably will just use rsync to manually replicate this, but is there a better way? I know of key value storage. But for this project, I am looking to minimize the number of technologies involved and stick with simple options. I've successfully used rsync for this before, but I was wondering if others who have done this have any new cool tools (or even rsync wrappers) that work better. Your experiences are appreciated.
