Iteration over std::vector: unsigned vs signed index variable

What is the correct way of iterating over a vector in C++? Consider these two code fragments, this one works fine: for (unsigned i=0; i and this one: for (int i=0; i which generates warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions . The unsigned variable looks a bit frightening to me and I know unsigned variables can be dangerous if not used correctly, so - is this correct?
