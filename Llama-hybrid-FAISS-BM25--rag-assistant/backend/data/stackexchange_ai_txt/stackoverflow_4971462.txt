System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension does what you want: string path = "hello.exe"; string newPath = System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension(path, ".coverage"); EDIT: Your using statement should be using System.IO , and then you can use it as you have it or like this: Path.ChangeExtension(path, newExtension); Also, Console.WriteLine can't be used as you have it. You could do this though: Console.WriteLine("{0} - {1}", path, newPath);
