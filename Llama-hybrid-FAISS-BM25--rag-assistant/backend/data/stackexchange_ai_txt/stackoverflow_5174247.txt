I think jQuery is the best here, it is also javascript and all you do is embed it to your website. And if you want a semi-transparent effect to view that you are dragging, I think you can add an event for a dragging handle. Use onMouseDown and onMouseUp. For example, this div is handle your youtube: The CSS for transparent is: opacity: .7; filter:Alpha(Opacity=70); whereby 0.7 and 70 is the opacity percent of element! [Example]: . Ok, If you change your mind somehow and you want to use jQuery, give it a try, I promise it is extremely easy! First of all, embed this into your website: $(document).ready(function(){$(".drag").draggable();}); Secondly, give anything you want to drag a class "drag", in this case: YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO EMBED HERE Use it together with the semi-transparent effect, I think that all you need, and I hope this help. xx3004,
