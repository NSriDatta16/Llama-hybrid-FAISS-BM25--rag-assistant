Is it possible to empirically discriminate distributions of the probability of a binary outcome?

I am interested in systems with an observable binary outcome (e.g. Success, Failure). The individual cases are usually modelled (e.g. using logistic regression) as having an estimated probability of success. This probability of success could be viewed as just a side effect of observational ignorance: Each case is predetermined as a Success or Failure. We just don't know until we look, and the set of covariates doesn't allow partitioning the cases into exclusively S or F cases, so every group of cases we can identify by the covariates has a mixture of S and F. Or the probability of success could be viewed as a real but unobservable property of each case: Cases are not predetermined to be S or F, rather that status is determined by some outcome process such that when we get around to observing it, each case will be S or F. Each case has an unobservable probability of Success that determines the probability that the observed outcome is S and we have no access to any better information. If we take the latter interpretation, it makes sense to talk about the distribution of the probability of S over cases. Given some group of cases with a known group probability of S it seems to me that there are an infinite number of distributions of case-level P(S) that would yield the same group-level P(S), i.e. all distributions with the same expectation of P(S). This would range from all cases having identically the same P(S) through to each case having P(S) either 1 or 0, with the group-level P(S) determined by the fraction of cases having case-level P(S) = 1. So the question is: Assuming each case has it's own fixed probability of Success and only the outcomes can be observed, is it possible to empirically discriminate between different distributions of probability of Success over cases? I strongly suspect the answer is 'No'. If the distributions can't be empirically discriminated, is it possible to relax some aspect of the above assumptions (e.g. by allowing partial observability of the process that translates the unobservable probability of Success into the observable outcome) so that the distributions of probability of Success are empirically discriminable? That is: What would you have to do to make it possible to empirically discriminate between different distributions of probability of Success over cases? Thanks Ross
