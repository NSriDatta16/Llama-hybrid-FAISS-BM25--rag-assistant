CompareValidator with aspCalendar

I ve two aspCalendar controls on the website. I would like to perform validation (date from Calendar2 should be greater then date from Calendar 1). There are a lot examples of validation but with ControlToValidate as textBox or label, What about more complex Controls, is there any way I can tell which property from that control has to be used? Maybe Client side validation ? But how to do this ? Thanks for help
