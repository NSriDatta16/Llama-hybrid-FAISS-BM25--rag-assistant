Shake Detection iPhone 3.0 not working

I have a ViewController that works perfectly with a button that trigger an action. I would like to replace the button with a shake event so I've googled it around and created a ShakeDetector class that ineherits from UIView and my implementation is as follow: @implementation ShakeDetector - (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake ) { // User was shaking the device. Post a notification named "shake". //[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"spin" object:self]; NSLog(@"sss"); } } - (void)motionCancelled:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } @end But I can't make it work... any help? Thanks
