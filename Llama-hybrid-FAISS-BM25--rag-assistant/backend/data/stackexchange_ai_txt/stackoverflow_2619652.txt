There are two relatively straightforward ways of trying to extract the appointment names. Use a Sequence Labeling Package If you have a labeled data set, you could train a sequence model, using packages like CRF++ or Yamcha , to pull out appointment titles like "Lunch with Mike". Use Named Entities and Rules If you don't have a labeled dataset, you could probably get some milage out of using a named entity recognizer to tag all the people, locations, and organizations in the appointment text. As a bonus this will also give you times & dates, so you won't need to write your own code to pull those out. With the named entities all labeled, it should be pretty straight forward to write some rules to extract or construct titles for each appointment. If you're looking for a Java based NER tagger, you could use the one released by Stanford or the one distributed with OpenNLP
