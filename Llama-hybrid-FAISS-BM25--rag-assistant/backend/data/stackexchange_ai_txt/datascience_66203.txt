How to handle data with dependency on two different dates

I am currently dealing with a dataset that contains multiple date-time fields: "buy-date" and "receive-date" which both have an effect on the prices and amount of offers made. One example could be: +------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+ | Buy-Date | Receive-Date | price | volume | orders | +------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+ | 2016-07-13 | 2016-09-01 | 123 | 10 | 100 | | 2016-07-13 | 2016-10-01 | 444 | 8 | 30 | | 2016-07-13 | 2016-11-01 | 234 | 0 | 0 | | 2016-07-14 | 2016-09-01 | 789 | 5 | 12 | | 2016-07-14 | 2016-10-01 | 321 | 6 | 54 | | 2016-07-14 | 2016-11-01 | 543 | 22 | 50 | | 2016-07-14 | 2016-12-01 | 654 | 12 | 4 | +------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+ I wanted to use this data either in conjunction with an autoencoder or lstm or cnn to search for errors in the dataset. But I don't know how to handle a dataset with two dates that influence the values. I thought of just indexing everything from 0 to N and handle this as a normal sequence instead of a time-series. I might just use Buy-Date and Receive-Date simply as features for network instead of as indexes. E.g. convert 2016-07-13 to 3 Fields with "buy-year", "buy-month", "buy-day". But how should I than go over the data? Can I still use a sliding Window? Should I just go through everything as if it were another kind of sequence without a temporal aspect? Could that work or is there something I don't see? Is there a name for this type data-set? It doesn't seem to be a normal time series but it also isn't a panel.
