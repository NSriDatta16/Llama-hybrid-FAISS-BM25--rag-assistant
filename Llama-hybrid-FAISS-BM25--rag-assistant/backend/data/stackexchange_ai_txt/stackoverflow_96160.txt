Web Dev - Where to store state of a shopping-cart-like object?

You're building a web application. You need to store the state for a shopping cart like object during a user's session. Some notes: This is not exactly a shopping cart, but more like an itinerary that the user is building... but we'll use the word cart for now b/c ppl relate to it. You do not care about "abandoned" carts Once a cart is completed we will persist it to some server-side data store for later retrieval. Where do you store that stateful object? And how ? server (session, db, etc?) client (cookie key-vals, cookie JSON object, hidden form-field, etc?) other... Update : It was suggested that I list the platform we're targeting - tho I'm not sure its totally necessary... but lets say the front-end is built w/ASP.NET MVC.
