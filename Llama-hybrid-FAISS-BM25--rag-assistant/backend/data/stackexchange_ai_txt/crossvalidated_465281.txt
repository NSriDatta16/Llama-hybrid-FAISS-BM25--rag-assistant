Instrumental variables: In which cases would the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and local average treatment effect (LATE) be similar?

It seems that if the proportion of always-takers in the control group (to whom eligibility was not assigned) is much smaller than the proportion of compliers in the treatment group (to whom eligibility was assigned), then ATT would be similar to LATE. Is this correct? If so, why?
