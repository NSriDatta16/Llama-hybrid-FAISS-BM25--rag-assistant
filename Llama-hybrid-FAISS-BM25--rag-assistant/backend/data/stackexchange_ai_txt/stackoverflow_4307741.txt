I always use session. I've seen you concern about the persons not using cookies, but i don't think that is a problem these days as i don't think there are many users denying cookies. My preference for session is that it's easy to store and retrieve and easy to setup. When you scale out (to more servers) you can easyly setup your application to store the the sessionstate in a sql server database so you're ready for the future too. Hidden fields i use sometimes when there is not sensitive information stored between the steps, because the user can edit the value of the hidden fields. If there is a lot of info to share between the posts and you don't want a lot of hidden fields, you can also create an object for your storage (like you would create when you would stoe it in session) and the serialize the object, base64 encode it and store it in ONe hidden field.
