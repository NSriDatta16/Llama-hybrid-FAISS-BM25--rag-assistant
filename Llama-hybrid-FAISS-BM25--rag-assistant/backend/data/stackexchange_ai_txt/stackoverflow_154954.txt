In addition to the debugger, I've also used logging and old fashioned paper and pencil. On occasion I've found really hard bugs, like code that runs fine in debug mode, but breaks in release mode. I've even occasionally rewritten perfectly good code that for whatever reason, doesn't work reliably, figuring that it's better to be reliable than elegant. I sometimes try to redefine what others term a bug as really being a feature, but that seldom works!
