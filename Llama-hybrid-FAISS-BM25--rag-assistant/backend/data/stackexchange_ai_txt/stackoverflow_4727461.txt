Using scandir() with Magento

For the home page of my Magento store, I am using a basic gallery script which scans a predefined directory using scandir() and outputs each filename to be displayed in the gallery. Everything works ok on my local machine, but the script seems to ignore the scandir() and just proceeds as normal without any errors or warnings. If I replace the scandir() and input the filenames directly, the gallery script works fine. What is going wrong here?
