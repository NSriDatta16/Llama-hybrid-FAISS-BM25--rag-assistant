Theoretically: Is there any advantage/reason on using a particular model for ML over another?

A neural network doesn't really care about the activation functions, and if we choose any activation function and a compatible loss, the model will converge into something. In a way, any model will be as good as another. From this point of view, the only reason to pick a model over another would be the time spend to fit the data. At the same time, say we have just one neuron, and we are fitting the classic of cat v non-cat with either linear or binary regression. But why would you choose any of them, if we can't really see the shape of the data, like we do in a plot? Then, I assume the function itself is quite irrelevant. I'm doing tests, but theoretically, would this be the same?
