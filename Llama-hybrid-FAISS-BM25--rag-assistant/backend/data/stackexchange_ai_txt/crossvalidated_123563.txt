Are LASSO regression predicted values also biased?

Since LASSO regression biases coefficients to reduce variance, aren't the predicted values also biased? In my case I am looking at fitted values from a predictive logistic regression model with LASSO penalty. The distribution of predicted probabilities appears shifted toward zero. I think that if these values are bias, which I think they are, it is okay since these are the predicted values from the model that minimize the misclassification error -- so even though they aren't true predicted values they are the ones that correspond to the "best" model. I keep scratching my head over this. o_O
