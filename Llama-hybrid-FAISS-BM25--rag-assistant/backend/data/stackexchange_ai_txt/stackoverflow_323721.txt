You could store your session in a SQL database , thus the application restart would not lose your sessions. Having precompiled non updatable code to deploy would make your xcopy faster alright but app pool would still be restarted. UPDATE: @configurator, making your comment visible to any casual observers http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317604 (there is plenty of coverage of the different options and how-tos out there, e.g. more than one session db, different frameworks dbs in same db, etc)
