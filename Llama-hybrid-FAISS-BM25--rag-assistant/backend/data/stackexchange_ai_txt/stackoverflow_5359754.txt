From eclipse to phone I get INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE

I am working on a game in eclipse. I connect my android phone to test the application. Upon pressing "RUN" in eclipse, the game will begin to be uploaded to my device. However, it onl makes it half way then the console in eclipse gives me this error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE. I checked my internal storage and I have 30mb left. My game is 3.20mb. I should have plenty of room. shouldn't I? Is this just a bug?
