Saved PCA model produce different result

I'm using PCA to reduce my feature vector dimension. I'm saving its model and transformed output like this: from sklearn.externals import joblib from sklearn.decomposition import PCA pca_transformed_fit = pca.fit(data) pca_transformed = np.around(pca.fit_transform(data), 10) np.savetxt('reducedFeatures.txt', pca_transformed, delimiter=',', newline='\n', fmt='%1.10f') joblib.dump(pca_transformed_fit, 'pca.model') data is the output of VGG16. As I want to have only 10 decimal places, I rounded the transformed output. So I want to use saved model to process feature vectors again with the code below: from sklearn.externals import joblib pca = joblib.load('pca.model') pca_transformed = np.around(pca.transform(samples), 10) np.savetxt('reducedFeatures_again.txt', pca_transformed, delimiter=',', newline='\n', fmt='%1.10f') BUT the problem is the outputs are not the same for a given feature vector. As long as these transformed data are very meaningful, what can I do to have the exact output?? If you need more clarification, just ask for it. Thank you!
