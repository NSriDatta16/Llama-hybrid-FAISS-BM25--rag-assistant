Methods to find out how categorical choices contribute to an optimal value

Say I need to create $200$ objects. I need to use $3$ processes to build a single object, let's call these processes $A,B,C$. Each of these processes can be executed in two ways. So process $A$ can be executed either by using method $a_1$ or $a_2$. Process $B$ can be executed using either method $b_1$ or $b_2$. And process $C$ can be executed using either method $c_1$ or $c_2$. Once an object is created, it is evaluated and given a value $v$. As there are 2 ways of executing each process, and there are 3 processes, that means there are 8 different combinations possible to create an object. Say I created 200 objects with each of these 8 combinations of methods. I then have a dataset that looks like this: Attempt A B C v 1 a1 b1 c1 1.9 1 a1 b1 c2 4.0 1 a1 b2 c1 1.8 1 a1 b2 c2 2.5 1 a2 b1 c1 1.8 1 a2 b1 c2 4.2 1 a2 b2 c1 1.7 1 a2 b2 c2 2.0 2 a1 b1 c1 1.7 2 a1 b1 c2 4.5 . . . . . . . . . . 200 a2 b2 c2 3 So for a given combination of methods, say $(a_1,b_1,c_1)$, I have created 200 objects, and have a distribution of values for those 200 objects. I have such a distribution for each of the 8 possible combinations of methods. I want to know what the combination of methods is that led to the largest average value. This is of course easy to do, as I can just average over the 200 values for each method combination and pick the largest one. My question is this . I would like to gain some insight into the relationship between the choice of methods for $A,B,C$. Specifically: How important are each of the choices? Perhaps the choice of method for executing process $B$ and $C$ have no impact on the value of the produced object, and it's all down to the choice between $a_1$ and $a_2$ for $A$? The relationships between choices. Perhaps $a_1$ is better when combined with $b_2$, but $a_2$ is better when combined with $b_1$. What methods are available for me to gain such insight? I was considering using a regression model on the categorical variables in order to answer point (1). In addition to a solution, some insight into available options would be very much appreciated!
