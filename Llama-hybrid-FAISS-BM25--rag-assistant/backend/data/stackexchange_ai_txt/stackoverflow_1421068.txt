.htaccess 301 redirect of single page

After a site redesign, I've got a couple of pages that need to be redirected. Everything is staying on the same domain, just a couple of things have been reorganised and/or renamed. They are of the form: /contact.php is now: /contact-us.php Using the .htaccess file, I've added this line, which is the one I find recommended most: RedirectMatch 301 /contact.php /contact-us.php This is mostly fine - it does the job - the problem is, it also redirects: /team1/contact.php /non-existant-folder/contact.php Is there a way of specifying that I only want to redirect the contact.php in the root?
