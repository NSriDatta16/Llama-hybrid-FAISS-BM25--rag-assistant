In Erlang, is it possible to send a running process to a different node?

I have been researching Mobile Agents, and was wondering if it is possible to send a running process to another node in erlang. I know it is possible to send a process on another node a message. I know it is possible to load a module on all nodes in a cluster. Is it possible to move a process that might be in some state on a particular node to another node and resume it's state. That is, does erlang provide strong mobility? Or is it possible to provide strong mobility in erlang?
