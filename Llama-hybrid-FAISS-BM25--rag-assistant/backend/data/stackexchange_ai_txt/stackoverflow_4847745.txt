You should be able to do something like this: ((JavaEditor) window.getActivePage().getActiveEditor()).getSelectionProvider().getSelection() However, it sounds like you are trying to invoke an IAction based on a selection. Presumably this is registered via an editorActions extension point (or something similar). If so, I would have a look at the SelectionDispatchAction class, which dispatches actions based on the current selection (as the name implies). This class is internal API, but you may still find it useful.
