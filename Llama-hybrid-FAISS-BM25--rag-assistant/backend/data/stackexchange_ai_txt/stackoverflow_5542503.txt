Like all averages, the answer depends upon the choice of metric. For a given metric M, the average of some angles a_k in [-pi,pi] for k in [1,N] is that angle a_M which minimizes the sum of squared distances d^2_M(a_M,a_k). For a weighted mean, one simply includes in the sum the weights w_k (such that sum_k w_k = 1). That is, a_M = arg min_x sum_k w_k d^2_M(x,a_k) Two common choices of metric are the Frobenius and the Riemann metrics. For the Frobenius metric, a direct formula exists that corresponds to the usual notion of average bearing in circular statistics.
