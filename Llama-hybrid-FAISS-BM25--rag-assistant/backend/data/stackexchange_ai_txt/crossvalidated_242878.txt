Keeping getting wrong answer calculating confidence intervals

I was given the following: A sample of 16 domestic cars is made whose average fuel economy is 30.313 and a standard deviation of 4.7583. A sample of 10 imported cars is made whose average fuel economy is 32.012 with a standard deviation of 8.878. Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two means. I attempted to do the calculation but but my answer was incorrect and the online homework system said the answer was (-7.192, 3.794) What I did was the formula $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ $\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$ for the margin of error. I was a little unsure of what degrees of freedom I should use but i noticed by looking at the table there was not a single value on the table that would get me the answer the system said. the $t$ value would have to be 1.801518 and the limiting value of the $t$ is the $z$ value of 1.96. So am I using the wrong formula or is the system just wrong? I looked at a few other problems I war marked incorrect for saw similar things.
