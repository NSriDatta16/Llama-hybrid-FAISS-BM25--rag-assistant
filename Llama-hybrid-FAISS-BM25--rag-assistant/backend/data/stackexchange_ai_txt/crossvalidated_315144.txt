Probability of $\text{arg}\max_i \mathbb{E}(X_i)$ with limited samples

We place ourselves in a multi-armed bandit setting. Each arm yields a stochastic reward in $[0,1]$ under an unknown distribution. After several pulls ($n_i$ pulls for arm $i$), we collect a dataset of observations: $$ \mathcal{D} = \{\{x_{ik}\}_{k\in[1,n_i]}\}_{i\in[1,m]}$$ How can I measure the probability that arm $i$ is the one yielding the maximum rewards on average? ----- Old problem explanation ----- I have a set of $m$ independent random variables: $$\{X_i\}_{i\in[1,m]}$$ We have a dataset where each variable has been iid sampled $n_i$ times: $$ \mathcal{D} = \{\{x_{ik}\}_{k\in[1,n_i]}\}_{i\in[1,m]}$$ How can I estimate efficiently (computation-wise and precision-wise) the probability of the argmax of their expectations? $$ \mathbb{P}\left(\text{arg}\max_i \mathbb{E}(X_i)|\mathcal{D}\right)$$ NB: In my case, $n_i$ values can be very different, like 5 for some variables and $10^4$ for others. $m$ is typically below 10.
