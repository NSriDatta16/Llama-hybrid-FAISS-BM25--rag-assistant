jsdom only implements the DOM interface, but the drawing context isn't part of that interface. To get what you want one, would have to implement the 2D context: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#canvas-context-2d I guess it could be done in JS using a gargantuan array... but it would be horrible slow. So either someone goes ahead and writes a C/C++ implementation for Node, or you're out of luck ATM. I suppose that you need the internal state to initialize new clients, correct? In this case you could just push the drawing actions onto a stack and send that to the client, the client then pops the stack until he reached the current state of the drawing. EDIT OK apparently there's something over at the GitHubs: http://github.com/joshthecoder/crayon But it doesn't look like this is in any way production ready, the code is really sparse and there's only a test for surface creation. MAYBE the linker does some magic here and exposes the cairo stuff to node, but even then that would only expose the cairo functions them selfs and one would still have to implement the 2DContext spec on top of that.
