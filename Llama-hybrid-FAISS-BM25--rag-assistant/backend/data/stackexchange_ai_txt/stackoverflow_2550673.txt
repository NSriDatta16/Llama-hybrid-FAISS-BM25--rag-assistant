UIScrollView content visible then bounces away

I have a pretty simple UIScrollView defined inside Interface Builder. I've pasted in some UILabels and when I run my app, I can drag to see the UILabels at the bottom but as soon as I let go it bounces away from view. What property controls this sort of setting?
