Micheal Foord has the following example for Embedding Ironpython from within Ironpython The basic steps are to create your shell application. For a real lightweight GUI there is EasyWPF . Use pyc to compile your script to an exe and the standard library into a DLL. Depending on if you need to capture stdout from the scripts or pass variables in information into them, things can get more complicated as indicated in the article. A basic example is listed below. import clr clr.AddReference('IronPython') clr.AddReference('System') clr.AddReference('mscorlib') clr.AddReference('Microsoft.Scripting') clr.AddReference('MyStandardLib') #Now you can reference things like 'import lxml as L ..... from IronPython.Hosting import Python from Microsoft.Scripting import SourceCodeKind spath = "C:/fred.py" # Path to script engine = Python.CreateEngine() #Now add your assemblies (like the standard library) to the engine for assembly in clr.References: runtime.LoadAssembly(assembly) source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromFile(spath, SourceCodeKind.Statements) mod = engine.CreateScope() runtime = engine.Runtime source.Execute(mod)
