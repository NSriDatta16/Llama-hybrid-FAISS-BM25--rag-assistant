Some convenient way to transform time series into stationary one

In this Machine Learning Mastery post we read that in order to predict time series using LSTM network, it is good to make the data stationary first and then scale it to the interval $(-1, 1).$ In order to scale the data, we can just apply MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing . However, in order to make the data stationary Jason Brownle writes its own functions. Question. Does sklearn provide a tool to transform the data into the stationary one? If no, maybe there are other packages which do it.
