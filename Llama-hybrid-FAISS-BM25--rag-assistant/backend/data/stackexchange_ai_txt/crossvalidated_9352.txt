Can anyone explain why I have obtained an anti-predictive Support Vector Machine?

I'm playing with support vector machines (SVM) using the e1071::svm() function in R, and I encountered a scenario where I asked it for a leave-one-out cross-validated classification of a 2-category response and obtained a total accuracy of 38% (35/90), which, given 90 samples, ends up with a 95% confidence interval that is below chance. Should I consider this a fluke, and if not, how is it possible for an SVM to become anti-predictive? In case it matters, I used default values for the cost and gamma parameters, and the data predicting the response was a 8192 item vector representing 500 milliseconds of electroencephalogram data collected across 64 electrodes.
