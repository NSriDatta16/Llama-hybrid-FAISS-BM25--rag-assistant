If you're goal is to make your code as useful and available to everyone in the world, choose a particular liberal license that explicitly gives people the right to use your work. Organizations with legal departments like explicit licenses, and people want licenses that work in their jurisdiction. Although Greg mentioned SQLite, he didn't point out that they acknowledge on their license page the problem of public domain and how it doesn't work everywhere for everyone and every use. Public domain actually limits some people, so they also sell licenses. Furthermore, take a look at the Creative Commons FAQ for CC licenses haven't been ported to my jurisdiction (country). What can I do? for more information on international problems with licenses. Some licenses, such as various flavors of the Gnu Public License (GPL), have been disfavored by companies because they don't want to release their modifications or have various company rules in conflict with GPL (e.g. the Apple App Store). Check if that affects your use. If this is something other than a casual decision for you, such as releasing a huge code base formerly owned by a Big Company, you might want to get a real IP lawyer rather than ask a bunch of programmers. :)
