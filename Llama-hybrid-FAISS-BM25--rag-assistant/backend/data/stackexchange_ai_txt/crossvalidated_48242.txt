Heavy tailed multi-variate distribution?

I have been asked to look at some spatial data, which I have assumed is multi-normally distributed in 3 dimensions (and to a reasonable approximation this appears to be true). Actually, all I've been asked to do is provide a table so that someone can specify a probability and I tell them how many standard deviations of their data they need to have that coverage so I wasn't expecting this to take long (i.e. 1.96sd = 95% in 1D). On a closer inspection of the data it is rather heavy-tailed and based on what I think it's wanted for these are the interesting data so I think I possibly shouldn't be using the normal distribtuion, making this a more interesting task. The only two-tailed, tail heavy distribution I know of is the t-distribution and a quick google search seems to imply that there is not a natural multi-variate extension of this although I could just use the one on wiki. Is there a multi-variate t-distribution that's considered 'best' or is there a better distribution that I should be considering?
