Best way to make a UIVIew look like a UIView in IB?

I'm trying to make resizable UIViews of which users can resize (code is done for that) and drag it around. Now I need to make it look like what it looks like in IB, with circles at its corners to drag, and dotted lines as borders of the UIView. How do you think I should go about doing this? Many thanks.
