Image storage as a service

Google App Engine provides a image API for storing / retrieving images. We are currently not in a position to deploy our application on top of App Engine because of limitations in the java frameworks (jboss seam 2.2.0) we are using to build our j2ee application. We would eventually want to deploy our production application on top of Google App Engine, but what are the short term options (java based open source products) which provides comparable functionality to Google App Engine's Image API and will have an easier migration path at a later point in time.
