I think you might be experiencing something called "Stein's Paradox" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_example What it says that if you add random noise to your data, there will exist an estimator that uniformly performs better than estimation without the noise. However, what it does not say is that if you have an estimator, (in the case of logistic regression probably something computed using IRLS) then that estimator will be improved by adding noise, just that somewhere out there, there will exist an estimator that does better using that noise.
