Now, I understand that the proportions have a binomial distribution Independent Bernoulli trials have a binomial distribution, but proportions in general don't. Unless you have some reason to think that the stains are independent, a binomial distribution is not appropriate. If you're hypothesizing that the stains are independent and the samples within a category have the same population parameter p (i.e. IID within a type), then you can take the (weighted, if the number of cells in each sample is different) averages for each type. If you're not hypothesizing that, then in some sense you have a sample size of $12$ and no distribution. You could do a paired test, but the power of the test would be rather small. and t-test is probably not appropriate because the variance of proportions is known. I don't see how. The variance for binomial tests is calculated from p, which isn't known a priori . So that indicates t-test. But if you're assuming IID and the number of cells is large, then the difference between t-test and z-test is neglible.
