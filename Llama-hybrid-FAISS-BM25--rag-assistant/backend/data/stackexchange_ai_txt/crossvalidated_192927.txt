If your problem is "simple enough" a very effective way to do this is using the "Bayesian Information Criteria". It is defined as: $BIC=\chi^2+df\times ln(n)$ . Where $df$ is the degrees of freedom of the model (number of points - number of fitted parameters) and $n$ is the number of data points you have. $\chi^2$ is basically the residual sum of square divided by $n$ (the number of points), if the variance of each data point is identical. If not, divide each squared residual by the variance of each point. If a model gives you a BIC which is at least 2 lower than another model, then the new model is better.
