I think translation could produce results close to original word frequencies, assuming expiriencing human translator. However, this will be subject to two kinds of error: first, word usage will reflect translator own preferences for word choices, (this can theoretically be fixed by using a number of different translations) and second, seeing original English sentences can also affect word choices and phrase choices. For some words, such as people names, organization titles, locations, and other similar words, results will probably be unsatisfactory, but for less specific words, results should be reasonable good approximation. That said, I don't see the reason to use this approach for except for rare and dead languages. It is costly and time consuming task to translate enough text. For many languages, reasonable corpus of native language speakers writings can be obtained at a small fraction of a cost, for example by downloading language-specific wikipedia pages (they are avaliable to download as archives), getting some research corpus, developed for that language, or at last resort by crawling some portion of relevant web pages.
