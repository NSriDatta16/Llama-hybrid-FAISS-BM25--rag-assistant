Here's my todo list when I've run across this. 1) Clean all targets, exit Xcode, then go drag the build folder from your project to the trash. 2) Do the Get Info on your project, make sure the Code Signing Entitlements and Code Signing Identity are selected correctly. Do the same for your Targets. 3) Login to the iOS Provisioning Portal and make sure the Distribution certificate has not expired. Also check the Distribution Provisioning Profile and make sure it is Active. Make sure the Certificate is properly in your Keychain and the Distribution profile is in Xcode Organizer (if you have multiple of the same one, delete all but the correct one and redo step #2). 4) Look at your Build Results on the failure and identify which profile it is actually using and make sure it is the right one.
