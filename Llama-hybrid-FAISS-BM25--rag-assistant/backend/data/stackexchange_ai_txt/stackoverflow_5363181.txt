use encoding 'utf8' is broken. Rather than interpreting \x{ed} as the code point U+00ED, it interprets it as the single byte 237 and then tries to interpret that as UTF-8. Which of course fails, so it winds up replacing it with the replacement character U+FFFD, literally "ï¿½". Just stick with use utf8 to specify that your source is in UTF-8, and binmode or the open pragma to specify the encoding for your file handles.
