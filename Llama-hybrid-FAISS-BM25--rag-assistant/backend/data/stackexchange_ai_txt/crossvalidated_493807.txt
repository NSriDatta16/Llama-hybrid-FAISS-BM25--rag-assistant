How to calculate the ACF and PACF for time series

I just started with time series analysis and I would like to know whether there is a formular for calculating the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for time series data. While there are forumlars for 'normal' data points and have not found any for time series. Maybe there is a special algorithm for doing that? I know that it is quite easy to calculate the ACF and PACF using e.g. R or Python. But how is this done? I'd appreciate every comment and will be quite thankful for your help.
