AFAIK SharePoint should also support HTTP GET/POST for reading/writing data. However, in my own experience, reading/saving data from Java to SharePoint usually involves problem at the authentication level. In fact SharePoint usually uses NTLM authentication, which is hard to implement in Java. I did some experiments in the past using HttpClient and implementing NTML authentication as described here , which requires jCIFS . Another quicker, but dirtier, option is the following. Since SharePoint ultimately stores files on the file system, just expose that path as a Windows UNC Path , and make it available from the machine where your Java application runs. Then, Java can just open a File on the UNC Path in the usual way, and everything is transparent for you application (A UNC Path will look something like \\machine-name\path\to\store ). This is not very elegant, and possibly not very secure.
