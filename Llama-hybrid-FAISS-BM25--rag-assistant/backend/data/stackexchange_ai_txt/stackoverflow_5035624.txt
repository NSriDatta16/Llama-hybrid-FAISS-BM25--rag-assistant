Iphone SDK: Image arrays?

I'm making a "Tapping-App" where you have to kill zombies by tapping on them. Currently i can't make any progress because i can't use the methods i need properly. My App works like that: I have a timer that spawns an image 3 times per second: [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1.0/3 target:self selector:@selector(Spawn) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; then i have the Spawn command: - (void) Spawn { CGRect myImageRect = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 109.0f); UIImageView *myImage = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:myImageRect]; [myImage setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage.png"]]; myImage.opaque = YES; [self.view addSubview:myImage]; [myImage release] } I also have a "TouchesBegan" command: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; } What I want to do, is put all the spawning images into an Array; If one of the images is touched i want it to be removed from the superview.I want to know how an array works and how i can remove objects added to the array from a different function like "TouchesBegan". Please help me with my problem! EDIT: Nevermind... I searched around the internet and found some useful resources witch were almost what i needed. I finally figured out how it works and got my spawner function to work with collision and with "TouchesBegan". If somebody wants the code, just ask me. DD
