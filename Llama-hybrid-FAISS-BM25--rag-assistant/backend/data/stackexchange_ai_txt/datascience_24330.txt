Initializing a recurrent neural network (RNN) in Keras

When we create an RNN in Keras, does it learn an initial hidden layer (ie. $h_0$, like a bias term)? I'm having trouble figuring this out, but I have looked here . Can anyone highlight a part in the code that shows an initial hidden layer is being learned? Or is it just randomly initializing the hidden layer? EDIT: The code is here , I'm just having trouble identifying where the hidden layer is initialized and what it is initialized to.
