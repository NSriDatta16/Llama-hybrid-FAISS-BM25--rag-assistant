Google fonts API generates CSS 2.1 validation errors

Pages using the Google Font API validate as CSS3, but not as CSS2.1. Here is the href, straight out of the Google instructions: CSS 2.1 and XHTML 1.0 Strict are unreasonably restrictive, so I'm not against scripting workarounds when there is no workable solution (i.e. for embedding Flash video, that is, there's no other cross-browser, easily implementable solution that I know of). Is there a workable solution, and if not, can anyone suggest a script workaround? Or should I just validate as CSS3 and call it good?
