If you have a directory full of arbitrary and randomly named files and 'time' is the only factor, it may be more pointful to establish a filename that matches the timestamp to eliminate need for using tools to view it. 2008_12_31_24_60_60_1000 Would be my recommendation for a flatfile system. Sometimes if you have a lot of files, you may want to group them, ie: 2008/ 2008/12/ 2008/12/31 2008/12/31/00-12/ 2008/12/31/13-24/24_60_60_1000 or something larger 2008/ 2008/12_31/ etc etc etc. ( Moreover, if you're not embedding the time, what is your other distinguishing characteritics, you cant have a null file name, and creating monotonically increasing sequences is way harder ? need info )
