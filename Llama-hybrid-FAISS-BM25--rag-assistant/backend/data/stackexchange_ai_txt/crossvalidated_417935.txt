Here, because of the presence of interaction, the main effects don't have a direct interpretation. That's not true. The "Farm Small" effect is the log odds ratio for TB where there are 0 cattle (if it's a projection, shift "Cattle" to a useful center). The "cattle" effect is the odds ratio for "TB" for "one differing value of cattle" where farmsize is big. Those interpretations are ironic because you don't have data dictionary, so use your knowledge of the codes or design to refine as needed. The Hosmer and Lemeshow equation for getting an OR for effect A conditional on effect B where A interacts with B is predicted at a specific value of the B (that's why setting the "B" to 0 leads to the interpretation above). The reason why the predicted odds ratio of TB for Farm Size where Cattle = 1 is not statistically significant is that for that particular value of Cattle, the odds ratio you find is very close to 1. It's not surprising because the interaction is so significant. In fact, in any logistic regression model where there is a non-zero interaction term, you can project some value of the "B" variable to get an instantaneous odds ratio for A that is exactly the null hypothesis. It just so happens that this specific prediction of Cattle = 1 is within a range where the can't be excluded for that value . It's just a matter of correctly interpreting the output.
