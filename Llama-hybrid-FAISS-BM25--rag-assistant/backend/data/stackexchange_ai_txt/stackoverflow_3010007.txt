A software/hardware structure of the Google Search/Maps Linux-clusters?

I am particularly interested how one can deal with a huge amount of information for a commercial service like Google Search or Google Maps. We all know they use (or "did" at least) a kind of Linux clusters, but how exactly are they organized? What kind of hardware do they use, what file systems, networking, what problems are the most frequent?
