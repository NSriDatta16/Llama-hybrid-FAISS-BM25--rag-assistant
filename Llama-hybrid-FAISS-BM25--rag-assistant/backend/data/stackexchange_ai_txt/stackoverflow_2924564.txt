A stretchable image is divided into 9 parts, if both leftCapWidth and topCapHeight are nonzero. leftCapWidth +--------------+ ^ | | | | | | A | | B | | topCapHeight |-----+·+------| v |-----+·+------| | C | | D | | | | | +--------------+ The central parts are always 1 px in size, and this is the part that is stretched, for example: leftCapWidth (constant!) +------------------+ ^ | | | | | | A | | B | | topCapHeight (constant!) v |-----+ - - +------| v | | . . | | | . . | ^ |-----+ - - +------| | C | | D | | | | | +------------------+ >----- To create a "glass pill button", you should fill the rounded border into the regions A, B, C and D above, and supply the radius of that pill into both the leftCapWidth and topCapHeight . Also, a stretchable image is not shrinkable . If you try to use stretchable images bigger than the buttons (or whatever else) you want to apply it to, they may be rendered incorrectly (especially on older iOSes).
