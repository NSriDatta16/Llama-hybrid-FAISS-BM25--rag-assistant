How can i set values in cookie and get values from cookie not using with shared object in flex?

Hi I need to save email-id in my login form through the cookies. if I use shared object I am able to save but my requirement is need to save in cookies. How can I save? I got sample code from net. Attaching that code `package com { import flash.external.ExternalInterface; /** * The Cookie class provides a simple way to create or access * cookies in the embedding HTML document of the application. * */ public class Cookie { /** * Flag if the class was properly initialized. */ private static var _initialized:Boolean = false; /** * Name of the cookie. */ private var _name:String; /** * Contents of the cookie. */ private var _value:String; /** * Flag indicating if a cookie was just created. It is true * when the cookie did not exist before and false otherwise. */ private var _isNew:Boolean; /** * Name of the external javascript function used for getting * cookie information. */ private static const GET_COOKIE:String = "cookieGetCookie"; /** * Name of the external javascript function used for setting * cookie information. */ private static const SET_COOKIE:String = "cookieSetCookie"; /** * Javascript code to define the GET_COOKIE function. */ private static var FUNCTION_GET_COOKIE:String = "function () { " + "if (document." + GET_COOKIE + " == null) {" + GET_COOKIE + " = function (name) { " + "if (document.cookie) {" + "cookies = document.cookie.split('; ');" + "for (i = 0; i isNew property indicates if the cookie * already exists or not. */ public function get isNew():Boolean { return this._isNew; } } } `How can I use this? I need to integrate this with jsp by default swf file is embedded in jsp. How can I save only username (email-id)? If user reenters again it should show in dropdown. how can I pass text input text into the cookie? Please help me in these Thanks in advance.
