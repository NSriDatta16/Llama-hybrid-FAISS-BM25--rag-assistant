Doc2Vec Input from Paragraphs

I understand how doc2vec works, but I am unclear the best practice on feeding in data. Suppose we have a document with multiple sentences ['I really love football. Peyton Manning was a great player'] If we feed this into the algorithm as is, the window for 'Peyton' could include ['love','football','Manning','was'] This doesn't make intuitive sense to me, however, since the words come from different sentences. Any suggestions?
