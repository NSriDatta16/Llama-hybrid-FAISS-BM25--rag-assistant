Some considerations in random order: 1) I'm not sure that would make a proper thesis, but it's mainly my opinion. A more interesting thesis from my point of view would be to evaluate more learning algorithms (random forests, svm, neural nets...) on the task and see which one performs better. Picking neural networks a priori doesn't seem fair to me. 2) if you are not a machine learning practitioner, you have a long journey ahead of you. A good start might be the course that professor Ng teaches on the coursera site (which is taught in Octave, an open source version of MATLAB). 3) matlab and SAS knowledge is fine for your needs, although python and R are mainstream at the moment. 4) you don't necessarily need a deep neural network for your task. They are essential in image recognition tasks to obtain good results, but with numerical data it is often the case that a shallow network (1-2 hidden layers) is enough.
