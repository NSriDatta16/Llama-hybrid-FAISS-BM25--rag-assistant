Find best machine learning for predicting category of products

I have a dataframe that contains product and in this dataframe I have some features like: brand, cat1 , cat2 , cat3 , city , desc , image_count , mileage , price , title , year . The goal is predicting category of products. I have 1 billion training data and important features for prediction are title and description that are text type. I like to know what algorithm is best for my prediction? I'm a beginner in machine learning and confused among different algorithms. Thanks
