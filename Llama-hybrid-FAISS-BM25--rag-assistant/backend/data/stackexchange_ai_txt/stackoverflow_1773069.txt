Using jQuery to compare two arrays of Javascript objects

I have two arrays of JavaScript Objects that I'd like to compare to see if they are the same. The objects may not (and most likely will not) be in the same order in each array. Each array shouldn't have any more than 10 objects. I thought jQuery might have an elegant solution to this problem, but I wasn't able to find much online. I know that a brute nested $.each(array, function(){}) solution could work, but is there any built in function that I'm not aware of? Thanks.
