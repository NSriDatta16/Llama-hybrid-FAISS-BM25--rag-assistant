By default, for security reasons ,OpenSSH denies your request to use the private key for authentication if you didn't set your permissions right for the keys files, which is 600(r+w for user and deny for rest). Run chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa* from Git bash, assuming you installed Git for Windows . If it's not that then you most probably didn't follow through the steps of creating a key pair and importing the public key to GitHub. You might want to re-take those steps paying more attention( Generating & Troubleshooting ).
