Have a look at ROC curves aka Receiver operating characteristics . To quote from the Wikipedia page: In signal detection theory, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or simply ROC curve, is a graphical plot of the sensitivity vs. (1 âˆ’ specificity) for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC can also be represented equivalently by plotting the fraction of true positives (TPR = true positive rate) vs. the fraction of false positives (FPR = false positive rate). Also known as a Relative Operating Characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR & FPR) as the criterion changes.[1] ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making. The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battle fields, also known as the signal detection theory, and was soon introduced in psychology to account for perceptual detection of signals. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, and other areas for many decades, and it has been introduced relatively recently in other areas like machine learning and data mining. It is actually easier than it sounds and makes comparisons easy -- 'better' methods will visually dominate the ROC curve of an inferior method. R has a number of packages for this.
