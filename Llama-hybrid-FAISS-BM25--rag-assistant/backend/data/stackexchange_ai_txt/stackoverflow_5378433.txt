Tiling windows with perl script - are nested arrays a bad idea?

I am writing a script which would tile X11 windows dynamically in Perl. So far I am going to use an array of arrays containing windows coordinates, sizes and ids to store state of tiled windows during session. Is it a good idea or should I organize this information in any other way?
