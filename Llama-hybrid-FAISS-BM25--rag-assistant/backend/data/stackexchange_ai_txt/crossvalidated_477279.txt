lme4 - nested time structure

I have a group of participants that performed measurements in 9 session. We performed 3 measurements per session of the same variable. Normally we would average these 3 measurements and call it a day, but I thought it would be nice to use this in the model. For the 9 sessions it would have looked something like this: full_model I could do the same thing with the individual measurements (1-27) and replace 'session' with 'measurement', but they are not quite independent because they were sampled in the same session. Instead, I tried something like this: full_model However, I do not believe this returns the correct coefficients. Across sessions the slope should be positive and within sessions it was negative for this particular variable, however, if I correct it like this the slope for measurement is negative. This is not really what I'm interested in. So the final thing I came up with was: full_model This kinda made sense to me as session (1-9) is nested within participant and measurement (1-3) is nested within session. The coefficients seem plausible to me, but is the model legit? OK, this also seems to give reasonable coefficients: full_model Where ncmeasurement is 1-27 and nmeasurement is 1-3. I'm even more confused now..
