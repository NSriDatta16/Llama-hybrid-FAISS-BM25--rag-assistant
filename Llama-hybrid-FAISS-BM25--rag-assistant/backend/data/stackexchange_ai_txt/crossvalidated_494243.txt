If your random variable is bivariate, then every realization is a pair of numbers. The expectation of a random number can be thought of as "the long-run average". A long-run average of a large number of pairs makes most sense as a pair of numbers, not a single number. Specifically, as the pair of the separate long-run averages. Which is why the expectation of a multivariate random variable is defined as the vector of separate expectations . More mathematically, the definition is that $$ E[X] = \int_\Omega X(\omega)\,dP(\omega), $$ and of course each $X(\omega)$ is a vector. There is no notion of multiplying the components of $X$ together. This is just integrating a vector-valued function $f\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^k$ to have $\int_X f(x)\,dx$ , which is a different animal than integrating the product of the components of $f$ , which would be $\int_X\prod f_i(x)\,dx$ .
