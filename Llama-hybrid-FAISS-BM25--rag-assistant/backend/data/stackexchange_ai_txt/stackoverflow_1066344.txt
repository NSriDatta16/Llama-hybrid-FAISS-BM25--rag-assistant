GlazedLists : a GUI adapter framework for viewing/editing/navigating/filtering/sorting/binding lists of objects with a JTable or JTree. (e.g. if you have a list of MP3 objects with various fields like Artist, Title, Album, Genre, etc. it makes it very easy to map the fields of the MP3 object to the columns of a JTable, formatted the way you want, without having to write much code.) Good for small-to-moderately-large lists of objects stored in memory: you have to use GlazedLists' BasicEventList and other associated classes as the collection implementations, rather than your own arbitrary List<> , unless you want to implement all of the methods of the EventList interface... so this makes it hard to encapsulate preexisting storage mechanisms (like a database, for instance). I've used it on List<> s of items in the 5000- to 50000-count range and it is fairly fast.
