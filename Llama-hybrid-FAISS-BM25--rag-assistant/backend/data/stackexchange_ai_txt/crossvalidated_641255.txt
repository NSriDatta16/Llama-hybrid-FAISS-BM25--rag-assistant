Bias and unbiasedness are concepts that apply to estimates, or estimators, of an unknown population parameter. Thus, I would argue it makes no sense to discuss "the (un)biasedness of a point forecast" without - explicitly or implicitly - specifying which functional of the future distribution we want to forecast. We may want to forecast conditional expectations, and then our point forecast may be biased or unbiased as an expectation forecast . This is Diebold's implicit assumption. However, as you write, it is quite often the case that we don't want an expectation forecast, but a quantile forecast. (For instance, for setting target safety stocks, or to build dams that are not only high enough for average floods, but for long tail floods.) In this case, I would say it makes perfect sense to discuss whether a particular quantile forecast is biased or unbiased. In this latter case, of course an unbiased quantile forecast will usually not have an expected error of zero. A related but separate problem is that of detecting biases in our point forecasts. Yes, we can use quantile losses to elicit quantile forecasts... but given a sequence of quantile forecasts and corresponding realizations, each separate forecast, or the entire algorithm for producing them, may or may not be biased. And this is very hard to detect.
