It seems to me if you label business analyst, subject matter experts, technical person and a user interface person as "the product owner" team, you really haven't deviated from "pure" agile. That said, "pure" agile is somewhat of a misnomer because most agile advocates will tell you that the #1 or #2 selling point is its ability to adapt to the business processes and corporate culture of your existing organization. The critical success factor might be having that product owner team, and all stakeholders really, invest in participating in some of your dev team's agile processes (showing up for demos, being accessible for questions during the sprint, etc). Edit: This quote from Wikipedia documents the very simple role of the Product Owner: The Product Owner represents the voice of the customer. He/she ensures that the Scrum Team works with the “right things” from a business perspective. The Product Owner writes customer-centric items (typically user stories), prioritizes them and then places them in the product backlog. Scrum isn't meant to enforce processes on how the Product Owner gets their job done. It's only the interface between the Product Owner and the Team (sprint planning and sprint review) that Scrum tries to outline.
