What you quoted is quite inappropriate for .NET assemblies. The Windows side-by-side cache is for unmanaged DLLs, the exact equivalent in .NET is the GAC. Furthermore, the compiler already embeds references to the dependent assemblies in the assembly manifest. You can see it if you run Ildasm.exe on your assembly. Double-click the manifest, you'll see the .assembly directives listed. Fwiw, embedding your own Windows manifest in a class library is not a problem. Just use Project + Add New Item and select the Application Manifest File template item. The auto-generated content is completely wrong for a DLL of course but it does get embedded in the DLL. You can see that by using File + Open + File and selecting your assembly. You'll see the RT_MANIFEST with resource ID 2. Just to reiterate: don't do this for a managed DLL unless you want to enter reg-free COM directives.
