Let $i=1,\dots,N$ index the rows and $j=1,\dots,M$ index the columns. Suppose you linearize the combination of variables (columns): $$Z_{i,1} = c_{i,1}\cdot Y_{i,1} + c_{i,2}\cdot Y_{i,2} + ... + c_{i,M}\cdot Y_{i,M}$$ The above formula basically says to multiply row elements with a certain value $c$ (loadings) and sum them by columns. Resulting values ($Y$ values times the loading) are scores. A principal component (PC) is a linear combination $Z_1 = (Z_{1,1}, ..., Z_{N,1}$) (values by columns which are called scores). In essence, the PC should present the most important features of variables (columns). Ergo, you can extract as many PC as there are variables (or less). An output from R on PCA (a fake example) looks like this. PC1, PC2... are principal components 1, 2... The example below is showing only the first 8 principal components (out of 17). You can also extract other elements from PCA, like loadings and scores.
