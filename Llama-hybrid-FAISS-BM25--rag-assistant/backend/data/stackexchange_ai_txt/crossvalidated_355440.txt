Is reinforcement learning only suitable for path dependent problems?

I have a game that I would like a neural network to teach itself. In the game there are an infinite number of initial states and the agent can then take one binary action, which will give him a reward or a punishment (of variable amount, which can be deduced from the initial state of the game). After each move, the game is reset. Is this a problem that might be suitable for reinforcement learning? I'm asking because it appears to me that a simple backpropagation cannot solve this problem accurately, or at least it's not clear to me if such a loss function with asymmetric payoffs, combined with binary crossentropy could work.
