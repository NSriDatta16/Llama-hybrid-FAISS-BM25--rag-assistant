The short answer to your question is: it depends who you ask ;-) Die-hard Bayesians will declare victory over, or at least parity with, frequentist methodology. Die-hard frequentists will default to "This can't be answered". The other 99% of statisticians will use whatever methods have been shown to be reliable under inerrupted experiments. I know that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution to the intentions of the researcher can be troubling, and there is really no good solution to that problem. Bayesians and frequentists alike must use some subjectivity and judgement in deciding how to form an inference. However, I think you are taking an example from an area that is generally controversial and laying the problems solely at the feet of frequentist inference. The sequential and/or stopped experiments are classic examples of the subjective nature of inference ... and to which there is no absolutely objective and agreed upon answer. What about regular inference, where you actually collect the sample you intended to get? Here, I think the frequentists have the upper hand, as CI's and p-values are well calibrated wrt their repeated sampling properties, whereas Bayesian inference retains its personal and subjective nature. If you want a more theoretical exposition of the Bayesian response, I would read about "conditional inference" with key researchers being Nancy Reid and Lehmann.
