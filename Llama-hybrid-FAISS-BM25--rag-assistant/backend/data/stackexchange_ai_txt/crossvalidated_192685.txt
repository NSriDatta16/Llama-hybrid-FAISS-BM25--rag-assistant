Crossover study, multiple measure

I'm trying to analyze data from a crossover study, where two treatments ($A$ and $B$) are applied to $n$ patients (each patient receive both treatments). For each treatment I have an outcome with multiple measurement. For example patient 1 for treatment $A$ has $m_{A,1}$ measurements and for treatment $B$ has $m_{B,1}$ measurements. The measurement are relative to the same variable. I'm interested in proving that treatment A and B do not differ. If I had one measurement for each candidate and each treatment I would have done a paired test (paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test) At the moment I'm averaging the measurements and conducting a paried test on the average. Is there a bettere way to do it?
