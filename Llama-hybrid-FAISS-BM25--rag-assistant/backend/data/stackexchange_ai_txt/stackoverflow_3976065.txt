You are using a WinForms application, therefore by using the keyword this it will refer to the form class you are using which does not have a definition for Controls.AddBookmark . I suggest you take a look here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc442946.aspx This will show you how to create a word addin from which you can then use this code to add a bookmark. Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.Bookmark bookmark1; bookmark1 = this.Controls.AddBookmark(this.Paragraphs[1].Range, "bookmark1");
