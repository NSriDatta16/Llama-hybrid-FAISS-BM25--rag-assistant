Image manipulation while on touch event is inefficient !

I have two images overlayed and i copy pixels from bottom image to top image while ACTION_MOVE. My goal is to give erasing feeling to the user but sometimes it doesn't copy(erase) some parts and it gets worse if touch event is fast( dragging finger fastly). This is the code i am using for copying pixels mutable.getPixels(pixels, 0, width, xPos, yPos, width, height) ; mutable2.setPixels(pixels, 0, width,xPos, yPos, width, height) ;
