How to use jQuery to assign a class to only one radio button in a group when user clicks on it?

I have the following markup. I would like to add class_A to (that holds the radio button and the label) when user clicks on the or . If user clicks some other radio-button/label in the same group, I would like to add class_A to this radio-button's parent paragraph and remove class_A from any other paragraph that hold radio-buttons/labels in that group. Effectively, in each , only one should have class_A added to it. Is there a jQuery plug-in that does this? Or is there a simple trick that can do this? 1 Some text here First subitem Second subitem 2 Some other text here ... First subitem ... Second subitem ... Third subitem ...
