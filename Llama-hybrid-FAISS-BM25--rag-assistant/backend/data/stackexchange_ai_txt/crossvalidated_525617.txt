Here are some resources (not all books): Papers: Chapter 76 Large Sample Sieve Estimation of Semi-Nonparametric Models (Handbook of Econometrics) I consider this the gold standard treatment of Sieve, it is theory heavy Sieve Extremum Estimation This is an easier version of the above Nonparametric Sieve Regression: Least Squares, Averaging Least Squares, and Cross-Validation Books: Abstract inference by Ulf Grenander This is the founding treatment All of Nonparametric Statistics by Larry Wasserman Ch.8 and 10 would be helpful Empirical Processes in M-Estimation by Sara A. van de Geer This book is good for learning the techniques needed for the asymptotic analysis of sieve Mathematical Foundations of Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Models This is not about sieves but the chapter on approximation theory is very relevant to sieve Videos: Nonparametric Sieve Estimation
