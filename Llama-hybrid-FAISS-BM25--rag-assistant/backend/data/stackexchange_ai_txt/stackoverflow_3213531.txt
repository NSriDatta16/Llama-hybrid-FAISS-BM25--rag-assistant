Creating a new Location object in javascript

Is it possible to create a new Location object in javascript? I have a url as a string and I would like to leverage what javascript already provides to gain access to the different parts of it. Here's an example of what I'm talking about (I know this doesn't work): var url = new window.location("http://www.example.com/some/path?name=value#anchor"); var protocol = url.protocol; var hash = url.hash; // etc etc Is anything like this possible or would I essentially have to create this object myself?
