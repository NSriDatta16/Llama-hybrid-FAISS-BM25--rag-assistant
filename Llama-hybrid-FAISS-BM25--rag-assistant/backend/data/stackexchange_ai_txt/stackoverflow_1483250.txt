I'm sure this will not make much difference, but you could benchmark a large data set to try it out. I searched the excellent MySQL Performance Blog for references without finding anything. The MySQL manual section on optimization has this to say, which is only marginally related For MyISAM tables, if you do not have any variable-length columns (VARCHAR, TEXT, or BLOB columns), a fixed-size row format is used. This is faster but unfortunately may waste some space. See Section 13.1.3, “MyISAM Table Storage Formats”. You can hint that you want to have fixed length rows even if you have VARCHAR columns with the CREATE TABLE option ROW_FORMAT=FIXED.
