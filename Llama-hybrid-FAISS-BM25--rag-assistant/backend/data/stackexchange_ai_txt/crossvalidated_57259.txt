Highly unbalanced test data set and balanced training data in classification

I have a training set with about 3000 positive instances and 3000 negative instances. But my test data set is pretty much un-balanced. The positive set only has 50 instances and negative has 1500 instances.This causes the precision very low. Are there any approaches to solve this problem? I use SVM to build classifier.
