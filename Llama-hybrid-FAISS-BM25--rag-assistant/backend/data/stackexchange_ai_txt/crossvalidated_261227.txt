Neural network for multiple output regression

I have a dataset containing 34 input columns and 8 output columns. One way to solve the problem is to take the 34 inputs and build individual regression model for each output column. I am wondering if this problem can be solved using just one model particularly using Neural Network. I have used a multilayer perceptron, but that needs multiple models just like linear regression. Can sequence to sequence 1 learning be a viable option? I tried using TensorFlow it does not appears to be able handle float values. Any suggestion to tackle this problem by using just one unified model specially using neural network will be appreciated. Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, & Quoc V. Le (2014).
