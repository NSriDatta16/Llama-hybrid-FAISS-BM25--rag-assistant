Begin and monitor progress on long running SQL queries via ajax

Is it possible to start a query that will take a significant amount of time and monitor progress from the UI via Ajax? I considered starting the process as a "run once" job that is scheduled to run immediately. I could store the results in a temporary table for quick retrieval once it's complete. I could also log the run time of the report and average that out, to guestimate the running time for the progress bar. I use Microsoft SQL 2005 at the moment, but I'm willing to other DBMS such as SQL 2008, MySQL, etc if necessary.
