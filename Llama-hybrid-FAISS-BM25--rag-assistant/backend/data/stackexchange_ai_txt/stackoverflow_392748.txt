I tested this in Firefox with Firebug using code like this: console.time("testEquality"); var n = 0; while (true) { n++; if (n == 100000) break; } console.timeEnd("testEquality"); and console.time("testTypeEquality"); var n = 0; while (true) { n++; if (n === 100000) break; } console.timeEnd("testTypeEquality"); My results (tested five times each and averaged): ==: 115.2 ===: 114.4 So I'd say that the miniscule difference (this is over 100000 iterations, remember) is negligible. Performance isn't a reason to do === . Type safety (well, as safe as you're going to get in JavaScript), and code quality is.
