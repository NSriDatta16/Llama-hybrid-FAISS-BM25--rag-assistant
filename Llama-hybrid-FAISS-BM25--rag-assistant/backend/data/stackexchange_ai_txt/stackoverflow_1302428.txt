What does jquery $ actually return?

I have read the JQuery documentation, and while much attention is devoted to what you should pass the function, I don't see any information on what it actually returns . In particular, does it always return an array, even if only one element is found? Does it return null when nothing is found? Where is this documented? I understand that jquery methods can be applied to the return value, but what if I want to just use the return value directly?
