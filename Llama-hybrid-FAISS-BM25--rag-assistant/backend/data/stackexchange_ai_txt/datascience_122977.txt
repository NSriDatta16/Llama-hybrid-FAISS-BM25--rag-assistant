Feed two matrices into an mlp neural network

So Im trying to train a recommender system (w/ DQN) using two sets of data , first is a 2D array size $N\times N$ where the diagonal is the current content (= state) and the rest row is the correlation between them in $[0,1]$ and the second $N\times N$ array has the content's cost for example: cost : tensor([[0, 0, 1, 1], |[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0]]) Content: tensor([[0.0000, 0.1521, 0.8630, 0.0475], [0.1521, 0.0000, 0.3607, 0.3768], [0.8630, 0.3607, 0.0000, 0.2905], [0.0475, 0.3768, 0.2905, 0.0000]]) How should i manage the data to input them to an MLP, my state size and the action size are the same $N$ .
