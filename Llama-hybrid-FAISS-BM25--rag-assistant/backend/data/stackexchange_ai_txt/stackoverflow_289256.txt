Similar to Robert's suggestion, we've written our own version of Code Smith. Our "Code Generator" has two parts: SQL & Classes. SQL: Will generate the Update, Select & Delete stored procs. C#: Will generate the classes and save the file as a .cs We call: sp_MShelpcolumns ' tablename ' to get a list of fields and data types and then do a replace. Its not a perfect solution, but is very effective to getting the first 80% completed
