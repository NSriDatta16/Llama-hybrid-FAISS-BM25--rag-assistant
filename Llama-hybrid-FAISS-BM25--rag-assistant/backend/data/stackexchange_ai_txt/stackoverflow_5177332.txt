ViewData: In short, use ViewData as support data, such as a datasource to a SelectList. ViewModel: ASP.NET MVC ViewModel Pattern When a Controller class decides to render an HTML response back to a client, it is responsible for explicitly passing to the view template all of the data needed to render the response. View templates should never perform any data retrieval or application logic â€“ and should instead limit themselves to only have rendering code that is driven off of the model/data passed to it by the controller. [...] When using [the "ViewModel"] pattern we create strongly-typed classes that are optimized for our specific view scenarios, and which expose properties for the dynamic values/content needed by our view templates. Our controller classes can then populate and pass these view-optimized classes to our view template to use. This enables type-safety, compile-time checking, and editor intellisense within view templates.
