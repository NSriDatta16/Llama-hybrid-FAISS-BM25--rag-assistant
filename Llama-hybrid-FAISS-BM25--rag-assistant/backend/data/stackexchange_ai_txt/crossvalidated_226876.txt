Identifying question type (Natural Language)

So far, I found an article about this: Question answering System As it can be seen on page 105 (section 3.1) and the graph in section 3.2, the questions can be classified depending on which words come after each why/what/where. Is there any model that you know about that is complete for describing questions? (i.e. how long is for length, how old is for age, etc) I tried searching for English Language Model Ontology but so far I didn't get too far. My problem is, probably, that I don't know the name of the term I'm trying to find.
