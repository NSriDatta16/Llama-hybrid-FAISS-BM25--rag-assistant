Weighting in Likert Scale results

I have referred to similar questions on this topic, but the problem presented then was not quite in line with my research, so I have created a new question. My research is the following: I have conducted a Likert Scale survey with 500 results in two groups, A and B, and 250 responses for each one. Nevertheless, the results are not representative of the underlying population (which is not 50%-50%), therefore any analysis I try to run (e.g. Clustering, PCA, even Pearson's Chi-Squared independence tests) will not be representative of the actual population. Is there any way to weight results if, for example, the actual proportion was A (88%) and B (12%). Thank you.
