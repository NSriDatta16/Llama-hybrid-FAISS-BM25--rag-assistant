I guess it is better to match against single value instead of two. For example it is hard to guess where is first name and where is last as user can type Magan Fox or Fox Megan. so query would look like this: SELECT id, firstname, lastname, CONCAT (firstname, ' ', lastname) AS fullname FROM `users` WHERE firstname LIKE '{$string}%' OR lastname LIKE '{$string}%' GROUP BY firstname, lastname ORDER BY firstname ASC, lastname ASC
