Are you using android:width="wrap_content" in your XML layout to define the width of that last column? Edit: I think I just understood, you have a list view, that holds a table and you want all rows of the list view to have the same length for the last row of the table. Right? I can only think of one, very unelegant solution right now and it involves going over all strings before building the list view. The general logic would be as follows: Im going to suppose you are getting al strings from an array, lets call it data. Establish a global float variable to represent the longest string you have, lets call it maxLength. Create a textview (lets call it invisibleText) in your layout that wont be visible, you can do this by setting android:visibility="gone" Then: int size = data.length; maxLength = 0.0f; for(int i = 0;i maxLength) maxLength = thisLength; } In you list view constructor: TextView text = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.the_text_view_you_want); text.setText(data[position]); text.setWidth(maxLength) The table columns should use android:width="wrap_content" I didnt test this code, but it should work, i've done similar stuff before.
