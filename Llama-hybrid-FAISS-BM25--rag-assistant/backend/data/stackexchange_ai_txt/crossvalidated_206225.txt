What are proper scoring and threshold selection rules for multiclassifiers?

I am using a neural network with 5 input neurons, 2 hidden layers of about 50 neurons in each layer, and 4 output neurons, trying to classify my 5-dimensional data into 4 different classes. Currently, I am choosing the network classification for a given example as the that corresponding to the neuron with the highest output and as expected, these results have been less than good. How would I score my multiclassifier and subsequently choose different thresholds to improve my results? So far, what I have tried is creating ROC curves by considering each class alone and the other 3 as a negative class, using a simple scoring method of fp/(1-fp) and choosing different thresholds for calculating the confusion matrix. How would I choose a score and thresholds that consider all classes rather than just 1 and the negative? Thanks, Annika
