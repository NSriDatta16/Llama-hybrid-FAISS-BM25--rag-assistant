Get and set specific height of elements

I'm a little bit new to JavaScript, but I hope someone can help me. How can I get the height of a paragraph element or div? By height I don't mean how high it is, but how many pixels it is sitting from the very top of the page. Is there any way to get this value? And to the 2nd part of my question: how can I set this specific value to another element? Thank you!
