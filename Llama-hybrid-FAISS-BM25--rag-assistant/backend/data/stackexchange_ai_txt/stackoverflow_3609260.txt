XSLT News : As of June the 8th, 2017, XSLT 3.0 is a Recommendation of the W3C Consortium Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is a programming language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents, text documents, or HTML documents. Other output formats are possible (e.g., PDF transformations using XSL-FO ). The original document is not changed; rather, a new document is created based on the content of an existing one. Typically, input documents are XML files, but anything from which the processor can build an XQuery and XPath Data Model can be used, for example, relational database tables, or geographical information systems. A typical transformation is accomplished as follows: A stylesheet is created (typically a .xsl file). An XML data source is created (such as a .xml file). The XSLT processor is loaded with both the XSL and XML content. The XML document is parsed into an XPath Data Model ( XDM ) tree (XDM is similar to DOM ). The XDM tree is traversed to produce a resulting document. XSLT syntax is based on XML, which means that XSL documents also are well-formed XML documents. XSLT, with a heavy emphasis on recursion, borrows principles from functional languages, including declarative programming, pattern matching, and immutable variables. As XSL is written in an XML format, its verbosity does not make it the first choice for general-purpose programming. When used correctly, XSL transformations produce elegant solutions to complex problems that are harder to solve in imperative languages. XSLT Processors and Libraries XSLT 3.0 processors XSLT 3.0 processors are backward compatible with XSLT 2.0 and usually XSLT 1.0 as well Saxon provides free and commercial XSLT 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 command line processors and libraries Raptor XML is Altova's XML and XBRL processor, which as of 2017 supports XSLT 1.0, 2.0 and XSLT 3.0 except streaming. A free command line version used to exist but is no longer available for download. XSLT 2.0 processors Backward compatibility with XSLT 1.0 is optional, but most processors support this Saxon and Raptor XML listed above support XSLT 2.0 as well QtXmlPatterns is a library to use XSLT 2.0 with Qt for C++, but is considered experimental by its creators xmlpatterns is a C++ commandline utility using Qt to run XSLT 2.0 or XQuery gexslt Gobo XSLT 2.0 an XSLT 2.0 processor written in Eiffel, seems to be discontinued, but supports almost all of XPath 2.0 and most of XSLT 2.0. Comes as commandline processor or Eiffel library. jd.xslt is a Java implementation of XSLT 1.1 (the spec was withdrawn in favor of 2.0 but already has a lot of 2.0 features) SOA Expressway XSLT is Intel's XSLT 2.0 processor as part of SOA Expressway, separate download no longer available, except via Wayback Machine PsychoPath supports XPath 2.0 to be used within Eclipse with XSLT XSLT 2.0 extension for Xerces , partially implemented but seems to be discontinued Gestalt , an XSLT 2.0 processor which formed the basis for gexslt IBM XML Feature Pack for WebSphere supports XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 MarkLogic is an XML database which includes its own XSLT 2.0 processor XMLPrime provides an XSLT 2.0 processor for the .NET platform XSLT 1.0 processors An incomplete list of known and lesser known XSLT 1.0 processors: XT , the very first XSLT 1.0 processor by James Clark, still available for download Xalan-Java is a free XSLT 1.0 processor for Java Xalan-C is a free XSLT 1.0 processor for C++ System.Xml.Xsl contains Microsoft's managed .NET XSLT 1.0 processor MSXML contains Microsoft's native ActiveX XSLT 1.0 processor, used in versions of Internet Explorer xsltc is a commandline processor to create compiled .NET assemblies for XSLT 1.0 transformations, not to be confused with Xalan's xsltc xsltproc or libxslt is a C library for XSLT 1.0 for the GNOME project, this version is used by PHP and other languages that compile to C TransforMiiX is Mozilla Firefox's XSLT 1.0 processor, of which a stand-alone version can be build. Sablotron an XSLT 1.0 processor written in C++ Minoru XSL or MDC-XSL an XSLT 1.0 processor written in C++, seems to be abandoned Xsltp.pl , an XSLT 1.0 compliant processor written natively in Perl XML::XSLT a Perl module with a partial complete XSLT 1.0 processor CFX XSLT open source XSLT 1.0 processor for ColdFusion XSLJIT by DataPower, a hardware accelerated XSLT processor, now used in WebSphere with XA35 JavaScript XSLT 2.0 processors These processors enable XSLT 2.0 in the browser. Frameless is a light-weight, partial XSLT 2.0 implementation of XSLT in JavaScript for use in the browser Saxon CE is Saxon's XSLT 2.0 processor cross-compiled to JavaScript for use in the browser XSLTy is a command line version of Saxon-CE and supports XSLT 2.0; it requires PhantomJS jQuery XPath 2.0 plugin , while not an XSLT processor, it enables the use of XPath 2.0 from within jQuery, and therefore from within the browser, which is of interest to a large group of users. JavaScript XSLT 3.0 processors These processors enable XSLT 3.0 in the browser. Saxon-JS effectively supersedes Saxon-CE. It is an XSLT 3.0 run-time written in pure JavaScript. It executes stylesheets that must be compiled by Saxon-EE directly, or from within an environment such as the oXygen XML editor that includes Saxon-EE. JavaScript wrappers for XSLT 1.0 in the browser JAXP is the Java API for XML, required when doing transformations in Java through the transformer factory 4XSLT , part of 4Suite is an open source command-line processor for XSLT 1.0, used on Unix systems, see manpage xslt.js is an open source XSLT 1.0 wrapper for transformations in the browser Sarissa is a reliable open source XSLT 1.0 and XML wrapper for transformations in a browser Tools and libraries Various libraries and tools include: EXSLT , semi-standardized set of XSLT 1.0 extension functions and instructions FXSL , an XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 and 3.0 compatible library of a large set of functions xslt-sb , a large set of XSLT 2.0 functions, extensive documentation in German DocBook XSL a large set of XSLT stylesheets to render DocBook XML for PDF, HTML or e-Book FunctX is a large set of XQuery and XSLT 2.0 functions XSLT Standard Library provides a large set of commonly used XSLT 1.0 functionality XTC Unit testing in XSLT and XQuery Kernow is a free user interface to run multiple stylesheets and sources with Saxon 9.x IronXSLT for supporting XSLT intellisense in older Visual Studio versions (it newer versions, XSLT 1.0 intellisense is incorporated) Register fix for Visual Studio 2008 XSLT intellisense Calabash is an implementation of XProc, a standardizes XML pipeline language, used for multiple steps processing of XML EXPath is a collaborative effort to define XPath (and therefore XSLT) extensions including a ZIP Facility , handling binary data , HTTP module etc. It evolved from EXSLT 2.0 . SOAP and HTTP extensions for Saxon [XmlSpectrum] 74 is a syntax-highlighter for XSLT/XPath 3.0 - coded in XSLT See further a list of tools using XPath or based on XSLT-related technologies History XSLT was proposed by the W3C and has three standards: 1.0 in 1999, 2.0 in 2007 and 3.0 which was published 2017. Question Tags Questions should use one of the xslt-1.0 , xslt-2.0 , or xslt-3.0 tags as appropriate to clarify what XSLT version the question requires or references. If you are unsure which version your processor supports, you can check it with XSLT using , for instance, by running the stylesheet (self-referencing XML and XSLT) https://martin-honnen.github.io/xslt/processorTest3.xml through your processor.
