Where are Magento static CMS blocks stored?

I cannot the location of static CMS blocks in the database. Where are they? The reason I need to know this is that when I move the database and my theme files from my local install to my online dev-install, the block does not update, and I need to re-create them for each installation. Follow-up question would be, how do I create them programmatically? EDIT: If anyone finds the question unclear I know how to make a static block in the Magento backend. The question is where are they stored in the Magento db/filesystem?
