Interpreting regression model significance in R

I am currently trying to create a regression model in R. I have a time series (ts_1). I converted this TS to a df and set the name of the column to 'Sales': ts_1_reg For a task I have to create seasonal dummies to build a model with. The data is monthly, and hence I have created 11 dummies: M1 I created a matrix with the sales data and the seasonal dummies: ts_1_reg When I create a linear regression model: fitreg And look at the summary of the model I see: As you can see none of the seasonal dummies are significant. And the adjusted r-squared is incredibly low. I would argue this model is pointless (although this is all new to me) My question is: is this model pointless and meaningless, or am I not recognising something significant?
