This isn't a direct answer, but since it seems like your motivation here is just to know which img elements don't have alt attributes, I wanted to add that not all img elements need alt attributes. The HTML5 spec mentions which img elements should have alt attributes: What an img element represents depends on the src attribute and the alt attribute. If the src attribute is set and the alt attribute is set to the empty string The image is either decorative or supplemental to the rest of the content, redundant with some other information in the document. If the image is available and the user agent is configured to display that image, then the element represents the image specified by the src attribute. Otherwise, the element represents nothing, and may be omitted completely from the rendering. User agents may provide the user with a notification that an image is present but has been omitted from the rendering. If the src attribute is set and the alt attribute is set to a value that isn't empty The image is a key part of the content; the alt attribute gives a textual equivalent or replacement for the image. If the image is available and the user agent is configured to display that image, then the element represents the image specified by the src attribute. Otherwise, the element represents the text given by the alt attribute. User agents may provide the user with a notification that an image is present but has been omitted from the rendering. If the src attribute is set and the alt attribute is not The image might be a key part of the content, and there is no textual equivalent of the image available. Note: In a conforming document, the absence of the alt attribute indicates that the image is a key part of the content but that a textual replacement for the image was not available when the image was generated. If the image is available, the element represents the image specified by the src attribute. If the src attribute is not set and either the alt attribute is set to the empty string or the alt attribute is not set at all The element represents nothing. Otherwise The element represents the text given by the alt attribute.
