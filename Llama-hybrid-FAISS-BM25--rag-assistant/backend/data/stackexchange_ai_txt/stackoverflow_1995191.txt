C# WPF: Using Generic Views: Not Possible?

I am new to WPF, have read some books about it, but now I am stuck. I have a generic class and a few concrete implementation of it public class Question { List AvailableAnswers; T Correct Answer; MidiSound SoundFragment; String Question; } public class IntervalQuestion : Question public class ScaleQuestion : Question I want my view to display the question, let the user choose between the answers etc. I only can't find a way to implement this with WPF, it looks like you can't create a view that is based on a generic object? Am I missing something here?
