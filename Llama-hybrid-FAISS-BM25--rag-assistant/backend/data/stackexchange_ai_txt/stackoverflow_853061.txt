A few things I'd do: Get them to run coverage and spot any missed areas of code and highlight how although they think they've got all the cases covered, they might not have. I've done this with a few people and they always seem quite surprised at areas they've missed when they thought they'd written watertight tests Start a "recipe" page on your local Wiki. Every time someone comes up with a testing scenario that they can't figure out, or need your help with, stick it on the Wiki and make it easy to find. Get other people to contribute as well It sounds like you're already doing this anyway, but ensure when anyone has a testing related question, make yourself available even if it's to the detriment of your normal workload. If you're passionate about it, it should inspire those who are interested to do the right thing too. When I'm introducing someone to testing (or a new testing technique), I'll often spend alot of my time randomly wandering over to their workstation just to see how they're getting on and nudge them in the right direction. This can be fitted in quite nicely when going for tea/smoke breaks or when you're doing a build. I've had quite good feedback about this but YMMV.
