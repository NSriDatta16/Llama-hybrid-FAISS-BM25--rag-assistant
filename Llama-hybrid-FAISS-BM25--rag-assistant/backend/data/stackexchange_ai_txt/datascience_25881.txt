Features selection/combination for random forest

I am working on using random forest to predict 1 or 0. I have about 20 variables available for modeling. I realized that if I put different variables will have different accuracy/sensitivity/specificity. I am wondering if there is a test or method can tell me which variables combination has the highest accuracy? Or which variable combination has the highest sensitivity and specificity respectively? Thanks in advance!
