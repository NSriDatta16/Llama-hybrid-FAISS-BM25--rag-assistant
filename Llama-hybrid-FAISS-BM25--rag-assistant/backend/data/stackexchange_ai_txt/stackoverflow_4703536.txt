match up two files in matlab

I have multiple files with varying file lengths. file 1 is a .txt file of length 86400 X 10 file 2 is a .csv file of length 144 X 10 Now this is the case when both the files have all data , but lot of times i have missing time stamps in middle so the length of the file1 is 1000-86400 X 10 and the file 2 is 10-144 X 10 Now I want to write a third file of length 144 X 20 to include all the columns of file 2 and file 1( I am averaging the 86400 down to 144). My problem is I am not able to match up the times properly to create the third file Any help? file2 datetime, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 ...... 9/15/2010 0:00, 8.8, 3.8, 2.8, 7.3, 0, 9.9 9/15/2010 0:10, 10.1, 8.4, 5.1, 7.7, 0, 8.1 9/15/2010 0:20, 8.8, 5.4, 7.6, 7.1, 0, 10.3 9/15/2010 0:30, 5.7, 8.8, 7.1, 1.6, 0, 6.8 9/15/2010 0:50, 7.9, 9.2, 6.4, 6.2, 0, 8.4 9/15/2010 1:20, 0.6, 5.85, 8.1, 9.8, 0, 0.6 file 1 datetime, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6...... 9/15/2010 0:00:01, 8.8, 3.8, 2.8, 7.3, 0, 9.9 9/15/2010 0:00:02, 10.1, 8.4, 5.1, 7.7, 0, 8.1 9/15/2010 0:00:03, 8.8, 5.4, 7.6, 7.1, 0, 10.3 9/15/2010 0:00:09, 5.7, 8.8, 7.1, 1.6, 0, 6.8 9/15/2010 0:00:10, 7.9, 9.2, 6.4, 6.2, 0, 8.4 9/15/2010 1:00:03, 0.6, 5.85, 8.1, 9.8, 0, 0.6 I use to read the files fid = fopen('file1.csv', 'rt'); a = textscan(fid, '%s %f %f %f %f %f %f', ... 'Delimiter',',', 'CollectOutput',1, 'HeaderLines',1); fclose(fid); M = [datenum(a{1}) a{2}] fid = fopen('file2.txt', 'rt'); b = textscan(fid, '%s %f %f %f %f %f %f', ... 'Delimiter',',', 'CollectOutput',1, 'HeaderLines',1); fclose(fid); N = [datenum(b{1}) b{2}] How do i write a 3rd file with all the columns of file 1 and file2 with the matching time stamps in the same format as file 2 ?? I am trying to write a 3rd file as datetime, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 ...... A1 A2 A3 A4 ....... 9/15/2010 0:00, 8.8, 3.8, 2.8, 7.3, 0, 9.9 x 9/15/2010 0:10, 10.1, 8.4, 5.1, 7.7, 0, 8.1 y 9/15/2010 0:20, 8.8, 5.4, 7.6, 7.1, 0, 10.3 z 9/15/2010 0:30, 5.7, 8.8, 7.1, 1.6, 0, 6.8 .. 9/15/2010 0:50, 7.9, 9.2, 6.4, 6.2, 0, 8.4 9/15/2010 1:20, 0.6, 5.85, 8.1, 9.8, 0, 0.6 ....
