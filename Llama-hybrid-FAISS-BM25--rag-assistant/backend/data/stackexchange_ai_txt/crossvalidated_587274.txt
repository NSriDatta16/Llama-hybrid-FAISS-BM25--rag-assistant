As a person working on this industry, I believe that logistics regression is the easiest to explain your score card. There are so many machine learning advanced techniques for classification problem, but let's think the main problem of ML is unexplainable. When you devise a scorecard system, the salesperson in the future will ask why you score a customer like that (the salesperson might believe that's a good customer based on what he knows, you have to explain to him that he has signs of bad customers such as bad credit history somewhere else and that's what Logistics Regression could serve you well whilst ML cannot). Binning => It should be a manual work because you have to understand why the data look like that. It could be done automatically but the data might offer no meaning because the sample is biased. We do use a lot of filtering criteria (WOE, IV, Marginal IV). I think they are easy to calculate and explain to non-risk persons as well, which explained its popularity. I just think bining is necessary and transforming predictors improve the performance as you already wrote.
