How do I return a record even if they have no records in a child table?

The following query returns a list of employees and their names, email address, and respective company names. The problem is with employees that do not have an email address in our system. If an employee doesn't have an email address, they are excluded entirely from the resultset. How do I return null (or empty string, etc) for an email address that doesn't exist, rather than excluding the employee? var employees = from e in Employees where e.ContactAttributes.Any (ca => ca.AttributeID == 19730317 ) from om in e.ChildOrganizationMaps from ea in e.EmailAddresses select new {e.FName, e.LName, ea.EmailAddress, om.Parent.CompanyName}; employees.Dump();
