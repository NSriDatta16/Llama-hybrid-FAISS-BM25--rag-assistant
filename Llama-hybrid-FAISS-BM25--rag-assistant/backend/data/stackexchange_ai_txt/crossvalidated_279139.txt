Machine learning for A/B testing

I want to construct an ML algorithm that replace the classic A/B testing, actually a predictive model that replace the A/B testing with very high accuracy, I have about 10.000 rows of emails subject lines with their open rate. My goal is to build an algorithm that takes 2 subject lines of emails as input and returns the best subject line. First of all, does this data contains the proper information for the project? I did a quick research on the internet and I found that t-test or Chi-Squared tests are used for A/B testing, but unlikely that can't work on my project. Then I found the Bayesian models but I could not understand them... I think that to use Bayesian models you have to perform a A/B test for example for the color of the button, collect the data and then use that model to find the proper answer. Any ideas or resources about that? Does anyone know how to approach this problem?
