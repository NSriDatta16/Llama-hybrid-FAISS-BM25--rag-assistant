Flash CS4: Font Disappearing

I have an odd issue while using FlashCS4. I have a textfield that, when set to STATIC TEXT works absolutely fine, in the correct font. If I set it to DYNAMIC TEXT, the text shows up as Arial or some other default on systems where the selected font isn't available. It shows up in the proper font on systems that have the font installed. If I set it to EMBED CHARACTERS the text doesn't show up at all on ANY system, whether the font is installed or not. I have tried embedding the font using the [EMBED] tag in my accompanying AS3 code, and I have the font added to the Library in CS4 as well. In CS4 I've tried selecting the font for the textfield as both the standard OS Font, as well as the one with the Asterisk next to it, but get the same results both ways. The library font is set to "export for actionscript" and "on frame 1". The font contains no bold/italic/etc. data, and I'm not using any special styling (other than centering the text). I don't think it's an issue with the font not being available, otherwise it wouldn't show up when it is set to Dynamic without any embedded characters. It's also strange that it wouldn't show up on the computer that has the font installed. Help?
