What's the connection between the heap used in dynamic memory allocation and the data structure?

Possible Duplicate: Why are two different concepts both called “heap”? I've googled around, but cannot find the answer for this question; what's the connection between the heap used in dynamic memory allocation and the data structure? Is memory organized on the heap in a way which is similar the the heap data structure? If so, this seems very strange, since fetching memory should be random access AFAIK (i.e, O(1)), but finding an item from a heap is not done in constant time. So, is this just an overloaded meaning of heap, so to speak, or is there some kind of connection?
