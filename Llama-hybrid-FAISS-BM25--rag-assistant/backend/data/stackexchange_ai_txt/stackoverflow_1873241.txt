Search and replace in VS2008 - linebreak

If I need to replace a text this text including the paragraph needs to be replaced How can I do this with VS2008 "search and replace"? EDIT One way is to use regex like suggested by Daniel. Its just pretty complicated. The real searchexpression at the end was: \ \n[^\ ]*\>\n[^\ ]*\> Thats to much for simple minded persons like us.
