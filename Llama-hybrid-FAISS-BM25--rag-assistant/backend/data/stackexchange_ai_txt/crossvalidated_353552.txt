Support Vector Machine - Calculate w by hand

I am working on a trivial example of SVM to gain some intuition behind the way it works. In the case of 6 data points, would it be possible to calculate the value of $w$ and $b$ by hand ? Intuitively I am able to get the correct values up to a scaling factor only. Using Sklearn with a linear kernel the correct values are $w = (\frac{1}{4}, - \frac{1}{4})^T$ $b = - \frac{3}{4}$ Intuitively I tried different values: $w = (1, - 1)^T$ and $b = - 3$ which comes from the straightforward equation of the line $x_2 = x_1 - 3$. This gives the correct decision boundary and geometric margin $2\sqrt{2}$ $w = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^T$ and $b = - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}$ which ensures that $||w|| = 1$ but doesn't get me much further Example Dataset and Sklearn result import numpy as np from sklearn.svm import SVC X = np.array([[3,4],[1,4],[2,3],[6,-1],[7,-1],[5,-3]] ) y = np.array([-1,-1, -1, 1, 1 , 1 ]) clf = SVC(C = 1e5, kernel = 'linear') clf.fit(X, y)
