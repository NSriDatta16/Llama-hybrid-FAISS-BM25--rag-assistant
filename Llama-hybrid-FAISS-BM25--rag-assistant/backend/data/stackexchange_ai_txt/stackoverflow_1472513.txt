Have you succeeded in this? I need to document data layer based on related views, but in addition to the problem related to relations there is another one: when model is refreshed the tables in the drawings update nicely but all chenged views disappear from the drawing. The model is updated, i.e. if I drag the views back on canvas the content is updated. But still I don't want to rebuild the whole picture every time a small update is done on the DB...
