Is it possible to compute income percentile, given the median and the average?

In Romania, the median net income in 2013 was 284 EUR/month , the average net income (unfortunately, in 2014, not in 2013 as the previous data point, but lets assume the same amount for 2013 for simplicity) was 423 EUR/month . Is it possible from these 2 data points to compute the percentile rank of a net income of, lets say, 2000 EUR/month? I've googled for an algorithm to compute this, but unfortunately I couldn't find any.
