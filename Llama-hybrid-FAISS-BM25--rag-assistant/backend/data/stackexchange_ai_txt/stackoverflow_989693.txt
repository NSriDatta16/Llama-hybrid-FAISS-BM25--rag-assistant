How do I change the background of a STATIC win32 control?

If the parent form of a (text) static control has a pattern on its background, then the area around the static control is an ugly blotch of solid color. How can I paint the background of the static control with the same pattern that its parent window uses? I've tried this, SetClassLong(retval , GCL_HBRBACKGROUND, (LONG)stripes); where retval was an HWND, pointing to the static control I just created, and stripes is an HBRUSH created from a bitmap. I tried with this, too: SetClassLongPtr(retval , GCLP_HBRBACKGROUND, (LONG)stripes); Neither of them worked. Does anyone know how to change the background of a static control in C? Update I handled the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message, which worked to an extent--it filled up the empty space in all the labels with the pattern I wanted. But the color right behind the text was just white... How can I make the pattern fill up that space as well? Nevermind, got it. SetBkMode(hdc, TRANSPARENT);
