Can CNNs detect features of different images?

In lecture, we talked about “parameter sharing” as a benefit of using convolutional networks. Which of the following statements about parameter sharing in ConvNets are true? (Check all that apply.) It allows parameters learned for one task to be shared even for a different task (transfer learning). It reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing overfitting. It allows gradient descent to set many of the parameters to zero, thus making the connections sparse. It allows a feature detector to be used in multiple locations throughout the whole input image/input volume. Here are the correct answers: It reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing overfitting. It allows a feature detector to be used in multiple locations throughout the whole input image/input volume. Why isn't the following answer also correct: It allows parameters learned for one task to be shared even for a different task (transfer learning). Doesn't ConvNets allow parameters to be shared, detecting the similar features of different images?
