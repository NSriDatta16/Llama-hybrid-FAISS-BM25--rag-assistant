Can 'Not putting my DB under the 'App_Data' affect the way Linq2Sql works?

I'm experiencing a problem while working with all my projects. I don't get Intellisense with Linq2Sql and, when I write partial classes in the model folder, properties created by the Linq2Sql designer are not recognized by the partial classes. So, I'm trying to rule out all the possible sources of the problem. I have 2 cases: (i) create a .mdf file under App_Data and (2) create a .dbo file in SQL EXPRESS 2005. Now, when I create the DataContext file (by dragging and dropping tables in the designer), are there going to work the same way? Or do I need to expect unanticipated behavior? Thanks
