I think 1st is the only possible solution. 2nd is very bad design. Assume you process each request for 1 second, and there are 2 requests coming in 1 second in average. You will quickly run out of resources (because more and more threads will be used) 1st one is good because you have all control on how you will store and process requests. Good design is to have web service as frontend that will just answer "Success" and enqueue requests. As a persistent storage i recommend MSMQ or database. Then create a service app that will have pool of threads and will pick from queue(db).
