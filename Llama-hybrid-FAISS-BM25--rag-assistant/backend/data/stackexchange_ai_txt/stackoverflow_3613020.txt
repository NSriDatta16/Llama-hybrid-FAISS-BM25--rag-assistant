Is the WebOS calendar api really as limited as it sounds?

A recent Ars Technica article rekindled my interest in WebOS so I was looking at the Services API (because I'm interested in building a replacement calendar app). I discovered the following text at the top of the calendar services API documentation : Note: To prevent unauthorized use of private user data, this API provides access only to records created by your application; that is, you cannot access records owned by another application. What is the point of even having an API if you can't access data created by other applications? At that point there would be no reason for me to use their API rather than building the data storage myself. Am I missing something? Can any WebOS developers weigh in on this? P.S. If they named their os "WebOS" you would think they'd know something about sane URLs. Check out that ridiculous calendar api doc url!!
