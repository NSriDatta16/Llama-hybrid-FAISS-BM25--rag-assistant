In addition, if I have three decimal values 120, 4420, and 230. How can I get a number less than 1 that represent the average of these 3 values? You cannot. The average of those 3 numbers will be (120 + 4420 + 230) / 3. That will never be less than one. Maybe you are confused about what average means?
