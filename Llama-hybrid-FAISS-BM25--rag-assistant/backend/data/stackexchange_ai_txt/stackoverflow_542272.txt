No, SQL Server Agent does not need to be running. SQL Server agent is only needed to execute scheduled tasks on the SQL server. This is probably a network issue. Can you ping the server? If so, try to ping it continuously with /t and see if all packets arrive. It could also be a problem with the SQL server load. Is the server idle or under load? Could you test the application locally on the SQL server or on the same LAN to see if the problem persists?
