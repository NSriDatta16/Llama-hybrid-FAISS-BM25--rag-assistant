This is more of a how-to-implement tip, but I started dabbling with creating an ActiveRecord/DataMapper implementation in PHP and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access. Eventually I found the SPL extensions to PHP, and particularly ArrayObject and ArrayIterator. These began to make my life a lot easier. Unfortunately I haven't had much time to devote to it, but anyone who tries something like this should check those out.
