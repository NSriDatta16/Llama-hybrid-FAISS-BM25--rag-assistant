I would say that change of sign for regression coefficient as alpha goes from K to zero is such indicator. EDIT: Huge standard errors and change of signs when omitting/adding variables is a symptom of problems caused by multicollinearity. It is almost impossible to estimate marginal effect from the variables having these problems when they are so strongly related. I would say this path plot can show which are those variables to which you have to put attention.
