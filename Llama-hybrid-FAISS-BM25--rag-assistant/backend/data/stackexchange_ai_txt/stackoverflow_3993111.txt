"Or" Together Expression > in .NET 4, Silverlight RIA domain service

I have a small custom object defined as: public class TimeSeriesDefinition { public int classID; public DateTime startTime; public DateTime endTime; } I'm passing a List classIDs, a List startTimes, and a List endTimes into an RIA Domain Service function. As a matter of organization, I was grouping these values into a List of TimeSeriesDefinitions and then trying to use a foreach loop to create an expression that would select with AND operators between the values in a class and OR operators between each class or implement a ".Any" query as suggested by the first answer I received below. The problem is that I can't use the TimeSeriesDefinition class in a DomainService function because it is not a primitive type or one of my entity types (maybe I should just make an entity with this type?), so I need another method of achieving the desired query results. My original idea for using expressions that I never got anywhere with is here: Expression > bounds; Boolean assignedBounds = false; foreach (TimeSeriesDefinition ts in reporters) { if (assignedBounds.Equals(false)) { bounds = c => c.reporterID == ts.classID && c.reportDateTime >= ts.startTime && c.reportDateTime > newBounds = c => c.reporterID == ts.classID && c.reportDateTime >= ts.startTime && c.reportDateTime >.Or(bounds, newBounds); } } return this.ObjectContext.EventLog.Where(bounds); My goal is for the resultset to have all records of a ts.classID between ts.startDate and ts.EndDate. From what I've found online, it seems that making sure the parameters are correctly assigned is tricky as well, but right now I'm still getting a "Cannot implicitly convert type 'System.Linq.Expressions.BinaryExpression' to 'System.Linq.Expressions.Expression>'" error at the line bounds = Expression.Or(Expression.Invoke(bounds), Expression.Invoke(newBounds); Can anybody point me in the right direction? I suppose I could possibly build this whole thing into a query string somehow, but I'd rather not go there. Thanks in advance for your insight!
