As far as I know (and I've done a lot of homework on it, I am lead engineer for a well known Mac/Win Media Player) Apple is being greedy and not sharing. There is plenty of evidence that newer macbook and mac pro HDMI and Display port connections support the full encryption protocol, and that iTunes is able to query and control it. Apple appears to be purposely withholding the API, with the intention of preventing any possibility of Blu-ray support on Mac, in order to create leverage for getting the studios to allow HD content for iTunes.
