What approach is to be taken to convert a code snippet to simple English?

Suppose a is a variable and I have a DSL (Domain Specific language) or a code snippet that says a.size() > 0 My task is to convert it to simple English and print Number of a's is greater than zero More examples: Input : a != null , Output a is not null Input : a != "" , Output a is not empty Input : a.parent.children.size()>3 , Output : Parent of 'a' has more than 3 children Input : a.children().forAll(e|e.value , Output : All the children of 'a' have a value less than 4 I want to know what the right approach to this kind of problem would be. I basically want to translate the code snippet to simple English, similar to how humans can have a fair/high level understanding of what the code snippet is trying to do by just reading it. I've considered the below approaches: One approach that I've considered to to write something like a compiler or a parser. Another approach that I'm considering is to use machine translation, similar to how RNNs are used to translate one language to another. How would one approach this problem? I asked the same question on SO here but I didn't get any response yet, so decided to ask here
