That's a custom generated plot which explores the splits generated for a single node in a given tree, which is typically not what plotting methods do for decision trees. The authors do not provide any such functionality in the code for their paper either. That being said, if you use the implementation in scikit-learn, it uses the same tree format as for their other methods, so if you find some external library generating similar plots for e.g. random forests, you can use it for isolation forest too.
