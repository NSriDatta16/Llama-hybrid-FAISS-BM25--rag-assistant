Trading signals example from Marginal Revolution blog

From http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/09/someone-give-doug-blog.html : Many trading signals reliably predict prices, but not strongly enough to overcome transaction costs (i.e. exchange fees, clearing fees, liquidity costs, etc.). A stock can moves up or down .01 in the next period, your trading signals predicts the right direction 60% of the time, and transaction costs average .0025. Unfortunately after costs, you'll end up losing $.0005 per trade, so it's not a viable strategy. But let's say you’ve got three uncorrelated trading signals just like it. If you wait until all three point in the same direction, now there’s a 94% of the stock moving in your favor. You easily clear the transaction cost threshold and neatly make .0063 per trade. When you gather together multiple uncorrelated signals, the whole becomes worth much more than the sum of the parts. Is the math for the three-signal example correct? Isn’t $$\Pr\left[ X = 1 | S_1=1, S_2=1, S_3=1 \right] = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.6^3}{0.5\cdot0.6^3 + 0.5\cdot0.4^3} \approx 0.771$$ and not 0.94? Let $X = 1$ if the stock moves up, $-1$ if it moves down, and assume these each occur with 0.50 probability. Conditional on $X$, each signal has 0.6 probability of agreeing with $X$, and 0.4 probability of disagreeing. We’re assuming the three signals are conditionally independent given $X$. Is my math wrong? Am I misunderstanding the setup? Or is there a mistake in the blog post I cited? It's not clear to me exactly what the post means by "uncorrelated signals." I assume they mean uncorrelated conditional on $X$. Toy R simulation: get_df I think a "94% [probability] of the stock moving in your favor" would require seven signals with each $S_i = 1$, not three.
