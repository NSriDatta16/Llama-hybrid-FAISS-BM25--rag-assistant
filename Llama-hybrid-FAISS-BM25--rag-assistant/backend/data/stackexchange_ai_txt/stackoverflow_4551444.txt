how can I modify browser word wrap behavior?

I notice that when the browser (firefox, safari) wraps text, the space where it breaks to wrap (the last space of a line) gets turned into a zero-width space, i.e, when you create a mouse selection across multiple lines in a paragraph, the space where it breaks does not visibly show. Is it possible to change this behavior so that the breaking space retains its width? Thanks!
