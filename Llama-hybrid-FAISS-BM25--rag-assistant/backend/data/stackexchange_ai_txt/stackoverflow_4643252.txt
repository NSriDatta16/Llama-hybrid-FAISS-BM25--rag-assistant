You don't explain what your integer represents so it is difficult to give an answer. It's best to use a proper data type for times. I'd use DATETIME - it will allow to you to perform calculations, sort, and format as required. Storing time as text is going to cause headaches later on. Store a time by adding the time to the SQL epoch (1900-01-01 00:00:00), like so SELECT DATEADD(SECOND, 50000, CONVERT(DATETIME, 0.0)) SELECT DATEADD(MINUTE, 50000, CONVERT(DATETIME, 0.0)) Then format the DATETIME object accordingly. To get HH:mm:ss, use format 108. To get the AM/PM flag, use 100 and take the two rightmost characters. Try the below: DECLARE @date DATETIME SET @date = DATEADD(SECOND, 50000, CONVERT(DATETIME, 0.0)) SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEPART(HOUR, @date)%12) + ':' + RIGHT(CONVERT(VARCHAR, @date, 108),5) + RIGHT(CONVERT(VARCHAR, @date, 100), 2) I should also point out that you are working in a database, not a presentation layer. There should be no need to worry about formatting dates and times in a database; it is about data storage and retrieval. Presumably you are returning this time to an application or webpage to be put onto a screen, into a report or whatever - best practice is to keep the data as a complete DATETIME and let the top layer format it. By converting to a VARCHAR you are just removing information and limiting yourself; no benefit, lots of cost.
