Here is some 'low-hanging fruit' where auto-correlation plots and perhaps a runs test reveal marked lack of IID behavior of a sequence. (See @kjetilbhalvorsen's Comment.) Data from the late 1970s show that eruptions of Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park were of short (0) or long (1) duration (less or more than 3 min in length) approximately according to a 2-state Markov chain--with no occurrences of two short eruptions in a row. Over the long run, the proportion of long eruptions is about 69%. The R code below simulates 2000 eruptions x according to this Markov chain. set.seed(2020) m = 2000; n = 1:m; x = numeric(n); x[1]=0 a = 1; b = 0.44 for (i in 2:m) { if (x[i-1]==0) x[i] = rbinom(1,1,a) else x[i] = rbinom(1,1,1-b) } mean(x==1) [1] 0.7005 By contrast, the sequence y has 2000 independent Bernoulli observations with success probability $p=0.7.$ set.seed(809) y = rbinom(2000, 1, .7) ACF plots show significant autocorrelations with lags 2, 3 and 4 (outside the dotted bounds) for the Old Faithful chain (left). The Markov dependence "decays" after a few steps. By contrast, there are no significant autocorrelations for the IID Bernoulli observations. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) acf(x, main="Old Faithful") acf(y, main="Bernoulli") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Here is a link to a recent discussion of runs tests on this site. Note: The ACF plot for lengths of Old Faithful eruptions is similar to one in Suess (2010) p146, Springer.
