This is mostly just to support and explicate the points @Glen_b has made. The fact that variables are highly correlated does not necessarily mean they are redundant and that you want to throw one of them out. Consider the data below: For these data, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are correlated $r = .99337$. If you were to fit a logistic regression model regressing $y$ on $x_1$ only, the area under the curve would be exactly $.5$. If you regressed $y$ on $x_2$ only, $AUC = .5644$. But if you regressed $y$ on both, then $AUC = 1.0$.
