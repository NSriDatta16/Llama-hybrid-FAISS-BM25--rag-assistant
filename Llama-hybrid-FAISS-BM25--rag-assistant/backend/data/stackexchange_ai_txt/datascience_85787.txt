Community analysis implies graph analysis. here is a short list of things you can work on: People often reshares tweets among a certain social group. Minimum-cut method, Girvanâ€“Newman and Modularity maximization are someof the starting algorithms to extract these type of substructures. You can try and find different hierarchies among the groups sharing a particular topics You can try and analyse the lifetime of tweets for particular topics (survival analysis) Analysing tweets is closer to graph analytics rather than NLP. Here is a great overview on community analysis . For coding and algorithms, please check graphX Spark library . If your data is not too large, networkX is easier . For survival analysis, lifeline is one of the easier options.
