You have multiple options to model the data using regressions. Basically you should do two things: aggregate the data and then use the most appropriate regression model. It is up to you to think about how to summarize the data and fit the models. But here are some some ideas. This is a summary of the winning proportions by home team games2 group_by(TEAM_ID_home) |> summarise(win_prop = mean(HOME_TEAM_WINS), observations = n()) Since the response variable is binary, perhaps you could explore a logistic regression model using the original data frame. This model explores if the proportion of winning at home is more frequently associated with any team (fm1) or season (fm2): summary(fm1 You can count grouping by season and team and then create a new data-frame with all the predictors you are interested summarized by the grouped variables. games3 group_by(SEASON, TEAM_ID_home) |> summarise(win_count = sum(HOME_TEAM_WINS), observations = n(), pts_home = sum(PTS_home, na.rm = T)) A Poisson regression may be useful to fit this kind of data. Including an "offset" for the number of observations is necessary to model the outcome as he proportion of winning. summary(fm3
