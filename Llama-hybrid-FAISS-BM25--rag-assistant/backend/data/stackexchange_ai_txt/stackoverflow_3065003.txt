Use SmallDateType in Model-First Entity Framework

I can't help but feel I am missing something but to this day I cannot find the answer. I am doing a model-first entity framework and have a few properties set as DateTime. These translate to DateTime in the database - but I would like to use SmallDateTime. In my case, getting down to seconds and milliseconds just isn't worth the double storage for as many rows as I will have. Does anyone know a way in the model-first environment to map DateTime to a SmallDateTime DB field? As a last hope, I can generate the DDL, replace all, and update the Model from the database after - but I feel that is obnoxious! Thanks in advance.
