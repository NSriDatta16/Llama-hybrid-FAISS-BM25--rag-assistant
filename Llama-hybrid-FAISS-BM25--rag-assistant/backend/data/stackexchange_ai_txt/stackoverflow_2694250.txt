If I understand you correctly, you don't really need to make an AJAX call to get at the viewdata needed for the new ddls. You already have the information, so it is just a matter of organizing it. You could perhaps just make a copy of one of the existing ddls (cf. jQuery's clone() method) You could create a hidden ddl that you use as a template and use jQuery's clone() method. You could store the required information in some other way - you will have to evaluate what will be appropriate yourself, or check back here with more info You could fetch the required data using an AJAX request. In that case you probably want to create an action returning a JsonResult containing the required data. If you choose this approach, beware of this subtle JSON security issue .
