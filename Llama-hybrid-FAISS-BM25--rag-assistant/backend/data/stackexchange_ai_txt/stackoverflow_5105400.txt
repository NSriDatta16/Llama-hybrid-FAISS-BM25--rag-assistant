run compass watch terminal command upon opening the folder with textmate

I use textmate for website development and compass to compile css stylesheets. Right now everytime I open up the folder with textmate I have to additionally run a compass watch /path/to/folder command. I know textmate is pretty powerfull, but not sure how to make it work so the compass watch command is automatically applied to projects you open with textmate (I usually drag the projectfolder on the dock-icon). Is this possible?
