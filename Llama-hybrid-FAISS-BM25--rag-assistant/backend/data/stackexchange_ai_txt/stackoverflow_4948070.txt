Magento - Change customer tax class id dynamically to affect existing order

Is it possible to dynamically update the customer_tax_class_id attribute of an oder being processed - for guest customers. I have tried setting it via the checkout/session model but it will not update. The goal is to reset the tax amount based upon a condition to 0. Using the tax_class_id which will have a rule of 0 tax.
