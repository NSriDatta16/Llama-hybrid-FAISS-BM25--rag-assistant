Possibly this is due to the transmission of the page being chunked: Paragraphs 3.5, 3.6 and 3.6.1 talk about how HTTP pages that use transfer-encoding like gzip must be chunked, unless they close the connection after the entire page has been sent. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.5 I believe each chunk is independantly compressed, and one of those chunks might have gotten corrupt.
