How to use weight variables within aggregated results, for group proportions

If I have the following data, where each row represents and individual response, how would I go about reporting the proportions of different groups? (here the groups are paper , door , and not sure ) Columns: question_response - the response to the survey question "do you prefer doors or paper " weighting_variable - a weighting adjustment, an adjustment weight to each survey respondent Rows : individual responses question_response weighting_variable 0 door 0.51 1 door 0.49 2 door 1.05 3 door 1.36 4 door 2.24 5 door 0.34 6 door 0.75 7 door 1.95 8 door 3.26 9 door 0.52 10 door 1.99 11 not sure 0.38 12 paper 0.94 13 paper 0.41 14 paper 1.29 15 paper 0.18 16 paper 1.03 17 paper 0.58 18 paper 0.07 19 paper 0.65 Just looking at the group counts, before considering the weights there are: 40% prefer paper 5% are not sure 55% prefer doors My question is how to consider the weights, my intuition is that they should be considered as follows. First for door , the average weight is 0.51 + 0.49 + 1.05 + 1.36 + 2.24 + 0.34 + 0.75 + 1.95 + 3.26 + 0.52 + 1.99 = 14.46 14.46 / 11 = 1.314545 Then paper is 0.643750 , and not sure is just 0.380000 Based on this I would instead say that 40% * 0.643750 = 25.7% prefer paper 5% * 0.38 = 1.9% are not sure 55% * 1.31 = 72.3% prefer doors This makes sense as the percentages are still summing to 100 (within some rounding), but I wanted to double check that this was correct .
