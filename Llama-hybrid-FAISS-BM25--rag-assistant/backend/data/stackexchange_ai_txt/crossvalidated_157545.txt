Complement learning

First off, complement learning is a term I made up, not sure if it really exists. Given that the ground truth consists of 2 classes: class 1, class 2, and also two observed sets: oset 1, oset 2, such that: oset 1 naturally contains samples from class 1 AND class 2, with (in my case) unknown priors oset 2 contains samples of class 1 Summarized, I do not have class labels, but only observation labels, can I use this to train a model to classify between both classes (to find the ground truth separation between class 1 and class 2)? I called this complement learning, because you try to find the complement between oset 2, given that oset 1 is the universe. Note: this differs from outlier-detection and anomaly detection, since you have 'so to speak', an idea of what the non-outlier and non-anomalous data is (in the form of oset 2). Moreover, the samples of class 2 may not show typical outlier behavior. Is there a better approach than clustering both osets and determining the clusters of oset 1 with little/no overlap with the clusters of oset 2. Is there a machine learning variant which tackles this type of problem?
