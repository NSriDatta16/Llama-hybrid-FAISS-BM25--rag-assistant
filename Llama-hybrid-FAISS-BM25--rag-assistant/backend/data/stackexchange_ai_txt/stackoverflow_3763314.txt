I ran to the same issue as you and as many others like you, before realising it needs the global statement. I then decided to move everything to object orientation and have piece of mind. Call me insane but I just dont trust myself with the global statement and its not difficult to come against a problem of local scope that is a pain to debug. So I would advice collect all your "global" variables put them in a class inside an init (self) and not only you wont have to worry about local scope but you will have your code much better organised. Its not a freak of luck that most programmer out there prefer OOP.
