finding the most correlated features in a multivariate time series

Assume I have a multivariate time series with 4 features where feature 1 is the most important one for me but at the same time I am suspecting maybe there is at least one more feature (another column of data, which is a time series itself) that is correlated to feature one. Is there anyway to identify this column or this feature? What I am thinking is to find the correlation coefficient between column 1 and column 2 ... column 4 to see which results in a higher correlation and then choose that feature along with feature 1. The main goal is to perform the clustering of time series but I am not sure how many features I should keep. Can anyone help how to find the most relevant feature in clustering given the main feature is feature 1 but I am not sure how many others to pick,
