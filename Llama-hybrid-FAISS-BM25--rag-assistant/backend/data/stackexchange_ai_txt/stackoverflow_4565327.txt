Good way to "wrap" jars for OSGi with Maven

I was looking at the PAX tools on OPS4J for example: this one and I thought I'd found a nice way to: Specify an artifact Create an assembled jar (jar that contains all dependencies) from that jar and its transitive dependencies Wrap it with BND to create an OSGi bundle It turns out, that I was wrong - it doesn't appear that the PAX stuff does this. (RTFM, right? :) ) But this got me wondering: is there something out there that does what I'm asking? I've thought maybe I could do this by creating a simple POM and using the maven-bundle-plugin but this seems like it might be a bit cumbersome for what I'm asking. NOTE: I get that embedding and assembling jar's is not really "the OSGi way" - so I wouldn't do this unless I really felt it useful. For example - Spring. Thanks in advance.
