In small samples under the null hypothesis, we get curves that cross often; this is just an artifact of randomness, and a null result is expected. In large samples, however, this can be challenging because a nuance is added to the initial hypothesis, and it is dangerous to change your hypothesis based on observed data. In textbooks, they will tell you non-proportional hazards reduce your power. That may be true if the hypothesis is whether the survival curves differ (at all). But that's a misinterpretation of the log rank test: the test is actually whether the hazard ratio is different from 1, just like in a Cox model. In fact, I think it's rather unimportant to know whether the survival curves differ on the whole, they almost always do. A time-by-covariate interaction in a Cox model is a special case of an accelerated failure time model. If the crossing curves are because the hazard ratio varies by time and by covariate, this can solve the muddle, but you have to be either very lucky, or actually understand the science of what's happening. The competing risks package has some implementation for these models. And of course, interpreting an interaction is very difficult in any linear model, let along a Cox model. There are 3 solutions I can think of: Use a robust error estimate. A surprising finding is that when the hazard ratio is non-proportional, the Cox model estimates a failure-time weighted average hazard ratio over the duration of follow-up. Use a $g\rho \gamma$ family of estimators: these can weight earlier or later survival if those are of greater interest and it's simply the tails of the analysis where high variability is causing curves to cross. For instance, if a cancer kills all patients within 5 years, but the median survival is 2 on drug A and 1 on drug B, we might value those first two years of survival greatly Use a restricted mean estimate of survival. This is the only estimator that estimates average survival time from censored data. It is just the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve. The "restriction" is just the duration of follow-up that should be curtailed to an appropriate time frame as with approach 2, so the area under the first two years, or four years, will give you an appropriate estimand and test that does not rely on a proportional hazard assumption.
