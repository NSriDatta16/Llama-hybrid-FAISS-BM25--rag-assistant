You can view vectorization parameters in exactly the same way as 'normal' hyperparameters. These are parameters you have to fix beforehand and find good ones by evaluating them on validation sets. The length of your text embedding for example regularizes the expressability of your model. Larger embeddings will give a model more freedom to fit the data compared to smaller embeddings. Similar to regularization (ridge or lasso) in linear regression.
