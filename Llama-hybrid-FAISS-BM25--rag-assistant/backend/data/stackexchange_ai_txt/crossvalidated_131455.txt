Is Markov chain based sampling the "best" for Monte Carlo sampling? Are there alternative schemes available?

Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a method based on Markov chains that allows us to obtain samples (in a Monte Carlo setting) from non-standard distributions from which we cannot draw samples directly. My question is why Markov chain is "state-of-the-art" for Monte Carlo sampling. An alternative question might be, are there any other ways like Markov chains that can be used for Monte Carlo sampling? I know (al least from looking at the literature) that the MCMC has deep theoretical roots (in terms of conditions like (a)periodicity, homogeneity, and detailed balance) but wondering if there are any "comparable" probabilistic models/methods for Monte Carlo sampling similar to Markov chains. Please guide me if I have confused some part of the question (or if it seems confusing altogether).
