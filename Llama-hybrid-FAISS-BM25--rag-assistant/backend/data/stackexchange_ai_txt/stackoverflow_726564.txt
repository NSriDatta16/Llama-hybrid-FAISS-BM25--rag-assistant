It depends on what you want, and it can help to see what the results are of different methods. If you want Red + Black = Red Red + Green = Yellow Red + Green + Blue = White Red + White = White Black + White = White then adding with a clamp works (e.g. min(r1 + r2, 255) ) This is more like the light model you've referred to. If you want Red + Black = Dark Red Red + Green = Dark Yellow Red + Green + Blue = Dark Gray Red + White = Pink Black + White = Gray then you'll need to average the values (e.g. (r1 + r2) / 2 ) This works better for lightening/darkening colors and creating gradients.
