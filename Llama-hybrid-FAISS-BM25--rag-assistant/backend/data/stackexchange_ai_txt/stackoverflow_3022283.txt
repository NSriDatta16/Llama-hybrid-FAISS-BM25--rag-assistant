When reloading the visitors you are replacing all the draggable elements when you do $('#visitors').html(data); - so those there were draggable before are deleted and replaced with new elements that are not draggable. (I'm pretty sure you realise this, because of mentioning .live() , so this is really just here for completeness) However, you know exactly when the visitor elements are changed, so instead of an alternative to .live() why not just make another request for the draggable effect immediately after the change. Might be safer to "destroy" the old draggables before you replace them, but I'm not sure if that's strictly necessary. $.post('planning/' + $('ul.periods li.active').attr('id'), {visitors:true}, function(data){ $(".draggable").draggable("destroy"); $('#visitors').html(data); $(".draggable").draggable({ revert:true }); });
