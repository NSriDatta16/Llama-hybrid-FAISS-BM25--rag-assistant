Best GLM model approximating a XGboost model

Let's say I have a XGboost model ( using python ) with y a numeric variable explained by x1 ... xn categorical variables. I would like to find a GLM model close to that model i.e. having an evaluation score on test set close to the original model score ( on test set ). model = smf.glm( formula = "y ~ C( x1 ) + ... + C( xn )" , family = sm.families.Gamma( link = sm.genmod.families.links.log() ) , data = df_train ) How could I proceed to get that GLM model ?
