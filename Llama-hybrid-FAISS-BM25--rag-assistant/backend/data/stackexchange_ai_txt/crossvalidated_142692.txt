How can we estimate the predictive interval in Lasso regression

Dear Community members, I am using lasso to solve an inverse problem (a Fredholm) which I can reframe as \begin{equation}\min_{\mathbf x ~~{\rm with}~~x_n\geq 0} \ell_{\rm Lasso}(\mathbf x, \lambda)\end{equation} where \begin{equation}\ell_{\rm Lasso}(\mathbf x, \lambda)= ||\mathbf A \mathbf x-\mathbf b||^2+\lambda ||\mathbf x||_1\end{equation} with $\mathbf A$ an ill-conditioned matrix. I understand that the Lasso may be understood as the maximum a posteriori estimate of the following pdf and that it can be derived from Bayesian arguments, meaning that \begin{equation} p(\mathbf x|\mathbf b, \lambda)\propto \exp\left(-\frac 1 2\ell_{\rm Lasso}(\mathbf x, \lambda)\right) \end{equation} While I can sample from the ridge posterior or an elastic net without problem (I can do exact HMC following the work of A Pakman, L Paninski - arXiv preprint arXiv:1208.4118, 2012 since it is basically a truncated Gaussian), the sample from the Lasso posterior is a bit problematic since $\mathbf A$ is near singular. I would be grateful if anyone could let me know if and how I'd be able to sample the Gaussian.
