I am the author of the of the threedubmedia plugins. I added this functionality for supporting multiple elements, because I could not find a satisfactory solution anywhere else. If you need a solution that works with the jQuery UI, here is a plugin which adds some multi-drag functionality, though the demos don't seem to work correctly in Firefox for Mac. http://www.myphpetc.com/2009/11/jquery-ui-multiple-draggable-plugin.html
