Is there any tab manager for visual studio?

It's common for me to have 20+ files opened in Visual Studio (I use VS 2008 now, but we will migrate to VS 2010, soon.) . Is there any add-in which could help organize actively opened files? I mean something like Firefox colorful tabs or a tab-manager which will group windows tabs by projects or folders,...
