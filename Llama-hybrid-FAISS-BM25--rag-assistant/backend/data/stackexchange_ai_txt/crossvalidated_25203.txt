How to decompose a time series with multiple seasonal components?

I have a time series that contains double seasonal components and I would like to decompose the series into the following time series components (trend, seasonal component 1, seasonal component 2 and irregular component). As far as I know, the STL procedure for decomposing a series in R only allows one seasonal component, so I have tried decomposing the series twice. First, by setting the frequency to be the first seasonal component using the following code: ser = ts(data, freq=48) dec_1 = stl(ser, s.window="per") Then, I decomposed the irregular component of the decomposed series ( dec_1 ) by setting the frequency to be the second seasonal component, such that: ser2 = ts(dec_1$time.series[,3], freq=336) dec_2 = stl(ser2, s.window="per") I'm not very confident with this approach. And I would like to know if there are any other ways to decompose a series that has multiple seasonalities. Also,I have noticed that the tbats() function in the R forecast package allows one to fit a model to a series with multiple seasonalities however, it doesn't say how to decompose a series with it.
