Aggregation of time series model

Consider the ARIMA(1,1,1) model $$(1-0.5B)(1-B)y_t=(1+0.8B)a_t$$ where $a_t\sim WN(0,\sigma_a^2)$ and a second independent process given by $$z_t=(1+0.5B)b_t$$ where $b_t\sim WN(0,\sigma_b^2)$ with $\sigma_a^2=\sigma_b^2=\sigma^2$.Give the model for the aggregated model $$w_t=y_t+z_t$$ and discuss situations in which this type of aggregation occurs. Let $$\Phi_Y(B)=(1-0.5B)(1-B)=1-1.5B+0.5B^2$$ $$\Phi_Z(B)=1$$ $$\Theta_Y(B)=1+0.8B$$ $$\Theta_Z(B)=1+0.5B$$ So $$\Phi_Y(B)\Phi_Z(B)w_t=\Phi_Y(B)\Phi_Z(B)y_t+\Phi_Y(B)\Phi_Z(B)z_t$$ $$\Phi_Y(B)\Phi_Y(B)w_t=\Phi_Z(B)(1+0.8B)a_t+\Phi_Y(B)(1+0.5B)b_t$$ Then in the left side I have $$(1-1.5B+0.5B^2)w_t$$ that is an AR(2) and in the right side I have $$Q_t=a_t+0.8a_{t-1}+b_t-2b_{t-1}+1.25b_{t-2}-0.25b_{t-3}$$ In this case, since $Q_t$ is a sum of independent gaussian white noises $Q_t$ is also white noise right? Then $$(1-1.5B+0.5B^2)w_t=Q_t$$ is an AR(2) process?
