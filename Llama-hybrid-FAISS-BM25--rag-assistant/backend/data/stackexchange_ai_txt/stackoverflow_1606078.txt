I've noticed that with my Linux hosting server, I have to replace all occurrences of CRLF with LF in both the extra headers and the mixed/alternative headers. About that the PHP documentation says: "If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it does not comply with Â» RFC 2822." I've tried to send a mail (only with "\n") to my personal account and I've looked for "\r" and "\n" in the raw message ... each line is ended by a CR and started with a "\n"! QUESTION: As the PHP mail() documentation says, I use the function wordwrap() to cut the line length to 70 characters. There is a workaround to let the mail client to display the message with its original formatting and not as a column where each line isn't longer than 70 chars? ANSWER [SOLUTION]: I have solved setting up quoted-printable as Content-Transfer-Encoding: $body .= "Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n"; $body .= "Content-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset=utf-8;\n\tformat=flowed;\n\tdelsp=yes\n"; $body .= "\n" . quoted_printable_encode($message); The quoted_printable_encode() function is available only with PHP 5.3, the implementation is suitable in the documentation page .
