Can the output layer size be bigger than input layer size in a neural network?

Does the number of outputs of a neural network have to be smaller than the number of inputs? This seems to be the case in most of the applications that I have seen . At the same time, I am not sure how this might be the case in language translation models. It is not guaranteed that the output (the translation of a text) would be the same or smaller length as the input text. It can be longer or shorter.
