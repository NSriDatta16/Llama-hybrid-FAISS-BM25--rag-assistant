Test if two coefficients are statistically different in logistic regression?

I am doing the logistic regression with logit link in MATLAB [b, ~, stats] = glmfit(X, [Y N], 'binomial', 'link', 'logit'); I can find the $p$-values for each coefficient in stats , but this tests if a coefficient is equal to 0. How do I test, say, if the first coefficient is statistically different from the second? Note that I am asking this from a stats perspective, so the answers are not necessarily MATLAB-specific.
