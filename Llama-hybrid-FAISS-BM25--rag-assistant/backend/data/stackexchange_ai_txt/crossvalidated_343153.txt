Multilevel models work well with observational survey data as you've described. Wrt small sample sizes and depending on the functional form of the hierarchical model more (or less) information is required for each cross section. E.g., frequentists such as Singer and Willett in their book Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis argue that at least 3 data points are required to estimate any effect or trend, the classic position. On the other hand Gelman and Hill in chap 13 of their book Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models contend that by using a Bayesian approach effects for cross sections even with an n of 1 are still estimable -- in the posterior. Linking party at the district/regional level is a structual data issue that requires party information within that greater level of granularity. It sounds like your data would have that structure. Given that, ANOVA-type interactions of these categorical fields would be the way to go, subject to the limitations of your approach (frequentist vs Bayesian) and the progressively smaller sample sizes as more and more cross-classifications are tested. You don't indicate how many parties are present but, for the sake of argument, let's assume a three party system for your country. With an N of 500, 200 constituencies, 16 regions and 3 parties, you will have to be very careful which interactions are tested as even the simplest interaction of 16 regions by 3 parties results in 48 possible cells to populate with an expected 10 respondents per cell (500/(16*3)). Of course your data will not be so smooth and evenly distributed so there will be many cells with zero respondents and a few cells with a large number of respondents.
