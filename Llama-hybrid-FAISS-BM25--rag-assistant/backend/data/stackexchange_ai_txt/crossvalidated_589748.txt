Plotting ideas for large number of unique catagories

I have 209 unique categories within a column, is there a nice way to plot it ? I am grouping the 209 unique categories with their respective cost column. How should I represent it visually ? Below is a small example of the output for the average of the cost grouped by the category(I am only showing one, there are 209 such rows): 1000-1299 lbs Wheel Skid Steer Loader,4747.0
