What is F1 Optimal Threshold? How to calculate it?

I've used h2o.glm() function in R which gives a contingency table in the result along with other statistics. The contingency table is headed " Cross Tab based on F1 Optimal Threshold " Wikipedia defines F1 Score or F Score as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. But aren't Precision and Recall found only when the result of predicted values of a logistic regression(for example) is transformed to binary using a cutoff. Now by cutoff I remember, what is the connection between F1 Score and Optimal Threshold. How is optimal threshold calculated? How is F1 optimal threshold calculated? Sorry if I've missed something, I'm new to stats here.
