Create an XML file: The easiest way is to create and populate an XmlDocument or XDocument object. Save to the install directory: use string path = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(Application.ExecutablePath); string file = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathm, "myfile.xml"); But you do know that the application's folder isn't the best place to store a file, right? Edit: Some comments mention Isolated Storage, but that is overkill. The best way to store data is to use the appropriate DataPath. That is different under various versions of Windows, but this always works: string path = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData); There are a few other values in the Environment.SpecialFolder enum, take a look.
