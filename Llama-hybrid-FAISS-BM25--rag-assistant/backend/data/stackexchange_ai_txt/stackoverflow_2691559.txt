If the intranet is not connected to the internet, you can verify that by pinging a well-known site, such as your domain or google.com, and refusing to operate if it answers. But such intranets are becoming rare. Maybe it would be easier to restrict max number of users (total or concurrent) - verifying that an application is not accessible from outside can be difficult. Less attempts to hack the application (behind company firewall) - that's the pro and a con, because then you may be tempted to pay less attention to security considerations because "well, it's an internal app!" No fundamental difference. In large organizations, usually some form of single sign-on is used and you will have to integrate that; also, server configuration and software may be restricted by IT. XAMPP can be run from a pen drive, so if you can boot Windows from there and instruct it to run XAMPP this should be possible.
