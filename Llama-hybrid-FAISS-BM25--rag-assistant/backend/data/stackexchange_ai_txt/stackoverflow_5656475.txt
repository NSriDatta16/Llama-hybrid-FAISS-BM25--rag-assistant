Regular Expression to detect a file extension

I need a regular expression that will detect a filename from a string - see if it ends with .pdf, or .PDF - case insensitive. Should even match .Pdf or any variant of pdf in case the user has messy filenames. This will be used in PHP 5. I know I can make a bunch of rows to test against each case, but I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do this.
