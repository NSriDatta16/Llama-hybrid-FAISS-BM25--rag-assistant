I'm a big fan of jQuery for elegant, client side cross-browser javascript. If you want to look at some "modern" concepts on the server side, REST is getting some airplay, and cloud stuff like Google App Engine can make for a really efficient development path (scalability 'for free'). But I still stick with the old-school IDE - syntax highlighting text editor. Or eclipse , which sometimes isn't much better ;)
