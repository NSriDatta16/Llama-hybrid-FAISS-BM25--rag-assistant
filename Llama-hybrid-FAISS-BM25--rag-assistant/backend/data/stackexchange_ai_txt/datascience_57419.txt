Reinforcement Learning Vs Transfer Learning?

I recently saw a video lecture from Jeremy Howard of fast.ai in which he states that transfer learning is better than reinforcement learning. But I was unable to understand the reasoning behind it. Can someone explain to me or point to any evidence stating which is better and why?
