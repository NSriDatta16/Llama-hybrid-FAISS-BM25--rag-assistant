There is no right answer. I like Matt's answer for reasons of precision. I like Abe's answer for reasons of space saving... (Yes, space in a table is much more 'impactful' than on the Filesystem) The real answer is, for what purpose are you storing the value? Is this for a mechanism to invoice the user storing the data? Then you'd have to rely on the contract. Is this to measure space on a drive... if so, files REALLY take up some number of 'blocks' and NOT some number of bytes. If the minimum block size is 2KB then you should say that EVERY file is increments of 2kb... If you store that value or that value times 2kb is up to you. Maybe you're storing the value because the retrieval algorithm has 2 optimization paths, one for larger files and one for smaller and that process would like to know the size WITHOUT interrogating the file-system. (in this case maybe just an "is_greater_than_x_kb" flag column is all you need.) No one here can tell you what your requirement is. The only thing the existing answers give you is an opinion, not a right answer.
