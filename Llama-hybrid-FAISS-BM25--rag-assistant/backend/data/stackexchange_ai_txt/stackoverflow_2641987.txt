How can I equalize the heights of text input fields?

What is the best way to equalize the height of my elements and my elements? It's proving difficult because of differences in box-sizing models. Google Chrome's user agent stylesheet has this: select { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; } ..whereas other text input fields use the content box model. Why the difference? Should I perhaps make all of my text-based input fields use the border-box model? BTW, I'm using standards-compliant mode (by using ).
