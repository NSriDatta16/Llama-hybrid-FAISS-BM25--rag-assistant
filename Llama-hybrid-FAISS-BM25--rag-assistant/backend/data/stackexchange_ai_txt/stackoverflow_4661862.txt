Well, the "why" is stated in the SpEL docs : While there are several other Java expression languages available, OGNL, MVEL, and JBoss EL, to name a few, the Spring Expression Language was created to provide the Spring community with a single well supported expression language that can be used across all the products in the Spring portfolio. While OGNL has its advantages, and its fans, its functionality is too limited for what was required for Spring 3, and so SpEL was born. And because SpEL became the base expression language for Spring, WebFlow moved to that as a replacement for OGNL. I haven't had much cause to use SpEL much, though, so I couldn't tell you how to do any particular task. As to its advantages, I'd say the primary one is that while OGNL is now stagnant, SpEL is a core part of Spring now, and so will be continuously improved and extended. Bluntly put, OGNL is dead (it's maintained now by opensymphony.com, which is hardly a dynamic, active organisation)
