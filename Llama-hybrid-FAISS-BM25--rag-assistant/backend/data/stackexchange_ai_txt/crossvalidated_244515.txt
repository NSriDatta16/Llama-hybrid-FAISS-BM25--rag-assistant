In their book, Fox and Weisberg (2011) talk about score tests for nonconstant error variance (in a linear model) suggested by the earlier studies (Breusch and Pagan, 1979; Cook and Weisberg 1983). Basically, it tests the hypothesis of constant error variance against the alternative that the error variance changes with the level of the fitted values (Kabacoff, 2011). Fox and Weisberg explained "the idea is that either the variance is constant or it depends on the mean, $$\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2g[E(y|x)]$$ or on a linear combination of regressors $z_1,\ldots,z_p$, $$\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2g(\gamma_iz_{i1}+\cdots+\gamma_pz_{ip})\text{ "}$$ (Fox and Weisberg, 2011: 316) You can find an implementation of this test in car R package (by Fox and Weisberg) as ncvTest function.
