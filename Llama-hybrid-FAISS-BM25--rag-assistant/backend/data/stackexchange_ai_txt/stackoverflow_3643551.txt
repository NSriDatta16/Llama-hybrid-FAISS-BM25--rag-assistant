You're going to need to account for the specifics of the spellings in the language to decide whether or not "ll", for instance, is "l" "l" or indeed is "ll". This much is obvious to you. My point in bringing it up is that this is the crux of the problem. You're going to need to pre-process your input so that these ambigous double-letters are encoded as one letter. With a store medium like plain old ASCII text files, this will be impossible. Your other option is to rely on some statistical liklihood in determining whether a letter pairing is 1 spanish letter or two. By taking into context the contents of the entire word, you can use prior probabilities to determine this. A Bayesian tecnique may work well.
