Stanford (Ng) and Caltech (Abu-Mostafa) have put machine learning classes on YouTube. You don't get to see the assignments, but the lectures don't rely on those. I recommend trying to watch those first, as those will help you to find out what math you need to learn. I believe a very similar class with assignments is taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera, which Ng helped to create. One exception: If I recall correctly, early in the Stanford lectures, Ng does some calculations involving derivatives of traces of products of matrices. Those are rather isolated, so don't worry if you don't follow those calculations. I don't even know what course would cover those. You do want to have some familiarity with probability, linear algebra, linear programming, and multivariable calculus. However, you need a lot less than what is contained in many complete college classes on those subjects.
