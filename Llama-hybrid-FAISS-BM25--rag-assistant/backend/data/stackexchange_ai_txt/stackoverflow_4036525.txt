Since your query doesn't contain a LIMIT, I'm not sure why you'd be using FOUND_ROWS() . Couldn't you simply SELECT COUNT(*) FROM activity WHERE AGENT = '$row[AGTNO] instead? EDIT: In fact, if I read between the lines a little more, I think you could get everything you need in one query. This may be over-simplified since I don't have all the details of the hier procedure, but it'd be something like: SELECT ag.AGTNO, ag.AGTCOMMLVL, /* etc. */, count(ac.AGENT) as foundrows FROM agent ag LEFT JOIN activity ac on ag.AGTNO = ac.AGENT
