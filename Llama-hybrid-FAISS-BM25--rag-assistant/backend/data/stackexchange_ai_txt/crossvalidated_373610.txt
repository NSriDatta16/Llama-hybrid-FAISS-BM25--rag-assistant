different trends in loss and AUC ROC metric

I am training a deep neural network for a binary classification I am using binary_crossentropy as loss and area under the roc curve as performance metric as requested by specific data domain I am working on. I train on a small and noisy dataset for some epochs, and get the following: So, my validation loss increases at some (point (log shown here)), while the auc increases at the same epochs after 125) How to interpret this finding?Is this overfitingt? Is my domain specific performance evaluation still realistic?
