Example for Time Series with Drift and one with Trend

after going through a few posts here on CrossValidated, StackOverflow and Google, I am still puzzled how I can detect whether a time series has a "drift" and how it differs from trend. Here are four questions that directly relate to each other. I want to avoid creating 4 posts for each of these. Does "drift" just mean a linear upwards trend? If so, then is "trend" always exponential? What's the difference between "drift" and "intercept"? Deseasonalizing and detrending might be part of the pre-whitening process of a time series. I wonder what to do with drift? When applying an Augmented Dickey Fuller Test after deseasonalizing and detrending, should I then consider "const" or "none"?
