If this is incredibly important, I'd suggest investigating the following: add id s to each outgoing link use JavaScript to capture the onClick for the links when a link is clicked, redirect the user to that link's id fragment identifier , then link out as desired When the user hits the back button, they'll return to that specific link, e.g. http://www.example.com/#link27 instead of http://www.example.com/ You may be able to get some ideas from here: Stack Overflow: Is it possible to persist (without reloading) AJAX page state across BACK button clicks?
