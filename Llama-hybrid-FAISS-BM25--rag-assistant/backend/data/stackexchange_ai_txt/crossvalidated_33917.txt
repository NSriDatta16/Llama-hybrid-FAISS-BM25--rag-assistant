How to determine significant principal components using bootstrapping or Monte Carlo approach?

I am interested in determining the number of significant patterns coming out of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis. I am particularly interested in applying this method to climate data. The data field is a MxN matrix with M being the time dimension (e.g. days) and N being the spatial dimension (e.g. lon/lat locations). I have read of a possible bootstrap method to determine significant PCs, but have been unable to find a more detailed description. Until now, I have been applying North's Rule of Thumb (North et al ., 1982) to determine this cutoff, but I was wondering if a more robust method was available. As an example: ###Generate data x And, here is the method that I have been using to determine PC significance. Basically, the rule of thumb is that the difference between neighboring Lambdas must be greater than their associated error. ###Determine significant EOFs #North's Rule of Thumb Lambda_err i){ if(lower.lim[i] > upper.lim[nearest]) NORTHok[i] I have found the chapter section by Björnsson and Venegas ( 1997 ) on significance tests to be helpful - they refer to three categories of tests, of which the dominant variance -type is probably what I am hoping to use. The refer to a type of Monte Carlo approach of shuffling the time dimension and recomputing the Lambdas over many permutations. von Storch and Zweiers (1999) also refer to the a test that compares the Lambda spectrum to a reference "noise" spectrum. In both cases, I am a bit unsure of how this might be done, and also how the significance test is done given the confidence intervals identified by the permutations. Thanks for your help.
