Coarse classing using the measure of weight of Evidence (WoE) has the following advantage- WoE displays a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the odds ratio which is the dependent variable in logistic regression. Therefore, the question of model misspecification does not arise in logistic regression when we use WoE instead of the actual values of the variable. $ln(p/1-p)$ = $\alpha$ + $\beta$*$WoE(Var1)$ + $\gamma$*$WoE(Var2)$ + $\eta$*$WoE(Var3 )$ Source: In one of the PPTs my trainer showed me during the company training.
