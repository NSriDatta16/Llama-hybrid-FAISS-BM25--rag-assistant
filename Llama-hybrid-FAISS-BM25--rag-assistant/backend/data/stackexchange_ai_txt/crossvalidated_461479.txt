Suppose that $y_{t}$ is a time series at time $t$ that you can express with the following equation \begin{align} y_{t} = \alpha + c_{1}y_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}, \end{align} where $\alpha$ is a constant, $\epsilon_{t}$ an error term and $y_{t-1}$ is the observation at time $t-1$ . The above equation is known as an AR(1) model. Notice that the term $y_{t-1}$ is linear because it just has a constant multiplying it. Now, if we would like to consider non-linear components, we could express $y_{t}$ as \begin{align} y_{t}^2 = c_{0} + c_{1}y_{t-1}^2 + ... + c_{k}y_{t-k}^2 + \epsilon_{t} \end{align} where the term $y_{t-1},..., y_{t-k}$ are quadratic ( $k$ is the number of lags). In fact, the prior expression is used to test if a time series is non-linear by setting the null hypothesis \begin{align} H_{0} : c_{1} = ... = c_{k} = 0 \end{align} against the alternative \begin{align} H_{1} : c_{i} \neq 0, \: \text{for some} \: i\in{1,...,k} \end{align} For a better clarification, chapter 1 of Nonlinear Time Series Analysis by Ruey Tsay and Rong Chen is recommended. In conclusion, linear or non-linear depends on the associated exponent to each term $y_{t-1}, ..., y_{t-k}$ .
