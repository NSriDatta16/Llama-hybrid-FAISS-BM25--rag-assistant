I quote Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow t-SNE Reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D). When visualizing your data you have to take into consideration the curse of dimensionality https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality
