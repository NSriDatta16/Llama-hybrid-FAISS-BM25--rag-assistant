Mean Square Error as reconstruction loss in VAE

I'm trying to understand one specific formula in a paper that I'm reading: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02469.pdf It's concerning equation 10: Unfortunately, the authors don't explain the context of what is Ïƒ. I also tried to find other sources. In other implementations it seems quite common to just use conventional loss functions of the author's liking, without much explanation.
