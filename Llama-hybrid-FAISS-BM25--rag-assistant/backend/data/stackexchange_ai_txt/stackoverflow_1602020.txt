This should be community wiki since it's pretty subjective and there's no "right" answer. That said, you should develop on the fastest machine available to you. Yes, anything slower will introduce irritation and encourage you to fix the slowdowns, but only at a very high price: Your productivity as a programmer is directly related to the number of things you can hold in your head, and anything which slows down your process or impedes you at all lengthens the amount of time you have to hold those ideas in short term-memory, making you more likely to forget them, and have to go re-learn them. Waiting for a program to compile allows the stack of bugs, potential issues, and fixes to drop out of your head as you get distracted. Waiting for a dialog to load, or a query to finish interrupts you similarly. Even if you ignore that effect, you've still got the truth of the later statement - early optimization will leave you chasing yourself round in circles, breaking code that already works, and guessing (with often poor accuracy) about where things might get bogged down. Design your code properly in the first place, and you can forget about optimization until it's had a chance to settle for a bit, at which point any necessary optimization will be obvious.
