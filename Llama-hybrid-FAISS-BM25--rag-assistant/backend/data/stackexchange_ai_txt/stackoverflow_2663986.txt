jQuery Sortable + Droppable z-index problem

I am having a probelm with the z-index of my sortable object not being above my droppable. If you visit http://clareshilland.unknowndomain.co.uk/ . Press Ctrl + L to bring up the login screen. Enter the username clare and the password shilland . It will then load in the admin bar and if you click manage gallery . A pop down thumbnail view will appear with all the photos from that gallery. The issue is that when you drag the 'polaroids' from the grid to the delete area they are under the delete area. I tried putting the delete area inside the same div as the grid but it makes no difference, I just don't know what to do at this point so any help would be a massive help!
