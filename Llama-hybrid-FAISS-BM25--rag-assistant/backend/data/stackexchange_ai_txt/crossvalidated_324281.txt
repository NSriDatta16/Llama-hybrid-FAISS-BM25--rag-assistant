Reparametrization of the GJR-GARCH(1,1) model (Asymmetric GARCH models)

Xia et al. (2017) state that the power-transformed and threshold GARCH(1,1,1) model is equivalent to the GJR-GARCH(1,1) model (see page 355 of Xia et al. (2017)). It is not clear why the first model can be rewritten as the latter model. MODEL 1: PTTGARCH(1,1,1) The power-transformed and threshold GARCH(1,1,1) model takes the following form: (1) $y_{t}$ = $ \sigma_t$ $\epsilon_t$ (2) $ \sigma_t^2$ = $\alpha_0$ + $\alpha_1$ $(y_{t-1}^{+})^2$ + $\alpha_2$ $(y_{t-1}^{-})^2$ + $\beta$ $ \sigma_{t-1}^2$, where $(y^{+})$ denotes positive values of random variable $y$, and where $(y^{-})$ denotes negative values of random variable $y$; moreover, $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\beta$ are (unknown) parameters. Essentially, this model splits the effect of past returns ($y_{t-1}$) on volatility into two distinct effects: the effect of past positive returns ($y_{t-1}^{+}$), and the effect of past negative returns ($y_{t-1}^{-}$). MODEL 2: GJR-GARCH(1,1) The GJR-GARCH(1,1) model takes the following form: (a) $y_{t}$ = $ \sigma_t$ $\epsilon_t$ (b) $ \sigma_t^2$ = $\alpha_0$ + $\gamma_1$ $(y_{t-1})^2$ + $\gamma_2$ $(y_{t-1})^2$ $I_{(y_{t-1}>0)}$ + $\beta$ $ \sigma_{t-1}^2$, where $I_{(y_{t-1}>0)}$ is an indicator function which takes value 1 if $y_{t-1}$ is positive, and takes value 0 if $y_{t-1}$ is negative. QUESTIONS Is it true that the two models are equivalent? It seems that the two models are not equivalent in that I cannot transform equation (2) into equation (b), and I cannot transform equation (b) into equation (2). Am I missing something here? Is there a mathematical way to show that equation (2) is exactly the same as equation (b), and/or vice versa? References Xia et al. (2017).
