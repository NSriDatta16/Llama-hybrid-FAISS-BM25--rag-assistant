Whole-site SSL/TLS encryption As the recent release of Firesheep shows, it's trivial to steal session cookies in open WiFi environments (such as offered by many libraries, hotels, and other venues) and any un-switched Ethernet segments still kicking around. (In theory, on switched ones too ) With Firesheep now making it a two-click operation for even the average Joe, whole-site encryption is no longer something to be treated as a luxury. (Along with setting the secure flag on session cookies to ensure compatible browsers won't accidentally leak them into unsecured requests) Neither the extension nor the problem are going away. According to Adam Langly's blog, Google found that SSL/TLS isn't as bad as people tend to guess and, with a little tweaking (which they're building on in Chrome), even the latency component of setting up a connection with extra round-trips can be effectively eliminated. Even certificate costs aren't as big an issue as many people think, given that StartCom offers free SSL certs and their root cert is already present in all major browsers.
