I agree not all relations are linear in itself but quite a lot of relations can be linearly approximated. We have seen many such cases in mathematics such as the Taylor series or Fourier series etc. The key point here is, geomatt22 said in the comment, you can in general transform the nonlinear data and apply some kind of transformation with basis functions and linearize the relationship. The reason universities only address 'multiple linear regression models' (including simple regression models) is because they are the building block to models of a more advanced level which are also linear. Mathematically speaking, as long as you can prove that a certain linear approximation is dense in a Hilbert space, then you will be able to use the approximation to represent a function in the space.
