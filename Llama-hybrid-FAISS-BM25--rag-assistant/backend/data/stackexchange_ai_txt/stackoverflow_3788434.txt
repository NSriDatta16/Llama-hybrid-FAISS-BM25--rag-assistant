As others have said here, it's a fact that storing credit card information requires you to be certified. You can ask for information to process the transaction but keeping it on storage of any kind is a big no-no. Fortunately sites like authorize.net, braintree.com, paypal.com, etc will let you interact with their APIs in such a way that you get a "Customer Vault ID" for each entity you'd like to make transactions for. These 3rd parties store all the sensitive information in a 100% legit way. And whenever you would like to make a transaction using their saved information, you interact with the service using their "Vault ID". I've used authorize.net, BrainTree and PayPal. Most recently it was BrainTree and had some good success with them. I would not recommend PayPal unless you need the brand recognition or you just want to do a direct transfer whereby you bypass asking them for account information of any kind (because they already entered it in PayPal).
