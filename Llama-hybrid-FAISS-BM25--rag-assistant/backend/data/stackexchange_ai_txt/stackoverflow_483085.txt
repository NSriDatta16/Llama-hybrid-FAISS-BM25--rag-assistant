I would recommend using the same database for your unit tests as for production. You really don't need some weird difference shooting you in the foot when you're debugging a live issue. If you have a look at the really big unit test suite for NHibernate, you'll see that it uses SQL Server (disk based), and the tests run surprisingly quickly. It's even more impressive consider that there's a lot more table creation / deletion going on than the average set of unit tests, which isn't what SQL Server is optimized for.
