I don't have Minitab so I can't show you the exact syntax or GUI menu actions to perform a t-test for independent samples. However, statistical packages (e.g., R, Stata) generally provide commands to perform a t-test when data are organized as either two series of measurements, one for each group (usually arranged in two columns); all individual measurements in one column, described by group levels in another column. With the example from Wikipedia ("weights of screws that were chosen out of a bucket"), that would mean that scheme 1 looks like: +-----+-----+ |A1 |A2 | +-----+-----+ |30.02|29.89| +-----+-----+ |29.99|29.93| +-----+-----+ |30.11|29.72| +-----+-----+ |29.97|29.98| +-----+-----+ |30.01|30.02| +-----+-----+ |29.99|29.98| +-----+-----+ while for scheme 2 we would arrange data as follows: +-----+-----+ |30.02|A1 | +-----+-----+ |29.99|A1 | +-----+-----+ |30.11|A1 | +-----+-----+ |29.97|A1 | +-----+-----+ |30.01|A1 | +-----+-----+ |29.99|A1 | +-----+-----+ |29.89|A2 | +-----+-----+ |29.93|A2 | +-----+-----+ |29.72|A2 | +-----+-----+ |29.98|A2 | +-----+-----+ |30.02|A2 | +-----+-----+ |29.98|A2 | +-----+-----+ As explained on this short tutorial on Minitab 2-Sample-t-test , any scheme can be used by filling out the correct option in the 2-Sample-t dialog box. In your case, that means selecting Height as Samples and Class as Subscripts , with Samples arranged in one column. After running your t-test, you may want to check usual assumptions (normality and homogeneity of variance).
