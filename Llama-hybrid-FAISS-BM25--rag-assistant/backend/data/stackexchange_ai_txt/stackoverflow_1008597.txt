Some pretty regular gotchas pertain almost exclusively to the DOM, which is slow accross browsers. Try to user innerHTML wherever possible. It's not the standards-compliant way of doing things, but it is by far the fastest. If you're looping through DOM elements using something like the following: for (var i = 0; i Note that every time you request the length of a NodeList , a rather expensive lookup operation is performed. You're better off caching the length of the NodeList as follows: for (var i = 0, il = domNodes.length; i The performance improvements here are incredible. Robert Nyman did an interesting comparison of for loops. If you've never heard of this, the performance boost might surprise you.
