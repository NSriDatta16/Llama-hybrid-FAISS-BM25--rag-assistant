Your problem is suitable for machine learning technique. You are modeling the problem as a non-parametric model, i.e. parameters are dependent on your data, as your data grows, parameters also grow as well. Simple non-parametric models will be something like k-nearest neighbors. each time you want to predict some new data point, you have to calculate all the training examples distances with that data point. So keeping track of email addresses is not a good idea, what if you let a machine read the content, then automatically decide with a fixed set of parameters what the output should be? You could access large dataset of spam/ham emails. and train large deep models on, following that fine-tune it on your custom dataset. As for the accuracy of the model, after you train a classifier, the output of the model will be a simple real value between 0 and 1, telling you how much the model believes it's ham or spam respectively, usually, we set a threshold of 0.5 to give definite answers. yet if you want to optimize the false negatives, you could increase the threshold. e.g. if you set it to be 0.8, you are saying I don't want the machine to classify it as ham if it's not 80% sure.
