Dojo Dialog dont want to block whole page only fragement/div of the page

Hi I am working on Dojo and Liferay portal. We have portlets which are using Dojo for UI. We want to show dialog ( "Loading..." dialog) for each of the portlets (Divs/Fragments...). Problem is each Dialog block access to whole page,and there are more than one such dialogs would be there. Can we customize/change to restrict Dojo Dialog's "Modalness" to particular div/fragment rather than whole page ?
