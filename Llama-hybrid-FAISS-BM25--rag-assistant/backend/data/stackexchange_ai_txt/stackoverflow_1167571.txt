There is nothing about the URL itself that will indicate language. One option would be to use a natural language toolkit to try to identify the language based on the content, but even if you can get the NLP part of it working, it'll be pretty slow. Also, it may not be reliable. Remember, most user agents pass something like Accept-Language: en-US with each request, and many large websites will serve different content based on that header. Smaller sites will be more reliable because they won't pay attention to the language headers. You could also use server location (i.e. which country the server is in) as a proxy for language using GeoIP . It's obviously not perfect, but it is much better than using the TLD.
