Maybe the website uses JavaScript to load additional data after the main page has loaded? Get Fiddler and check what passes through the pipes. Is there some sort of CSS/Javascript hide/unhide work done on page load? Check with IE8's built-in script debugger. Maybe there's a CSS stylesheet loaded which hides those results, or are they physically missing from the response? How do the webclient/IE headers differ? Some sites send different content depending e.g. on User-Agent header ("If this is not IE/FF/Opera/Webkit, it's probably a bot, send different content"). Pay attention to other header fields as well. Again, check using Fiddler. Are the results in IE displayed as HTML? Is it not some Flash/Java/Silverlight/whatever object? (strange but possible) Is there some cookie action going on? Some sites set a cookie on access, and use it to keep state - e.g. "you haven't gone through the search page, no results for you". Again, Fiddler to the rescue. Does the site work OK in other browsers? If not, what's broken? (not a problem per se, but can give you a hint where a problem could be)
