As many have said, generating all permutations is computationally infeasible for non-trivial classes. What I have had to do, and had great success with, is generating all permutations of a class for a specific range of inputs; i.e., given a class with properties A, B, and C, I'd like to generate all permutations of A=1, A=2, B=1, C=3, and C=4, resulting in: A=1, B=1, C=3 A=2, B=1, C=3 A=1, B=1, C=4 A=2, B=1, C=4 This kind of thing can be accomplished with recursive algorithms or some really elegant LINQ queries. There's a fairly exhaustive piece on that here , but its a good amount of programming and it really helps if you're boned up on your Set Theory.
