Closing out some old questions... Our setup was not conducive to maven due to lack of network connectivity and timing. I know there are offline maven setups, but it was all too much given the time. Hopefully we'll get to use a proper setup when we've got time to reorganize the build process. The solution involved Ant, BND, and some custom ant tasks. The various bundle dependencies are manually managed. We were already using Ant; BND and custom tasks tied it all together. The custom tasks just made sure our bnd/eclipse projects were in sync.
