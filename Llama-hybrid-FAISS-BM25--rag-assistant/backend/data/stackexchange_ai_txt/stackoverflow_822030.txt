I honestly do not believe you can do well with web development without having a good background with general software development. If one doesn't pay attention to that he/she will end as a mundane scripter or something. Would be a good idea if you told us what kind of people with what background you get. If you got some financial academy graduates, it is not clear what kind of motivation will they have towards any kind of development. If these are engineers or some creative field like design, decorations etc. it will be a different story. Try to gather a little bit of best-practices from various aspects of development. A little from testing and quality control, a bit from project management, a few things about dealing with customers, security for publicly-exposed software, legal aspects. Not too much, just to paint a big picture.
