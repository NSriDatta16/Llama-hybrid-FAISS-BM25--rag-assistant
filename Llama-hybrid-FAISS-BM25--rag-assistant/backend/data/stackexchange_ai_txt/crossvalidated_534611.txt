Logistic regression predicts $P(1)$ , and we get $P(0)$ via $1-P(1)$ . Remember that the GLM deals with a binomial response variable that models the probability of getting a "success", defined as $1$ in the usual way we define the binomial PMF. Therefore, a coefficient of $0.03$ means that, for every one-unit increase in the corresponding variable, expect an increase of $0.03$ in the log-odds of $1$ . (Always keep in mind that logistic regression is predicting a log-odds (or a probability, depending how you elect to look at it), not a discrete outcome. Predicting discrete outcomes is surprisingly problematic. )
