Generally speaking you should not be using "random sequences" to try to model the non-class-A. You're likely better off using some kind of One-Class or Single-Class classification technique whereby you only present the class-A data. For support vector models, two common approaches are the SVDD (which tries to capture the data in the smallest sphere) and One-Class SVM - these are equivalent to each other for the Guassian kernel. Note that libsvm (and thus scikit) use the latter. In both cases, you effectively control the percentage of points in class-A that you are willing to misclassify to enforce the boundary for identifying A.
