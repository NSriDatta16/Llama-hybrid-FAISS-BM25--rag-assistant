The softmax output of a neural network classifier can be considered a probabilistic classification, however the probabilities will often not be well calibrated. Well calibrated means that the estimated probability matches our confidence in the prediction - in other words, the classifier is well calibrated it makes the correct prediction 80% of the time it predicts class A with 80% probability (and similarly for all other probabilities). If calibrated probabilities are required then a post-classification calibration step can be used. This essentially rescales the softmax output to adjust the probabilities to more closely match the expected distribution.
