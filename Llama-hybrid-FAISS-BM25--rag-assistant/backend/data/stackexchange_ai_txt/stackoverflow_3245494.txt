I finally solved it, but I'm not sure if it's the best/most elegant way to do it. NSMutableArray* items = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; for (MenuItems* item in menuItems) { [items addObject:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:item.id,[item.modified description],nil]]; } NSString *post = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"currentData=%@", [items JSONRepresentation]]; Explanation: I first thought that the problem was the NSMutableArray, but then realized that it was the contents of it. So I just get the information I need out of it and saved it as NSArray which JSON-Framework does accept :-)
