Initially split your data into 80% development data and 20% evaluation data. You shall only evaluate your model once. Using the development data, use k-fold cross validation for training and evaluation of models. Do not start with the most complicated model first (neural networks). Instead, always start with a variant of decision trees, because they are easy to train and often perform well. Specifically have a look at XGBoost and RandomForest . Either way, you will want to optimize your hyper-parameters . Once you then have nice cross-validated results, you can use your model with the optimized hyper-parameters once to evaluate it. Everything else is cheating yourself. Most importantly, best read a lot of sklearn documentation. It provides great insight not only into how to use their algorithms but also general insight on approaching and evaluating.
