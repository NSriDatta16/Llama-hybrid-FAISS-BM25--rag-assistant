It is not "intuitively clear" to me. In fact, I'd say it totally depends on the signal to noise ratio. PCA decomposes the data into uncorrelated vectors, with the first vector (first component) catching the largest portion of the variability in the data, the second -- the second largest etc. If the noise is big enough, it will push the "signal" towards the smaller components. Quite often I see that one of the "major" components is dominated by one or two outliers (usually technical errors in measurement), while the actual study variables come in third or fourth.
