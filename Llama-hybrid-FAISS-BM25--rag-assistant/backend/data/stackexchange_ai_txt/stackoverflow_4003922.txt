In your root controller of a navigation controller (the view controller that is normally visible as first one), activate a modal controller with those initial instructions with presentModalViewController:animated: . You probably want to call it from within viewWillAppear: . Do not animate presenting of modal view controller (otherwise you see what's below), but animate when dismissing it - it looks really elegant. Use UserDefaults to store the information that it had already been shown, and do not show it anymore.
