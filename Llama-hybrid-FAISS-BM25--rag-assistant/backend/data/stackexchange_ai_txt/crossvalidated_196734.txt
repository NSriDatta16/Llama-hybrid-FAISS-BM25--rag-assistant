Finite maximum log-likelihood but infinite AIC (bug in R?)

I have a panel data set with binary dependent variable of 20,000 observations and 11 independent variables. I ran a logistic regression with fixed effects and the model returns maximum log likelihood value of -7417.845 and AIC equals Inf . I am not sure why here the AIC value goes to infinity? I am using R package " glmmML ".
