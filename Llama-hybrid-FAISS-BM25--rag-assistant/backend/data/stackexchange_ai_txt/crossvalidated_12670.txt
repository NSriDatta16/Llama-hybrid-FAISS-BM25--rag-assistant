Data APIs/feeds available as packages in R

EDIT: The Web Technologies and Services CRAN task view contains a much more comprehensive list of data sources and APIs available in R. You can submit a pull request on github if you wish to add a package to the task view. I'm making a list of the various data feeds that are already hooked into R or that are easy to setup. Here's my initial list of packages, and I was wondering what else I'm missing. I'm trying to limit this list to "real time" or "close to real time" data feeds/APIs, where the underlying data might change between downloads. There's plenty of lists out there for static datasets, which only require one download. This list is currently biased towards financial/time series data, and I could use some help expanding it into other domains.
