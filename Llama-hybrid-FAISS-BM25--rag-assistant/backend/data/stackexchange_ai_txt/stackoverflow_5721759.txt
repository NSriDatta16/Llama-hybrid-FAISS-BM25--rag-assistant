Filtering rows based on column values in Bash

I've got a bash script which outputs some column-based information. I'd like to give the user some options for matching values is specific columns. For example, ./myColumnDump might print User Job_name Start_day andrew job1_id monday andrew job2_id tuesday adam job1_id tuesday adam job2_id monday and I'd like to add options like ./myColumDump -j 2 (where's j's argument is a regular expression used which matches values in the Job_name column). I'm currently piping the output through grep and embedding the user-specified regex's in a big regex to match a whole row, but the he/she might specify -j .*monday which would spill into the different column. Is there a nicer way to achieve this in a bash script?
