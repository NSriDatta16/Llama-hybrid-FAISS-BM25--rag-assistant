You should download Visual Studio 2008 Express , and download ASP.NET MVC 1.0 (I wouldn't download ASP.NET MVC 2.0 yet because it's only in RC. Wait until it hits 2.0 final). You can also check out the Nerddinner walkthrough . It's very helpful when learning ASP.NET MVC. Generators Do you mean code generators? Ew. Gems/Plugins If you want functionality, you can either build it or see if a JQuery plugin exists for it. Databases The Database is accessed through your model. Migrations ? Routes Routing is handled by the framework, and you can add routes in the Global.asax.cs file. Models (ORMs) Models are indeed still called 'Models', and in ASP.NET MVC, if you use LINQ-To-SQL, the model is generated for you when you drag your database tables in. You can use the Repository pattern to access the database model. Controllers (InheritedResources) Controllers are still called controllers. Views (layouts, templates, partials) There are different types of View Engines, but the one provided with ASP.NET MVC should do well at first. Rails Console I'm guessing you mean the IDE/Debugger? You can build and debug an ASP.NET MVC app inside of Visual Studio. Test Units/Specs You can use NUnit, or you can use MSUnit. MSUnit is already integrated with Visual Studio, but NUnit can be.
