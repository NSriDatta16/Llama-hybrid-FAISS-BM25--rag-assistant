I'd recommend a logistic regression with merchants and products as random effects. In R, this would look like: library("lme4") fit Extracting the estimates is relatively straightforward, and I handle millions of data points with approaches similar to this on standard workstations all the time. The model fitting typically only takes a few minutes.
