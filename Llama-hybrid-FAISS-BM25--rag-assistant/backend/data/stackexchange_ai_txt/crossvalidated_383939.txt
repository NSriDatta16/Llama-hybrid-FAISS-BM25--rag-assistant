You are not explicit about your Death variable, so I am going to assume that Death = 1 if the character died and Death = 0 if the character didn't die. Your glm model would then be a binary logistic regression model of the form: log(odds of death) = beta0 + beta1*Gender where Gender = 1 if the character is female and Gender = 0 if the character is male. You can plug-in the values of 0 and 1, respectively, for Gender in the above model to get the following. Males (for whom Gender = 0) log(odds of death) = beta0 (1) Females (for whom Gender = 1) log(odds of death) = beta0 + beta1 (2) From this, you can see that beta0 refers to the log odds of death for males , while beta0 + beta1 refers to the log odds of death for females . This means that: beta1 = (beta0 + beta1) - beta0 represents the difference in the log odds of death between females and males . Now, if you exponentiate both sides of equations (1) and (2), you will get the following: Males (for whom Gender = 0) odds of death = exp(beta0) (3) Females (for whom Gender = 1) odds of death = exp(beta0 + beta1) (4) Dividing (4) by (3), this means that: (odds of death for females)/(odds of death for males) = exp(beta0 + beta1)/exp(beta0) = exp(beta1) In other words, exp(beta0) represents the odds of death for males , exp(beta0 + beta1) represents the odds of death for females and exp(beta1) represents the odds ratio of death for females relative to males. Note that your computer output returns the estimated values of beta0 (-0.3334916) and beta1 (-0.2329039) under the Estimate column. Since probability = odds/(1 + odds) , you can use equations (3) and (4) to derive the probability of death for male and female characters, respectively. Males (for whom Gender = 0) probability of death = exp(beta0)/(1 + exp(beta0)) (5) Females (for whom Gender = 1) probability of death = exp(beta0 + beta1)/(1 + exp(beta0 + beta1)) (6) Now, let's say you add another variable called Age in your model, where Age is the age of the character at the time of death. Let's also say that Age was centered around its sample mean prior to being included in the model: Age.cen = Age - mean(Age). Your binary logistic regression model would then be: log(odds of death) = beta0 + beta1*Gender + beta2*Age.cen For this extended model, beta0 represents the log odds of death for a male of average age (i.e., for a subject for whom Gender = 0 and Age.Cen = 0 or, equivalently, for a male subject for whom Age = mean(Age)). Equivalently, exp(beta0) represents the odds of death for such a male. On the other hand, beta1 represents the difference in the log odds of death between females and males of the same age , while exp(beta1) represents the ratio of odds of death for females to odds of death for males of the same age .
