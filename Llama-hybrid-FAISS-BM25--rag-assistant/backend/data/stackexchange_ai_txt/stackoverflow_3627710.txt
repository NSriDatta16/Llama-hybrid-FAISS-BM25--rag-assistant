A little confused by your wording. I assume you want to place your custom view in your UIViewController. You can easily do this both in Interface builder and within your code. Code: myView *view = [[myView alloc] initWithRect:CGRectMake([x],[y],[width], [height]]; [self.view addSubView:view]; [view release]; In Interface Builder: Select "View" in the Library Objects. Drag View unto your UIViewController's view. In the inspector click the i in a circle icon ("View Identity") Using the class dropdown select the class of your view (myView) Here's more info: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/IB_UserGuide/CustomizingInterfaceBuilder/CustomizingInterfaceBuilder.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005344-CH16-SW12
