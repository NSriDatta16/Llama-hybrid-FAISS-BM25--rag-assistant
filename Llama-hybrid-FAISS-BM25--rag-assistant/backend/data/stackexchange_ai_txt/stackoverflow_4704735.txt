How to check if HTML sessionStorage is not empty?

G'day guys, I'm trying to figure out the best way to check for empty storageSession in HTML5. I noticed that some browser returns null and some return just empty space if you clear or did not set any values to the sessionStorage . I've tried the following if (sessionStorage.getItem('value1') == "null" && sessionStorage.getItem('value2') == "null") { But it doesn't seem to work. Anyone got a better way to check if a sessionStorage is empty? Appreciate your help on this and thank you in advance.
