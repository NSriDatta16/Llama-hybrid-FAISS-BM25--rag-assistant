First of all, Congrats that you have started your journey of becoming a Data engineer/analyst. According to me there is no clear path on how to become a Data analyst. Applied data science with Python course is great but i would urge you to start working on problem statement of any domain (NLP,CV) and take part in competition where you will learn how to visualise data and work with large amount of dataset which are key requirement on becoming Data engineer/analyst. In this process you will anyway get to know what you need to learn and apply to solve the problem statement. Remember this will be a long journey so keep hustling!
