How do I insert a DOM element in an ordered list (in Dojo)?

I'm trying to make an AJAXy submission and have the resulting partial be inserted into my list at the proper place. I can think of a few options, but none is terribly good: Option 1: Return JSON, do rendering in Javascript. That seems like the wrong place to render this, especially since the list itself is rendered in my application server. It has the benefit, though, of making it easy to access the value to be sorted ( response.full_name ). Option 2: Return an HTML fragment, parse the sort value out. Parsing HTML in Javascript is probably worse than rendering it. Option 3: Return an HTML fragment that also contains a section that gets evaluated. This could add the DOM node to a master list and then make a JS call to insert itself at the right point. The downside here is that IE doesn't evaluate tags when innerHTML or appendChild are called.
