the life expectancy should have a positive slope (logically) Why should life expectancy have a positive slope, logically ? Even if it's positive, why should it be constant? Here's what Canadian actuary has to say: Jean-Claude MÃ©nard, Canada's Chief Actuary, said the improvement in life spans is not projected to continue at the same rate into the future. His office's projections assume the pace of gains will continue for the next few years, then gradually slow. I'd argue that the forecast you made (mistakenly, accidentally) is better than any "proper, correct" time time series forecast will produce. The reason being is that the time series forecast will pick up the trend and continue it into future in some shape or form. It doesn't have to do it by primitive trend extraction, it can be done in a very sophisticated manner, but in the end it will pick up the growth trend. I'm going to say that Alberta Male life expectancy will not keep growing at the historical pace anymore. 80 years is an excellent guess for the future, it's not going to be 85 by 2040.
