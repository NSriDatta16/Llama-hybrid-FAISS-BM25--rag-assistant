Ideally, this can be looked at with a survival analysis, where wheezing is the event (instead of death). You can do this in SPSS or stata, for example. In this case, you get a significance level (p value) from Cox regression (usually in the same program dialog). An easier approach is a t Test, where you compare the numbers at one of these time points. Your data has to be organized in columns, like "groupA24h" "groupB24h" and so on; the single patients would be the rows. You can get a statistically significant result, which is not the same as a clinically relevant difference. Although I doubt that 31 vs. 33 would be significant (at alpha=.05).
