Can you create folders to organize web sites in IIS7?

I have several ASP.NET sites in IIS7 and would like to be able to group them into folders (or other mechanism, if available). Ideally, I would use a customer name or account number and put the sites under there. Is there a way to customize the organization of sites in IIS7, or is there just the one 'flat' view? I'm open to tricks and hacks.
