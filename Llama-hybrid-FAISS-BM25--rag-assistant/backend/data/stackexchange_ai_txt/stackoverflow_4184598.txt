I do software development mainly on the Windows platform. Thus I use VisualSVN to help me keep my repositories on my home network storage (or on the local computer storage) acting as the server, and I also use TortoiseSVN to access local SVN - acting as the client. This allow me to work on small local projects which is easy to maintain.
