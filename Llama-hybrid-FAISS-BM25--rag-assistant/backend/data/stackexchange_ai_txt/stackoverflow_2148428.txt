I'm not quite sure what you mean by, "A static mirror of this site would hundreds of megabytes while the actual data is under 10 megabytes," but I believe the only practical way to read/write from HTML5 storage is via JavaScript, so when they first run your app it would have to check to see if the data exists in storage, and if it's not populate it from some source using JavaScript. There's no way to "preload" it other than that AFAIK.
