How do you have multiple javascript libraries in Dynamics CRM 2011

Right I am creating a method which adds an Account to Dynamics CRM with an Ajax POST to a built in webservice, the code is as follows : var context = GetGlobalContext(); var serverUrl = context.getServerUrl(); var ODATA_ENDPOINT = "/XRMServices/2011/OrganizationData.svc"; var account = new Object(); account.Name = "Sample Account created via OData jQuery library."; // Parse the entity object into JSON var jsonEntity = window.JSON.stringify(account); // Asynchronous AJAX function to Create a CRM record using OData $.ajax({ type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", datatype: "json", url: serverUrl + ODATA_ENDPOINT + "/AccountSet", data: jsonEntity, beforeSend: function (XMLHttpRequest) { //Specifying this header ensures that the results will be returned as JSON. XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader("Accept", "application/json"); }, success: function (data, textStatus, XmlHttpRequest) { }, error: function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) { } }); Right this code has a link to JSON and JQuery libraries, how do i link them in dynamic CRM 2011. I am looking to execute the code on a onload function to add the new account. But am in the dark at the moment to how that will work. I understand I have to first: Go to web resources Add the above jquery save the file Go to my entity and add the javascript library and its method to call on the onload but it links to json and jquery libraries though. How does this work?
