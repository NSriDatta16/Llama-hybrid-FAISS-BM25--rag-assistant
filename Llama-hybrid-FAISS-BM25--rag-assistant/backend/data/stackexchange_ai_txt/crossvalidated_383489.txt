Is there any relation between the number of hidden layers in a neural network and performance/accuracy?

I need to know if the number of hidden layers affect the performance and accuracy of a neural network. In other words, does increasing the number of hidden layers of a neural network increase the accuracy but decrease the performance? Or there is no rule for that?
