Can somebody tell me a simple case in which it is used for? A very typical case is in logistic regression. Logistic regression is a technique used often in machine learning to classify data points. For example, logistic regression can be used to classify whether an email is spam or is not spam or classify whether a person has or does not have a disease. Specifically, the logistic regression model says that the probability a data point $x_i$ is in class 1 is as follows: $h_\theta(x_i) = P[y_i = 1] = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^T x_i}}$ The parameter vector $\theta$ is typically estimated using MLE. Specifically, using optimization methods, we find the estimator $\hat\theta$ such that the expression $-\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\log(h_\hat\theta(x_i)) + (1-y_i)\log(1-h_{\hat\theta}(x_i))$ is minimized. This expression is the negative log likelihood, so minimizing this is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.
