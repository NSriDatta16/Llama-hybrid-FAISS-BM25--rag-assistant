You have to distinguish two different explained variances here: The explained variance in $\mathbf X$ and The explained variance in $\mathbf Y$ . PCA by construction yields the maximum explained variance in $\mathbf X$ . A PLS model (with same number of components/latent variables) may explain the same amount of $\mathbf X$ variance or less. OTOH, the PCA doesn't optimize the explained variance in $\mathbf Y$ , and PLS may explain more variance in $\mathbf Y$ than the PCA model (again with same number of components/latent variables). You may even achieve the same or more explained variance in $\mathbf Y$ with a PLS model that has somewhat fewer latent variables than the corresponding PCA/PCR model - but there is no guarantee here.
