Codeigniter MVC controller architecture

I'm building a site using CodeIgniter that largely consists of static content (although there will be a relatively small CMS backend, and there's code to handle localization/internationalization based on the domain used to access it). Typically, in a situation like this, I'd use a Pages controller that is in charge of rendering static content, but as there are a fair number of pages on the site (30+) it'd quickly end up containing lots of methods (assuming one per page). Should I break my Pages controller into multiple controllers (that perhaps inherit from it) according to different sections of the site? Should I organize methods differently in the Pages controller? What's the best practice here? Thanks! Justin
