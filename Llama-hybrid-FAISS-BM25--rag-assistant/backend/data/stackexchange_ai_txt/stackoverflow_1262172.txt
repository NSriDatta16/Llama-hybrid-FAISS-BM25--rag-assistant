Yes, without question Magento is open-source. Yes, it is a great product. Yes, it is slow. However, Magento seems to be missing the rich community that often accompanies open-source. For example Drupal, Firefox, and Ubuntu have a crazy passionate base. The Magento community should step up to the plate to fill in the gap since the official documentation, wiki, and forums are lacking. It seems the further away from Varien you get, the better the community support. I imagine Varien does this on purpose - since it is in their interest to have people purchase support from them. Perhaps I am being too hard on them. The project is young, and the community is still evolving. It might help if there was a community-wiki-hub that was independently operated by the community. Sites like snippi.net, Stack Overflow, alanstorm.com, westwideweb.com, inchoo.net, and the IRC channel are doing a great job at fueling the community so far.
