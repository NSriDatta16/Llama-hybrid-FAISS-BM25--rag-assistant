Apparently GitHub now offer git training courses to companies . Quoth their blog post about it : I’ve been down to the Google campus a number of times in the last few weeks helping to train the Androids there in Git. I was asked by Shawn Pearce (you may know him from his Git and EGit/JGit glory – he is the hero that takes over maintanance when Junio is out of town) to come in to help him train the Google engineers working on Andriod in transitioning from Perforce to Git , so Android could be shared with the masses. I can tell you I was more than happy to do it. […] Logical Awesome is now officially offering this type of custom training service to all companies, where we can help your organization with training and planning if you are thinking about switching to Git as well. Emphasis mine.
