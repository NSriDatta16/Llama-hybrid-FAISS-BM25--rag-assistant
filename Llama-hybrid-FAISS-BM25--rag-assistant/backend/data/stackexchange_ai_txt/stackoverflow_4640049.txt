Securing data storage with .NET Facebook App (with Facebook C# SDK)

I wanted to start a thread to understand practices people currently use to serialize user data in a Facebook (canvas) application running on .NET with the Facebook C# SDK. Security: Has anyone exposed data endpoints that can be accessed in an AJAX-mechanism from a FB app? If so, how did you protect them? Seems like it would be simpler to access the data when doing a full postback in terms of security, but even there I'm not entirely sure about the security implications. I'm used to doing things with forms authentication so I'm pretty unsure of how to secure data in the FB context. Obviously not having passwords is nice but I still thought this was a worthwhile topic. Thanks... -Ben
