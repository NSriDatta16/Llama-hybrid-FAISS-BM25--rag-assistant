The solution to this problem was to create target directories in /var/www/html called foo and bar. Authentication was then setup for the directories in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directories as below: AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthType Basic AuthName "Bar Extranet" AuthLDAPURL ldap://myldapserver.mydomain.com:3268/DC=mydomain,DC=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=*) AuthzLDAPAuthoritative on AuthLDAPBindDN "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com" AuthLDAPBindPassword "mypassword" AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN on require ldap-group CN=Bar Kiosk,OU=mycompany Groups,DC=mydomain,DC=com Allow from 192.168.1 Allow from 10.254.0 Satisfy any The target directory of the rewrites was set to accept authentication from either foo or bar as below: AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthType Basic AuthName "mycompany Extranet" AuthLDAPURL ldap://myldaphost.mydomain.com:3268/DC=mydomain,DC=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=*) AuthzLDAPAuthoritative on AuthLDAPBindDN "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com" AuthLDAPBindPassword "mypassword" AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN on require ldap-group CN=Domain Users,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com require ldap-group CN=BAR Kiosk,OU=mycompany Groups,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com Allow from 192.168.1 Allow from 10.254.0 satisfy any Although this allows both foo and bar to access the target directory, it is sufficient for my needs, as the target directory is obfuscated by the URL rewrite code. I also changed the code in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file for the URL rewrites to prevent loops: RewriteEngine on RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^(.*)tenant_filter=1$ [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^(.*)tenant_filter=2$ RewriteRule ^foo/(.*)$ some/really/long/url/$1?tenant_filter=2 [L] RewriteRule ^bar/(.*)$ some/really/long/url/$1?tenant_filter=1 [L] Lastly, my situation was complicated by the fact that I am running BlueDragon 7.1 for Linux on that server. I did not mention it in my initial post, but BD was not recognizing some of the changes I was making in my Apache configs without being restarted. This greatly complicated the process.
