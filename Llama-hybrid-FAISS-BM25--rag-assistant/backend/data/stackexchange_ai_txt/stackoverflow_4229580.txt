Extracting specific text from a link or paragraph or title or alt tag and show it again on same page but different location

I'm trying to duplicate/show the text Java Bean in another part (under the image) on the same page (visit http://www.miracleflooring.ca/cork.html to see how that works). Right now I have the info title & price show when you hover over the thumbnail, when mouse out, info hides. My client asked me to show the title & price under each image (each div with class item) and I want to find a way to do that without having to re-do things manually for each item. Is there a way using css/javascript/php of doing so (I hope I'm clear on what I need to do). Java Bean $4.99 sq-ft I know some of the code seems like overkill but it was done that way and will take lots of work to change that. I have no idea on how to do this and I'm still not sure what is the best way to do it as well but any help is much appreciated! EDIT: I saw karim79 answering something that may help but not sure if that's what I need (how to implement it too) extract text from tag
