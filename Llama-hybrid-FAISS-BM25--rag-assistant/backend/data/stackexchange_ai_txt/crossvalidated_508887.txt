Bernoulli Trials with Bayesian Analysis

Can Bayesian analysis be used with multi-class problems? For example, reliability analysis is usually concerned with "failed" or "not failed" classifications. My understanding is this fits well with the intent of Bayesian analysis as it pertains to Bernoulli trials. Can this type of Bayesian analysis be extended to multi-class problems? For example, instead of failed/not-failed, can it be used for multiple states where states are defined by a gradient of numerical scores? In reading "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" (Kruschke) there is a statement that "All we require in this scenario is that the space of possibilities for each datums has just two possible values that are mutually exclusive". Does this mean Bayesian analysis is not appropriate for multi-class scenarios?
