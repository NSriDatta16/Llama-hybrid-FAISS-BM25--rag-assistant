I was doing some moving around in SVN, and copying files back and forth. Now I can't use it

I deleted files in my SVN, and dragged new files into it over WINSCP. Now, I try to add all the files and commit, but it won't let me. $ svn add * svn: '.' is not a working copy svn: Can't open file '.svn/entries': No such file or directory
