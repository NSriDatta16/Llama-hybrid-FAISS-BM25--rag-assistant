Dimension Reduction using PCA and Random Forests

I an using scikit-learn as a toolset. I have 1K features as candidates and am trying to reduce the feature set as I believe the majority is noise (but am not sure). I wanted to somehow automate this using PCA and Random Forests. My end result would be a designated feature set. Any suggestions? I know random forests provides feature_importances that can be matched to feature_names. I know PCA can looks at features in terms of percentile that account for varience. Before I dive in the shark tank, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Chris
