Write Java Method Signature with Annotated paramaters with JDT

I am writing an eclipse plug-in which generates code. I am leveraging eclipse jdt to gen out classes, fields, and methods. One of the requirements I have is to generate methods with annotated paramaters... public returnType foo(@someAnnotation int id) { ..... ..... } Does anybody know how to write out the @someAnnotation using JDT? To write out normal parameters in JDT you could do something like the following Signature.createTypeSignature("int", false)
