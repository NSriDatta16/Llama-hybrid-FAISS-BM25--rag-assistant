For VB.NET code you'll miss 2 metrics on source code comment and source code cyclomatic complexity (but you still have CC computed from IL code). See all feature of NDepend here http://www.ndepend.com/Features.aspx : - Code Query and Rule over LINQ (CQLinq) - Compare Builds - 82 code metrics - Manage Complexity and Dependencies - Detect Dependency Cycles - Harness Test Coverage Data - Enforce Immutability and Purity - Warnings about the health of your Build Process - Generate custom report from your Build Process - Diagrams - Facilities to cope with real-world environment
