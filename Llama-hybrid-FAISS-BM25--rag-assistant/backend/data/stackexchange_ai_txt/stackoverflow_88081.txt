I tried Dragon a couple of years ago and it was a nightmare of mish-mashed words and phrases - not recommended. I understand that it was the best thing going at that point in time so I'm not optimistic. As a fellow sufferer, recommendations would be: Find a job that demands as little OT as possible Try a variety of keyboards. In my experience, working on a laptop full-time worked best. Start a program of low-moderate stress weight lifting.
