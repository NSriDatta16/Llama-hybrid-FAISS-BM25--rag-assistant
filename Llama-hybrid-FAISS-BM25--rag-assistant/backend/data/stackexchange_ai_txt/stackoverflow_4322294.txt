Writing on SDCard Problem - Android

I'm trying to write a file to my SDcard in my HTC Hero phone. I create the File in my SDCard using: File = new File(path.getAbsolutePath(), "Filename.txt"); where path is the path to my externalStorageDirectory (i.e. \sdcard) When I log the path of this file, it does say \sdcard\filename.txt However, when I create a fileoutputstream to write to the file, suddenly the filepath is changed to \data\data and I cannot access it. Can someone please help clarify how I can create a File in the SDCard and then write to it? Thanks! Edit: path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); Log.d("SDCARDPLSWORK", path.toString()); try { myFile = new File(path.getAbsolutePath(), "SensorValues.txt"); boolean i = myFile.createNewFile(); Log.d("SDCARDPLSWORK", myFile.toString() + " " + i); fos = new FileOutputStream(myFile); Log.d("FILEANDROID", getFileStreamPath("SensorValues.txt").toString()); } catch(FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } This is what I'm doing. The part until SDCARDPLSWORK is correct, but when it comes to the FILEANDROID log it goes to the private data storage.
