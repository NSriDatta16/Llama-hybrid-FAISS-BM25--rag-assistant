Is there are standard way to store a database schema outside a python app

I am working on a small database application in Python (currently targeting 2.5 and 2.6) using sqlite3. It would be helpful to be able to provide a series of functions that could setup the database and validate that it matches the current schema. Before I reinvent the wheel, I thought I'd look around for libraries that would provide something similar. I'd love to have something akin to RoR's migrations. xml2ddl doesn't appear to be meant as a library (although it could be used that way), and more importantly doesn't support sqlite3. I'm also worried about the need to move to Python 3 one day given the lack of recent attention to xml2ddl. Are there other tools around that people are using to handle this?
