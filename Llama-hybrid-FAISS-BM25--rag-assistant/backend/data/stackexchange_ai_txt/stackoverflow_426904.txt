I have to agree with your view - if it's more efficient to write and elegant then what's a few milliseconds. Writing extra code gives more room for bugs to creep in and it's extra code that needs to be tested and most of all it's extra code to maintain. Think about the guy who's going to come in behind you and maintain your code - they'll thank you for writing elegant easy to read code long before they thank you for writing code that's a few ms faster! Beware though, this cost of a few ms could be significant when you take the bigger picture into account. If that few milliseconds is part of a loop of thousands of repetitions, then the milliseconds add up fast.
