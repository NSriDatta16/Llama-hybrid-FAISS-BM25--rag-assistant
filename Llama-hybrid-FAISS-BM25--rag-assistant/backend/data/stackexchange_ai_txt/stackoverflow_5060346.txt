Howto automatically add a specific value from current route to all generated links?

I have site culture in URLs like this: routes.MapRoute( "Default", "{language}/{controller}/{action}/{id}", languageDefaults, languageConstraints) And it works like a charm with a little help from custom MvcHttpHandler that sets current thread's UI culture on every request based on route value. My problem is how do I automatically add the language route value from current request to all outgoing links? E.g. when page /EN/Foo/Bar is requested, I would like this To automatically generate the same result as this: And of course the same for all other helpers like BeginForm() etc. In my current code base there are already > 1000 occasions where these helpers are used, and requiring .AddRouteValue every time is very fragile as some developer will forget to use it with 100 % certainty. I hope the only solution is not creating custom Html helpers for everything?
