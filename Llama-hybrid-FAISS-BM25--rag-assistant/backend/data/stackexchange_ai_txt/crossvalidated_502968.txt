$p$ -value hacking I’ve learned that the headline-grabbing cases of misconduct and fraud are mere distractions. The state of our science is strong, but it’s plagued by a universal problem: Science is hard — really f**ing hard.

I could pontificate about all the reasons why science is arduous, but instead I’m going to let you experience one of them for yourself. Welcome to the wild world of $p$ -hacking .

The $p$ -value is that "due to random chance" footnote that you are looking for. By hacking it, you can get your results published.
