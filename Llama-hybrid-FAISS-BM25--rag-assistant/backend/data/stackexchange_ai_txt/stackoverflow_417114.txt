Short answer: I don't think there is a working cross-browser example that meets your requirements. The CSS3 specification includes a font-stretch property, but sadly enough, CSS3 is barely (if at all) supported at this time. Some possible ways that could emulate this behaviour that I can think of: Use a flash-based approach like sIFR Use a javascript / canvas based approach like Typeface.js . There's a font-stretch example included on the example page Use condensed fonts (icky-approach, since this means you are relying on the font being available for the client), like Arial Narrow. Use a server-side script that generates an image from text parameters In short, there is no simple and elegant solution to this problem because text and image manipulation is generally something you'd do in a graphics editor . If this is not possible, I'd definately recommend looking into Typeface and sIFR .
