You could make it a kind of Monte Carlo simulation. Start with a wide random "acceptable range" and generate a few truly random values. Check your statistics and see if the average and variance are off. Adjust the "acceptable range" for the random values and add a few more values. Repeat until you have hit both your requirements and your population sample size. Just off the top of my head, let me know what you think. :-)
