How can I use variable length inputs to train a regression model?

I'm working predicting a value $y \in \mathbb{R}$ from the value of $x_{n+1}$, where $n$ is the number of samples ($x_{i \in [1,n]}$) used for training. Each training sample $x_{i}$ is a time series of variable lengths. How can I engineer features to predict $y$ while making the most of the samples available? Nota bene: I'm working with Python & Scikit-learn the length of the time series may be considered as an explanatory variable Thanks for your help :)
