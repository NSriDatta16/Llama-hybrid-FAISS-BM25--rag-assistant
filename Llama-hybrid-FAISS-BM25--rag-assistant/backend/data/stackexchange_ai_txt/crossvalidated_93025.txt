Silhouette scores for different distance metrics

I clustered a data set using PAM with a euclidean distance metric and a pearson correlation distance metric. The average silhouette value of the correlation clusters is higher at most points than the euclidean one, but their maximas are at the same number of clusters, and peaks occur at similar cluster numbers. Is there any way to compare the two on the same scale?
