Point not in Rect but CGRectContainsPoint says yes

If I have a UIImageView and want to know if a user has tapped the image. In touchesBegan, I do the following but always end up in the first conditional. The window is in portrait mode and the image is at the bottom. I can tap in the upper right of the window and still go into the first condition, which seems very incorrect. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint(myimage.frame, location) == 0){ //always end up here } else { //user didn't tap inside image} and the values are: location: x=303,y=102 frame: origin=(x=210,y=394) size=(width=90, height=15) Any suggestions?
