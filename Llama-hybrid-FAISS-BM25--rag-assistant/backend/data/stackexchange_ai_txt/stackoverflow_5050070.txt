Exclusive CSS for iPhone/Android

I'm making a mobile-friendly stylesheet for a page of mine. Is there a simple way to make it show that stylesheet to iPhone/Android users? Or do I have to pull the user-agents and figure it out that way - and how do I do that? Also - any tools to make this sort of web dev easier?
