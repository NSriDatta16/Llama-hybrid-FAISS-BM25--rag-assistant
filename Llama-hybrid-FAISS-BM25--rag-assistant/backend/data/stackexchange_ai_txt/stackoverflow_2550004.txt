SHA-256 and SHA-512 are safe for the foreseeable future. They belong to the SHA-2 family, against which no attacks have been identified so far. This wikipedia page says that Unix and Linux vendors are just now moving to SHA-2 for their secure hashing of passwords. The SHA-3 family, with even stronger algorithms, is being developed, but won't be ready until 2012 at the least. P.S: Unless you're hiding secret agent names from governments, you'll be safe with SHA-1 as well, but if it's no trouble implementing SHA-2, just use that one instead.
