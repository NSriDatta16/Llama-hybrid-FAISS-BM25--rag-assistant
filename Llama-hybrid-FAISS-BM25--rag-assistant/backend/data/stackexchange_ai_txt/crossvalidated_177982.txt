Keeping a record of which key is pressed would greatly increase the amount of information and probably the predictive power of your model. Assuming that you do not intend to record which key is being pressed and only use elapsed time between keystrokes, a simple method you can follow is performing a series of two-sample tests where user A is compared to all reference users in your database. For example, you can construct the ecdf (empirical cumulative distribution function) of time intervals for user A and compare against all ecdf's from your database using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This test produces a p-value for each comparison. It would be wise to carry out multiple tests per pair-comparison using re-sampling techniques. For example, build 1000 ecdfs by randomly choosing a subset of the available data. This way, a distribution of p-values can be obtained for each candidate pairing. The pairing that gives a p-value distribution well-approximating the uniform distribution is the one supporting your null hypothesis i.e. keystrokes being compared come from the same individual. However, I again stress that having additional information such as which keystroke is being pressed will open up much greater possibilities for user identification, through employing machine learning techniques while employing cross-validation etc.
