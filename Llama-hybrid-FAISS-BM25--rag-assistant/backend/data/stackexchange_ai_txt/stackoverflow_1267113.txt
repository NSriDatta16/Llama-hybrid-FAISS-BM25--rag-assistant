Be sure to declare CGPoint startPoint in your classes .h file, and then update the value within your touchesBegan implementation with: startPoint = CGPointMake(point1.x, point1.y); As specified by Kailoa above. Then, in your touchesMoved implementation, you can do a check to see if the new point is more than 30 degrees separation, and if so, update startPoint. If the above isn't what you are looking for, please post more details/example code.
