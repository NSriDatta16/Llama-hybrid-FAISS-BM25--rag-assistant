If you plan to use a linear classifier (as logistic regression), you will get a score of belonging to each possible category (won/lost). In Python, you can use sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict_proba from scikit-learn (Python). This is a nice example of how to visualize the probability of belonging to each class: In R, you can use predict() from glm .
