iOS - Making sense of velocityInView on UIPanGesture

I'm using a UIPanGesture to return velocityInView and from what I gather it's supposed to be returning points per second. What I am getting is numbers in the hundreds of millions and a lot of zeros... I'm not moving my mouse that quickly in the simulator. I think... Thanks in advance for any help/advice you have. Edit: Requested Code. Displaying / Calling -(void)handlePanGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *) recognizer { if (recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged || recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) { CGPoint vel = [recognizer velocityInView:myScrollView]; //[self doSpinAnimationWithVelocity:vel.x]; NSLog([NSString stringWithFormat:@"Velocity - X-Axis - %d ", vel.x]); NSLog([NSString stringWithFormat:@"Velocity - Y-Axis - %d ", vel.y]); } } Image here of output since I'm still below 10 rep
