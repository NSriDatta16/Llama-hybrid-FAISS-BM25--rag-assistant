From a ML perspective I see two possible approaches: outlier detection You can use a clustering algorithm like t-sne to visualize your data, and identify possible outliers. You can use this to understand the data, what outliers exist, and why. As @spectre suggested, you may want to bring this information to a subject matter expert. this can also be where things end. You can simply say "throw out data if it's too much of an outlier" based on k-means output, for instance. supervised classification Once you have a solid profile of what is an issue and why, you can manually flag data that is problematic. You can then train a classification model like xgboost, for instance, to learn from what you classified as problematic, and predict if new entries are problematic.
