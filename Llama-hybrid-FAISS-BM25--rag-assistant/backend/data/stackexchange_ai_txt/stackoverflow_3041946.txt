How to integer-divide round negative numbers *down*?

Seems like whenever I divide a negative int by a positive int, I need it to round down (toward -inf), not toward 0. But both C# and C++ round toward 0. So I guess I need a DivideDownward() method. I can write it in a few lines with a test for negative and so on, but my ideas seem klugey. So I'm wondering if I'm missing something and if you have an "elegant" way to round negative division downward.
