It really depends on your data, and how you intend to use it. At one of my previous positions, we used Postgres due to the native geo-location and timezone extensions which existed because it allowed us to manage our data using polygonal datatypes. For us, we needed to do that, and we also wanted to use stored procedures, views and the like. Now, another place I worked at used MySQL simply because the data was normalized, standard row by row data. SQL Server, for a long time, had a 4gb database limit (see SQL Server 2000), but despite that limitation it remains a very stable platform for small to medium applications for which the old data is purged. Now, from working with Oracle and SQL Server 05/08, all I can tell you is that if you want the creme of the crop for stability, scalability and flexibility, then these two are your best bet. For enterprise applications, I strongly recommend them (merely because that's what we use where I work now). Other things to consider: Language integration (ASP.NET session storage, role management, etc.) Query types (Select, Update, Delete) [Although this is more of a schema design issue, not a DBMS issue) Data storage requirements
