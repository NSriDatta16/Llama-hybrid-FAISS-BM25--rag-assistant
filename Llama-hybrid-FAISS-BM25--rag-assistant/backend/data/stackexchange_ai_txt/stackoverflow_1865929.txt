Back button filter not working

I have configured a filter to disable my browser back button and show the user as session expired. It is working as expected when I configure that in my application prototype but when I incorporated it to my (spring MVC) application it is not working. I have configured my filter like this backButtonFilter com.filters.BackButtonFilter backButtonFilter /* and I had my filter contents like this response.setHeader("cache-control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); response.setHeader("pragma", "no-cache"); response.setDateHeader("expires", 0); response.setHeader("Cache-Type", "private"); I have introduced the log statement to see if my filter is getting executed or not. I can see it executing. Why is it happening so?
