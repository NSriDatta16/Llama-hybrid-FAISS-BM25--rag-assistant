When one wants to do meta-analysis as opposed to fully prospective research, I view Bayesian methods as allowing one to get more accurate meta-analysis. For example, Bayesian biostatistician David Spiegelhalter showed years ago that the most commonly used method for meta-analysis, the DerSimonian and Laird method, is overconfident. See http://www.citeulike.org/user/harrelfe/article/13264878 for details. Related to earlier posts when the number of studies is limited I prefer to think of this as Bayesian updating, which allows the posterior distribution from previous studies to be any shape and does not require the assumption of exchangeability. It just requires the assumption of applicability.
