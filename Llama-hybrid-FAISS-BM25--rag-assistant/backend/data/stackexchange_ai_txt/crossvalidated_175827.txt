Ordered response with nominal predictors

I have a data set with ordered response variables (ten levels) and nominal independent variables (sex, year of birth, educational background etc. of the participants in a questionnaire). How do I test the effect of the nominal predictors on each of the ordered responses? I tried a ordinal logistic regression ( polr{MASS} ), following this example here , but ran into some trouble with R ( Error: initial value in 'vmmin' is not finite ). Is this method even valid, or should I try another one? I believe that my data set is a fairly common result of a survey, yet I have trouble to find any hints on how to analyse it.
