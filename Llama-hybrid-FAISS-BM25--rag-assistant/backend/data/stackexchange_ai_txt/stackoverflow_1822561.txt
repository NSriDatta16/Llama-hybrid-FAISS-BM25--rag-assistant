The developers of CodeIgniter, EllisLabs, have set up the framework in this way for ease of use. It means that people wishing to try out the framework don't have to fiddle with any permissions settings on their server. Of course on a production server, you are absolutely right, putting your PHP files in the public HTML folder is not a good idea. A better way to organise your folders would be: root code_igniter application_folder config controllers models ... system_folder public_html css js images index.php .htaccess The only other change to be made here would be to change line 26 of index.php to read: $system_folder = "../../code_igniter/system-folder";
