Magento Google Analytics Code is not showing

I am new to magento and I have placed my account number in my system > Configuration > Sales > Google API. I have also enabled Google Analytics. But still I can't see the Google Analytics code on any of my magento application. What I have double checked are: Account Number are proper (These are for the same domain name for which we are trying). Google Analytics is Enabled (Yes).
