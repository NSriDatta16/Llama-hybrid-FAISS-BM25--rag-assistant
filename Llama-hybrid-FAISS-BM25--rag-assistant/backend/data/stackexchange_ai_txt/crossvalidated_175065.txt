Up until your last paragraph I'm totally with you. You are totally correct in saying the reason that the probability the first head is odd is $2/3$ is because the first toss is odd. There is a 50% chance that not a single even toss will occur! I think your intuition might be aided by studying another question. Q: If the first toss is tails, what is the probability that the first heads toss will be an even toss? A: $2/3$ Intuitively this should make a lot of sense. Since the first one missed, now even has the advantage, we're in the same situation we were in a second ago, but now even even has switched places with odd. How about the math? Let's let $O$ be the event that the first head is odds, $E$ for even, and $T$ be the event that the first toss is tails. What we know is $$P(T) = 1/2, P(O)=2/3, P(E)=1/3$$ We can pretty easily show that $P(O, T) = P(O)-P(T')=1/6$, and that $P(E, T) = P(E) = 1/3$. Dividing both by $P(T)=1/2$ we end up with $$P(E|T) = 2/3, P(O|T)=1/3 .$$ One last bit of intuition: Suppose we're playing a game where we're taking turns trying to make a certain basketball shot. Whoever makes the shot first wins. If the probability of successfully making the shot is very high, the player who goes first has a huge advantage. The harder the shot is to make the less of an advantage the first player has. The example we just talked about is the example where there is a 50% chance of making the shot.
