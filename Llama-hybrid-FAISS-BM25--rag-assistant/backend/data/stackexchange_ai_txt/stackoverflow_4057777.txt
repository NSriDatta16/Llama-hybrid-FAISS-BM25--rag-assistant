PHP Can't find save handler memcache

I'm busting my brains over this issue (it should be straightforward), but can't seem to find a solution so hopefully one of you can help me. I'm trying to store sessions using php's memcache extension. I'm running MAMP and have installed the extension correctly (I think...it shows up when I do phpinfo), am running the daemon and can connect to it through php, using something like this: $memcache = new Memcache; $memcache->connect('localhost', 11211) or die ("Could not connect"); So I KNOW that php can communicate with the daemon. The problem is when I enable memcache session storage in php.ini and try to do a session_start() it gives me an error that it "Cannot find save handler memcache". This is what is in my php.ini: session.save_handler = memcache session.save_path = "tcp://127.0.0.1:11211" Any help would be much appreciated =( Some additional info: Installed using the directions here: http://lullabot.com/articles/setup-memcached-mamp-sandbox-environment on OSX 1.6.4 and i put the .so file in the proper directory
