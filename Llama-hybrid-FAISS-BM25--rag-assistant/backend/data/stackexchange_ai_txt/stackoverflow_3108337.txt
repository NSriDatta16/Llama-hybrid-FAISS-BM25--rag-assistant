Multi user - Drag&Drop

I have a tree ful with data that are draggable (& droppable). It all works fine, but there's one problem. When more users're working on this module (with tree) and they're dragging objects around, all get mixed up. So I'm working on a solution, but I got as far as table lock in mysql. But if I do that, just one user can work on this module and that is no acceptable. Got any ideas?
