I don't know if this is the cause of your problem, but compare functions in Java usually return negative or positive or 0, not necessarily 1 or -1. I am willing to bet that you are somehow getting a nonzero value from compareToIgnoreCase, but because it's not 1 or -1 you fall through, and end up returning 0 even though the arrays are identical in length and not content. Try checking against >0 and Also, you can organize this code better. For example, do one comparison, save the results, then switch on the results. This way you may be doing two expensive compares for nothing.
