Should I use ANOVA or paired t-test?

For my statistical analysis, I want to find out: If there is a statistical significant difference in PM2.5 levels in 2019 and in 2020**. If there is a statistical significant difference in PM10 levels in 2019 and in 2020**. If there is a statistical significant difference in NO2 levels in 2019 and in 2020**. If there is a statistical significant difference in O3 levels in 2019 and in 2020**. So as you can see, I'm not comparing the pollutants with each other â€“ there's no reason to do so in my study. I'm just comparing 2019 and 2020, using 4 different pollutants. Therefore I am confused as to whether I should use an ANOVA (would it not just end up comparing NO2 against O3, PM10, PM2.5 and vice versa?) or if I should do four paired t-tests ? (I'm aware their are issues with doing time series, about things being autocorrelated and all that, but for the sake of this analysis I don't need to get into deep complexity. I'm just doing a simple analysis!) ** It's not for the entire year, just for Jan, Feb, March, April but I don't need to break it up by month, I can just compare 2019 to 2020.If there is an easy way to to break it down by month, please do mention, but it's not necessary!
