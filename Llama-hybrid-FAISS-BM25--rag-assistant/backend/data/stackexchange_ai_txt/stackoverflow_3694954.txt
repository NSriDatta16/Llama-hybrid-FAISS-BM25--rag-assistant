The FirstOrDefault and SingleOrDefault operators solve your problem. A similar problem I've encountered is when a collection contains a collection; a nested list. In that case I often use the null coalescing operator to allow a single line retrieval through the nested list. The most trivial case looks like this: var nestedList = new List >(); int? first = (nestedList.FirstOrDefault() ?? new List ).FirstOrDefault(); So if the outer list is empty, a new empty list is returned which simply allows the final FirstOrDefault to return a null .
