So, Clustering is "Unsupervised" learning : You make groups in which elements look like each-other. In Unsupervised learning, you don't have a Label that you look for. Here, your problem is to Classify text between 3 categories : Sports, Foreign, Local. Those 3 categories ARE labels : You know you have news about those 3 subjects, and want to make a model that learns characteristics of those 3 categories to automatically assign a label to a new unknown article : This is called Classification, which is Supervised learning. Since you have more than 2 labels (classification is usually Yes or No), you're in a "Multi Label Text Classification Problem". If you're starting in Data Science, that's a really tough subject, far from easy.
