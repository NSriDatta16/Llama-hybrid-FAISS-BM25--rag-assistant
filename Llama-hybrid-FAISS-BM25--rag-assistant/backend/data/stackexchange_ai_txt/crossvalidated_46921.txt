How to combine results of logistic regression and random forest?

I am new to machine learning. I applied logistic regression and random forest on a same dataset. So I get variable importance (absolute coefficient for logistic regression and variable importance for random forest). I am thinking to combine the two to get a final variable importance. Can anyone share his/her experience? I've checked bagging, boosting, ensemble modeling, but they are not what I need. They are more of combining information for the same model across replicates. What I am looking for is to combine result of multiple models.
