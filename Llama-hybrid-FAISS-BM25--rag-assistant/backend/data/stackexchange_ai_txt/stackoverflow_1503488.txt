I'd suggest adding Anonymous to the ACL of the database, with No access and nothing but Read public documents checked. Then, you can grant access to the agent by checking Allow Public Access users to view and run this agent in the Agent properties. I don't know if it is possible to get the Authorization header into the agent to check the authentication. If there are only two parties communicating I would compute a hash of the message, a timestamp and a shared secret and use that to check access. Edit You won't be able to parse the Authorization header manually. Domino (at least 7.0.3) tries to do a session authentication if your request contains an authorization header, regardless of access settings on the object you request.
