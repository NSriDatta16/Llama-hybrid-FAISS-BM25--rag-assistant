There are basically two ways of approaching the fact that animals within a cage are likely to be more similar than animals in general. If you have a small number of cages then you can just add another fixed factor for cages. It will be of very limited scientific interest but it will account for the correlation with cages. You can also add its interaction with your treatment variable to see if the treatment effect varies between cages. Alternatively as @WeiwenNg suggests in a comment you can fit cage as a random intercept. This would certainly be preferable if there are many cages. Again you could also have a random (slope) effect for treatment if you think the treatment effect may also vary. Providing code advice is strictly speaking off-topic here bu, as you yourself suggest in a comment, the ordinal package has a wide range of facilities (I have never used MCMCglmm).
