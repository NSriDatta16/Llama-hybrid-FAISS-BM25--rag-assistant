Yes, crossvalidation is the way to go. Use 40 folds (leave-one-out) when you have a small sample size. That you get different non-zero coefficients is fairly normal. LASSO should not be seen as a tool to reliably identify which coefficients "should" be in the model: there will typically be a correlated pair of covariates, and then it doesn't matter so much which of the two goes into the model, and the choice is random. LASSO is primarily a tool for making a pragmatic prediction model that is "economic" in the sense that you can use it while collecting only a subset of the covariates that were used in the model fit.
