Given n ordered sets, each containing 6 numbers, generate the next set in the sequence

I am facing the following problem in machine learning. Given n ordered sets, each containing 6 numbers, generate the next set in the sequence. The numbers in a set are not random. For instance, it could be that these numbers are generated by an equation, e.g. $(1+x^y)$ so that the form the following sequence: [{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 5, 10, 17, 26}, {1, 2, 9, 28, 65, 126}, ..., {1, 2, 1 + 2**n, 1 + 3**n, 1 + 4**n, 1 + 5**n}] But this equation or any other rule governing the order is not known. We are given a large n of these sets. What would be the most appropriate way to predict this in Keras?
