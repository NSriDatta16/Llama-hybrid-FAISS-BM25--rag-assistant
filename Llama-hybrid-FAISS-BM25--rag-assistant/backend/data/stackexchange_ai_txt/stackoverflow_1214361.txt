I think you are confusing testing use cases and unit testing. Test cases should try to be at the method level or at most at the class level. In this case, you should attempt to have as best of coverage as allowable in your budget/time constraints and you should write them before/while writing your code. I think developers should also try to run through the actual use cases and automate them with something like selenium to make sure that the product is solid but ultimately after a reasonable amount of this type of testing, it should be delivered to QA.
