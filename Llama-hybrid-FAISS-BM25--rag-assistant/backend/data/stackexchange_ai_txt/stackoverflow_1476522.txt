To add to ghommey's response: we're also using Piwik right now and it fits the bill for our purposes. Separating IP ranges isn't really a concern for us as we use separate development and deployment servers. As for customizing it, I've written a couple of Piwik plugins, one of which served to enable SSO for our (non-PHP) project. Writing the code itself has been relatively straightforward; however their authentication cookies violate the HTTP cookie RFCs (RFC2109 and RFC2068) in that they use illegal characters so there might be also other dragons in places.
