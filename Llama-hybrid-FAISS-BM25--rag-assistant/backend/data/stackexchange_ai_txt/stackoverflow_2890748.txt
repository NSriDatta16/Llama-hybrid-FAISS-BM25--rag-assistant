I cannot find how to copy an iterator. Closest is itertools.tee , but simply making a list of it, as @J.F.Sebastian suggests, is best here, as itertools.tee's docs explain: This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on how much temporary data needs to be stored). In general, if one iterator uses most or all of the data before another iterator starts, it is faster to use list() instead of tee() .
