Compare stationary time series

I need some hints for the following task: I got two time series from different weather sensors which contain daily rain data values. One of the sensors is a professional one and my job was to build a low-cost sensor and compare the results with the professional one, which is supposed to be very accurate. When facing a nonstationary time series the normal procedure would be to decompose it and derive a model out of it. As rain being not really time dependent in non tropical areas i would guess that rain data is already stationary. How would I proceed then? I was thinking about something like this: Proving stationarity of the time series Eliminate outliers Correlation (Pearson) of both time series I'm really new to statistics so this might be a really noobish approach.
