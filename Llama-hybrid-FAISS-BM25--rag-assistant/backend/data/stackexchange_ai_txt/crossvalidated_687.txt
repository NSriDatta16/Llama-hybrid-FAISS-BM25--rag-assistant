Statistics is about inferring something about a population, and that requires some level of interpretation. More intuitively, "is the glass half full or half empty?". They both mean the same thing, but may have a different effect on the person who hears it. So I would say it's the interpretation aspect which is the problem P.S. There's an interesting article on the BBC website which may be worth a read. P.P.S. If you meant this more generally, then there could be a case for saying that the frequentest approach to statistics can give a different result to the Bayesian approach.
