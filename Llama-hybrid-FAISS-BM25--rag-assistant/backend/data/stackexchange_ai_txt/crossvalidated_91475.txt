Same or different? The Bayesian way

Say I have the following model: $$\text{Poisson}(\lambda) \sim \begin{cases} \lambda_1 & \text{if } t \lt \tau \\ \lambda_2 & \text{if } t \geq \tau \end{cases} $$ And I infer the posteriors for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ shown below from my data. Is there a Bayesian way of telling (or quantifying) if $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the same or different ? Perhaps measuring the probability that $\lambda_1$ is different from $\lambda_2$ ? Or perhaps using KL divergences? For example, how can I measure $p(\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1)$, or at least, $p(\lambda_2 \gt \lambda_1)$? In general, once you have the posteriors shown below (assume non-zero PDF values everywhere for both), what is a good way of answering this question? Update It seems that this question can be answered in two ways: If we have samples of the posteriors, we could look at the fraction of the samples where $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$ (or equivalently $\lambda_2 > \lambda_1$). @Cam.Davidson.Pilon included an answer that would address this problem using such samples. Integrating some sort of difference of the posteriors. And that's an important part of my question. What would that integration look like? Presumably the sampling approach would approximate this integral, but I would like to know the formulation of this integral. Note: The plots above come from this material .
