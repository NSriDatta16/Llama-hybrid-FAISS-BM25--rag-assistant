Brian Phillips's answer does not go quite far enough, in my experience. You don't know what the current directory is when your tests are run by PHPUnit. So you need to reference the absolute path of the test class file in your set_include_path() expression. Like this: set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . dirname(__FILE__) . "/../src"); This fragment can be placed in its own header file SetupIncludePath.php and included in test files with a 'require_once', so that test suites don't append the path multiple times.
