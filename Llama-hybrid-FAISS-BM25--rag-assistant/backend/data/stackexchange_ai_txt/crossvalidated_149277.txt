Random forest and model predictions

I have a working random forest model (classification tree) in R that I made with a training dataset. I used the predict function with a verification dataset: > predict(RF_model, Verif_samp) The predicted values this produces must have been put into some kind of formula made by the random forest model? I'm wondering how to see what happened here - I would like to know if there is any kind of overall model or formula that a random forest creates (used by predict), and if so, how it would be viewed in R.
