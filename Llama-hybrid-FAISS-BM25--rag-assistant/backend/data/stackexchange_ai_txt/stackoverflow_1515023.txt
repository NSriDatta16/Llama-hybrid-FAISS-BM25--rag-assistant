function call with actual code

what I'm trying to do is take this function call... assign_sum_to_pixel(&current_pixel, sum); and replace it with the actual code that it calls which is this... /* * assign_ sum_ to_ pixel - Computes averaged pixel value in current_pixel */ static void assign_ sum_ to_ pixel (pixel *current_ pixel, pixel_ sum sum) { current_ pixel->red = (unsigned short) (sum.red/sum.num); current_ pixel->green = (unsigned short) (sum.green/sum.num); current_ pixel->blue = (unsigned short) (sum.blue/sum.num); return; } What I came up with was this... /* * mysmooth1 - my smooth1 */ char mysmooth1_descr[] = "my smooth1: My smooth1"; void mysmooth1(int dim, pixel *src, pixel *dst) { int i, j; int ii, jj; pixel_ sum sum; pixel current_ pixel; for (i = 0; i red = (unsigned short) (sum.red/sum.num); current_ pixel->green = (unsigned short) (sum.green/sum.num); current_ pixel->blue = (unsigned short) (sum.blue/sum.num);*** ***(These three lines above are the lines I inserted which is where the function call use to be)*** dst[RIDX(i, j, dim)] = return; } } } but...for some reason when I run the code it fails to work giving me this error kernels.c:456: error: invalid type argument of â->â kernels.c:457: error: invalid type argument of â->â kernels.c:458: error: invalid type argument of â->â kernels.c:459: warning: statement with no effect which is right where I added the new code ... current_ pixel->red = (unsigned short) (sum.red/sum.num); current_ pixel->green = (unsigned short) (sum.green/sum.num); current_ pixel->blue = (unsigned short) (sum.blue/sum.num); can someone tell me if I'm doing something wrong... Am I missing brackets somewhere? am I not initializing my variables correctly? is return not supposed to be at the bottom equaling to dst[RIDX(i, j, dim)] any help, comments, suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.
