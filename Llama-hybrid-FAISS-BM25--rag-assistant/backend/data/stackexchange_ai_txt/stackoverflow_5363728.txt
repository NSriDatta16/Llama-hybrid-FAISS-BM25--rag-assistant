Get scroll bar position of an NSScroller on the fly

The purple rectangle is an NSView . In its awakeFromNib method I call [[NSViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"nib" bundle:nil]] . The red rectangle is an NSScrollView aka @"nib" . This view includes the vertical scroll bar. The green box is an NSBox nib which is selected by NSCollectionViewItem . How would one observe and get the scroll bar knob's position on the fly when scrolling through a list (i.e. while dragging the knob)? Thanks for the help :)
