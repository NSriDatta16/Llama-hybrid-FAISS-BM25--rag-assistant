Calculating an aggregated score

I'm out of my element when dealing with statistics, so I hope you'll be able to offer me some guidance. I'm working on a project where students will apply for scholarships, and then a panel of people (reviewers) will independently evaluate each application and score a number of questions from values 1 through 5. Given this, a theoretical data set might look like: Student Reviewer Score 1 Score 2 Score 3 Score 4 Anna Mr. Jones 5 4 5 5 Anna Ms. Smith 4 4 4 5 Anna Mr. Quinn 4 3 5 4 Anna Mr. Blair 5 5 4 3 Anna Ms. Brown 4 4 3 4 Billy Mr. Jones 5 4 4 4 Billy Ms. Smith 3 4 3 3 Billy Ms. Brown 4 4 2 4 I would like to create a single value per student that fairly represents all the other scores in the data set, giving consideration to the number of reviews completed for the student. (Note that in this data set, "Anna" was reviewed five times, while "Billy" was reviewed only three times). What mathematical process should I use to create such a value??? I've considered the obvious average of all scores, but does the fact that Anna had more reviews than Billy change the statistical relevance of that simple calculation? Is there something more that should be done to account for the variation in number of reviews? Desired Outcome: Student Overall / Aggregate Score Anna ??? Billy ???
