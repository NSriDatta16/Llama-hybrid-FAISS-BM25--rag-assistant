The role of the bias terms in matrix factorization formulas?

I'm reading about matrix factorization for recommender systems . A basic matrix factorization model would be something like: $(p_i \times q_j ) + b_i + b_j$. That formula would compute the rating for one element in the rating matrix. Now I can see that this is very similar to a usual logistic regression formula where you multiply the feature vector with a weight vector and add a bias terms. That would give you the formula of a hyperplane. But with the matrix factorization formula you have another bias terms. So can you explain to me what it does?
