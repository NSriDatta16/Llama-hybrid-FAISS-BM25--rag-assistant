Trying to select text within a cell in a table in Internet Explorer results in rest of table being selected

I have a strange problem on a web page I'm working with. I have table with lots of information in it and when I try to select a single cell (click-drag) it selects that entire cell and the rest of the table. I have checked the code over and over again and I cannot seem to find what is causing this problem. Other tables work just fine with selecting just a single cell or even text within a cell. Double clicking the cell also works for selecting but since some of the cells have links in them that does not solve the problem. Has anyone heard of a similar problem or know how to solve this? Tables use -format and all tags are closed correctly.
