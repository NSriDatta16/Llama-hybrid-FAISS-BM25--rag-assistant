Type synonyms cannot be partially applied. In this specific case, you can write type A = ReaderT Int IO type B a = ReaderT String A a [or even better type B = ReaderT String A to use B in another monad transformer] It's general, that transformation is impossible without using newtype/data, for example: type A a = Reader a Int cannot be equivalently written as type A = ... . In some sense, this feature would be equivalent to type-level lambda \a -> Reader a Int .
