I've ran into similar issues with the Enterprise version of Magento. You might try disabling the shopping cart sidebar, if you have not already done so, that should help the site speed when browsing. We changed the sidebar so that if there was more than 25 items in it, it would not try to load the products, which helped a great deal. For the second error, if you use Firebug and Firefox as you step through the order process, you should get more error information than "undefined" which would help figure out what is going on there. You could also try bumping up the memory_limit for php.ini, we ended up setting ours to 256mb, which solved most of the memory errors for our site.
