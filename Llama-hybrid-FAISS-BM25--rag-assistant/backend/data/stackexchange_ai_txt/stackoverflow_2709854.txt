A neural network is definitely not an "advanced 'data structure'"... a neural network is an algorithm for function/statistical estimation, optimization and dynamic behavior. It's also referred to as a machine learning algorithm. "Is a neural network actually more than a data-structure ?" It does a lot more than a data structure... so from that stand point, yes, but in general it's an invalid comparison. It actually allows your computer to "learn" how to correlate certain patterns of input with certain patterns of output.
