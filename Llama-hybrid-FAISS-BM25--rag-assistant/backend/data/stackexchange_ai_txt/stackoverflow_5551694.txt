In short - odbc_connect() takes; an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN), Username & Password as per -- http://php.net/manual/en/function.odbc-connect.php As far as I am aware there is no VFP ODBC driver for Linux so you will, most likely, need to employ an ODBC Bridge solution like - http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-odbc-mt/ This has a client/server architecture -- Linux client -- php ODBC Application OpenLink Generic ODBC Driver (thin multi-tier ODBC client) Windows server -- OpenLink Request Broker (Multi-tier server) OpenLInk Agent for ODBC (Multi-tier server) Fox Pro ODBC DSN (pre configured) Fox Pro files... I hope this helps?
