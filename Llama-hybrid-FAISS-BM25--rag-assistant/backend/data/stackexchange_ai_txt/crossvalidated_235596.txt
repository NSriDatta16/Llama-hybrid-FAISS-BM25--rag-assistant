1% of the global population means roughly 1% in my country?

Assuming that you hear that X affects 1% of the global population, is it safe to assume that it should affect 1% of the population of your country/city/subgroup? Given that there is nothing in the subgroup to affect the distribution of X. (Assume that the distribution of X is not mentioned, so should we assume normal/Gaussian?*) I'm asking because, often, I hear X disease is very rare, it only affects 1% of the global population, which sounds HUGE to me. *if so, you could say that your country is an outlier and it's much less that 1%, but on average, you should be correct, right?
