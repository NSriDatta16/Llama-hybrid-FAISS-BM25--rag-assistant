I don't know if the other answers have helped you understand, so I'll add a very simplistic answer that I hope will get you over the initial bump. MySQL will act as an online storage space for you, but it won't provide the website. In between MySql and the website, there will need to be a program of some sort. There are many, many different languages and frameworks available to do this, and it's essentially the entire business of web developers to create these programs. In your particular case, you asked about uploading different pages to MySql and having them displayed for each day of the week. You wouldn't need to use MySQL or a database at all for this, a few lines of code in most common languages would do this for you, and adding a database would simply add complexity where it wasn't needed.
