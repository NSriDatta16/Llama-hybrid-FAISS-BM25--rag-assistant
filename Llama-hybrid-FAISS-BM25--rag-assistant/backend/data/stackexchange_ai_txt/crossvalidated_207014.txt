Visualization of categorical data with too many categories

When dealing with data visualization, is it possible to produce a good graph from a table that has categorical data with too many levels and none of the levels have a reasonable amount of entries count? For example, in 178 lines, I have 124 unique nominal categories, wich only 3 of them have more than 5 entries in the table, and most other categories only one. Is it possible to have an elegant graph in situations like these? Are there better solutions to summarize and visualize this kind of data?
