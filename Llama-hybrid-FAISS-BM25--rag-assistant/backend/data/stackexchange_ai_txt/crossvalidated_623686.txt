Is the dot product in a neuron in a neural network normalized?

A neuron in a NN is typically defined as: $$y = f \left ( w \cdot x + b \right )$$ If I have 100 weights (such as $w = [1,1,..., 1]$ ) and 100 inputs (such as $x = [1,1,...1]$ ), is the maximum value of my dot-product, $w \cdot x$ , 100 or 1? That is, are my inputs and weights normalized?
