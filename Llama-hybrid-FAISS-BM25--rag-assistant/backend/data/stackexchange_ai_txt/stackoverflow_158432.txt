Can you provide references to these articles? I see no reason to change the tried and true methods. After all, Primary Keys are a fundamental design feature of relational databases. Using UNIQUE to serve the same purpose sounds really hackish to me. What is their rationale? Edit: My attention just got drawn back to this old answer. Perhaps the discussion that you read regarding PK vs. UNIQUE dealt with people making something a PK for the sole purpose of enforcing uniqueness on it. The answer to this is, If it IS a key, then make it key, otherwise make it UNIQUE.
