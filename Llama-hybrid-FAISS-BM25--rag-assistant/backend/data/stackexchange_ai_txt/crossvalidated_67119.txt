I think one way you can test neural networks like the Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM) is to apply them to new sets of data, or more commonly a subset of the total data set, and see how they perform. You can also test the model with cross validation. I have used a popular open source machine learning (ML) software toolkit that is simple to install and use, and it allows you to easily test many types of ML algorithms separately with a number of the model's regression statistics ( http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ ). That might give you a quick analysis without much intervention except the basics of running the program, although depending it may not be worth it if it will be difficult to format your data (although you can usually google "csv to arff convert online" for example for one-step formatting).
