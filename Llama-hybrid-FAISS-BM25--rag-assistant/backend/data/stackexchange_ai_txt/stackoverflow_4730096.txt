You should be able to get the whole URI with ECoreUtil.getURI(EObject) function, it should also include the fragment part. EObject.eResource().getURI() returns you the resource's URI where this object is located, so it will not include the Objects own unique ID there. That fragment ending hash there is EObjects XMI-ID, that can be returned using ECoreUtil.getID(EObject) if needed. But that ECoreUtil.getURI(EObject) should be just ok.
