Windows Phone 7 - How to get list of podcasts or media programmatically

For Windows Phone 7- Is it possible to list the media files (specifically podcasts) on the phone programmatically? I've looked into the mediaplayerlauncher but that uses isolated storage. I want to write a program which lists podcasts in the phone media hub in a simple manner with the newest ones listed first, any help is appreciated, thanks.
