What you want to collect (a heat map of clicks essentially) is doable, but I don't think the way you want to go about it is very feasible. Try this out. I think that using this kind of solution with frames, etc. is much more feasible than embedding a browser (this amounts to writing a browser that can be served up by some kind of java/silverlight technology, not trivial). Another idea would be that since, I assume, you have the permission of your users to track their clicks, write a greasemonkey (firefox plugin) based on the javascript in the link I provided above. You could then have all users use this plugin script combination to give you their clicks.
