How to chose optimal number of lags and inputs?

I'm using Genetic Algorithms to do inputs selection in a time series problem. The issue is that the number of possible inputs is very large (100 possible inputs + inputs' lags) and I don't know a procedure to determine the minimum number of lags to consider. My procedure was to run a correlation analysis ex ante and leave de top 70 inputs in terms of correlation with the desired output. The problem with this procedure is that, as I increase the number of possible lags in consideration, more "ridiculous" inputs (i.e lag 140) are selected...
