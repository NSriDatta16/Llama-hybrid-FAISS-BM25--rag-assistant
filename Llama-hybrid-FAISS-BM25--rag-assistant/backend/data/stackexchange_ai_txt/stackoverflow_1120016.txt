How can I combine files into one CSV file?

If I have one file FOO_1.txt that contains: FOOA FOOB FOOC FOOD ... and a lots of other files FOO_files.txt . Each of them contains: 1110000000... one line that contain 0 or 1 as the number of FOO1 values ( fooa , foob , ...) Now I want to combine them to one file FOO_RES.csv that will have the following format: FOOA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0... FOOB,1,0,0,0,0,0,0... FOOC,1,0,0,0,1,0,0... FOOD,0,0,0,0,0,0,0... ... What is the simple & elegant way to conduct that (with hash & arrays -> $hash{$key} = \@data ) ? Thanks a lot for any help ! Yohad
