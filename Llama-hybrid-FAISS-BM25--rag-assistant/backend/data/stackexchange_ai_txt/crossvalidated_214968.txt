How to predict from glm created with average values?

I want to predict count data (example: people visiting a beach) based on some predictors (example: temperature, cloudiness). I have created a generalized linear model (with Poisson distribution and logarithmic link function) using historic data. The model consists of three coefficients: intercept $\beta_0$, temperature coefficient $\beta_T$ and cloudiness coefficient $\beta_C$. For given temperature $T$ and cloudiness $C$, the predicted number of people $X$ visiting the beach is then $$ X(T,C)=\exp(\beta_0+\beta_T T+\beta_C C) $$ My question: When I use average values to calculate the model parameters (e.g. monthly mean values of $X$, $T$ and $C$), can I use the resulting parameters to predict daily values? If not, is it possible when I train on other values, e.g. $\exp$ of the average of $\ln X$ instead of the average of $X$?
