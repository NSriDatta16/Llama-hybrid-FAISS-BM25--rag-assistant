While @Gaël Laurans answer has merit, there is a more fundamental reason why this is not appropriate. For this answer I will be assuming you ran what has come to be a standard ANOVA (type 3 sums of squares, as is produced by SPSS and SAS by default). Actually, finding that interaction suggests that you certainly had enough power to detect (differing) effects of A... it is just that you did not find an equal effect of A across levels of B or levels of C. Let me explain, ANOVA is not like regression in this context, that is a main effect does not refer to the effect of the variable controlling for the interaction. Instead, your main effect reflects the size of the effect for that variable averaging over all the levels of all of your other variables. This results in your main effects being "qualified" by your interactions. That is, the main effects simply can not be interpreted directly in the context of an statistically significant interaction. It is for this reason that in an ANOVA context when there are significant interactions people tend to break down and do simple-effects analyses at each level of the variable that the term that the 'main effect' variable of interest interacts with. In your specific case the A×B and A×C could indicate that there is an effect of A, but only at certain levels of B or C and/or the direction of the effect of A varies across levels of B or C. The easiest way to tell what is the case will be to plot your data. However, as you now know this is the nuanced state of affairs, therefore talking about a global effect of A is pretty senseless.
