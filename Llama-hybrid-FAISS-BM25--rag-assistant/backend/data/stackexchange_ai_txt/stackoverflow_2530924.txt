Do you particularly need the Id of the user or the userName ?, it seems you are looking for the Guid of the present user, for this I think the retrieval of this Id depends on your implementation. If you want to retrieve information based of userName, then you can do the following: HttpContext.Current.User gives you the User object, you can get the other information from it, for your case, you need to use HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name
