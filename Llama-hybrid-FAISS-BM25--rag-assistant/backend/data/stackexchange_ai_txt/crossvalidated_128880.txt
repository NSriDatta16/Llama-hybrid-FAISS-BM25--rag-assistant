number of feature maps in convolutional neural networks

When learning convolutional neural network, I have questions regarding the following figure. 1) C1 in layer 1 has 6 feature maps, does that mean there are six convolutional kernels? Each convolutional kernel is used to generate a feature map based on input. 2) S1 in layer 2 has 6 feature maps, C2 has 16 feature maps. What is the process look like to get these 16 feature maps based on 6 feature maps in S1?
