How to extract free induction decay parameters from a plot

I'm new to Machine Learning. I have a question. Given a Free Induction Decay graph, similar to the one shown below, how can I use Machine Learning to extract features (i.e., $f$ , $f_0$ , $V_{pp}$ ) from the graph? Should I use supervised or unsupervised learning? Is this a Classification or Regression problem? Can I use the Sci-Kit Learn Python Library or should I use MATLAB? If anyone can help, that would be great.
