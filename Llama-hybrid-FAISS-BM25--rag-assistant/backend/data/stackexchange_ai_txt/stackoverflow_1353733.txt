MYSQL: How to copy an entire row from one table to another in mysql with the second table having one extra column?

I have two tables with identical structure except for one column... Table 2 has an additional column in which I would insert the CURRENT_DATE() I would like to copy all the values from table1 to table2. If I use INSERT INTO dues_storage SELECT * FROM dues WHERE id=5; it throws an error pointing to the difference in the number of columns. I have two questions: How do I get around this? How do I add the value for the additional date column (CURRENT_DATE()) in table2 within this same statement?
