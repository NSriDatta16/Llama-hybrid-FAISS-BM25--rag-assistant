How to Optimised my Regression model if my Target Variable is Right Skewed?

Recently i was working on a problem where my target variable is a continuous variable, with highly right skewed data. Please refer to image below If i want to create regression this please suggest the best approach : 1. Should i do any transformation ? 2. It has very long tail should i ignore them or how to tackle them? 3. Any modifications required in the loss function (Using SSE Right Now)? 4. What is the best evaluation metrics (Using MAPE right now)? Till Now i have removed outliers after 99.5 percentile values and with a XGBoost model i have been able to reach to 70% MAPE.
