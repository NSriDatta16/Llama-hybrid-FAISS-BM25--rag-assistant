destroy a view when back button is pressed

My navigation controller is organized this way: FirstViewController -> SecondViewController -> ThirdViewController in the First I do a search on the web and I display the result in a UITableView when I select a cell I push to the Second where I do another search based on key previously pressed and I display some information and a button for "more info" when I press the button I push to the Third view and this works fine... The problem is when I press two times the back button for doing another search: when I arrive at the third view I display every time the informations about the first search! this is because I do the display of information in loadView and this is called only the first time, right? How should I do? thank you!
