There are so many Ruby Blogs that I won't list them here. www.ruby-forum.com has lots of posts, and if you are after rails stuff www.railsforum.com is pretty active, www.pragprog.com has lot's great ruby books for sale, including Programming Ruby, widely accepted as the first book to learn Ruby with, for better or worse. RubyInside, RufyFlow are great but a good list of blogs at Ruby Learning website and if you need Ruby API docs Ruby Brain , and if you are doing Rails then Rails Brain is good too, although really I have had not rouble turning up Ruby stuff just by searching Google, but stuff should keep you going for a while.
