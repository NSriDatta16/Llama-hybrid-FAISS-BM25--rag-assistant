First, I agree with earlier answers and comments about stepwise. Second, I am not so sure that binary logistic is the best choice - it may be, it may not. Is "qualified sales opportunity" really a yes/no variable? Might some sales be larger than others? Might some opportunities fail? Perhaps others become long term? All these would argue against binary logistic regression. Classification trees are another method you might consider, especially if your N is reasonably large. In R I like the party package but other tools are also good. There are also elaborations on trees such as bagging and boosting that may work well since your goal is prediction.
