How to test if a time series becomes stationary?

I am new to time-series analysis, but I am dealing with a non-seasonal time series data now. The plot of the data looks like the following, so there might be huge variance at the beginning, and eventually it becomes stable, we believe the curve would finally become stationary as time goes by. The problem is, how could I test if it becomes stationary eventually? or could I detect a certain period that is locally stationary in the data?
