If you want to apply to Google and/ or Microsoft then I'd say that of the two you need both! Given more choice, probably C++ and one other language - either dynamic, functional, or both (Scala might be a good choice too). It's not necessarily about whether you'd use the languages themselves but more about the different approaches they require and encourage. If you continue to be "scared" by C++ you're probably going to struggle applying as a dev at either of those organisations - unless you are highly specialised elsewhere.
