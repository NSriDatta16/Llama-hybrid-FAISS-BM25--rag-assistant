Infragistics UltraWebGrid - ASP.Net - Grids position fixed and are not scrolling with page

I have two grids on a page that seem to always be position:fixed. I want them to scroll with the page when an overflow scrollbar appears on the body. The grids however ALWAYS stay in the same place and don't scroll with the rest of the page content. Is there any way to get an UltraWebGrid to be relative and scroll up the page with the rest of the page's content? This seems to work in IE6 but not in IE8. All jQuery/CSS hacks haven't been successful.
