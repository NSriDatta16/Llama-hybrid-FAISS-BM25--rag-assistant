Xcode project management: single engine - different personalized applications

The idea is that I have an application template that should be customized for different clients. The main goal is to provide a number of personalized applications with almost the same functionality. What is the best approach of Xcode project organization (and maybe management) in order to achieve the following points for each client's application: Always different images set for visual elements (for controls, views, icons etc); Rarely different XIB files for small UI structure modification; Visual customizations - code level; Small functional modifications; Possibility to switch back to previous personalized versions; One functional engine (e.g. search functionality); At the moment, for every personalization request I create in the same project's root directory new project file , and corresponding XIB files , images set and source files (for some functional requests) directories. Each project file has a reference to the main source files directory (engine). But I suppose that's not the best way to organize this type of projects.
