Extracting structured data from semi structured data

I want to use machine learning and NLP to convert semi-structured data in text files to structured data by predicting the patterns in the files and splitting the fields for example if I have a text file that looks like this : Input : 2021565267MALL1ETAGE ZARA1st FLOOR 2345561 2022565267MALL2ETAGE ZARA1st FLOOR 2345561 2022565267ANFAPLACE2ETAGECOFEESHOP2345561 20225652634ANFAPLACE2ETAGE 2345561 Desired Output : 2021565267,MALL1ETAGE ZARA1st FLOOR,2345561 2022565267,MALL2ETAGE ZARA1st FLOOR,2345561 2022565267,ANFAPLACE2ETAGECOFEESHOP,2345561 20225652634,ANFAPLACE2ETAGE,2345561 The semi-structured files are not fixed-width so we can not just add col specification in pandas like this ( it can work for the first line for example ) : col_specification =[(1, 10),.... ] One of the approaches that I found online is to make a dictionary based on the occurrences of the words in the semi-structured file will that work in this situation if so how can I implement something like that?
