Usually the output of a neuron in an Artificial Neural Network is a sigmoid function of the inputs weighted by the parameters of the neuron. So it takes other values than 0 or 1 - it takes values BETWEEN 0 and 1. But, as you can see from the sigmoid function ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function ), depending on the parameters of the neuron its output will easily fall very close to 0 or 1, as these values are the asymptotical values of the sigmoid.
