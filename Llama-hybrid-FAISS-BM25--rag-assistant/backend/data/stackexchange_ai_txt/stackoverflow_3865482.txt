Ok, I've found a way. Not sure how good this is, but it works. Instead of putting the variable into the range value, name the last cell which is interesting: $sheet -> Cells ($last_row,$last_col) -> {Name} = "LastCell"; And then use this in the range field; my $Range = $Sheet->Range("a1:LastCell"); Not the most elegant bit of coding I've every performed, but it works.
