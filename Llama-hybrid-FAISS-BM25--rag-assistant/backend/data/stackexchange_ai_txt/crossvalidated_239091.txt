In an irreducible chain all states belong to a single communicating class . Periodicity is a class property . This means that, if one of the states in an irreducible Markov Chain is aperiodic , say, then all the remaining states are also aperiodic. Since, $p_{aa}^{(1)}>0$, by the definition of periodicity, state a is aperiodic. As the given Markov Chain is irreducible, the rest of the states of the Markov Chain are also aperiodic. We can also observe that, the two-step transition probability matrix(TPM) for the given chain is given by \begin{equation*} P^{(2)}=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.5& 0.25& 0.25\\ 0.5& 0.25& 0.25\\ 0.5& 0.25& 0.25\\ \end{array}\right) \end{equation*} Note that, all the elements of $P^{(2)}$ are positive. This ensures that, $P^{(3)}>0, P^{(4)}>0$ and so on. The greatest common divisor of the times $2,3,4,\cdots$ is $1$. Hence, by the definition of periodicity, the period of every state is aperiodic.
