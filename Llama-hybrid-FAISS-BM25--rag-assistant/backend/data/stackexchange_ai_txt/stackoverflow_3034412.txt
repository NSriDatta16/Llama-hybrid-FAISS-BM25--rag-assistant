In this particular case, it'd probably be better to override nod() for your multi-headed dragons. Whether they have 1 head or 5 is a detail that really shouldn't be worried about in the base class (which should be as simple as you can reasonably make it). You don't want to have to account for every possibility that every one of your code's users (even you) will ever need at every point in time. Otherwise, you'd need to account for 2-headed dogs (which are a lot more real than even 1-headed dragons). People extending your classes and such will be developers, too; let them do the work to account for the more exotic/bizarre cases, if they need to.
