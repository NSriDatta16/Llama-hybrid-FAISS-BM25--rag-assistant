Use Local Storage as an autosave proxy - good or bad?

We are developing a web app that uses auto save as a save pattern. With that feature came some quite unexpected UI problems. In order to enhance the user understanding of the concept, we wanted to make the autosave instant, not periodic with visual feedback everytime the document is saved. We thought about using local storage as a temporary data cache, and then just set a slower interval that synchronizes all user data with the web server in the background. This might have some bad side-effects when dealing with possible revision conflict scenarios. Has anyone had any experience with autosave patterns and/or using local storage as a data proxy, and can share some valuable information
