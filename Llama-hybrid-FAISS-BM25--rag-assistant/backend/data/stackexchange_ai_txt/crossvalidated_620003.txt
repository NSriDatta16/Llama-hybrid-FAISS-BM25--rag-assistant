Do I have to study the correlation between ordinal and nominal variables together?

I have a data frame made up of categorical and ordinal variables, I want to make a multiple binary logistic regression model. The steps that I am going to carry out are: See if the variables meet the multicollinearity condition: on the one hand I see the correlation between the ordinal variables with the Spearman correlation matrix and on the other hand I see the relationship between the nominal variables with the VIF method. Do I then have to make a correlation between nominals and ordinals if I am going to put them all together in the same model?
