I can answer from the point of view of an average developer, knowing just enough SQL to understand both syntaxes, but still googling the exact syntax of insert each time I need it... :-P (I don't do SQL all day, just fixing some problems from time to time.) Well, actually, I find the first form more intuitive, making no apparent hierarchy between the two tables. The fact I learned SQL with possibly old books, showing the first form, probably doesn't help... ;-) And the first reference I find on a sql select search in Google (which returns mostly French answers for me...) first shows the older form (then explain the second one). Just giving some hints on the "why" question... ^_^ I should read a good, modern book (DB agnostic) on the topic. If somebody has suggestions...
