One very pragmatic way to find the answer is with simulation . Let's first adress an easier question: given a number N of trials what is your confidence that you will have at least class once. In the equiprobable case with 200 classes you could for example do a simulation like this: sim.runs You would need to find out how many simulation runs you need to have the precision you need (i.e. the needed digits should be stable over multiple runs). You can then experiment with the number of samples (n.samples). There is probably also a more fancy combinatorial way to calculate this, but I think this method is more adaptable to various more complicated cases. Depending on your sample sizes computation might be an issue.
