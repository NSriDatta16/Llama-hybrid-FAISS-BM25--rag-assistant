C# Copy directory to another server

After numerus failed attempts of trying to use robocopy to mirror files accoss to another server as a SQL job(Dont ask). The job would have to run every 15 minutes and run as a SQL job to copy all transaction logs and backup files and so that is the job fails it reports up in SQL which is then checked by MOM. The job can not just copy the whole directory every time as its about 50gb in size it would just have to mirror the directroy, In other words get rid of the files that dont exist on the source directory and copy the new files that do. It has been suggested that c# is the best way (and its a good learning curve for me). But my c# knowlege is very minimal. Sorry I fogot to mention we are on a restricted network and Robocopy was the only option ragerding applications. FTP is alsoo banned. Help Thanks
