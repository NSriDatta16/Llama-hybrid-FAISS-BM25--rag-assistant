The first thing to ask is always, " why are we doing this?" Is it for sustainable fishing? Maximize the amount of fish caught? The purpose of the project leads to very different approach. Second thing to ask is, " what are some possible recommendations, and what constraints are there?" It is a waste of time to recommend something at the end of project which is not executable. The principle is NOT mess with all the data/models/buzzwords first, but set out to understand the problem and background . Have you discussed with the stakeholders (e.g. professor, business owner) about the project scope? What do you know about fishing population? Have you done your literature review on what have been done by others? What approach they took and what conclusion was drawn? Garbage in, garbage out. Don't randomly dump some data in some model and pray - it just gives you garbage back. Not how data science works.
