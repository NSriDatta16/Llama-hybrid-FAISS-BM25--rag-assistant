The very first thing I do is get the user agent of the person who saw the bug, so I can check it and make sure I'm testing on the exact same browser version and operating system. They can see their user agent by going to http://whatsmyuseragent.com/ I also ask for a screencast if possible--sometimes I think I'm doing the exact same steps they are, but actually I misunderstood what they meant. For really tough bugs, I try to add some logging into the code (maybe add a logging window) so I can figure out which codepaths they hit.
