Application of Bayesian Averaging for Ranking

I have a sample with two metrics and one ratio per attribute. I am trying to rank the attributes based on the ratio and variable amounts and from my research I have found that most people find Bayesian Averaging as the best formula to create a ranking system. I'm trying to apply this methodology using this practice and an example from this question , but I'm getting tripped up on where the inputs should go in the answer provided. Here are my variables/ratio: Leads Subscriptions Lead to Subscription % (Subscriptions/Leads) Here is example data: Attribute | Leads | Subscriptions | Lead to Subscription % Facebook: 20 | 10 | .5 TV: 4000 | 2000 | .5 LinkedIn: 2000 | 900 | .45 My assumption here is that "TV" is the strongest driver of conversion followed by "LinkedIn" due to the larger variable sizes creating a stronger indicator of performance than "Facebook" which might convert higher, but the variable size is small. From the answer in the linked question, I'm a bit confused as to the inputs being used in the formula provided and how I can translate my metrics into the equation. Should "P" = Lead to Subscription %, with an unknown "nr" and "n" = Leads ? It is also advised to add a dummy value to each calculation to have a larger impact on the smaller variable sizes and almost none on the larger. Does this approach sound correct?
