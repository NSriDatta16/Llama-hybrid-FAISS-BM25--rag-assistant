NoSql (e.g. RavenDB) for financial time series data?

I started to look into NoSql and was wondering what others think of the suitability of such solutions for storing and querying financial time series data? For example, in a simple scenario, I would store the stock symbol, open, high, low, close, volume and a timestamp. I would then want to query for that data based on symbol and a timestamp range. What do you think would be a good document structure for this scenario? Thanks, Tom Edit: I'm mainly concerned about the read query performance of time series based data in a NoSQL solution vs a traditional RMDBS solution
