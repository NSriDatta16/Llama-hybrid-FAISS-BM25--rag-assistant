For people looking for a more little theory, Peter Hoff at the Duke/University of Washington has worked on this. His 2005 JASA paper "Bilinear Mixed-Effects Models for Dyadic Data" ( pdf and code ) describes an MCMC approach that is very similar to @Dimitris Rizopoulosâ€™ answer above). That rough code was made into a more polished R package called AMEN (Additive Multiplicative Effects Models), and this 2017 preprint/tech report is effectively a tutorial with a few worked examples. He calls this the "Social Relations Regression Model."
