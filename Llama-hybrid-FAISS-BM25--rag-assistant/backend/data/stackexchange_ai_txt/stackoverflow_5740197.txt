I would create an interface for each common group of information and then implement them for reach type of sportsmen that they can be applied for. interface IRunner { int AverageSpeed {get; } } interface IBallPlayer { int ShootingSpeed {get; } } class TennisPlayer : IBallPlayer; class FootballPlayer : IRunner, IBallPlayer; If that's not what you are looking for you have to be more specific and give some code examples showing existing code and some code example showing what you want to do. A picture (code) is worth more than thousand words.
