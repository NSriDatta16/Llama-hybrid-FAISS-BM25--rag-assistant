You ask for clear definitions of concepts, coverage of linear models and their applications, and to avoid matrix algebra. These requirements suggest the following: Michael J. Wichura, The Coordinate-Free Approach to Linear Models. 2009. Very geometric flavor. Mervyn Stone, Coordinate-Free Multivariable Statistics. 1987. Very geometric. Requires substantial mathematical sophistication. Ronald Christensen, Plane Answers to Complex Questions. 1996 (last updated 2020). Classic. Emphasizes vector space geometry. Wide array of applications.
