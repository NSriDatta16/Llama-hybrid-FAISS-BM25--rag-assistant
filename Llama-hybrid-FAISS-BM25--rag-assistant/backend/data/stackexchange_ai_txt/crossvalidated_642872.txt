One can just multiply the pooled standardized mean difference by a given standard deviation. Say a meta-analysis of studies comparing the cognitive abilities of children exposed to lead with those unexposed yields a pooled standardized mean difference of $d = -0.20$ . Then this implies a $-0.20 \times 15 = 3$ points deficit on average in terms of IQ scores (since IQ tests are normed to have an SD of 15). So this kind of back-transformation makes most sense when the d value reflects a construct (in this example, cognitive abilities) for which one can take a known SD for some kind of scale that can be argued to be a reflection of this construct (in this example, IQ scores).
