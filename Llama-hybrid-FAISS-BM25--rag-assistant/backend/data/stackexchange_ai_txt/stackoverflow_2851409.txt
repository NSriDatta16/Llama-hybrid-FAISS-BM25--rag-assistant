Or you can try transform : newbob Just be sure to put every factor you'd like to convert to character. Or you can do something like this and kill all the pests with one blow: newbob_char It's not good idea to shove the data in code like this, I could do the sapply part separately (actually, it's much easier to do it like that), but you get the point... I haven't checked the code, 'cause I'm not at home, so I hope it works! =) This approach, however, has a downside... you must reorganize columns afterwards, while with transform you can do whatever you like, but at cost of "pedestrian-style-code-writting" ... So there... =)
