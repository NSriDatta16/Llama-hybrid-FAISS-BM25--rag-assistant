Without seeing the actual settings that your "Release" build configuration uses explaining this increase in size requires a great deal of speculation. Beyond some perhaps unlikely factors resulting in a vast increase in the amount of code being "dragged in" even though it isn't used, that magnitude of increase would most easily be explained by the inclusion of debug information. I would check your compiler and linker settings for: Debug Information (compiler setting) TD32 info (linker) Remote debug info (linker) Compare these settings in your Delphi 2009 project with the equivalents in Delphi 4.
