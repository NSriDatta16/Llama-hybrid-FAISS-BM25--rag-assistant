How can i rotate body when user touch the screen in cocos2d

I am facing one problem. I have done some coding to rotate cpSegmentShapeNew but its not working . Have a look on the following code, //**creating shape testBody = cpBodyNew(INFINITY, INFINITY); cpShape* testShape = cpSegmentShapeNew(testBody, cpv(230, 82), cpv(193, 46), 0.0f); testShape->e = 0.0; testShape->u = 0.0; testShape->data = flipper; testShape->collision_type = 2; cpSpaceAddStaticShape(space, testShape); //Body moving when user touch -(BOOL) ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //event that starts when a finger touchs the screen UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint tmpLoc = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; CGPoint location = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate:tmpLoc]; ball.position = location; ballBody->p = location; [flipper runAction:[RotateTo actionWithDuration:0.1f angle:60]]; cpBodySetAngle(testBody, 60); cpvrotate(testBody->rot, cpv(100000,0)); return kEventHandled; } Please anyone tell me that where i am wrong. Thanks.
