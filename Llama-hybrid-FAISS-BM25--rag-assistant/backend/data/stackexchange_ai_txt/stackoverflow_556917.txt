Change the major of the version number Announce it through all avenues at your disposal Add prominent announcement in readme Add code that converts between the old and new if DB or other changes are required Add code that detects the use of depreciated methods, data storage, etc and alerts the user before performing destructive changes Ask relevant FAQ type questions on major Q/A websites so when people have queries the answer is immediate and obvious using a simple search But the major version number is the primary target - people expect 1.x to 2.x transitions to cause issues, and are more careful when upgrading. -Adam
