How to calculate confidence interval for correlation coefficient (derived from from covariance)

I have two variables - percent_with_x and percent_with_y across 5 different states as shown below: percent_with_x 0.44947 0.48601 0.41299 0.43999 0.95145 percent_with_y 0.48743 0.11818 0.23235 0.83729 0.72262 I have a third variable - percent with x and y, defined as the percentage of individuals who had both x and y. I have calculated the covariance as follows: $cov = p(x=1, y=1) - p(x)\cdot p(y)$ . I calculated this for each state and then took the average as my covariance value. I am now interested in calculating the confidence interval for my covariance estimate, but unsure how to do this. Any help is appreciated.
