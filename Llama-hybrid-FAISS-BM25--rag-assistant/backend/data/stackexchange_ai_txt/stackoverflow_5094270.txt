Both function and object declarations are extern by default. However, you need to add an explicit extern to your object declarations in header files to avoid a re-definition: without a storage-class specifier, any file-scoped object declaration will actually be something called a tentative definition and reserve storage for the object within the current translation-unit. For consistency, I unnecessarily use extern even for function declarations. In most cases, I declare objects within headers as one of extern int foo; static const int bar = 42; and functions as one of extern int spam(void); static inline int eggs(void) { return 42; }
