Xcode beginner (from Eclipse to Xcode)

I want to learn Xcode in order to use its Obj-C, C, Java etc. project development facilities. I'm trying to start from the tasks I've done easily in Eclipse. For instance: In Eclipse I used to create a new project and add a .java file with a main() whenever I wanted to test a snippet or a short algorithm that writes on standart output or console. I tried to create a java project in Xcode, but the templates given are ready-to-code complete mac apps, hence they are an overkill for a simple test. Starting out from an empty project, I began to notice that I had to write some shell scripts and some ant lines, also those codes had to be associated with "targets" and many other things that are not natural in Eclipse... It was overwhelming... so: Does Xcode provide a simple solution like a Eclipse java project to aid those problems? Where can I find (besides apple.com) an easy introduction to Xcode? texeditor, java y javac are better options, and then is better to remain in Eclipse?
