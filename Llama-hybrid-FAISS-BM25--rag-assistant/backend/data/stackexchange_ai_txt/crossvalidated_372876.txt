RKHS norm and Fourier transform link

In the notes here , it is stated that norms of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can be written in terms of Fourier transforms, and this is often used to argue that a higher RKHS norm implies a less smooth function. For example, the Gaussian kernel is defined as: $$ k(x_i, x_j) = \exp \left ( {\frac{\|x_i - x_j \|^2}{\sigma^2}} \right ) $$ for all $x_i, x_j$ belonging to some set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ , and $\sigma > 0$ is a tuning parameter. The RKHS corresponding to this kernel, denoted $H_k$ has elements defined as: $$ f(\cdot) := \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} {\alpha_i} k(\cdot, x_i) $$ and corresponding norm: $$ \| f \|_{H_k} := \sum_{i=1}^{\infty }\sum_{j=1}^{\infty } \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i, x_j) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty }\sum_{j=1}^{\infty } \alpha_i \alpha_j \exp \left ( {\frac{\|x_i - x_j \|^2}{\sigma^2}} \right ). $$ But the linked notes say that we can write: $$ \| f \|_{H_k} = \frac{1}{2 \pi^d} \int |F(\omega)|^2 e^\frac{{\sigma^2 \omega^2}}{2} d \omega $$ where $F(\omega)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} dt$ , but I can't really find a proof of this anywhere. Does anyone know where I can find one or can provide an outline here?
