Have you read the API docs ? The req object is a http.ServerRequest object as documented there. It's HTTP, and such things like resolution are not part of the protocol. What you can get is a user-agent, and from there you might be able to retrieve more information using another service. Remember that node.js is a standalone app - it's not running in a browser - it's an HTTP Server application that is running in a JS interpreter.
