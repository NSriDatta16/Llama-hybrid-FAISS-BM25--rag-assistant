array.Length is a property and an O(1) operation. An array's length is known at the time it is created, so there is no reason to enumerate the entire array when you access the Length property. Any() should be fairly fast, and certainly useful if the collection type could change to be any other IEnumerable , but Length is not going to be performance drag. Also, your specific example uses a string and not an array, but the message is the same. The length of the string is known at the time of creation, so Length would not need to enumerate the characters in the string when you access the property.
