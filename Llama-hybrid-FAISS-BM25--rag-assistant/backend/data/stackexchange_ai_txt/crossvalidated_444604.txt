Bayesian updating of prior with positive result from underpowered test

How should one update the beliefs about a probability of a theory being true given a positive result (meaning confirming the theory in a statistically significant way) of an underpowered study? Let: P(G) = prior probability of Genuine theory. P(F)=1-P(G) = prior prob. of false theory P(+/G) = power = probability of positive result given genuine theory P(+/F) = significance level ( $\alpha$ ) = prob of positive result given false theory Then by Bayes rule: $P(G/+) = \frac{P(+/G)P(G)}{P(+/G)P(G) + P(+/F)P(F)} = \frac{P(+/G)P(G)}{P(+/G)P(G) + \alpha(1-P(G))} $ Let P(+/G) -> 0. As the study becomes more and more underpowered P(G/+) -> 0. But shouldnâ€™t an underpowered study simply have no effect on my prior?
