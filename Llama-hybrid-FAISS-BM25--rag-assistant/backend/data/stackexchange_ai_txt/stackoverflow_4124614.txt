Remove elements from a flat array if value is greater than a given number

List item What's the most efficient way to remove items from an array in php where the value is greater than a pre-determined threshold, e.g. given an array Array ( [0] => 1.639 [1] => 2.168 [4] => 1.897 [6] => 4.129 ) I would like to remove all the items with a value greater than e.g. 2, preserving key associations, to give Array ( [0] => 1.639 [4] => 1.897 ) I know I can do this using a foreach() loop but it seems that there should be a more elegant way.
