What are LS means useful for?

I have recently learned about LS means (estimated marginal means, predicted marginal means) and I am trying to understand what they could be used for and under what circumstances. For concreteness, consider a dependent variable $y$ and two categorical independent variables, $x_1$ with two categories and $x_2$ with three categories. One could create dummy variables corresponding to these categories and call them $d_{1,1}, d_{1,2}$ and $d_{2,1}, d_{2,2}, d_{2,3}$. One could then have a linear model (without interaction terms) $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1,2} d_{1,2} + \beta_{2,2} d_{2,2} + \beta_{2,3} d_{2,3} + \varepsilon $$ where $d_{1,1}$ and $d_{2,1}$ are the reference categories. LS means for $x_1$ would be \begin{align} \bar y_{1,1} &= \beta_0 &+ \frac{1}{3}(\beta_{2,2} + \beta_{2,3}), \\ \bar y_{1,2} &= \beta_0 + \beta_{1,2} &+ \frac{1}{3}(\beta_{2,2} + \beta_{2,3}). \\ \end{align} Uses I can think of Given $x_1$ and $x_2$, the best (in MSE sense) prediction of $y$ is $\beta_0 + \beta_{1,2} d_{1,2} + \beta_{2,2} d_{2,2} + \beta_{2,3} d_{2,3}$. This is also the expected result after treatment if $x_1$ and/or $x_2$ are interpreted as levels of treatment. Given $x_1$ alone, the best prediction of $y$ is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \mathbb{1}_{d_j=1}$ for $x_1$ being in the category $j$. This is also the expected result after treatment if $x_1$ are interpreted as levels of treatment. None of these two coincides with $\bar y_{1,1}$ or $\bar y_{1,2}$. I get that Least-squares means [are] predictions from a model over a regular grid, averaged over zero or more dimensions (which is the Wiki excerpt for the lsmeans tag), but is what is the practical use of that? So far I can see only one situation in which this could be useful; this is if we know that in population the proportion of observations that have $d_{i,j}=1$ and $d_{k,l}=1$ is the same for all combinations of $i,j,k,l$. Is that the intended use of LS means? Or can it be useful for description or hypothesis testing?
