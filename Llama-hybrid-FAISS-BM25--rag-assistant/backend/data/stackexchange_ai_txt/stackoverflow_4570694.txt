Are you certain this is an optimization that is needed? 2000 lines that are 10 characters long is only 20000 characters. In most environments, that's tiny. Most machines have considerably more RAM than that. Most disks are considerably larger than that. And, usually, sending and receiving that much information is trivial over the web. Perhaps your situation is unique. Maybe you have large number of 20000 character data sets, or very slow web access over which to transmit this date, etc. But, I'd encourage you to consider whether you aren't perhaps trying to optimize something that even if you are very successful in implementing, won't significantly change your application's performance in the real world.
