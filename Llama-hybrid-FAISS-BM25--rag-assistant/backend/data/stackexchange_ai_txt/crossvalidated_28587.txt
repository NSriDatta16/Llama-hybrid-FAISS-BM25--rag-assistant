Detecting fishy data

Just a little thought I've been having. If we rolled a fair dice 60 times, and got 60 sixes in a row, we would (wrongly?) definitely assume that something fishy's going on. Is there any statistical measure which could raise our attention to this potential problem? Or is it simply not a problem, since this sequence is just as likely as any other sequence of 60 rolls (e.g. 10 occurrences of each of the six numbers, or 60 fives, etc.)? I'm guessing we could use the weak law of large numbers to calculate what the probability of the average observation being different from the expected value of the dice, by a value of 2.5 in this case, after 60 trials is?
