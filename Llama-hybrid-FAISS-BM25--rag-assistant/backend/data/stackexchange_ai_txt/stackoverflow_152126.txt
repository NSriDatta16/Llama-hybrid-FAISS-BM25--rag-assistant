Many of the answers here indicate that the two approaches produce the same output and that the choice is one of coding style and performance. Its seems its believed that static content outside of becomes a single Response.Write. However it would be more accurate to say the code outside gets sent with BinaryWrite. Response.Write takes a Unicode string and encodes it to the current Response.CodePage before placing it in the buffer. No such encoding takes place for the static content in an ASP file. The characters outside are dumped verbatim byte for byte into the buffer. Hence where the Response.CodePage is different than the CodePage that was used to save the ASP file the results of the two approaches may differ. For example lets say I have this content saved in a standard 1252 code page:- The British £ The British £ ")%> The first paragraph is garbled, since the £ will not be sent using UTF-8 encoding, the second is fine because the Unicode string supplied is encoded to UTF-8. Hence from a perfomance point of view using static content is preferable since it doesn't need encoding but care is needed if the saved code page differs from the output codepage. For this reason I prefer to save as UTF-8, include
