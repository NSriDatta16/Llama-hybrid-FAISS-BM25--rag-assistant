Logistic regression , Bayesian or not, is a model defined in terms of Bernoulli distribution . The distribution is parametrized by "probability of success" $p$ with mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)$ , i.e. the variance directly follows from the mean. So there is no "separate" variance term, this is what the quote seems to say.
