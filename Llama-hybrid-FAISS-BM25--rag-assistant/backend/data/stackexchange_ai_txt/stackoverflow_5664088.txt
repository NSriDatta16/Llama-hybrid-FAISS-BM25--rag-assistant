Removing the bounds on each parameter including alphabet size, there's an easy objective-preserving reduction from the maximum coverage problem, which is NP-hard and hard to approximate with a ratio better than (e - 1) / e â‰ˆ 0.632 . It's fixed-parameter tractable in the alphabet size by brute force. I agree with Nick Johnson's suggestion of brute force; at worst, there are only (13 + 26 - 1) choose (26 - 1) multisets, which is only about 5 billion. If you limit the multiplicity of each letter to what could ever be useful, this number gets a lot smaller. Even if it's too slow, you should be able to recycle the data structures.
