I use the one baked into Visual Studio with the addition of TestDriven.Net for the right-click menu items that allow me to run single tests with/without the debugger. I started using NUnit. Either one is probably ok. I prefer to use the one in VS primarily so I don't have to support both tools, but there are some advantages to the integration especially if you use Team System. I believe that TestDriven.Net supports a lot of different frameworks. You'll also want to use a coverage analyzer to help you see what parts of your code have been covered by tests and help you determine other tests that may be needed. You may need Team system to get baked in coverage analysis for VS, but there is always NCover (comes with TestDriven.Net). I'd suggest looking at Pragmatic Unit Testing in C# from the Pragmatic Programmers or Test Driven Development with C# . Both would have examples. Rob Conery's StoreFront example is a good example of ASP.NET MVC.
