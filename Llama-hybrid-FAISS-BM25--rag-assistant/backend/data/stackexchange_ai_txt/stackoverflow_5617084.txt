One downside of trying to use ERB for general string interpolation is that ERB is really aimed at generating HTML. The result will be lots of encoding issues when you forget to raw-ify everything and get confused about why your ampersands, greater-than, less-than, etc. symbols are getting mangled. I think there'll be more computational overhead for ERB as well but this might not matter. Furthermore, if you put inlined ERB inside Ruby will end up with Ruby inside ERB inside Ruby (and quite possibly more levels as you call methods from within ERB) and that will be a bit of a confusing mess. Think of the poor souls that will have to maintain your code, said poor soul might even be you. UPDATE : You could use #{} for simple HTML templates (see Mustache for something like that) but it would be difficult and rather ugly to produce a repeated section; repeated sections are quite common in HTML templates so that should be easy and natural for an HTML template system. With ERB, you can just: but that would be a mess in #{} interpolation. You'd also end up doing #{html(blahblah)} all the time and most people would forget. Also, "#" has a special meaning in URLs and a different special meaning in CSS (where braces also have a special meaning); fragment URLs and chunks of CSS are fairly common in HTML templates so you'd be constantly worrying about mixing up things up. This particular bit of nastiness would probably only be an issue when using #{} to produce a CSS selector or a fragment in a URL but that's enough to make it cumbersome.
