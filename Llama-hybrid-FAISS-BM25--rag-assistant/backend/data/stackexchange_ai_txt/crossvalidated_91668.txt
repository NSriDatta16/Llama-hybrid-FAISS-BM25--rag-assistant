In my field (social science using cross sectional surveys), an adjusted R squared of .87 would be much too large. That would be a sure sign that you have done somehting meaningless like predict something with a second measure of itself. So whether or not you need to improve your model depends on the context, which you did not give us. If you are looking for alternative transformations of your explanatory/right-hand-side/predictor-variables you could consider fractional polynomials: Royston P, Altman DG.
