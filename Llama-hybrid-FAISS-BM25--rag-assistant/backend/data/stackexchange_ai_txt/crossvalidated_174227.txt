It's easy to get confused by the presentation of coefficients when you call coef(fit2) . Look at the summary of fit2: > summary(fit2) Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: Recall ~ (1 | Subject/Time) + Caffeine Data: data REML criterion at convergence: 444.5 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.88657 -0.46382 -0.06054 0.31430 2.16244 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Time:Subject (Intercept) 558.4 23.63 Subject (Intercept) 2458.0 49.58 Residual 675.0 25.98 Number of obs: 45, groups: Time:Subject, 15; Subject, 5 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error t value (Intercept) 61.91827 25.04930 2.472 Caffeine 0.21163 0.07439 2.845 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) Caffeine -0.365 There is an overall intercept of 61.92 for the model, with a caffeine coefficient of 0.212. So for caffeine = 95 you predict an average 82.06 recall. Instead of using coef , use ranef to get the difference of each random-effect intercept from the mean intercept at the next higher level of nesting: > ranef(fit2) $`Time:Subject` (Intercept) 0:Jason 13.112130 0:Jim 33.046151 0:Ron -3.197895 0:Tina 8.893985 0:Victor 24.392738 1:Jason -2.068105 1:Jim -9.260334 1:Ron -4.428399 1:Tina 6.515667 1:Victor 17.265589 2:Jason -18.203436 2:Jim -19.835771 2:Ron -3.473053 2:Tina -17.180791 2:Victor -25.578477 $Subject (Intercept) Jason -31.513915 Jim 17.387103 Ron -48.856516 Tina -7.796104 Victor 70.779432 The values for Jim at Time=0 will differ from that average value of 82.06 by the sum of both his Subject and his Time:Subject coefficients: $$82.06+17.39+33.04=132.49$$ which I think is within rounding error of 132.46. The intercept values returned by coef seem to represent the overall intercept plus the Subject or Time:Subject specific differences, so it's harder to work with those; if you tried to do the above calculation with the coef values you would be double-counting the overall intercept.
