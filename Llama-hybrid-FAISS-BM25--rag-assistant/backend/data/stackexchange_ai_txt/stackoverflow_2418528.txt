Is there a way to rename a similarly named column from two tables when performing a join?

I have two tables that I am joining with the following query... select * from Partners p inner join OrganizationMembers om on p.ParID = om.OrganizationId where om.EmailAddress = 'my_email@address.com' and om.deleted = 0 Which works great but some of the columns from Partners I want to be replaced with similarly named columns from OrganizationMembers . The number of columns I want to replace in the joined table are very few, shouldn't be more than 3. It is possible to get the result I want by selectively choosing the columns I want in the resulting join like so... select om.MemberID, p.ParID, p.Levelz, p.encryptedSecureToken, p.PartnerGroupName, om.EmailAddress, om.FirstName, om.LastName from Partners p inner join OrganizationMembers om on p.ParID = om.OrganizationId where om.EmailAddress = 'my_email@address.com' and om.deleted = 0 But this creates a very long sequence of select p.a, p.b, p.c, p.d, ... etc ... which I am trying to avoid. In summary I am trying to get several columns from the Partners table and up to 3 columns from the OrganizationMembers table without having a long column specification sequence at the beginning of the query. Is it possible or am I just dreaming?
