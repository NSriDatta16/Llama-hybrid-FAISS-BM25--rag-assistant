You only need to assign then entites nullable property to null . I've never had to assign or test against System.DBNull when using linq-to-sql entities. It sounds like the generated entity classes have been manually modified or are out of date from the database. For your reference, the following is a nullable and a non-nullable integer field: private int? _someID; /// /// Gets or sets the SomeID. /// [Column(Name="SomeID", Storage="_someID", DbType="INT", UpdateCheck=UpdateCheck.Never)] public int? SomeID { private int _someOtherID; /// /// Gets or sets the SomeOtherID. /// [Column(Name="SomeOtherID", Storage="_someOtherID", DbType="INT NOT NULL", CanBeNull=false, UpdateCheck=UpdateCheck.Never)] public int SomeOtherID { Check your generated entity looks something like the above.
