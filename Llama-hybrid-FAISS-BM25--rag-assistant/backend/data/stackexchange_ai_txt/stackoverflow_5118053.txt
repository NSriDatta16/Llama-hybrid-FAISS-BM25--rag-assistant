Global log level for CocoaLumberjack

I'm using CocoaLumberjack in an iPhone project, to log some information. I've followed the Getting started guide , and everything works fine, but there is one thing that bugs me: there doesn't seem to be an elegant way to define a log level for the whole app. To make it work I need to define a constant in every source file, like this: static const int ddLogLevel = LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE; So, is there a way to define a global log level for the application? I found this article on the subject, but I still need to add an #import in every file...
