Graying out texts with/without lines with LaTeX?

This is a screen capture from Pragmatic Bookshelf. How to make this boxed text with LaTeX? It has it's own heading with underline, and uses color. And how to make some text with gray background as follows? http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7351/screenshot20100718at916.png Added Konrad's method works, but it looks like that it doesn't work well with multicolumn package. Tonio's method shows the gray only for the characters, but I want to have the gray box expanded to the end of \textwidth. http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/8417/screenshot20100718at247.png I posted another question with respect to the \texwidth, and it seems to working anyway.
