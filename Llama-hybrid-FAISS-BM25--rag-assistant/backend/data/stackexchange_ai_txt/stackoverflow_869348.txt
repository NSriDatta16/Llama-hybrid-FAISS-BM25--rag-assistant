Thanks a lot Alexander! Thank you for putting me on the right path. I did not try you latest code, but I was able to get your previous code working. Here is the working code. I'm sure this is all kludgy, but perhaps someone out there can show me a more elegant solution: $(document).ready(function() { $("#myVal").change(function() { changeActionURL(); }); changeActionURL(); }); function changeActionURL() { var url = ' ' + '?dup=' + $("#myVal").val(); $("#u").attr('href', url); } Report Dupe not done My solution as you can see is just to hard code the LINK instead of trying to use the ASP.NET AJAX helper class.
