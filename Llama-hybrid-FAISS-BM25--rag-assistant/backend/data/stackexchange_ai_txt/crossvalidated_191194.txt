How to handle missing data for prediction with small data set

I have to analyse the results of american football players. The goal is to predict the position group based on the results of about 20 exercises. Therefore I use SVM, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest and compare the results. I have about 400 samples from 40 players in total. E.g. a player can measure his exercise results multiple times. The Problem: Some players leave some exercises out so that the row contains a 0 as result. If so, I have 2 options: 1.If the player measured the result of the specific exercise at least 1 time I calculate the mean and use it to replace the 0. 2.The player has never measured a single result for the specific exercise. That means I cannot calculate a mean value. Unfortunately this happens quite often. If I would drop these players I would lose 75% of my data because only 15 players measured their results for all exercises. Should I use the overall mean (including all players) or leave them 0 so that the data lose their significance and are not considered by the algorithm? playerNo exercise1 exercise2 exercise3 positionGroup 1 10.3 44 5.8 1 2 9 62 5.2 2 3 12 33 6.2 1 4 0 35 4.7 3 5 0 46 7.4 2 2 0 55 8.3 2 3 9 41 6.4 1 ...
