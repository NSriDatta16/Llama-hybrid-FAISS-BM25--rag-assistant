Google brought me here too, and I found that the implementation of Scikit-learn library , a famous repository for data science in Python, uses SVDs with a small tweak to fit the data points and perform factor analysis. Hence the answer is a big YES you can use SVD. If you're keen with code implementation, I suggest you can read the Factor Analysis source code of Scikit-learn here at github . They implement the SVD algorithm using Scipy library and tweak the output for shape adjustment. In addition to that, I want to add some reference on top of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis paper PPCA paper suggested by @gwg: David Barber, Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning, Algorithm 21.1 (textbook) textbook here Christopher M. Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Chapter 12.2.4 pdf here (paper, same author of PPCA). Scikit-learn referenced this paper for their alogrithm
