I think this depends on the use-case. CNNs are often applied in an image classification setting, where as you mention, the convolution layers are often followed by FCLs. With U-net, on the other hand, the result is another image showing a segmentation map, so no FCLs are used. The 'neuron behaviour' in U-net comes from ReLU activation functions, which are applied after the convolution filters.
