Is it appropriate to run PCA on a subset of variables?

I was thinking about using PCA to deal with issues of multicollinearity on my dataset. I was wondering how appropriate it is to run PCA on only subsets of variables that seem to have issues of collinearity. For example, if I had a dataset with 10 independent variables, and 5 of them seemed to suffer from multicollinearity, would it be appropriate to just run PCA on those five variables and leave the other 5 in their original state?
