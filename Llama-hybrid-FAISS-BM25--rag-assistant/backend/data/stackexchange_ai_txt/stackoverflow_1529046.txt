Perhaps if you hook up a text field delegate and then implement the following method: -(BOOL)shouldReplaceCharactersInRange:(NSRange)aRage withString:(NSString *)aString You may be able to check aString for the autocorrected string (maybe @". ") and then just return NO. This will hopefully not allow the @" " to be replaced with @". "
