Yes, it's certainly painful to lower-case several objects for each loop iteration (plus a possibly redundant toString ?), and also bad practice to call list.size() for every iteration â€” that value should be cached before the loop starts. Anyway, if you're working with this much data, is there a reason that you're not using an SQLite database for storage and displaying/filtering your list using CursorAdapter ? That would be the recommended way to implement something of this size.
