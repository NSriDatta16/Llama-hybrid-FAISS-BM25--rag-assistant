Best way to change font colour halfway through paragraph?

I was wondering what is the best way to change the font colour of some text that appears halfway through a paragraph. For example, I have a paragraph of white text, but I want a couple of words in the middle of the paragraph to be orange so that they stand out, but then carry on with white text after that, what would be the best way of achieving this? Thanks in advance!
