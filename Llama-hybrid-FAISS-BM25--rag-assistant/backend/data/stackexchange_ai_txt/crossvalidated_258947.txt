Any way to handle plurals in NLP without stemming words

I am playing around with topic modeling, and I notice a lot of related plural and singular words in my corpus (e.g. 'champion' and 'champions' are both found). I gave the porter stemmer in NLTK a shot, but full-on stemming removes a lot of other details that I would like to retain. Is there a way to depluralize terms using python?
