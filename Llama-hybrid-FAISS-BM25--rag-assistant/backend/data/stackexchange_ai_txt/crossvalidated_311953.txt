There is variation, but in each variable, there is one category that is very clearly the largest. That means that for a large part of your samples, you are just predicting the mean, and it doesn't really explain the difference between your records. The group mobile-coconut-cat, for example, is your largest category by far. Your predictions for this group are the mean, which is the best you can do if you want to minimize RMSE. The variation within this group is something that you cannot explain with the data, and if you don't have other predictors, there is no way to make those predictions better. There are perhaps some small things that can be done to improve your model. First of all the relation with word_count is probably nonlinear. So adding it like this doesn't help, it only hurts the model. There might be a sweet spot of the number of words for an article, and you should use some transformation that allows the model to find this sweet spot. Second, the smallest categories are probably overfit, so for example the group apples has a high average time, but it's not a big group, so this could be just coincidence. In your model, it has its own coefficient, which probably overestimates the actual average time spent on those pages. For regularization, I would look at a mixed model with lme4 , or something like LASSO from the glmnet package. Conversely, as in, there your model might not be flexible enough, there are no interactions in it. But short articles may be more popular on mobile, while long articles are more popular on desktop. There is no freedom for the model to find such a pattern at the moment. I don't think adding this interaction ( wordcount * channel ) will immediately improve things, but combined with some nonlinearity in wordcount, and regularization, it could help a bit. All this might lift your rsquared a bit, but I wouldn't count on getting up to 10%. Whether or not someone stays longer at the page has a lot to do with whether it's actually what he or she is looking for, whether nothing IRL happens that stops him or her from reading on, perhaps if it's a fast or a slow reader, probably patience has a role in it. None of that can be 'predicted' from your data.
