How to evaluate the accuracy of a probability distribution?

I've trained a Gaussian Bayesian Network. If I feed input values for the parent variables of my output variable, I get a normal distribution. How can I quantify the accuracy of this distribution when confronted to the real data? Should I just use the variance?
