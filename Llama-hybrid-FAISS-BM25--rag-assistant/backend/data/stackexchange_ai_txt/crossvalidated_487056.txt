"IF statement" in a Neural Network

In classification problems, it is frequent to have classes with different properties. For example, I came across a problem where I needed to classify the following images in a single network: White mugs Black mugs Blue mugs Glasses As my approach was getting more complex, the accuracy between glass vs mugs (due to the lights) was increasing, but after looking at the confusion matrix, black vs blue vs white seemed to overfit. Likewise as my model was getting simpler, glass was confused for white and blue for black and black for white. How can I write a NN such as: If it is a mug, then classify mugs only, else it is a glass. If this concept makes any sense (let aside the mug oversampling issue), I would appreciate any reference to papers or how can this be implemented in theory.
