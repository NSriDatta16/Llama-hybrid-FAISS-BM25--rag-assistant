How do you get your users to report bugs using the appropriate channels?

We have got a setup where users can either use a web-based form or send e-mail to a particular e-mail address so that they can report a bug. If they do this, a record is created in the bug tracking system, and the appropriate developers are notified by e-mail. Some users are still sending e-mails to us personally, calling us on the phone, or (worst of all) finding us in person to describe the bugs verbally. What do you do to encourage your users to use the bug reporting system you have arranged for them? Do you refuse to accept bugs unless they are submitted via an approved route? Do you accept bugs reported through other means, but gently (or sternly?) remind the users to instead use proper channels? Do you not even bother with having "accepted routes" for bug reporting, and just take what you get? And whatever means you use, how do you address the following: Not making the users feel as if you are avoiding work by constraining their contact methods Encouraging bug reporting (it's amazing how many users will just let bugs slide without reporting them until weeks or months later) Cultivating goodwill and trust (cough) between your team and your users I am looking for some general guidance on this issue. We had hoped by making things easier for them it would help the issue, and it has to some extent, but does anyone have some particular successful (or unsuccessful) methods to share?
