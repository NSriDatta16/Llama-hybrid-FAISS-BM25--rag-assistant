Dimensions of Scale (Gamma) and Offset (Beta) in Batch Norm

While implementing Batch Normalization for a particular layer 'L' with 'n' hidden neurons/units in a Neural Network, we first normalize the Activation values of that layer using their respective Mean and Standard Deviation, and then apply the Scaling and Offset factor as shown: X-norm = (X - mu)/sd X' = (Y * X-norm) + B where mu = mean of X and it is a (n,1) vector sd = standard deviation of X and it is also a (n,1) vector X = Activation values of layer 'L' with dimension (n,m) if mini-batch size = m X-norm = normalized X with dimension (n,m) Y = Gamma / Scaling factor B = Beta / Offset factor Now my question is, what are the dimensions of Gamma and Beta ? Are they (n,1) vectors or are they (n,m) matrices ? My intuition says that since they somewhat are analogous to the Mean and Standard Deviation, they should be (n,1) vectors.
