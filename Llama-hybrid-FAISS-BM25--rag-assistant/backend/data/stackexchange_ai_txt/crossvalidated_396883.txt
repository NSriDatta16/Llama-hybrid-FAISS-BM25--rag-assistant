what exactly happens during each epoch in neural network training

1.Across different epochs, which of the following is/are updated? initial weights (initial ConvNet filter matrices, initial fully connected weights) hyper parameters: number of ConvNet filters, size of ConvNet filters, number of layers... 2.The lost function calculated from the last epoch appears to be the initial value of the lost function for the current epoch. Why?
