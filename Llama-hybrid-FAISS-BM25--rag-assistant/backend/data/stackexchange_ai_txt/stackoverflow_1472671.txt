How do I help prevent my users from initiating a drag accidentally in Cocoa?

I have a collection view that I've subclassed that allows me to reorder the collection view items via drag and drop. My drag code that sets up the pasterboard is currently in mouseDragged: - (void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)aEvent { if(!dragInProgress) { dragInProgress = YES; NSPasteboard *pboard = [NSPasteboard pasteboardWithName:NSDragPboard]; ... setup pboard, declare types, setData ... ... create drag image .... [self dragImage: image at: position offset: NSZeroSize event: aEvent pasteboard: pboard source: self slideBack: YES]; } } I would like to only initiate a drag if the user has dragged for a certain length, so they don't initiate a drag accidentally. Is there a setting to do this in Cocoa, or do I need to move this code to mouseMoved: and check the distance between where the drag started and where the mouse is currently?
