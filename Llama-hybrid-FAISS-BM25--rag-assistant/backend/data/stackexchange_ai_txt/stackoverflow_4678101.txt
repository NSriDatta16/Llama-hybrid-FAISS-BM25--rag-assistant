How can I change some text when a checkbox is clicked?

I have a form with three items with checkboxes and prices. In a paragraph underneath I have an area for the total price, and an area for the items selected. How can I update these two areas when each checkbox is checked? £10.00 £20.00 £30.00 If you buy name of items here , it will cost you a total of £ price here . How can I achieve this with jQuery or JavaScript? I don't really want to use a textbox for putting the values in, I'd rather they were in-line text. So I want the object names in the first bit, and the total price in the second.
