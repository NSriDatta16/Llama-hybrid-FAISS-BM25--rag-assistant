Heavy-tailed data, power laws, extreme value distributions and theory are a special class of models in statistics. One useful way to interpret or further analyze your data would be to estimate a tail index. While there are several sophisticated estimators such as Hill's or Pickand's methods, a straightforward heuristic is to use OLS regression on the log(rank) against log(size) with the resulting coefficient providing a proxy for the index. Once that is derived, then this value can be compared against a Tweedie distribution table to determine in which family your data's distribution belongs. There are many, many resources available that discuss heavy-tailed data, power laws, tail indexes and the like. Here are a few suggestions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-tailed_distribution For tail index domains see the Tweedie table "Examples" here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution Tail index heuristic Xavier Gabaix, RANKâˆ’1/2: A SIMPLE WAY TO IMPROVE THE OLS ESTIMATION OF TAIL EXPONENTS available here ... http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/jbes.2009.06157.pdf Cosma Shalizi, the CMU machine learning guru has much to say about power laws here, So you think you have a power law? http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/2010-10-18-Meetup.pdf
