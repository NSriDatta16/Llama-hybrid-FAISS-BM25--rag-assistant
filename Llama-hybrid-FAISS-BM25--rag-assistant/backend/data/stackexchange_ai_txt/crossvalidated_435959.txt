Since you mention feedback I would suggest you view your system as evolving in time, namely a time series. In this case I would at least consider Sugihara's S-map and CCM methods and forget about the final diagnosis for a while. The advantage of these methods is that they are specifically aimed at data arising from dynamical systems. CCM tells you which variables are causative to your higher level observables (ptau, A $\beta$ , sAPP $\alpha$ ), while S-map allows you to predict them. You might find out that many of the variables you measure are actually redundant. The downside is, of course, that you need to collect time-series data. If you want to test whether or not such methods are useful for said data, you need only collect time series of the observables mentioned earlier and see if they admit a low dimensional attractor ("have low embedding dimension"). This is done using the Simplex method - take a look at the first pages of this tutorial for the R package rEDM.
