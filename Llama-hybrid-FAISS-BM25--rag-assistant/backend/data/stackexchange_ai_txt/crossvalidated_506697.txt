The reasons for the scarce applications of Bayesian methods are two faceted: 1) additional layer of complexity; 2) lack of computationally cheap algorithms to handle Bayesian methods and big data, and people may don't keep up with the trends in this direction. Some practical approaches: MCMC is still expensive and hence variational inference approach is usually applied, for instance, MC dropout. For the online predicting, usually we use an expensive Bayesian neural network as a teacher to distill its knowledge to a point estimate student for deployment. Design better regularizations from the perspectives of Bayesian, for example Vadam . References: Hands-on Bayesian Neural Networks - a Tutorial for Deep Learning Users
