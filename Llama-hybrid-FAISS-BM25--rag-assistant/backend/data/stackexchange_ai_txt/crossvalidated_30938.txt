I don't think the increase in the number of bootstrap replications will help much. The problem is probably due to the small sample size of 27. Even second order accurate bootstrap confidence intervals such as BCa are approximate and the coverage can be way off in small samples. Schenker illustrated this problem with the BC confidence intervals for variance parameters when the population distribution is a highly skewed chi square distribution. Chernick and LaBudde also showed that this would occur for BCa with highly skewed distributions such as lognormal. I have mentioned this previously on this site.
