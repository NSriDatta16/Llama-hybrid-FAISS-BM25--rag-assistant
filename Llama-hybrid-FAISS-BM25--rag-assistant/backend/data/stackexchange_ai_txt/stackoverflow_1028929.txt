How do I use Perl's LWP to log in to a web application?

I would like to write a script to login to a web application and then move to other parts of the application: use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); use LWP::UserAgent; use Data::Dumper; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(keep_alive=>1); my $req = POST "http://example.com:5002/index.php", [ user_name => 'username', user_password => "password", module => 'Users', action => 'Authenticate', return_module => 'Users', return_action => 'Login', ]; my $res = $ua->request($req); print Dumper(\$res); if ( $res->is_success ) { print $res->as_string; } When I try this code I am not able to login to the application. The HTTP status code returned is 302 that is found, but with no data. If I post username/password with all required things then it should return the home page of the application and keep the connection live to move other parts of the application.
