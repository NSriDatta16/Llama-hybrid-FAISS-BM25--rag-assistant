It depends on the type of collection you are creating. I don't think the native java Array types support any functionality like this. However there are other collections that can do these sorts of things, for example Apache Commons Math has a number of structures to do just this sort of thing. Guava is another package with a lot of great Array methods built in. Another option one could easily implement would be to extend the collection your using. For example: public class ArrayListExtension extends ArrayList{ public ArrayListExtension(){} public Double average() { Double sum = 0; Iterator iterator = this.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext()){ sum += iterator.next(); } return sum/this.size(); } } Note: There are no sanity checks built into this. In a real-world implementation you'd want to do some try-catch to make sure that the values are actual numbers.
