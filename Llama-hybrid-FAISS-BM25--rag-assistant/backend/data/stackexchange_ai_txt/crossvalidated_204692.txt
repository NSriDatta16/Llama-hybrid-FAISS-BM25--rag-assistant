The majority of the linear models based in the likelihood function have extension to the Cox regression. For example, penalized regression models (lasso, rigde regression, elastic net) or partial least squares. In other hand, there are extensions from the classification trees to survival trees. This means all the ensemble methods based in trees are also extended to survival data in a natural way: random forest, bagging, gradient boosting machines, â€¦. Finally, other methods, like support vector machines or neural networks have some theoretical versions for survival data, but there are difficult to apply in the practice.
