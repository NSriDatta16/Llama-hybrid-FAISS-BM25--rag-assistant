I've come across this before, embedding boost into my projects. Each individual boost library comes with various project files for building with different make systems (Jam, make, Visual Studio 6...) but they're never so great with the newer versions of VS. I always prefer to create a new project file and embed boost directly into my project. It's pretty simple, you just need to add all of the source files and set the project options properly. There is one caveat, however, and that is you must name the library output file the as boost does, because their include files depend on that. Once you've done this, you can distribute the boost libraries just like any other files in your project.
