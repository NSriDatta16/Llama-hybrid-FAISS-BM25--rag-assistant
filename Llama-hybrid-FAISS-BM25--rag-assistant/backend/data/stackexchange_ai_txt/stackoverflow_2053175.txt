ok - third time lucky. I don't know of any tool that can do this in one step - but I don't think that any of them are going to do what you want (except for probably some really high end tools). Thus, I think that your best bet is to use one of the aforementioned script like dbschema.pl and send the output to something like sql2diagram This should be simple to script up - and the email the output to whomever needs to see it. Since you have the text output at the intermediate stage, you can highlight diffs as well bby preserving multiple copies of the output. Can you clarify what you mean by "Organize the tables"
