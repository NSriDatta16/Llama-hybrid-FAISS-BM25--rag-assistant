Benefits of using Deep Learning-specific hyperparameter optimization tools vs. sklearn?

There are quite a few library for hyperparameter optimization that are specific to Keras or other Deep Learning libraries, like Hyperas or Talos . My question is, what's the main benefit of using these libraries compared to, for example, sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV() or sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV ?
