Is there an Android Tablet equivalent of UIPopOverController?

I'm just mucking around with Android tablet stuff in 3.0. I have fragments set up to do the equivalent of UISplitViewController for iPad. Anyone know what the best solution to get something like the iPad UIPopOverController is? I'm thinking the options are either a separate dialog or something in the Action Bar ...? I haven't actually seen any Android tablets running 3.0 so not clear what the standard will be ... Many thanks in advance
