Why to use Residual Plots? A residual is a difference between the observed y-value (from scatter plot) and the predicted y-value (from regression equation line). A residual plot is a graph that shows the residuals on the vertical axis and the independent variable on the horizontal axis. If the points in a residual plot are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis, a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, a non-linear model is more appropriate. Good Fit Bad Fit Non-random residual patterns indicate a bad fit which suggests non-linear model may be required. Source Roberts, D. (2019). Residuals - MathBitsNotebook(A1 - CCSS Math).
