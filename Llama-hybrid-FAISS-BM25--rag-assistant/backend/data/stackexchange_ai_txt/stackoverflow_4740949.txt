Is there any reason you don't return it as an image from your controller? var image = GetByteArrayImage(); var stream = new MemoryStream(image); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Expires = 14400; return File(stream, "image/jpg"); Thin in your client you can just use WebRequest to download the file like any other file and not have to do any other magic.
