Unless something has changed in recent iOS versions, the scroll down trick is the only one that reliably works, I've had no issues with this version : /mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent) && !location.hash && setTimeout(function() { window.scrollTo(0, 1); }, 1000);â€‹ I didn't care about any other mobile platform for this particular page though, it was redirecting based on agent...you may want to change the regex to check for iPhone specifically, e.g. replace /mobile/ with /iPhone/ .
