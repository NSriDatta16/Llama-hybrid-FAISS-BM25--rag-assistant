SQL Queries - How Slow is Too Slow?

Do you have any formal or informal standards for reasonably achievable SQL query speed? How do you enforce them? Assume a production OLTP database under full realistic production load of a couple dozen queries per second, properly equipped and configured. Personal example for illustrative purposes (not a recommendation, highly contingent on many factors, some outside your control): Expectation: Each transactional unit (single statement, multiple SQL statements from beginning to end transaction boundaries, or a single stored procedure, whichever is largest) must execute in 1 second or less on average, without anomalous outliers. Resolution: Slower queries must be optimized to standard. Slow queries for reports and other analysis are moved to an OLAP cube (best case) or a static snapshot database. (Obviously some execution queries (Insert/Update/Delete) can't be moved, so must be optimized, but so far in my experience it's been achievable.)
