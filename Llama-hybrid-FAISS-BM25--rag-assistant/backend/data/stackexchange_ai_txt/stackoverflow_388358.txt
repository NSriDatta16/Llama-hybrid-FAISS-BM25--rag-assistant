HInclude Caching problem on Internet Explorer

I've been using HInclude ( http://www.mnot.net/javascript/hinclude/ ) for sometime now and its working great, but there is one problem though. The part of my site which is fetched using HInclude doesn't get refreshed everytime I hit the back button in Internet Exploer (6.x + and 7.0 also). It works fine on other browsers. I've tried setting the cache-control and pragma controls in header to "no-Cache". but even that is not working. I want HInclude to pick up new content everytime a user clicks back button or re-visits a page with hx content on it. How do I do that?
