Is Just-Identified 2SLS Median-Unbiased?

In Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion (Angrist and Pischke, 2009: page 209) I read the following: (...) In fact, just-identified 2SLS (say, the simple Wald estimator) is approximately unbiased . This is hard to show formally because just-identified 2SLS has no moments (i.e., the sampling distribution has fat tails). Nevertheless, even with weak instruments, just-identified 2SLS is approximately centered where it should be. We therefore say that just-identified 2SLS is median-unbiased. (...) Though the authors say that just-identified 2SLS is median-unbiased, they neither prove it nor provide a reference to a proof . At page 213 they mention the proposition again, but with no reference to a proof. Also, I can find no motivation for the proposition in their lecture notes on instrumental variables from MIT , page 22. The reason may be that the proposition is false since they reject it in a note on their blog . However, just-identified 2SLS is approximately median-unbiased, they write. They motivate this using a small Monte-Carlo experiment, but provide no analytical proof or closed-form expression of the error term associated with the approximation. Anyhow, this was the authors' reply to professor Gary Solon of Michigan State University who made the comment that just-identified 2SLS is not median-unbiased. Question 1: How do you prove that just-identified 2SLS is not median-unbiased as Gary Solon argues? Question 2: How do you prove that just-identified 2SLS is approximately median-unbiased as Angrist and Pischke argues? For Question 1 I am looking for a counterexample. For Question 2 I am (primarily) looking for a proof or a reference to a proof. I am also looking for a formal definition of median-unbiased in this context. I understand the concept as follows: An estimator $\hat{\theta}(X_{1:n})$ of $\theta$ based on some set $X_{1:n}$ of $n$ random variables is median-unbiased for $\theta$ if and only if the distribution of $\hat{\theta}(X_{1:n})$ has median $\theta$. Notes In a just-identified model the number of endogenous regressors is equal to the number of instruments. The framework describing a just-identified instrumental variables model may be expressed as follows: The causal model of interest and the first-stage equation is $$\begin{cases} Y&=X\beta+W\gamma+u \\ X&=Z\delta+W\zeta+v \end{cases}\tag{1}$$ where $X$ is a $k\times n+1$ matrix describing $k$ endogenous regressors, and where the instrumental variables is described by a $k\times n+1$ matrix $Z$. Here $W$ just describes some number of control variables (e.g., added to improve precision); and $u$ and $v$ are error terms. We estimate $\beta$ in $(1)$ using 2SLS: Firstly, regress $X$ on $Z$ controlling for $W$ and acquire the predicted values $\hat{X}$; this is called the first stage. Secondly, regress $Y$ on $\hat{X}$ controlling for $W$; this is called the second stage. The estimated coefficient on $\hat{X}$ in the second stage is our 2SLS estimate of $\beta$. In the simplest case we have the model $$y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i+u_i$$ and instrument the endogenous regressor $x_i$ with $z_i$. In this case, the 2SLS estimate of $\beta$ is $$\hat{\beta}^{\text{2SLS}}=\frac{s_{ZY}}{s_{ZX}}\tag{2},$$ where $s_{AB}$ denotes the sample covariance between $A$ and $B$. We may simplify $(2)$: $$\hat{\beta}^{\text{2SLS}}=\frac{\sum_i(y_i-\bar{y})z_i}{\sum_i(x_i-\bar{x})z_i}=\beta+\frac{\sum_i(u_i-\bar{u})z_i}{\sum_i(x_i-\bar{x})z_i}\tag{3}$$ where $\bar{y}=\sum_iy_i/n$, $\bar{x}=\sum_i x_i/n$ and $\bar{u}=\sum_i u_i/n$, where $n$ is the number of observations. I made a literature search using the words "just-identified" and "median-unbiased" to find references answering Question 1 and 2 (see above). I found none. All articles I found (see below) make a reference to Angrist and Pischke (2009: page 209, 213) when stating that just-identified 2SLS is median-unbiased. Jakiela, P., Miguel, E., & Te Velde, V. L.
