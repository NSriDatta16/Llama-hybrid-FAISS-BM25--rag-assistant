It seems Google provides no way to automatically create apps on their App Engine. But as long as you can do it from a browser, you can simulate the app registering process with http queries, using cURL for instance, in PHP. cURL allows you to send http queries, optionnally with POST data, cookies, etc...you can also set a user-agent. You can pretty much emulate every browser's behaviours. Here, you will have to make a POST query containing the data you're supposed to have filled in the app registering form. More on cURL on the PHP doc , and there's even a StackOverflow tag for it.
