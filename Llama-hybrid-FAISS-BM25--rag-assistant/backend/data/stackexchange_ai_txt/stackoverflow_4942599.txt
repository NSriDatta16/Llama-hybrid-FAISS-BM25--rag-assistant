If by "complete coverage of the full colour spectrum" you mean having every discrete colour value possible in a given colorspace at least once, then you could just count all the unique colours in each image and the one with the highest value could be called the most colourful. If, by spectrum, you mean number of hues, then you could convert each pixel's colour to HSV or HSL, tallying the number of unique hue values an image has, and again consider the one with the highest number of them the most colourful. If, by complete, you mean something like in your other question about points around a circle, I think it might be useful to define some sort of linear density metric -- although I'm not exactly how best to apply to the data at hand...or even if that's what you mean.
