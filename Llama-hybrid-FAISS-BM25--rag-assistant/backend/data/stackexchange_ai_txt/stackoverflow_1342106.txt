Why does C# say that the CCR's IterativeTask is non-generic?

I'm using the Concurrency and Coordination Runtime and am writing code similar to what is described in the documentation. The following line fails to compile: yield return new IterativeTask ("Hi",a,b,ls, itfunc); The compiler gives this error message: The non-generic type 'Microsoft.Ccr.Core.IterativeTask' cannot be used with type arguments Which is mistifying because the documentation uses that method with type arguments and it's clearly generic. (I'm going to post my own answer here, that's encouraged as I understand it)
