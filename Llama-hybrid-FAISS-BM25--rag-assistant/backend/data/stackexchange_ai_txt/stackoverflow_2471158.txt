I don't know of a way to create a nested wrapper with the wrapper option, but perhaps you could use the showErrors handler to achieve the same effect. Basically you would use old fashioned jquery/javascript to wrap the span element after the plugin shows the errors. I think the trick will be figuring out if you've already wrapped it in a tooltip. Perhaps, you can do this by finding the closest div with a class of tooltip from the span. I hope a more elegant solution presents itself, but I think this is a good start. Let me know if you find any tweaks to make it more efficient. I didn't have alot of time to play around with it. showErrors: function(errorMap, errorList) { var errorListSize = errorList.length; this.defaultShowErrors(); if(errorListSize > 0) { $('span.error').each(function() { if($(this).closest('div.tooltip').size() == 0) { $(this).wrap(' ').wrap(' ').wrap(' '); } }); } }, Here's the html that is generated. This field is required.
