If you are using this machine for development only (seems you do : "for testing purposes") , I don't think it should be much of a problem. I've seen that kind of message a few times, and never experimented any trouble that might be related. (If it had been 4.0 and 4.1, maybe, as there were lots of important new stuff added... But between 5.0 and 5.1, I don't think so) To correct that "problem", you'd have to install a new version of the libraries used by PHP... And I'm not sure the most recent version of PHP 5.2 (5.2.10) uses libmysql 5.1... And you probably don't want to recompile anything by yourself ^^ Other solution would be to downgrade to MySQL 5.0.x ; but I wouldn't care, for a testing machine, unless I run into strage behaviour.
