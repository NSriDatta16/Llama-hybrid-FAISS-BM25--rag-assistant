First thing to understand is that standard deviation (std) is different than average absolute deviation . These two define different mathematical property about the data. Unlike average absolute deviation, standard deviation (std) weighs more to the values that are far from mean, which is done by squaring the difference values. E.g., For following four data points: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline Data (x)& |x - mean| & (x-mean)^2 \\ \hline 2 & 2 & 4\\ \hline -2 &2 &4\\ \hline -6 &6 &36\\ \hline 6 &6 &36\\ \hline \sum x =0 & \sum (|x-mean|) = 16 & \sum (x-mean)^2 = 80 \end{array} average absolute deviation (aad) $= 16/4 = 4.0$, and Standard deviation (std) = $\sqrt{80/4} = \sqrt 20 = 4.47 $ In the data, there are two points which are 6 distance away from mean, and two points which are 2 distance away from mean. So, deviation of 4.47 makes more sense than 4. Since total observation are always $N$, for computing std we are not diving by $\sqrt N$, instead we divide the total variance by $N$, and take its square root, to bring it to the same unit as the original data.
