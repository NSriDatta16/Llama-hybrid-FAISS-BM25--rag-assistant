Evaluating a binary classification time series model

Question: What metric should I use to compare time series models that are used for binary classification when the classes are highly imbalanced? Is there a way to get an average score that makes sense in this case? Background: I'm struggling to find an appropriate metric for model evaluation and comparison. Multivariate binary time series data, and I'm interested in comparing several different models. My data are highly imbalanced (about 120 cases of class 0 for every case of class 1). I would use f1 score, or AUROC, or average precision if this were a static case; however these are time series data. I'm not sure if averaging AUROC makes sense (as in, averaging over a sequence). The data are 10,000 sequences, where each time point is a binary (0/1) matrix of size (986, 986). I've read that: raw classification accuracy is not a good metric to use with imbalanced data sensitivity and specificity are not the best measures to use for imbalanced data.
