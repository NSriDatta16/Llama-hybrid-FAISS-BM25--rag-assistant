You might look at using the lower bound of the Wilson score interval for your ratings. See http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html for more details. Although, there, it is used for the simpler Bernoulli case. The gist is if you have a lot of ratings you have a higher degree of confidence in your scoring. You can then combine the scores from your local ratings and the Technorati ratings, by weighting the scores by the number of voters locally and on Technorati. As for wanting a single -1 vote to have high impact, just remap it to a large negative value proportional to your desired impact before feeding it into your scoring formula.
