I think you probably can randomly remove respondents but I don't think it actually helps anything. As a thought experiment, let's take the idea to the extreme. You could fully resample your dataset from the available data. That is, you could pick a sample size, say 2000, and randomly select a number of respondents for each group in proportion the population frequency. For example, you would draw 380 (=2000 * 19%) respondents from group A and 1 (=2000 * 0.5%) respondent from group F. That may well be more respondents from group A than you have data for, so you would be repeating some samples. Then you could proceed with your statistics without any weighting at all. You might be concerned that the random numbers you used for your random resampling are arbitrary, so perhaps you do the same process multiple times hoping to converge on some average answer. Now you have two ways of calculating each statistic: (a) Don't do any resampling, just calculate the statistic directly from the sample using weights (b) Fully resample multiple times and calculate a running average of the statistic (a) gives you a single number while (b) gives you a sequence of estimates. The question is, does (b) converge to (a)? If it doesn't, I would suggest that there is a problem. What exactly is (b) converging to? If (b) does converge to (a), that is good, but the calculation of (b) is pointless because you already know what it is going to converge to. Your approach of partially resampling one group is a mix between (a) and (b) but I think the point still holds. Either it gives you the same result as the the full weighted sample or it doesn't. If it does, that's fine but the calculation was unnecessary. If it doesn't, it's not clear what exactly you have calculated and what it means. To answer your questions directly: Is randomly removing members of Group C methodologically acceptable? Yes, but it doesn't actually help you so I recommend that you don't Alternatively, how best to correct for the outsized over-representation in the final sample of group C? By simply weighting the sample as you originally did I think that I am a lot more relaxed about heavy re-weighting (particularly under-weighting) than you are. You refer to some "weighting best practices". Perhaps you could provide a link to those and we could examine what problems the rule of thumb is trying to avoid?
