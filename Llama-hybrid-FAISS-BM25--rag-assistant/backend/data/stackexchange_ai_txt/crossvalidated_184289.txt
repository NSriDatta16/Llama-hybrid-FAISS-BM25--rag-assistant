This is a simple consequence of the distribution of $||X||^2$: if $X\sim\mathcal{N}_p(\mu,Q)$, then $$||X||^2\sim \sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i (U_i+\xi_i)^2\qquad U_i\stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ where the $\lambda_i$'s are the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ and $\xi$ is a rotation of $\Sigma^{-1/2}\mu$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i\xi_i^2=||\mu||^2$, as explained here . This is not very nice but $$\mathbb{E}[||X||^2]=||\mu^2||+\text{tr}(\Sigma)$$ which means that the larger $p$ is the farther above $||\mu||$ the norm $||X||$ is on average. The same applies for the quantiles of $||X||$ as I wrote in a short paper quite a while ago...
