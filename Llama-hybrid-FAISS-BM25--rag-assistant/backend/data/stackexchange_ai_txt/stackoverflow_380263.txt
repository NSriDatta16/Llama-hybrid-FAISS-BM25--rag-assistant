1) WYSIWYG editor. Being able to edit HTML content as if it were in Microsoft Word. That includs the ability to upload your own images. 2) Creating new pages without query strings ie) not 'pages.aspx?pageid=5' but 'contact.aspx' 3) Additional features such as news, photo gallery, blog, user management, etc... Personally I really like the CMS starter kit Microsoft has available on codeplex. It is very well done and uses XML file storage so it doesn't need a database !
