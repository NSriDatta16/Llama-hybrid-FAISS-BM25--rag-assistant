Is maximum a posteriori estimation part of Bayesian inference?

A maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation maximizes the posterior distribution using Bayes' rule and provides a point estimate. Is it correct to say that MAP is a Bayesian inference method? Or does 'Bayesian inference' only refer to methods that estimate the full posterior distribution (as opposed to a point estimate)?
