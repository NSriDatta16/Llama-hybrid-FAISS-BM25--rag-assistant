The GWT team does not provide a list of unsupported browsers, only supported browsers, and it's a vague list at that "most recent versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. (Opera, too, most of the time.)". If you have a good idea yourself of what browser/version won't work you can use this code : public static native String getUserAgent() /*-{ return navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); }-*/ to learn what browser is being used and perhaps cook up a work-around. On the other hand, browser rendering of web pages can fail in many subtle ways ranging from mildly annoying to catastrophic, and there is often no way to know where your page falls on that scale. One of the major reasons for GWT is that you can stop worrying about this sort of thing. At least until it happens.
