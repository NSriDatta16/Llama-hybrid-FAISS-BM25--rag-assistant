You can take a look at Part-Cover. It's a code coverage tool (GPL) but it works similarly to NCover, which means it uses profiling API to do its job. Not sure how good or bad the code is, and of how much help it'll be for you (GPL may be an issue as well), but its something you may want to take a look at. It's been updated late last year and then went silent, so I'm not sure if the project is still active.
