Help about cosine simulating in h2o

So I'm beginning in deep learning and especially in h2o. I tried to simulate cosine function in R, not to compute it like for example by using h2o.cos(), But after many and many more combinations of hyperparameters, I really didn't get any serious results. My dataset is: x=1:3000 y=cos(x) data=cbind(x,y) colnames(data) My model: modelcos Without any test, in a normal case with neural networks, we have by application on the training frame the predictions curve practically the real curve by superposition Plot: predcos I tried and I tried many options (withdrawing all, rising up epochs, dropout, momentum, activation, distribution etc.). Without testing the model, I didn't get any acceptable figures. And tests are systematically inconclusive. If I use neuralnet package, the key is to drop down the learning rate. But it doesn't work for all the dataset. I tried to simulate logarithm too, but no results. Please somebody could help me?
