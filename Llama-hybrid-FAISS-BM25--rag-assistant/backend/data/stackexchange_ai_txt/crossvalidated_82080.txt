(disclaimer: I cannot type well today: my right hand is fractured!) Contrary to the advice to use a non-parametric test in other answers, you should consider that for extremely small sample sizes those methods are not very useful. It is easy to understand why: in studies with extremely small size, no difference between groups can be established unless a big effect size if observed. Non-parametric methods, however, do not care for the magnitude of the difference between the groups. Thus even if the difference between the two groups is huge, with a tiny sample size a non-parametric test will always fail to reject the null hypothesis. Consider this example: two groups, normal distribution, same variance. Group 1: average 1.0, 7 samples. Group 2: average 5, 2 samples. There is a big difference between the averages. wilcox.test(rnorm(7, 1), rnorm(2, 5)) Wilcoxon rank sum test data: rnorm(7, 1) and rnorm(2, 5) W = 0, p-value = 0.05556 The computed p-value is 0.05556 which does not reject the null hypothesis (at 0.05). Now, even if you increase the distance between the two means by a factor of 10, you will get the same p-value: wilcox.test(rnorm(7, 1), rnorm(2, 50)) Wilcoxon rank sum test data: rnorm(7, 1) and rnorm(2, 50) W = 0, p-value = 0.05556 Now I invite you to repeat the same simulation with t-test and observe the p-values in the case of large (average 5 vs 1) and huge (average 50 vs 1) differences.
