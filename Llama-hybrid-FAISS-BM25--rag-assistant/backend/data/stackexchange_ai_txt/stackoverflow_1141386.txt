Use the NLTK , in particular chapter 7 on Information Extraction. You say you want to extract meaning, and there are modules for semantic analysis, but I think IE is all you need--and honestly one of the only areas of NLP computers can handle right now. See sections 7.5 and 7.6 on the subtopics of Named Entity Recognition (to chunk and categorize Manny Ramerez as a person, Dodgers as a sports organization, and Houston Astros as another sports organization, or whatever suits your domain) and Relationship Extraction. There is a NER chunker that you can plugin once you have the NLTK installed. From their examples, extracting a geo-political entity (GPE) and a person: >>> sent = nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_sents()[22] >>> print nltk.ne_chunk(sent) (S The/DT (GPE U.S./NNP) is/VBZ one/CD ... according/VBG to/TO (PERSON Brooke/NNP T./NNP Mossman/NNP) ...) Note you'll still need to know tokenization and tagging, as discussed in earlier chapters, to get your text in the right format for these IE tasks.
