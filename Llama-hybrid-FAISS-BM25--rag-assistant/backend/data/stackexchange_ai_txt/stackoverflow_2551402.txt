Teamcity and Grails

My current requirement is: I have to package my grails app and use teamcity for continuous build. The only problem is the build agents don't have groovy and grails installed (don't ask why) I want to package my app with Groovy and Grails directories and check in Git. So that there is no dependency on installing groovy and grails on the build agents. And the package has everything to run the app. Can anybody please help. Please let me know if you want me to rephrase my question.
