Variance of $\frac{t}{T}X+Y$

I would like to understand how the variance of multiple random variables is computed when weights of the variables change over time. For example, let $\displaystyle X_{t}$ be a random variable at time $\displaystyle t$ and $\displaystyle Y_{t}$ be a random variable at time $\displaystyle t$ . At time $\displaystyle 0\leq t\leq T$ , given $\displaystyle X_{t}$ and $\displaystyle Y_{t}$ , we have \begin{equation} Z_{t}=\frac{t}{T}X_{t}+Y_{t} \end{equation} I would like to understand if is there any sense to compute \begin{equation} \text{var}(Z_{t})=\text{var}(\frac{t}{T}X_{t}+Y_{t})\\ \text{var}(Z_{t})=\text{var}(\frac{t}{T}X_{t}) + \text{var}(Y_{t}) + 2 \text{cov}(\frac{t}{T}X_{t}, Y_{t})\\ \end{equation} I am asking this because the value of some financial derivatives with specific maturity can depend on their current price and forward price in a way that the weight of the current price increases towards maturity. That is, the random variables are dependent. This is just a simplified formulation of such a problem. Additionally, if we assume the random variables to be normally distributed, how wrong would it be to assume the first term to be $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}X_{t}$ since the average of $\displaystyle \frac{t}{T}$ within $\displaystyle [0, T]$ is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}$ ? Thanks!
