How to parse key/value chain into associative array in PHP?

I have a string that looks like: key1/value1/key2/value2/ and so on I did an explode('/',trim($mystring,'/')) on that Now I want to haven an associative array like: array( 'key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2', ... ); of course i can do it with an for loop where i always read two entries and push them into a target array, but isnt there something more efficient and elegant? a one liner with some some php core function similar to ·list()· or something?
