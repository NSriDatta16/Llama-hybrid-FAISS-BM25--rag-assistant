Dealing with Discrete numeric variables in logistic regression model

i have one relevant variable in my model like number of additional services taken by customer with visual inspection it is clear more the number of additional services customer opts in lesser the chances of customer to leave. i m creating logistic regression model for predicting customer's propensity to leave. How shall i treat this variable? as numeric or treat it as categorical variables and create dummy variable for it. (As of now range of number of additional services is between 0 to 10).. please suggest.
