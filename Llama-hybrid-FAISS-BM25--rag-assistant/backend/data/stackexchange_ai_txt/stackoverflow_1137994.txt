There may be a built in tool for this, but if it were me, I would probably use DB-B to generate a list of update statements and run them as a script in DB-A. Something like: select 'update T-A set PID = ' || PID || ' where OID = ' || OID || ';' from T-A (This assumes that OID is your primary key. Since you have a large number of rows you might have to break it into multiple scripts. Someone else may be able to offer a more elegant solution.)
