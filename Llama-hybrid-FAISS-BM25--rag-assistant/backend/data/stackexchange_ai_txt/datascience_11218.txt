Data visualization of frequencies of state transitions (possibly in R?)

I am working on some experimental data, which can be of types A, B and C. Now I observe this data for 5 time points, and I can see them move between A to B, B to C,... etc. I see such transitions for a number of independent data points, and I have the cumulative frequencies from all data. For example, I have: $$ Period A B C \newline 1 4 4 2 2 1 2 7 3 0 1 9 4 10 0 0 5 8 1 1 $$ I DO know the transitions from one state to another, for example from A->B, B->C so on and so forth. For example I know that from Period 1, (all A's went to C. Among the missing B's one went to A, and rest to C.) I was thinking of what would be the best way to visually represent this time wise transitions from one state to another. I was thinking that there might be some better way than just having a transition matrix, maybe something that looks like a Markov Chain but which could accommodate all the 5 periods of transitions in a succinct way? I myself work on a statistical software called STATA, which has limited graphical applications. IS there something on other software packages (R maybe?) which can help me in this? Sorry for the hack representation of the data matrix.
