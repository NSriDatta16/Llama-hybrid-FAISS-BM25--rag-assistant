Describe your workflow of using version control (VCS or DVCS)

I'd like to learn other people workflow when using either vcs or dvcs. Please describe your strategy to handle the following tasks: Implement a feature Fixing bugs (during development and deployed app) Code Review Refactoring code (post code-review) Incorporate patches Releasing the newer version of your app (desktop, web, mobile, would you treat them differently?) Feel free to organize your answer not grouped by the tasks but grouped by whatever you think is relevant but please organize it by VCS/DVCS (please don't mix them). Thank you.
