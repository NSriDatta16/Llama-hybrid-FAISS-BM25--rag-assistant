I think that you're on the right track toward becoming an expert data scientist . Recently I have answered related question here on Data Science StackExchange (pay attention to the definition I mention there, as it essentially answers your question by itself, as well as to aspects of practicing software engineering and applying knowledge to solving real-world problems). I hope that you will find all that useful. Good luck in your career!
