I don't think plugins are a function of your workspace. You'd probably need to have separate Eclipse installations. Or, there's a way to do a "shared" install, whereby the binary is in one place and the plugins are in another. That must mean that there's a startup parameter to tell it where to find plugins. Perhaps you could leverage that?
