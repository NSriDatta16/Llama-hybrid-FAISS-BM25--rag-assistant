Some native 128-bit types are available on certain platforms, you tend to be limited by the architecture. For example __m128 is available for SSE2? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ayeb3ayc.aspx Also listed as __int128 in this ABI: http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi-0.99.pdf However the preferred naming of uint128_t and uint256_t can be found in SHOGUN, a "large scale machine learning toolbox with focus on especially Support Vector Machines (SVM)" http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/index.html
