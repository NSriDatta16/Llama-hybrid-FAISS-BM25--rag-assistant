If you know the number of ints you'll have to average in advance, you can do the division one-by-one int [] a; int average; int remainder; int alen = a.length; for( int i = 0; i = alen ) { //roll the average over if needed remainder -= alen; average++; } } Of course in practice it doesn't matter because you can't have more than 2 31 elements in an array, which means you could store the sum in a long .
