Open a file from a remote network share

I am trying to open a file from a server I currently have Dim attachedFilePath As String = "\\myserver\myshare\test.txt" File.Open(attachedFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read) This does not open a file. However, if I change the path to be local then there is no issue. Dim attachedFilePath As String = "c:\...\test.txt" So, is there a way to open a file from remote storage?
