fourier terms for double seasonality in R

I am performing a time series analysis on a daily time series. I know that there is a weekly period (7 days) and also a montly seasonality. For now, i set the time series object in R using a ts(x=mysequence, frequency = 7) and modeled the time series using an auto.arima with xreg parameter containing a 11 columns matrix of dummies tied to each months (January base level). I was told that a better approach to handle multiple seasonality (within ARIMA context) is to use Fourier terms instead of monthly dummies. So I come out with this code from Rob Hyndman: library(forecast) y My doubt is twofold: what is the criteria to choose K for montlhy patterns? How can I perform a - priori selection of K? why the code shows seasonal=FALSE. I would put seasonal = TRUE to capture weekly frequency patters. I am using R and forecast R package to perform the analysis.
