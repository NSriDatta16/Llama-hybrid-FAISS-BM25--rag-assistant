My take on the three questions is Question 1 What classifies as too much correlation? For example: a pearson correlation of 0.5 is that too much? Many authors argue that (multi-)collinearity is not a problem. Take a look here and here for a rather acid opinion on the subject. The bottom line is that multicollinearity does not have an impact on the hypothesis testing other than having a lower (effective) sample size. It will be hard for you to interpret the regression coefficients if you do a regression, for instance, but you do not violate any basic assumption if you choose to do so. Question 2 Can we fully determine whether there is collinearity between two variables based on the correlation coefficient or does it depend on other factors? I think there are several ways of measuring the correlation between two variables, from calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient (if you assume linearity, and apparently you did so), to Spearman's rank , distance correlation , and even doing PCA on your dataset. But I would leave the answer of this question to better informed people than me. Question 3 Does a graphical check of the scatter plot of the two variables add anything to what the correlation coefficient indicates? IMO, the answer is sound no.
