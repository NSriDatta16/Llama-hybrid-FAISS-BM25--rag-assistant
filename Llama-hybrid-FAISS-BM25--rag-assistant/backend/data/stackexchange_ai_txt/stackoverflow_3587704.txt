Good way to procedurally generate a "blob" graphic in 2D

I'm looking to create a "blob" in a computationally fast manner. A blob here is defined as a collection of pixels that could be any shape, but all connected. Examples: .ooo.... ..oooo.. ....oo.. .oooooo. ..o..o.. ...ooooooooooooooooooo... ..........oooo.......oo.. .....ooooooo..........o.. .....oo.................. ......ooooooo.... ...ooooooooooo... ..oooooooooooooo. ..ooooooooooooooo ..oooooooooooo... ...ooooooo....... ....oooooooo..... .....ooooo....... .......oo........ Where . is dead space and o is a marked pixel. I only care about "binary" generation - a pixel is either ON or OFF. So for instance these would look like some imaginary blob of ketchup or fictional bacterium or whatever organic substance. What kind of algorithm could achieve this? I'm really at a loss
