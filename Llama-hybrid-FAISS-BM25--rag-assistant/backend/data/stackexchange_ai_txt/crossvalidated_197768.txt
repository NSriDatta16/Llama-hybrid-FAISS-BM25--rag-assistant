Following SO etiquette, this should have been written as a comment to @John K. Kruschke, but longer comments are difficult to structure. Sorry. @John K. Kruschke writes: Merely by post-processing of the completed MCMC chain... lower_CredI and upper_CredI in the original post were computed as you mentioned from the full MCMC chains and are only slightly reformatted for better comparison with lme output. While you favor HDI, these are simple quantiles; with the symmetrical posterior in this example it does not make a big difference. ROPE and effect size I have seen applications to ethics committees were statistical power was computed without stating the assumption about effect size. Even for the case where there is no way around defining a "clinically relevant effect", it is difficult to explain the concept to medical researchers. It is a bit easier for non-inferiority trials, but these are not as often subject of a study. So I am quite sure that introducing ROPES will not be acceptable - another assumptions, people cannot keep more than one number in mind. Bayes factors might work, because there is only one number to take home like p-values before. Priors I am a surprised that neither @John K. Kruschke nor @Ben Goodrich from the Stan team mention priors; most papers on the subject ask for detailed discussion of prior sensitivity when presenting results. It would be nice if in the next edition of your book - hopefully with Stan - you could add boxes "How to publish this (in a non-statistical paper) with 100 words" for selected examples. When I would take your chapter 23.1 by word, a typical medical research paper would by 100 pages and figures long...
