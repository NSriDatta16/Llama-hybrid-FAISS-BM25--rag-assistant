Short answer (without technical stuff) would be https://www.quora.com/How-do-ensemble-methods-work-and-why-are-they-superior-to-individual-models If you want to know exactly how then read about specific algorithms like random forest or gradient boost rather than overview of ensemble learning. Good link for RF - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.08-random-forests.html
