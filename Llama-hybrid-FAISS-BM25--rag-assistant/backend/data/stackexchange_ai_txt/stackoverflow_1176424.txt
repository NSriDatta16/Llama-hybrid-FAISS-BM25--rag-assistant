It is possible to generate an event from C++ to trigger a normal LabVIEW event. Here is a NI forums post discussing this structure. And a code excerpt from that thread: #include #include #include "EventDLL.h" //Generate a LabVIEW event int GenerateLVEvent(LVUserEventRef *msg, int param) { PostLVUserEvent( *msg, (void *)&param); return 0; } And here's the original sourcecode as a PNG: (source: vi-lib.com ) And here is the accompanying LabVIEW code: The lower loop is LabVIEW code that sends a DLL event to the LabVIEW event handler. This should be placed inside your DLL. One of the input parameters should be the event pointer as a U32. Good luck, Ton PS if you are going do dive into DLLs and LabVIEW interoperability, pay attention to everything RolfK says, he is a guru in that field.
