Try SELECT [Agent Name], AVG(RANK) FROM MY_TABLE WHERE [TimeStamp] BETWEEN DATE1 AND DATE2 GROUP BY [Agent Name] (Update) Thanks to Martin which reminded me I need to cast RANK . SELECT [Agent Name], AVG(CAST(RANK AS FLOAT)) FROM MY_TABLE WHERE [TimeStamp] BETWEEN DATE1 AND DATE2 GROUP BY [Agent Name]
