Ok, I figured it out. It had to do with the key storage parameters for the certificate object. For anyone else that runs into this problem, make sure you construct your X509Certificate2 objects that you are adding to the store using the X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet and X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet flags. This will force the private key to persist in the machine key set location which is required by HttpApi ( HttpListener wraps this).
