Well, XML and its associated technologies have several uses/advantages: Plain XML on its own is really just a plain-text data storage format. The well-formed criterion of the XML specification basically ensures that an XML document can always be parsed correctly. The tag structure of an XML document makes it easier to parse and access the content and, if you're interested in the semantic web, sort of makes it easier to find meaning in the data. XML (or markup languages derived from it) is used quite a lot in data transfer because it's an intermediate, platform independent format. XML Schema can be used to enforce a particular structure and form in an XML document, and thus can be used to create custom markup languages. XSL (or XML Stylesheets) can be used to generate a rendered output from any XML document that links to the stylesheet, so when someone loads the XML file in their browser it will display as XHTML or a PDF or whatever else you tell it to.
