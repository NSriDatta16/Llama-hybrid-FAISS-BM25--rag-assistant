You could try the approach recommended by Steve Goodman and calculate the minimum bayes factor: Toward Evidence Based Medical Statistics 2: The Bayes Factor To get this from mcmc results, you can subtract the estimate for the group level parameters for each step to get a posterior distribution of the difference as was done by John Kruschke in this paper: Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t Test He does not calculate a bayes factor there and recommends against it (see appendix D). Instead he designates a region of practical equivalence around the null hypothesis (zero) and see if your credible interval overlaps. To get the minimum bayes factor I believe what you can do is then divide the probability at the mode of your estimate of the difference between means by the probability at zero. I have not seen this done anywhere but it makes sense to me. Hopefully someone else can comment on that.
