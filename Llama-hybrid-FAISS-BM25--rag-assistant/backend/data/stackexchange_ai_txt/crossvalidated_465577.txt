It is up to you to choose whether to predict a binary 'good' vs 'bad or to predict a score such as on a scale of 1 to 5. If you choose binary classification, logistic regression would be your answer. If you do choose to represent the score as on a scale of 1 to 5, I would not represent these numbers as categories in a flat categorical classification problem. When minimizing a classification error such as categorical cross entropy, the resulting model has no sense of scale, in that the score '1' is no closer to '2' than it is to '5'. I would train a regression model and have it predict a continuous number, even though the training data is rounded to whole numbers.
