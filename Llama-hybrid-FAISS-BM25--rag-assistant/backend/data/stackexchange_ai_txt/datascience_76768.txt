what is the meaning of $\mathbb{R}^{768\times (768 * 2)}$?

Hi I'm an undergraduate student interested in Machine Learning. I was reading a paper from ICLR 2020 and came a cross a weird looking vector dimensions. Can anyone tell me what this means?? $\mathbb{R}^{768\times (768 * 2)}$ Does this mean that in python numpy array the shape would probably be (2, 768, 768) ?? I remember reading that the numpy array dimensions are reversed from the actual vector dimensions representations. And the vector I asked about shows up in page 4.
