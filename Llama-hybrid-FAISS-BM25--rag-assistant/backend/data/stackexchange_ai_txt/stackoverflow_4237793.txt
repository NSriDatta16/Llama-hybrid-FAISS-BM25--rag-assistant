MySQL Error: "Unknown table engine 'InnoDBopt'"

I'm getting the following error on some code from an old app: A Database Error Occurred Error Number: 1286 Unknown table engine 'InnoDBopt' INSERT INTO `sessions` (`session_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `last_activity`) VALUES ('2ef196aba7f060308be6b7bc1133671f', '127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) Ap', 1290342372) I'm using MySQL version 5.1.36. This app was developed a while ago, so most likely I just need to downgrade my MySQL version to run this? If so, please advise what version I need to run this. Edit: To clarify, I had to copy my database from one mysql installation to another, so I copied everything inside `c:/mysql/data' to the other installation of MySQL, that's likely what's causing this issue.
