Why go for something so complicated? You can do it quite simply with a big enough dataset using convolutional neural network. There are tons of material available discussing the use of CNNs to image classification, MNIST digit recognition . Hope this helps. You can use PIL to extract pixel values. Though you will need labelled data.
