touchesbegan touches only registers one touch even with two fingers

i touch down at same time with two fingers. i get [touches count]=>1 and [[event allTouches] count] =>2 Shouldn't i get 2 for both of them? Also, when i first place 1 finger down then another on the same cell. The second finger event doesn't cause touchesBegan to drigger? Shouldn't it call touchesBegan twice? i have a table cell where i set: multipleTouchEnabled = YES; here is my touches began: -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"began touch count %d", [touches count]); NSLog(@"all touches %d", [[event allTouches] count]); }
