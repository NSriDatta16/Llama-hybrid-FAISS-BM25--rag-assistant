Visual Studio 2003 pre build script can't find 'svn' command

I'm using a script to get the subversion head revision number from a subversion repository derived from the script found at http://blog.guymahieu.com/2008/06/09/getting-the-svn-head-revision-number-from-a-windows-batch-file/ . The script works fine when called from a normal command line, but when calling the same batch file as pre-build-event with path $(ProjectDir)/../getSVNRev.bat the command svn is unknown. The path to svn.exe is in the standard system %Path% but it seems that VS uses another path. I echoed the %Path% variable in the batch file and the %Path% seems to be set to the VC++ binary path. I added the path to svn.exe to the VC++ binary path, got that echoed, but still the svn.exe was not found. I even copied svn.exe and all dlls into system32 but still, the command svn was unknown to the VS command line. Are there any other locations I should add the path, so that the pre-build event on VS.NET 2003 recognizes svn.exe? Thanks, Norbert
