The question was initially prompted by my need to build a lexical analyzer. getc() and ungetc() are useful at first (to get the read bugs out the way and to build the state machine) After the state machine is done, getc() and ungetc() become a liability as they take too long to read directly from storage. When the state machine was complete (debugged any IO problems, finalized the states), I optimized the lexical analyzer. Reading the source file in chunks (or pages) into memory and running the state machine on each page yields the best time result. I found that considerable time is saved if getc() and ungetc() are not used to read from the file directly.
