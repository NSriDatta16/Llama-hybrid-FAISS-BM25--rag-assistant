@user2974951 addresses the problem here. In order to determine which variables best predict bestselling books, you'd need to better define your population under study, which would have to include best-selling books in addition to non-best-selling books. For example, you may be able to obtain a list of books published and made available to the library of Congress in a given year. You would then need to cross-reference that list with, say the New York Times Best Seller list (you'll need to define "best-selling" more carefully too because there are many "best-seller" lists). Once you have identified best sellers, one approach is to use logistic regression. Using this approach, you could code a variable, say, best_seller , as 1 if the book is a best-seller and 0 otherwise. Once your dataset is properly coded and includes observations from both non-best sellers and best-sellers there are a number of approaches for determining the "most influential" variables in predicting best-sellers. You could use methods like simple regression with standardized coefficients, or better yet l ogistic regression . There are a number of other methods in machine learning that may be even better suited for this task such as the xgboost algorithms like adaboost . What you are after is essentially called variable importance or feature importance in the machine learning communities. If you search Cross-Validated on these terms, you'll find a number of methods that you can try out.
