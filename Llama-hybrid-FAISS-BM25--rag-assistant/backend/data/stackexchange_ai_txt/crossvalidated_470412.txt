Time Series with Monthly/Quarter Day Data

I have a .csv file where a large number of measurements were performed 4 times in a single day (at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 hours), once monthly for 12 consecutive months (Jan-Dec). Naturally, I'd like to get a time series to model this year of data, but there are a lot of measurements for each time-day-month (really time-month) combination. At each time-month, there are 3 discrete, numeric, non-time variables. 30 observations for Variable A 25 measurements for Variable B 45 measurements for Variable C Multiple other variables of interest, measured once at each A-B-C-time-month combination For a total of 33750 measurements per time, giving 135000 observations in a day. For a total of 1620000 observations in the entire year. (A*B*C*hr*mon = 30*25*45*4*12) I was hoping someone could help me set up this code in R . I don't think it's as simple as a ts() function in R , and I wasn't able to find anything super relevant or related to my problem. I'd appreciate some direction and/or help. I'm happy to help clarify any questions, but I can't provide any sample data, for reasons that will remain unsaid, but also because the data is too long to be simplified in any short format. Essentially what I started with is to do a group_by(Month,Time,A,B) %>% summarize() which gets all variance of Group A and B over Time. And I repeat that for B and C, A and C, and individually for A, B, and C. Then I can make a time series for each one of these. Is this approach appropriate for a time series analysis?
