How do I convert GAE TimeProperty to integer?

In this Python package there is this code: >>> dt = DateTime('Mar 9, 1997 13:45:00 US/Eastern') >>> dt.timeTime() 857933100.0 I would use this package but there is a warning: "Unless you need to communicate with Zope 2 APIs, you're probably better off using Python's bult-in datetime module." TimeProperty in GAE gives me something like this 02:37:31.797000 How do I convert it to a number as in the example so that I can add an integer to it and sort by the new value. I want to achieve some kind of weighed sort. Thanks. EDIT @Robert Kluin: Thanks; this works: >>> today = datetime.datetime.today().toordinal() >>> today 734086 >>> But I have a DateTime object that I am using in the query to sort; so this works: QUERY2 = Rep.all() QUERY2.filter("mAUTHOR =", user) QUERY2.order("-mDATE") RESULTS2 = QUERY2.fetch(10) But when I try this, it does not work: QUERY2 = Rep.all() QUERY2.filter("mAUTHOR =", user) QUERY2.order("-(datetime.datetime.mDATE.toordinal())") RESULTS2 = QUERY2.fetch(10) I get the error: PropertyError: Invalid property name '(datetime.datetime.mDATE.toordinal())' This is the value of mDATE as printed by the template: mDATE = 2010-11-10 05:38:55.340000
