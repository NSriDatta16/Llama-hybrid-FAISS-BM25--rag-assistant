SVM: intuition behind maximizing the margin

I do understand that SVM is about finding the classifier that maximize the margin. But what is the intuition there? Please don't go into the math. Thx More specifically, if someone ask you during an interview , what would you say about the motivation for maximizing the margin in SVM? Keep it simple, intuitive and better not math-related.
