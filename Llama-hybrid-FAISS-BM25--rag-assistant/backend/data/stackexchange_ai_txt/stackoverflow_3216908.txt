Class attributes reset when imported from package

I have a project that is organized something like project/ __init__.py builder.py component/ __init__.py Within builder.py , I have a class called Builder that has several class attributes in order to implement the Borg pattern. The trouble arises when I try to import Builder in component/__init__.py and make changes to class attributes. It seems that whatever changes I make to the class attributes in the package are undone when the function returns. UPDATE: Here is a simple example of what is happening. builder.py class Builder(object): attribute = True import component print Builder.attribute component/___init___.py from project.builder import Builder Builder.attribute = False Output: False True Judging by the fact that two lines are printed, I would guess that the code in builder.py is being executed twice, which resets the value of attribute to True.
