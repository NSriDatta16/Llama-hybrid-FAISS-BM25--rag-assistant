Let's approach this from the angle of a new programmer who wants to make some changes to the layout of your website. I'm not sure whether using a framework will make things better, more abstraction, more learning curve. I think you are on the right track with your organization. I usually create a default.css file which contains the markup for the default fonts, colors, link styles, etc. In this file, I treat the website if it were one big chunk of pretty formatted text with embedded pictures. No tag styling here. Usually this means that a lot of the formatting for the content is in there. But not that special button on the news page, that one gets a news.css on it's own. Usually websites can be divided into parts. Header, footer, sidebar, frontpage, newspage, agenda, etc. If for instance the footer needs to be red, it's nice to see a file footer.css which indeed contains the background color. If the link style in the footer is the same as in the sidebar, put the style declarations in both files. If the link style in the footer is the same as the main body text, it gets placed in default.css . Try to make sure it is in the first place you'd look as a new developer.
