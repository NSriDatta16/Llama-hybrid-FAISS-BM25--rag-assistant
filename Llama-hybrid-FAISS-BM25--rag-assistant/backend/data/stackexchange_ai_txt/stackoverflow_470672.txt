When is the right time and the wrong time to do the quick and dirty solution?

When is it the right time and when is it the wrong time to take the quick and dirty approach versus the proper elegant solution? This started from the comments on my question: Decode Base64 data in Java . I wanted a way to do something using only internal Java or something I wrote. The only built in way is to use the sun.* package which is unsupported. So when is it the right time and when is it the wrong time to take that approach?
