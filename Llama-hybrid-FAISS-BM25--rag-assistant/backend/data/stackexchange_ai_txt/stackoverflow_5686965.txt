The problem is that you have more variables than sample points and the principal component analysis that is being done is failing. In the help file for princomp it explains (read ?princomp ): ‘princomp’ only handles so-called R-mode PCA, that is feature extraction of variables. If a data matrix is supplied (possibly via a formula) it is required that there are at least as many units as variables. For Q-mode PCA use ‘prcomp’.
