The Airline Passengers dataset is a well-known time series forecasting dataset. Regarding the Airline Passengers dataset specifically, there may not be as much attention given to it in terms of competition or research, as it is a relatively small and simple dataset , with only 144 data points and the dataset exhibits clear seasonal patterns , which can be easily captured using simpler modelling techniques. and a well-known dataset that has been used for decades. So it's possible that many researchers have simply not found it to be a particularly interesting or challenging problem to solve . One reason there may not be a single state-of-the-art LSTM solution for this dataset is that time series forecasting is a complex task and there is no one-size-fits-all solution . Different models and techniques may work better for different datasets, depending on factors such as data characteristics, seasonality, trends, etc . Additionally, hyperparameter tuning can have a significant impact on the performance of a model , and there is no universally optimal set of hyperparameters that will work for all datasets. However, there have been many research papers and competitions focused on this problem, so I can provide some examples. In addition to the Airline Passengers dataset, there are several other well-known time series forecasting datasets that are often used to benchmark the performance of different models , including: M4 Competition dataset : A large collection of time series data from various domains with different characteristics used in the M4 forecasting competition. The competition has spurred much research into forecasting methods, including LSTM-based approaches. The M4 dataset is a collection of 100,000 time series used for the fourth edition of the Makridakis forecasting Competition. The M4 dataset consists of time series of yearly, quarterly, monthly and other (weekly, daily and hourly) data, which are divided into training and test sets. The minimum numbers of observations in the training test are 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series. The participants were asked to produce the following numbers of forecasts beyond the available data that they had been given: six for yearly, eight for quarterly, 18 for monthly series, 13 for weekly series and 14 and 48 forecasts respectively for the daily and hourly ones. Energy forecasting dataset : A dataset containing hourly electricity demand and weather data for a large metropolitan area, used for predicting electricity demand. This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric Espa√±a . Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public here. Traffic forecasting dataset : A dataset containing hourly traffic volume data from a major urban freeway, used for predicting traffic volume. This dataset contains the traffic data in San Bernardino from July to August in 2016, with 170 detectors on 8 roads with a time interval of 5 minutes. This dataset is popular as a benchmark traffic forecasting dataset. Traffic Prediction Dataset Retail forecasting dataset : A dataset containing daily sales data from a retail chain, used for predicting sales. Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting Walmart Sales Forecast Some state-of-the-art LSTM-based approaches for time series forecasting include: Transformers for Time Series Forecasting : This paper introduced a transformer-based model for time series forecasting called Temporal Fusion Transformers , which outperforms traditional LSTMs on several benchmark datasets. Transformers in Time Series: A Survey Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? DeepAR : This model was introduced by Amazon in 2017 and is based on an LSTM network. It uses a probabilistic forecasting approach and has been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods and other deep learning models on several benchmark datasets. GRU-D : This model was introduced in 2017 and is based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network. It includes a denoising module to remove noise from the input data, and has been shown to outperform traditional LSTMs and other deep learning models on several benchmark datasets. LSTM-FCN : This model was introduced in 2018 and combines a LSTM network with a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) . Recent papers that have used LSTMs for time series forecasting include: An Efficient Deep Learning Framework for Stock Price Forecasting Based on Stacked Bidirectional LSTM with Attention Mechanism by Huang et al.
