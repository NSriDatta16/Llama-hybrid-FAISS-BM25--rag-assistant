Essentially, you want to use mocks in your unit tests to simulate these exceptional cases. To test the First Bit of Code In your unit test, inject a mock of sqlMapClientTemplate that throws DataAccessException when queryForList is called. Your test should check that COBException in this case To test the second bit of code Two new tests Pass in a BindingResult that returns true for hasErrors() and then check that the ModelAndView has what you expect in it Inject a mock of reportSearch that generates a COBException . Not sure how to check what happened to assert something, but you could get coverage that way.
