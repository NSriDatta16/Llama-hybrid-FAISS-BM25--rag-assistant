I'd go simpler. Subclass UIControl and implement the touchesBegan: touchesMoved: and touchesEnded: methods. You can determine which star the user pressed/dragged/let up on with the X coordinate of the touch. For example: CGFloat relativeTouchLocation = [event locationInView:self] / self.bounds.size.width; Then it's just up to you to determine which stars are illuminated based on that value. Oh, and to send a UIControlEventValueChanged event. Obviously, you also override drawRect: to draw the stars in the view. Although Jason's solution above will work, your user won't be able to slide her finger across the control to fine-tune her rating. This would also give you the option of doing half-stars or other fine adjustments.
