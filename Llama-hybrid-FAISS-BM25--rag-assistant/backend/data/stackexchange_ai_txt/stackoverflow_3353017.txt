Whenever you want to change to markup (HTML), you generally have to do it with theming. You wont find modules that give you options to move things around. That just too much work, and you can never make every one happy. Instead they set up the module to be overridden and provide a sensible default that most can use. So with the Drupal theme kit, you generally have 3 options. Override a theme function. Override a template. Create a preprocess function. In this case, it looks like, there is a master template that organizes the initial post, the answers and the login option. You can find out if this is the case and how the page is created with devel themer . It's a good tool to help find templates and theme functions when you're new to Drupal theming.
