You should definitely check for permissions on every request. You should never rely on just input data for security! And remember if you can decrypt it, so can the malicious user who wants to hack in your site. Using a session to store permissions is a trade off security in favor of performance and I think it would be average security to do it. But still - if you have sensitive data - check on every request, every time. Don't optimize for few microseconds in the name of less security. As now I saw your real problem in a comment, I can suggest using some sort of additional hash for every refresh the user makes and save it in the session of the user. Then check if the user uses the same hash e.g.: $hash = md5(microtime()); $_SESSION['secret_user_hash'] = $hash; And put it in URLS like: &z= And after a user makes the request just check if it is the same hash. Keep in mind that if you are using heavy AJAX you should always update your hash, when you change it in the session. The best way i can think of is keeping an array in the session of random hashesh(e.g. 5) and use them on random for the query. So you have a bigger pool and you don't have to update after every request.
