How to connect to JMX agent using python

I am working on custom monitoring system to my server. the application is developed using python and Django. The server is running java web applications and I need to monitor the JVM under which the application server is running, so I start the applications with enable the JMX. Now I need to connect my python application to the JVM JMX agent. Is there any way to get that? I have read about the HtmlAdapterServer, that enable managing JMX MBeans from specific url but I do not know how can I use it? Thanks in advance and best regards
