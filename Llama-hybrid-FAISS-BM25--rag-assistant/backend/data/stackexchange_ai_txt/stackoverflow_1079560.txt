I usually end up saving the diagrams as Enhanced Metafile (*.emf) and then embedding the resulting image. This solves the size problem for most line drawings since metafiles are much more amenable to scaling and printing than raster formats. The downside is that you have to keep them in sync. I'd imagine that there is some method of automating this but I haven't found one if you are tied to using Word as your document format. As a programmer, I really like editing in something like DocBook. The image source can be an HTTP endpoint so image translation is pretty easy to automate with PHP or [insert your favorite web platform here] . Since the rendering is delayed until you publish as a PDF, you don't have to worry about things getting "out of sync". The downside is that I haven't found a good way to extract individual diagrams from a Visio file in a way that is conducive to this :( Maybe we will be really lucky and someone will write a nice whiz-bang editor or utility that generates SVG files from Visio or EMFs.
