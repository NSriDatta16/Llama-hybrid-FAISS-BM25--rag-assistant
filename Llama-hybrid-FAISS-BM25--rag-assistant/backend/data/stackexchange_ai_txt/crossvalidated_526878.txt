If your predictor is ordinal (i.e. ordered) and your response is categorical, you can do a logistic regression with polynomial contrasts . Your first idea of treating the grades as continuous numerical values is valid if you can fairly assume that grade 3 is as different from grade 2 as grade 4 is from grade 3 and so on i.e. the 'gaps' between your ordinal categories are similar. If instead you expect to see a much bigger change from (for example) grade 4 to grade 5, then this assumption does not hold and you should treat the data as ordinal and analyse it accordingly (with polynomial contrasts). Your second idea is an inefficient use of the data and is best avoided, since there are well-established methods to deal with the problem.
