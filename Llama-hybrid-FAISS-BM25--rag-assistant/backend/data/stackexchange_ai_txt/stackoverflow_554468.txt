License restrictions on including a DLL in another repo?

Answered : They don't allow any kind of redistribution with 2.6, supposedly, unless you have licenses for it. But they don't sell licenses for it. But they give it away free. But, who knows, i think they just want us to buy an overpriced thing we don't need to write a free utility. I guess I'll look at NVelocity or TaHoGen... I am concerned about placing some DLLs that go with a project, which is also free (on SF.net), but hasn't had a particular license associated with it yet. This is a bit lawerly, but hopefully not so much so that it can't be answered through experience. And there is a lot of that here :) I think the issues is really with CodeSmith 2.6 , since they have their own "custom" eula. To view the "sourcelicense.txt" you need to download the zip and open it, but i've copied the relevant parts into the post (sorry they are so long!) Edit: What the app does it use CodeSmith 2.6 dlls, along with a collection of custom templates, to generate class files/etc. We don't need the codesmith source, only the compiled result. Of course, those dll's will be distributed with the application in the .exe. The question is whether or not stuffing them in to the repo is somehow different (or legally more questionable) than putting them into a .msi/.exe installer. I'll approach codesmith about this, but I would like a better understanding than I have now, is all. They are currently not in the repo, but it would ease things for the dev processess if they were. End Edit 1 MIT Licensed component (doesn't seem like an issue) Mysql.Data.dll (not sure of the license) CodeSmith 2.6 Freeware DLLS Compiled to DLL form SchemaExplorer.dll / etc CodeSmith.Engine.dll I'd like to be able to make the project self hosting, and not have the user go traipsing around, downloading and/or compiling copies of the source (especially if they find a newer version or older verision, which could easily happen with the MIT/msql components.) There will be nice instructions if the DLLs can't be included, but life is infinitely simpler if they can, and there are no chances of the project going "dead" if one of them is suddenly yanked.
