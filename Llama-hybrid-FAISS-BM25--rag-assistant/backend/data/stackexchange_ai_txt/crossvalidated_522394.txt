Continuous Time Markov Chain - M/M/2 Queue throughput

First I find the stationary distribution of this problem by solving $\pi G=0$ to get $\pi \approx (0.20675105, 0.29535865, 0.05907173, 0.23628692, 0.1350211, 0.06751055)$ . Using $\pi$ , we can calculate the throughput of the system as $\sum_{i \in S} i\pi_i$ where $S = \{0,1M,1J,2,3,4\}$ and we simply let $1J=1M=1$ . Therefore, we get $\sum_{i \in S} i\pi_i = 1.503$ , which is greater than the arrival rate $\lambda = 1$ . Isn't this erroneous?
