Best Way to tackle to time series classification problem?

I have a dataset where the input is a dataset for ICU patients where each ICU stay has 40 features (20 vitals, 20 lab values) and multiple time steps (the stays' length is between 6 and 19-time steps). The output is the 20 lab values (represented as binary numbers where 1 means the lab value is in range and 0 is out of range). The task is to predict the future output for an input ICU stay. I have tried to make it a sequence to sequence problem where the output is a sequence shifted by a one-time step. However, the results were not good enough. The question is there a way to better tackle this problem? (like maybe windowing ?)
