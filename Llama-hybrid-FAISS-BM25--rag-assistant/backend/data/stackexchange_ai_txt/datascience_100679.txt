Should you look at the correlation between data points before using SVM to classify the data? Why?

Total beginner here, so apologies if this comes off as a wild question. I am learning how to classify data in SVM. I saw an example on Kaggle where someone had included a correlation matrix on the data points prior to classifying it. They didn't explain why. And so, I'm wondering... is there any merit to doing a correlation analysis on the data prior to classifying it? Several follow-ups to that as well: Does it (the correlation) show in any way that your data is appropriate for classification? And if not, is it possible to accommodate for that? If you know that two points have a very high correlation, is that a sign that the data set might be very good at classifying some of the data that you have, but not all of it? Will items that have low correlation act as "noise"? Thank you!!
