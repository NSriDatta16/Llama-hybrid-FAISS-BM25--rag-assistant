Java BitSet - wrapper to put chars/Strings in

I'm making use of BitSet in Java to store values I have to serialize and deserialize into/from lower abstraction levels. This is to create a file-format container. Currently I want to store a String into a BitSet: private BitSet string_to_bit(String content_string) { BitSet result = new BitSet(this.size); char[] content_string_arr = new char[content_string.length()]; for (char c : content_string_arr) { int tmp = (int) c; result += Integer.toBinaryString(tmp); } } The += is undefined on a BitSet, so the code is wrong at that point. Afaik I cannot override operators in Java 6. How would you elegantly wrap that operation? I don't want to end up repeating all these low level conversions over and over again because as it seems they repeat. Is there any .toBit equivalent? I can cast a BitSet to String with toString(). Why is there no de-abstraction? Best, Marius
