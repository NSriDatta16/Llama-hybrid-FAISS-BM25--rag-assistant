Split C char* for Spreadsheet Cell Reference

To outline: I have a parser that grabs Cell references using the following regex "$"?{letter}{1,2}"$"?{digit}{1,3} I cant seem to find an elegant way to split the resulting char* into its row, and column components. ex. split a1 into a and 1 or split $aa$4 into fixed_col a fixed row 4 Any help is appreciated.
