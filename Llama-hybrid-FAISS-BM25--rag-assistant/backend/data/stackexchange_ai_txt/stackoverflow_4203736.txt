Stop audio recorder on its own after time delay in c# ( using NAudio)

I am making an audio recorded using NAudio in C# and i need to remove the stop button used and simply stop the recording on its own after some time delay. The code for the record event is private void cmbRecord_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { outputFilename = "file address"; waveInStream = new WaveIn(44100,2); writer = new WaveFileWriter(outputFilename, waveInStream.WaveFormat); waveInStream.DataAvailable += new EventHandler (waveInStream_DataAvailable); waveInStream.StartRecording(); // Just controling the objects on the screen. cmbRecord.Enabled = false; cmbStop.Enabled = true; } void waveInStream_DataAvailable(object sender, WaveInEventArgs e) { writer.WriteData(e.Buffer, 0, e.BytesRecorded); int secondsRecorded = (int)(writer.Length / writer.WaveFormat.AverageBytesPerSecond); } The stop button is given as private void cmbStop_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { waveInStream.StopRecording(); waveInStream.Dispose(); waveInStream = null; writer.Close(); writer = null; cmbRecord.Enabled = true; cmbStop.Enabled = false; } I need to stop the recording automatically inside the cmbRecord_Click event. Thanks in advance.
