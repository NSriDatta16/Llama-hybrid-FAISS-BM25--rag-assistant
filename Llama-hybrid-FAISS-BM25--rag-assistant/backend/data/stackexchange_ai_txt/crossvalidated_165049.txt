According to the Hastie equation 14.31 (see also Halkidi et al. 2001 ), the within-cluster variance $W(C_{k})$ of a cluster $C_{k}$ is defined (for the Euclidean distance) as $\sum_{x_{i}\in{C_{k}}}\|x_{i}-\bar{x}_{k}\|^2$ , where $\bar{x}_{k}$ is the mean of cluster $C_{k}$ (also called the cluster centroid , its values are the coordinate-wise average of the data points in $C_{k}$), and {${x_{1}, ..., x_{N}}$} is the set of observations (they are vectors, i.e., one coordinate per dimension). In plain English, the cluster variance is the coordinate-wise squared deviations from the mean of the cluster of all the observations belonging to that cluster. The total within cluster scatter (for the entire set of observations) is simply $W=\sum\limits_{k=1}^K\sum_{x_{i}\in{C_{k}}}\|x_{i}-\bar{x}_{k}\|^2$ for K clusters and N observations with $K
