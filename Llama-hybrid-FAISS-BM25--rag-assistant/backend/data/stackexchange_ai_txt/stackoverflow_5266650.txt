First use MySQL select like $query = " SELECT CONCAT('\"',ifnull(firstname,''),'\",\"',ifnull(middlename,''),'\",\"',ifnull(lastname,''),'\"') FROM relatie WHERE relatie.id = ".$s." AND relatie.SomeOtherThing > 1 ORDER BY relatie.id LIMIT 1; "; $result = mysql_query($query); The ifnull's are very important because otherwise null fields in a CONCAT will make the whole CONCAT to be null, suppose middlename is null, this code will output something like: "Johan","","Smith" Without the ifnull's it will just output nothing, because the null-middlename will make the whole concat expression null. The Order by and limit are only needed if the id is not unique, because you said you only want one line. Next put a CSV header in and output the line you saved in $result earlier. header("Content-type: application/csv"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.csv"); header("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Expires: 0"); echo $result."\n";
