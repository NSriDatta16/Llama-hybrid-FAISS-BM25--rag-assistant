Usually the statement is false. The statistician should make sure that the chance of false inference is as low as possible. Sometimes that would involve minimising the type I error rate, but mostly is involves looking at the problem differently. In other words, there are many circumstances where the type I error rate should be of no interest, and in those circumstances the statement is wrong. The type I error rate relates to the global false positive error rate in a notional series of experiments, and it is useful in planning experiments and for testing hypotheses with an automatic decision rule. In many cases (most scientific cases, in my opinion) the statistician should be concerned with the more local question of what the data allow him to conclude about the state of the world in the context of this experiment. That may involve consideration of the actual p-value (as opposed to determining if it is above or below a threshold in a manner that is consistent with quantitation of long term type I errors) or inspection of a likelihood function or a Bayesian posterior probability distribution. Even if one is determined to work within a strictly frequentist framework it is sensible to examine the trade-of between type I and type II errors. It is unfortunate that we describe tests in terms that privilege type I errors over all other types of error.
