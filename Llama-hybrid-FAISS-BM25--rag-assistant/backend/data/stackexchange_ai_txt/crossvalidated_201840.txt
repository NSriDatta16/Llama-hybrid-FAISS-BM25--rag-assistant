Is it inherently invalid to use BIC for model averaging?

If I understand AIC/AICc vs. BIC correctly, AIC presumes that there is no "true" model and that any given model is simply a "best worst approximation". However, BIC presumes that there IS a "true" model and that the lowest BIC of a comparison represents the best approximation of the models present of that "true" model. So, why do people use BIC for model averaging? Doesn't that contradict an important assumption behind BIC? Is it merely because BIC penalizes more harshly for additional terms? If so, does that mean the premise of a "true" model really doesn't matter?
