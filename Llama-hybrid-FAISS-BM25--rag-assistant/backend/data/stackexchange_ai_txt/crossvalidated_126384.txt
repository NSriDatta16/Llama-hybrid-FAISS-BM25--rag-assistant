Sparse coding vs. sparse PCA, are they the same thing?

Are they the same thing? If not, could someone possibly explain the difference or point to the seminal papers describing the approaches? I am looking not for a detailed technical exposition, but a general taxonomy of the algorithms. For example, are both of them for dimensionality reduction?
