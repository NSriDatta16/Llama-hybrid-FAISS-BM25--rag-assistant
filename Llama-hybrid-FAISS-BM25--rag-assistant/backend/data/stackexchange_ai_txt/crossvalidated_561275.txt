This is worked out in the book ' Time Series Analysis and Its Applications With R Examples, Third Edition ' by Robert Shumway and David Stoffer. Following their notation, let an $ARMA(p, q)$ model be expressed as $\phi(B)x_t = \theta(B)w_t$ (see equation (3.21) in page 93 of the book ), where $\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z − \cdots − \phi_p z^p$ with $\phi_p \neq 0$ , $\theta(z) = 1 + \theta_1 z + \cdots + \theta_q z^q$ with $\theta_q \neq 0$ , $z$ is a complex number and $B$ is the backshift operator (see Definition 3.6, page 94 ). Then, an $ARMA(p, q)$ model is invertible if and only if $\theta(z) \neq 0$ for $|z| \le 1$ (see Property 3.2 in page 95 ). The way of proving this statement is also discussed there. Also check out these lectures notes . The stationarity of $ARMA(p, q)$ is ensured when all the (real and complex) roots $z_j$ of the polynomial $\phi(z)$ satisfy $|z_j| > 1$ (see page 11 of the lecture notes ), i.e., $\phi(z) \neq 0$ for $|z| \le 1$ . In the particular case of $ARMA(1,1)$ , $\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1 z$ and $\theta(z) = 1 + \theta_1 z$ . So, it is invertible and stationary if $0 .
