cobertura in eclipse

I just installed ecobertura plugin, but it looks like not a very user-friendly tool from within eclipse. is there any good plugin for cobertura in eclipse or article to describe how to use ecobertura? I'm used to seeing code complexity and coverge etc in a very nice way. I need to use cobertura, because the build system in the back-end uses it, so it makes sens to use it in the IDE as well. Regards
