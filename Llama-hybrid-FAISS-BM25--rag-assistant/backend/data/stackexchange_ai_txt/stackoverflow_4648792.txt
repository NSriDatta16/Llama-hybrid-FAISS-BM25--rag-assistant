Is there a python module to parse Linux's sysfs?

Hey all, Linux has a lot of great features in procfs and sysfs , and tools like vmstat extend that quite a bit, but I have a need to collect data from a variety of these systems and was hoping to leverage a unified Python utility instead of hacking together a bunch of disparate scripts. In order to do that I first need to identify whether or not Python has the bits and pieces I need to adequately parse/process the different data collection points. So, the essence of my question: Is there a python module that handles/parses the sysfs objects already? I've looked for such a beast via Google, usenet, and various forums, but I haven't yet found anything intelligent or functional. So, before I carve one out, I figured I'd check here first.
