Don't check in dead code in the production tree. If you think you might have some use for that code some day in the future, check it in to your personal repository. Anything that is in the product tree has an associated cost - code review, test coverage, design doc, public API description, thread modeling, maintenance, and so on. Paying that cost for code that is not used means you have less to spend on actual features for your users.
