Adding arbitrary data to an image without affecting usability

I want to include certain information about an image in the image itself. The requirement, i think, is different from the meta data (which i think talks about specific information such as author, date taken etc). The information i want to include may be some random bytes. The image should be still viewable in any standard image viewer. I dont want to "hide" the bytes (m not looking for steganography). I merely want that i can access these bytes from my own application (say Java based) and use / modify the same.
