"implemented" vs "future promise" text scoring in NLP

Are there any pretrained NLP models or even analytical techniques to classify or score sentences from election speech into "implemented" and "future promise" categories. Essentially, we aim to distinguish between text that describes something that has already been implemented or achieved and text that describes something with potential or promise for the future. e.g. For "implemented" category: Since our regime from last 5 years, we have ensured your village has 24 x 7 electricity. e.g. For "future promise" category: If we get elected, we will bring 24 x 7 electricity in your region.
