Write a interface for the EXE and have your main form or main class implement it. Then register that object implementing the interface with the DLL. Assign it to a variable of the that interface type Make a Subroutine that is visible throughout the DLL. In the Subroutine check to see if the variable is nothing if isn't then the subroutine that fires method you created to fire DoEvents. Anytime you need to do a DoEvents then call the Subroutine. If you are using a three tier organization for your application put the subroutine or variable on the object representing your entire application. Have the form register itself with the Application object. If you have re-entrancy problems you can add status variable and other helper functions to safely check what the application is doing. Note that is far far easier to implements this if you are using some type of multi-tier design. To other looking at this re-entrancy is a problem however so is a non-responsive UI. In a complex application there are circumstances where you have to let the event loop fire.
