Ways to check if the browser is authentic?

I was thinking of setting up some kind of mechanism to avoid wget/cURL/etc to download, then again wget/curl can put a fake user agent so my question is more like if someone can confirm this will work For example, the user want to download a file, at the content disposition URL I can make javascript checks (silly stuff, like send some hash using JS, return it to me then we'll see if you are an authentic browser) If that have some cons it'll be great to know other methods
