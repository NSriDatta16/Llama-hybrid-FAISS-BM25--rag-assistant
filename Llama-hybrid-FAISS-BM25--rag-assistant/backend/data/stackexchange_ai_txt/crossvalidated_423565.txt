Bayesian regression not normal

Let's say Im trying to do a bayesian linear regression and I have some strong prior on the parameters x1,...,xn. However, after collecting my data I can clearly see the residuals are not normally distributed, and thus can't calculate the likelihood correctly. What should I do? Use a transformation? Thanks
