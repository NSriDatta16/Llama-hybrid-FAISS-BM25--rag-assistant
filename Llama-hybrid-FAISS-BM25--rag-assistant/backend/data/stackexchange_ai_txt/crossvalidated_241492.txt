How to analyze results of this experiment?

I used a Definitive Screening Design plan to examine which of the parameters $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_6$ have significant influence on the response $Y$. The design plan consists of $13$ treatments. A treatment is a combination of low, medium and high levels of the factors. I have repeated all the treatments on the same set of subjects. The number of subjects is $n=30$. Let $Y_{i,j}$ denote the response measured in the $j$th subject when exposed to the $i$th treatment. I am not certain how to proceed. Can I compute the average response for each treatment: $$\overline{Y_i} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Y_{i,j}$$ and then try to fit a linear model to these $13$ data points? For example: $$\beta_0 + \beta_1A_1 + \beta_2A_2 + \beta_{11}A_1^2 + \beta_{34}A_3A_4$$ I would then test the hypotheses $H_0: \beta = 0$ vs $H_a: \beta \neq 0$ for each $\beta$. A DSD plan that I used allows us to estimate main effects and also pure quadratic and two-way interaction terms.
