I'm growing fond of collectd , a modular C daemon focusing on monitoring (rather than graphing) with a multitude of plugins : Read - the usual CPU , I/O , network , load , memory and JMX as well as some more interesting ones like the ability to monitor DNS requests by sniffing packets, monitor latency/connectivity , and 'tail' a logfile to monitor things like SSH login attempts or incoming emails Write - send readings to a CSV file , remote host , RRDtool , Unix socket , webserver Notify - via libnotify or email Bindings - to Perl , Python and (most importantly for your purposes) Java There would seem to be several options for getting metrics into your Java code: in-process, using the aforementioned Java plugin to register a write callback to receive data from the various other plugins over the network, by embedding jcollectd (a Java implementation of collectd's protocol) into your app indirectly, by writing to a CSV or RRD file and using one of the various RRD implementations for Java
