@Carlos: In his article Tim Bray recommends this (as does another post by Google ), but unfortunately it is not being applied by all tablet manufacturers. ... We recommend that manufactures of large-form-factor devices remove "Mobile" from the User Agent... Most Android tablet user-agent strings I've seen use mobile safari, e.g. the Samsung Galaxy Tab: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2; en-us; SCH-I800 Build/FROYO) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1 So at the moment I am checking on device names to detect Android tablets. As long as there are just a few models on the market, that's ok but soon this will be an ugly solution. At least in case of the XOOM, the mobile part seems to be gone: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 3.0; en-us; Xoom Build/HRI39) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.13 But as there are currently only tablets with Andorid 3.x, checking on Android 3 would be enough.
