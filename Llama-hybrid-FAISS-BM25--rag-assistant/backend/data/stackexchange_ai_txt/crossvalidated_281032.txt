This problem seems ideally suited to Bayesian Decision Theory as it is essentially a gambling problem. It is a case where the differences between Frequentist and Bayesian methods are important. Bayesian methods have the statistical property that they are coherent, whereas Frequentist methods are not coherent. A probability is coherent if a bookie, which is what the carpark management is, can state prices for a gamble in such a way that no actor or combination of actors could game the system and cause a sure loss for the bookie. Indeed, you have a tremendous advantage in that you have three months of customer specific data and you have plenty of modeling power. Bayesian decision theory, in this case, would not be very far from LASSO. The likelihood function might change and the prior might change. Indeed, if they do not, LASSO and Bayesian posterior analysis will provide the same point estimates. Still, you may not want to use those point estimates. The critical example in Thomas Bayes' An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances has been popular lately and provides a reason to go the extra step outside posterior analysis. While Bayes example is a square table, essentially a square billiards table denoted ABCD, we will go into a simplified equivalent to see the difference. Suppose a random number is generated in the open set (0,1) and the value is kept hidden. The hidden value will be denoted $\theta$. You and I play a game where a random number is generated and if the newly generated number is less than $\theta$ then I get one point, otherwise, you get one point. The newly generated numbers are not observed, merely the outcome. The first person to six points wins the game. I have five points and you have three points, what is the probability that you will win? This, of course, could be "what is the probability that a particular space is occupied?" The standard frequentist estimator is $5/8$ for me and $3/8$ for you. You have to score three points in a row so your chance is $\frac{3}{8}^3$. You have roughly 5.27% chance of winning under Frequentist calculations. The Bayesian calculation is different. You have to set a prior distribution for possible probabilities for $\theta$. Since all are equally likely, $\Pr(\theta)\propto{1}$. The likelihood function, in this case, is $\theta^5(1-\theta)^3$. This integrates to $$\Pr(\theta=\Theta)=504(1-\theta)^3\theta^5,\forall\theta\in\Theta$$. Leaving a distribution over $\theta$ which is not at all useful if we need a point measurement to place a gamble with, such as a fixed probability of winning. This is where the Bayesian method and the Frequentist method part calculations. I want to consider all possible parameters that could result in five wins for me and three wins for you, in proportion to their actual probability of a value being the true value. Then I want to make a prediction as to what the chances of you winning are, in order to price the gamble. The Bayesian predictive distribution is: $$\int_{\theta\in\Theta}\mathcal{L}(\text{future wins}|\theta)\pi(\theta|\text{historical wins})\mathrm{d}\theta,$$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood function and $\pi$ is the posterior probability. In this example the solution would be $$\Pr(\text{3 future wins for you})=\int_0^1[1-\theta]^3\times{504}(1-\theta)^5\theta^3\mathrm{d}\theta=.0909.$$ Which is correct? The Bayesian one is correct. The difference is that one is $(1-E(p))^3$ and the other is $E[(1-p)^3]$. You can test this by simulating millions of parameters and keeping those whose outcome is 5:3 and then generating outcomes if you want to test this by Monte Carlo. I would construct a simple microeconomic model with a person-specific unknown parameter of being present at time $t_i$ and the constraint that the number of parking spaces being used at any point in time $i$ must be less than or equal to the total spaces with some very high probability of certainty. I would solve the posterior density for each actor and simplify as much as possible. I would create a weak prior that included outside information such as holiday schedules, guesses as to peak vacation season and so forth since you only have three months of data. I would prefer a robust but weak model to a strong model given the amount of time that has been observed. You do not know about the impact of holidays, weekends, vacations, illnesses and business events on parking cycles. Then I would impose a predictive distribution with a cost function. It would depend upon the cost of the garage for being wrong and putting someone in another person's spot versus the cost of being wrong and having nobody in a spot. As to my likelihood, it would probably be some form of logistic type function.
