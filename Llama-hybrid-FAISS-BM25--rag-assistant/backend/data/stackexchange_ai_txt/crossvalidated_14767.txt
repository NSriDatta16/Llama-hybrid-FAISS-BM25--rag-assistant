I would greatly consider looking into Latent Dirichlet Allocation. It's not a clustering algorithm, but rather a topic model -- individual stores would be modeled as mixes of underlying themes. Different types of customers would have varying likelihoods based on particular themes. It is a fully generative, Bayesian model, so you get some very detailed information about the themes in each store, and the customer properties associated with themes. There is a free C version of it that you can use; otherwise, a Gibbs Sampling package like BUGS can fit the model using a fairly straightforward of the Bayesian network underlying the model.
