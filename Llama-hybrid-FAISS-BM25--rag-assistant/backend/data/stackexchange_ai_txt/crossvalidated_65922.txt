I have no idea but I can guess based on how I would do it. I would take a reinforcement learning approach. Essentially, have an agent that takes an action (to decrease or increase the price of an item) based on the observed state of the system (traffic, season, other factors idk...) and the agent would then get some sort of reward (sales, margin, idk...). So some kind of simulation (or actual experiments) would occur in which the agent would learn the optimal price policy to take given the state that it is in in terms of maximizing reward. This is analogous to the bandit problem since some sort of pricing exploration has to be done initially. I can't really assume that this method would be tractable though (millions of items!)
