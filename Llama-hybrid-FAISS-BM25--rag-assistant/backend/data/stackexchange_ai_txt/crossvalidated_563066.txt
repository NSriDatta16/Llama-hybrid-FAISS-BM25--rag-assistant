I have not read the code but assume, that will be ok. When you ask your computer for the best fitting straight line through your data, it is very confident about which ist the best fitting straight line. That is why your posterior is so narrow and that has nothing to do with whether a straight line is a good idea in this case. Whether you are going Frequentist oder Bayesian, you have to analyse your residuals and when you plot the residuals against your x you will find that there is a pattern/problem. A narrow posterior is not a replacement for analysis of residuals.
