jQuery UI Dialog - modal window temporarily covers dialog during effect

My modal window covers the dialog for the duration of the effect that brings it in - as if the z-index bringing it to the top only kicks in once the effect has ended. Anyone any ideas?! The code is below... Of course if I don't use a show effect then it comes straight to the fore and isn't a problem. $(function(){ var dialogOpts = { autoOpen: false, height: 400, width: 800, position: ["center", "center"], modal: true, closeOnEscape: true, stack: false, draggable: false, hide: "clip", show: "clip" }; $("#why").dialog(dialogOpts);
