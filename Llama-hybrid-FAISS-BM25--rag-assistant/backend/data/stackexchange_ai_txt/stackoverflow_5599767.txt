The simple answer is "no." The actual space a document takes up in Mongo's files is variable, but it isn't the maximum document size. The DB engine watches to see how much your documents tend to change after insertion and calculates the padding factor based on that. So it changes all the time. If you're curious, you can see the actual padding factor and storage space of your data using the .stats() function on a collection in the mongo shell. Here's a real-world example (with some names changed to protect the innocent clients): {14:42} ~/my_directory âž­ mongo MongoDB shell version: 1.8.0 connecting to: test > show collections schedule_drilldown schedule_report system.indexes > db.schedule_report.stats() { "ns" : "test.schedule_report", "count" : 16749, "size" : 60743292, "avgObjSize" : 3626.681712341035, "storageSize" : 86614016, "numExtents" : 10, "nindexes" : 3, "lastExtentSize" : 23101696, "paddingFactor" : 1.4599999999953628, "flags" : 1, "totalIndexSize" : 2899968, "indexSizes" : { "_id_" : 835584, "WeekEnd_-1_Salon_1" : 925696, "WeekEnd_-1_AreaCode_1" : 1138688 }, "ok" : 1 } So my test collection has about 16,749 records in it, with an average size of about 3.6 KB ( "avgObjSize" ) and a total data size of about 60 MB ( "size" ). However, it turns out they actually take up about 86 MB on disk (" storageSize ") because of the padding factor. That padding factor has varied over time as the collection's documents have been updated, but if I inserted a new document right now , it'd allocate 1.46 times as much space as the document needs ( "paddingFactor" ) to avoid having to move things around if I change it later. To me that's a fair size/speed tradeoff.
