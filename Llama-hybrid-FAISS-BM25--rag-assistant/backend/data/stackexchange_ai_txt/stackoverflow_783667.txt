I just experienced a somewhat similar experience with setting Notepad++ as my external editor with msysgit1.6.2.2 . The key was to realize the wrapper was not a DOS script, but a /bin/sh script. So try to put in your ".bat" (even though it is not exactly a bat script, the extension is not important here): #!/bin/sh # diff is called by git with 7 parameters: # path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode "C:/Programs/SourceGear/DiffMerge/DiffMerge.exe" /title1="Old Version" "$2" /title2="New Version" "$5" | cat Do not worry about making all the ' \ ' go ' / ': it is done by the Git scripts calling the external diff tool. I did not test it with DiffMerge, but with WinMerge, it works just fine, both from a DOS session or a Git Shell. #!/bin/sh "C:/Program Files/WinMerge/WinMergeU.exe" -e -ub "$2" "$5" | cat (with the ' -e ' option, I have just ot type on ' ESC ' to close and quit the diff tool: that works great!) average_geek adds in the comments: added the ' /bin/sh ' header and tried running git diff again. This time the error is: Unexpected parameter 'C:/Docume~/avggeek/LOCALS~1/Temp/.diff_b08444 Is there a way to see what are the parameters getting passed when I call git diff ? 1/ There actually is a way to see what are the parameters getting passed! Add the following line in the C:\Program Files\Git\libexec\git-core\git-sh-setup file: git_editor() { : "${GIT_EDITOR:=$(git config core.editor)}" : "${GIT_EDITOR:=${VISUAL:-${EDITOR}}}" case "$GIT_EDITOR,$TERM" in ,dumb) echo >&2 "No editor specified in GIT_EDITOR, core.editor, VISUAL," echo >&2 "or EDITOR. Tried to fall back to vi but terminal is dumb." echo >&2 "Please set one of these variables to an appropriate" echo >&2 "editor or run $0 with options that will not cause an" echo >&2 "editor to be invoked (e.g., -m or -F for git-commit)." exit 1 ;; esac #### ADD THIS LINE BELOW echo >&2 "editor is ${GIT_EDITOR:=vi} $@." #### END ADDITION ABOVE eval "${GIT_EDITOR:=vi}" '"$@"' } You will see what editor is being called, with what parameter. Now, regarding the "Unexpected parameter" part: I did have the same kind of error when I called WinMergeU.exe with " /e /ub " instead of " -e -ub ", so first question is: Are you sure that the " /title1 " bit could not be used as " -title1 " or " -t1 " or " --title1 " or " --t1 " ? That is what Is can see from the chapter 9 "Command Lines Arguments" of the pdf documentation of DiffMerge . If not, I suspect some double quotes are in order for delimiting properly the different parameters. Something like: "/title1="Old Version"" "$2" "/title2="New Version"" "$5" or "/title1=\"Old Version\"" "$2" "/title2=\"New Version\"" "$5" But my money would rather be on the " -title1 " or " -t1 " form: -t1="Old Version" "$2" -t2="New Version" "$5" should work just fine.
