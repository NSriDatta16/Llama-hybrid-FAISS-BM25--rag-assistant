Facing problem with XLWT and XLRD - Reading and writing simultaneously

I am facing a problem with xlrd and xlwt. Pasting the sample code below. from xlwt import Workbook, Formula, XFStyle import xlrd book = Workbook() sheet1 = book.add_sheet('Sheet 1') myFontStyle = XFStyle() myFontStyle.num_format_str = '0.00' sheet1.write(0,0,10, myFontStyle) sheet1.write(0,1,20, myFontStyle) sheet1.write(1,0,Formula('AVERAGE(A1:B1)'), myFontStyle) book.save('formula.xls') wb = xlrd.open_workbook('formula.xls') sh = wb.sheet_by_index(0) for rownum in range(sh.nrows): print sh.row_values(rownum) The idea is to write some values to Excel file, have some excel specific functions like LogNormal, StdDev etc and read the calculated values using XLRD. By running the above code, I get the following results which are undesirable:- [10.0, 20.0] [u'', ''] Ideally I should have got 15 on the second row. It writes the Excel perfectly when I open it but XLRD does not return the results. I am stuck with this for a very critical project. Request you to kindly respond earliest. Thanks and Regards Tarun Pasrija
