AUC variance for estimators with randomness (e.g. Random Forest)

I know that we can calculate the standard error for the AUC for all estimators, assuming that the conditional density is fixed. What I'd like to do, however, is additionally account for the randomness in certain estimators such as random Forest. I know that we can do a nonparametric bootstrap, where we resample and refit the estimator each time. However, I'm looking for a less computationally expensive approach. Thanks!
