Let me extent the answer of Anurag Uniyal a little bit class X(object): def __init__(self, y=None): if y is None: # y wasn't specified, create an empty list self.y = [] else: # y was specified, use it try: self.y = list(y) #create y's copy so that the original # variable is safe except TypeError: # ooops, couldn't create a list. We might warn # the user or something. Oh, nevermind self.y = []
