"Welcome to the SPNEGO SourceForge project Integrated Windows Authentication in Java The intent of this project is to provide an alternative library (.jar file) that application servers (like Tomcat) can use as the means for authenticating clients (like web browsers). If your organization is running Active Directory (AD) and all of your web applications go through Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS), and IIS has Integrated Windows Authentication enabled, and everyone in your organization is using Internet Explorer (IE), then this project may not be of any interest to you."
