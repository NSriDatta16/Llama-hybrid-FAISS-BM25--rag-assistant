How to marginalise this?

I came across this example in one of my lectures, but am unable to figure out how to carry out the marginalisation over c. In the context of bayesian networks: For the first expression, it is obtained by reading the conditional independence assertations from the graph: $p(ABC) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c)$ From the LHS of the first expression we can get: $\Sigma_cp(ABC) = p(AB)$ But for the RHS of the first expression how to we get from: $\Sigma_c(p(A)p(C|A)p(B|C)) = p(A)p(B|A)$
