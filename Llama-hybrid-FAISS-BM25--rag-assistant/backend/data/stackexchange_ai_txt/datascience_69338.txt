Building a tag-based recommendation engine given a set of user tags?

Basically, the idea is to have users following tags on the site, so each users has a set of tags they are following. And then there is a document collection where each document in the collection has a Title, Description, and a set of tags which are of relevance to the topic being discussed in the document as determined by the author. What is the best way of recommending documents to the user, given the information we have, which would also take into consideration the semantic relevance of the title and description of a document to the user's tags, whether that be a word embeddings solution or a tf-idf solution, or a mix, do tell. I still don't know what I'm going to do about tag synonyms, it might have to be a collaborative effort like on stackoverflow, but if there is a solution to this or a pseudo-solution, and I'm writing this in C# using the Lucene.NET library, if that is of any relevance to you.
