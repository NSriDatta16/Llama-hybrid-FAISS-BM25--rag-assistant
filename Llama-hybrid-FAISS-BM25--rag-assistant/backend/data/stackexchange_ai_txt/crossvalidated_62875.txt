How can posterior be persisted and reconstituted as future prior?

Suppose I model a data generating process as a hierarchal model and have made some training observation from the process. To learn about the process, with the observations I run the bayesian machinery to calculate posterior for the stochastic parameters of the model. Now I would like to be able to throw out the observations and just use the posterior I got in the learning process as prior for learning from the next set of observations. For cases where I don't have conjugate prior story, I am not sure how one can persist the state of posterior (while throwing away all your observations) so that it can be used as prior for the next observation? Any thoughts?
