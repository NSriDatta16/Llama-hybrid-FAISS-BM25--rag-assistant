How can I retrieve the citations for a given book using the Amazon API?

I know of a website which, if given the ISBN, populates all the information like author, pages, and even images of a book, using Amazon. How is this done? I am trying to compile a reading list. I have a seed reading list of books and I want to collect the bibliography of those books and then I want to find out which book is the most cited and then I would be able to find the most important books to read. But right now all I see is to parse their webpages which is not a very pleasant and elegant way of doing this.
