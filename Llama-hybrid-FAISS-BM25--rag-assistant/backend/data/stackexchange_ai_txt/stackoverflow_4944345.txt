I have a Galaxy S and the only real "bug" with it I know of is the RFS filesystem that slows anything doing storage I/O down to a crawl. How are you loading the HTML? Do you just pass an http:// URL to the webview? If so, what URL? For a 100 bounty I'll be happy to help debug if you give this information... :) In the meantime, try seeing if webView.getSettings().setCacheMode(LOAD_NO_CACHE); makes a difference. That will force it to not use the storage-based cache, which on a Galaxy S could indeed be mightily slow.
