If your class is a subclass of UIButton for example, you can open the Library in Interface Builder and it will be under the classes tab when you search for it and you can drag and drop. You can also just drag/drop a UIButton and set its class in the inspector pane. However, because you have your own .xib that might mess it up, in which case just ignore me.
