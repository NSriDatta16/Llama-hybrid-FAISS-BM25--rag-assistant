I'm not quite sure I understand you right, but I would have started with a frame holding the image and it's description. I would then use a TFlowPanel to hold instantiations of the frame. There shouldn't be to much work to implement drag and drop, I think. Never tried, though. If there is a lot images, you should go for a ownerdraw and doublebuffered solution, I think. In the end, you should just drop in the laser projection component and hook it up to the laser projector steering unit...
