The code fragment you've shown for managing table cells looks fine. From your description, it sounds like the bottleneck is actual data retrieval from the server (web service?). Are you making the web service call(s) on the main thread or a separate thread? If you are not doing so already, perhaps you could call the web services on a separate thread and create "placeholder" cells that are refreshed later once the web service completes. This should keep the UI responsive, though you wouldn't necessarily see the data in each cell immediately (e.g., it might say "loading" or something similar until the data is available).
