search functionality on multi-language django site

I'm building a multi-language Django site, and I'm using django-transmeta for my model data translations. Now I'm wondering if there is a Django search app that works with multi-language models. I've played with Haystack and it works fine for single-language sites, but I can't get it to work with transmeta's metaclasses... Does anybody have any experience with this? Any pointers would be appreciated! cheers, martin
