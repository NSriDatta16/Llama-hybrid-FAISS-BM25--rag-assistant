The CasualImpact package is essentially a time series package. It uses Bayesian structure time series models, so the pre period can be thought of as a training period, used to determine the relationship between the response variable and the covariates. I don't know what your data looks like but it seems to me that you have a time series with 4 observations. That means that you are trying to train your model with only 2 observations. The package requires 3 observations but you should probably have much more than that, because you cannot do reliable inference with 2 data points. If you have data on different individuals for those 4 days then you may be able to estimate a diff-and-diff model, which will suits better your data.
