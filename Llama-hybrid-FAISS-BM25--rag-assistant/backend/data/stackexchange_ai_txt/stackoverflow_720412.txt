GridSplitter is hidden by WinForm element

I am working in a WPF application. And my problem is regarding the GridSplitter visiblity. In my xaml code,I am maitaining a Grid. In the 3rd row of Grid, I am hosting a Winform DataGridView. In the same row, the GridSplitter is written. When GridSplitter is dragged to adjust Grid Row sizes, for other controls like Buttons etc it is properly visible. But when it comes over the DataGridView which I am hosting, the GridSplitter hides behind the hosted control. In fact, whatever I host instead of Datagridview,makes the GridSplitter hide behind it, when it is dragged. I tried setting the ZIndex for GridSplitter. It did not make any difference. Can anyone help me with this? Following is my XAML sample code:- Thanks.
