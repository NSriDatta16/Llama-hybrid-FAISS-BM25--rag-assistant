Why is there heteroskedasticity even though no relationship seems present in the residual plot?

I estimated a random effects panel model and performed the Breusch-Pagan (BP) test for heteroskedasticity. The test is significant, meaning that there is heteroskedasticity. However, the residual plot seems not to have a clear fanning-in our fanning-out pattern. Also, even after removing outliers with very low or high residuals, the BP test remains significant. How should I interpret the significance of the test that is in contrast with the residual plot? Residual plot before removing outliers (sig BP test): Residual plot after removing outliers (also sig BP test): The model I use is the following: plm(ln(gini_eurostat) ~ ln(intraEU_trade_bymemberstate_pct) + FDI_in_pctGDP + FDI_out_pctGDP + unempl_pct + lnpop + marketcap_pctGDP + naturalresources_pctGDP + ln(socialbenefits) + ln(tech_exports_pctexports) + ln(GDP_percap_constantLCU) + ln(intraEU_trade_bymemberstate_pct) * lowGDP_percap_currentUSD, data=pdf, model="random")
