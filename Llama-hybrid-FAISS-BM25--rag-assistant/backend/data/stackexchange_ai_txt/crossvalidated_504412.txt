Standard object classes/structures for common statistical outputs There are some special object types that have been developed in R to represent particular kinds of statistical outputs. For example, there are objects of class htest that are used to represent the outputs of a hypothesis test, and objects of class lm , glm , etc., used for the outputs of statistical models. However, there are a number of common statistical outputs that do not have special classes/structures developed. As a result, they tend to be represented in an ad hoc manner. It would be useful for common statistical outputs to have a defined class and structure in the base program, with consistent elements and printing method. Here are some examples of particular outputs that would benefit from having a developed class/structure, with associated custom print methods, etc. Giving these and other important statistical outputs a standard class/structure would allow users to develop, compute and print these outputs in a way that includes all required information and gives user-friendly print output. Sets could be represented by appropriate objects such as is presently in the sets package. Having sets as objects in the program would be useful for a number of statistical outputs. Confidence intervals/sets could be represented as an object of class ci that includes a set object giving the confidence interval/set, the confidence level, the name/description of the parameter or quantity for the interval, and any other required information. Highest density regions (HDRs) could be represented as an object of class hdr that includes the set object giving the HDR, the coverage probability, and any other required information.
