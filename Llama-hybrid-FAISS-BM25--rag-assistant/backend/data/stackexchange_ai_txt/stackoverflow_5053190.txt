You didn't state whether you mean keep login state transiently, or across restarts of the Silverlight application. If the former, you can just store it in a variable. The Silverlight process runs on the client machine and thus has a one-to-one relationship with that user. If the latter, you could consider storing a token in isolated storage. When the application starts, you can check for the presence of this token and pass it to the server if found.
