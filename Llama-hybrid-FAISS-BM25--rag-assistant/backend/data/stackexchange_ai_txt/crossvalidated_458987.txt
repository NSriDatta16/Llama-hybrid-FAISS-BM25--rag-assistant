The regret measure of $$\operatorname{Regret}(T)=\sum_{t=1}^T{f_t(w_t)}-\min_u \sum_{t=1}^T{f_t(u)}$$ is the difference between the cumulative loss of the player and that of the best fixed decision in hindsight. So as you have already observed, the measure implicitly assumes that there is a reasonably good decision over all iterations. The measure is thus not suitable in non-stationary environments and is sometimes called static regret. There are two mainstream measures for tacking non-stationary environments: adaptive regret : ensuring static regret in any small interval (this is exactly the measure mentioned by @Sebastiaan); dynamic regret : ensuring a small regret with a changing comparator sequence (I will focus on this measure). The definition of dynamic regret is as follows, $$\mbox{D-Regret}_T(u_1,\ldots,u_T) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_t(w_t) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_t(u_t).$$ So you can see the comparators $\{u_1,\ldots,u_T\}$ here are allowed to change over iterations instead of a fixed one in the static regret. The dynamic regret bounds will typically involve a term measuring the non-stationarity of environments, for example, $P_T = \sum_{t=2}^{T} \| u_t - u_{t-1}\|$ . The notion of dynamic regret is also called tracking regret/ shifting regret in the early development of prediction with expert advice. For online convex optimization (OCO), the pioneering work [1] first introduces this measure, [2] establishes the lower bound and designs an optimal algorithm for OCO, [3] extends the idea to bandit convex optimization scenarios.
