I recently looked for the best method for clustering comparison and I can safely state that the best one (for independence from the number of clusters and selecting bias in random tests) is the so-called adjusted random index. Other techniques have bloomed around but reading about it seems not necessary because this measure has all the 'good qualities'. A standard article to read about is: Vinh, N. X., Epps, J. & Bailey, J. Information Theoretic Measures for Clusterings Comparison: Variants, Properties, Normalization and Correction for Chance. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 11, 2837â€“2854 (2010). . I do not agree with the first answer as the clusteval package has only the simple rand index which is not adjusted for random bias (i.e. tends to be good for large number of clusters really easily - see article). As there are many packages having the ARI measure I tested the efficiencies and the best is hands down the C implementation in phyclust with the RRand() function ( phyclust::RRand ). It takes microseconds for 150 labeled numbers with 50 clusters. For the t-sne vs pca go for t-sne. It is like MIC for correlation. Just better. Obviously, it can be cumbersome to calculate for big data-set so pay attention. It is implemented in Rtsne . Check this tutorial out about the two methods compared.
