It depends a bit what makes sense here, but if you think that what you are interested in is views per item, then a Poisson distribution may make sense. I.e. $$\text{Views} \sim \text{Poisson}(\text{items} \times \lambda).$$ For a single Poisson rate, $\lambda$ - or in the case that you think that the views/item rates have nothing to do with each other for the different products - a Gamma distribution would be conjugate . If you parameterize it in terms of shape $\alpha$ and rate $\beta$, then the posterior has shape parameter $\alpha+\text{Views}$ and rate parameter $\beta+\text{items}$. If you think that the rates might be similar (in the sense of exachangeability that you could not predict up-front which rate would be lower or higher than the others), you might want to go down the empirical Bayes route. In that case you would estimate the mean rate $\mu$ and dispersion parameter $\kappa>0$ (or $\theta:=1/\kappa>0$ if you e.g. use glm.nb in R) considering the views as observations from a negative binomial model with an intercept and a $\log(\text{items}_i)$-offset. Then you would use independent $\text{Gamma}(\alpha=\hat{\theta}, \beta=\hat{\theta}/\hat{\mu})$ priors for each individual rate and would update them individually. Or you could formulate this explicitly as a hierarchical Bayesian model. It should be relatively easy to fit, because a $\lambda_i \sim \Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ and $\text{views}_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i \text{items}_i)$ allows Gibbs sampling (so you can use any Gibbs sampler, or of course any general purpose MCMC sampler such as Stan).
