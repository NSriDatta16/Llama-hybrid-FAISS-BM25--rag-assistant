Excel 2007 supports the OpenXML format which is a ZIP file (.XLSX) containing a bunch of XML files. There is an SDK to work with the OpenXML format you can get the docs for it here , and download it here . Basically numbers are stored as plain text within a element so if cell A1 has the number 42 and cell A2 has the number 81.56 in the UI, the XML would look like the follow XML fragment: 42 81.569999999999993 When working with OpenXML I would highly recommend just using the SDK and not going after it on your own.
