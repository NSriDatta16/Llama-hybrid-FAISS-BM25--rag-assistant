changing focus on multiple edittext boxes

I've written some code to test if a user has changed the values in any of 6 edittext boxes, but the code looks bulky and redundant. I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this. The user inputs numbers into all of 6 edittext boxes, and after each entry, a calculation routine checks to be sure all boxes have valid numbers before doing the calculation. The kistener has to fire on a lost foucus so that the number is in the box before the calculations are done. and outputing a result. If the user want to go back and change a value in any one of the 6 edittext boxes, the calulation routine runs again.been I've set up 6 listeners in the onCreate section for each edittext box. Then I have 6 separate routines to test for each hasFocus==false. Within the onCreate section i set a listener for each of the 6 user input edottext boxes: et1.setOnFocusChangeListener(this); . . . . et6.setOnFocusChangeListener(this); Then I have a method to check if any edittext box has lost focus, suggesting theat the user changed some data, and therfore re-run the calulations. I do a check for each of the 6 user input edittext boxes as follows: @Override public void onFocusChange(View v, boolean hasFocus) { if ((v == findViewById(R.id.et1)) && (hasFocus==false)) {do calculations } . . . . if ((v == findViewById(R.id.et6)) && (hasFocus==false)) {do calculations } } Forgive me if I've made any typos in the code above. It runs on my platform, but I would like to learn a better way to do this.
