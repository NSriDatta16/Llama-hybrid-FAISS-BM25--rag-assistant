whois lookup limits - how to work around daily quota/query limits

I'm building a website that allows users to check the availability of international domain names. My approach was to do a simple whois lookup on each request, but I'm now realizing that there are pretty harsh daily or hourly limits, e.g. "Allowed average daily response limit is set to 100 regarding one IP address." Is there a way to work around this issue? How do all these sites offer this kind of service, without running into problems with the query limits?
