Most streams are consumed when you read from them. In your 2nd code block, you consume the stream the first time as a bitmap. When you invoke decodeString a second time, the stream is 'empty' (if only in the sense that all of the data has already been read). The best answer will probably be monkjack's, but perhaps with just a little extra code to ensure you aren't reading a gargantuan file into memory. I recommend just a check as you're streaming it into a buffer for size (i.e. stop at 10MB); I'm not sure how well Android will handle an out of memory exception.
