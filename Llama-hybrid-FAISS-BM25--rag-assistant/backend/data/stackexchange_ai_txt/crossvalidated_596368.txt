Choosing Optimal Forecasting Method

I am trying to fit the weekly forecasting model, however, I only have 60 data points.. trying tslm i.e. the linear model with time series components, and comparing it to harmonic regression, the linear model had lower AIC but higher AICc. As a further test, I then split my data into 54 training and left 6 as test data and refitted, and compared their performance using MAPE, TSLM gave a better performance using MAPE as a metric. TLDR Now I'm confused about which method I should proceed with since tslm is better in aic and mape whereas harmonic regression is better in aicc. Any help is appreciated.
