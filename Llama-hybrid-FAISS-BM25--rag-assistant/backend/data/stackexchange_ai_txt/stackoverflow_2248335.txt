I don't know about Rails 3, but I'll try to answer bonus question. You can put whatever you want in public/javascript directory. By default it will load files: prototype.js, effects.js, dragdrop.js and controls.js ( read more ). If you want to compress all js files and send it in one file, you can use this plugin . Of course it won't work for dynamicaly generated js files.
