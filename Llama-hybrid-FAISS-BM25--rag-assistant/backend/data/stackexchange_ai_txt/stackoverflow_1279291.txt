How can I change the way these items are sorted in the ModelForm code, or in the Model code, rather than in the template? One thing you can do is add an ordering meta option . You do this by adding a Meta inner class to a class, with the ordering attribute specified: class Department(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100) abbreviation = models.CharField(max_length=4) class Meta: ordering = ["name"] Note that this changes default ordering for Department models (not just when used in a form). And in general, how can I customize the way a particular field or widget works when generated by a ModelForm? You'll want to read the Django docs about ModelForm and built-in form fields . In particular, pay attention to the optional widget attribute, which allows you to change a form field's widget. The difference types of widgets are described here .
