This is generally hard to tell without knowing what the problem exactly is, but I would advise you to try some machine learning methods. For start you may try random forest, which is almost trivial to apply and quite probably will achieve better accuracy than just using one, best-correlated variable. Also, it will produce importance measure which will tell you which variables contribute most to the prediction accuracy -- possibly taking into account even quite complex multivariate interactions obviously invisible to Pearson's correlation.
