What is the most elegant way to read a text file with c++?

I'd like to read whole content of a text file to a std::string object with c++. With Python, I can write: text = open("text.txt", "rt").read() It is very simple and elegant. I hate ugly stuff, so I'd like to know - what is the most elegant way to read a text file with C++? Thanks.
