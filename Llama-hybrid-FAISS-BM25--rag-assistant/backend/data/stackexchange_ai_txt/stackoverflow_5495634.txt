Why does the performance of my #pragma-unrolled loop degrade if the trip count is not constant?

I have following code using loop unrolling: #pragma unroll for (int i=0;i here if n is a defined constant, everything works fine. However, if n is a variable, performance dramatically reduced. I noticed roughly 3 times the instructions are issued and executed. I guess I am looking for a way to do loop unrolling at run time, may be that's just not feasible.
