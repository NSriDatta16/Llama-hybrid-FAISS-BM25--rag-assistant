However, I observed that my NLP model had consistently low (which suggests that it is not due to high variance)... I don't believe this is necessarily the case. Variance in the sense of bias-variance tradeoff refers to the variance over different training sets of the model's output on a fixed (unseen) datapoint. A very high-variance model will likely have very poor scores on any new test set.
