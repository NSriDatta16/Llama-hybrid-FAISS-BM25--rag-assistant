I believe there is a simple enough Bayesian solution here. I haven't tried to implement any of this though! Without measurement error, this is a simple Beta-Bernoulli model: $$ \begin{align} p_i &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i)\\ y_{i,j} &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i) \end{align} $$ where $p_i$ is the proportion of people who like movie $i$ , and $y_{i,j} = 1$ if person $j$ reported liking movie $i$ and $0$ otherwise. $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ are prior parameters, and can be used to encode information about the proportion of people we would expect to like each movie ( see here for details on the Beta distribution). If there is an unknown probability that each person just responds at random for every movie, we can add an additional set of parameters, $r_j$ ( $r$ for random ) encoding the probability that person $j$ is a random responder, and use Beta priors for each person. I assume that random responders have a 50% chance of responding that they liked the movie. $$ \begin{align} p_i &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i) \\ r_j &\sim \text{Beta}(a_r, b_r) \\ y_{i,j} &\sim \text{Bernoulli}( r_j \times 0.5 + (1-r_j)\times(p_i)); \end{align} $$ On its own, this model probably isn't identifiable, but fortunately you have a lot of prior information about the first 100 movies. This means you can set strong priors on $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ for $i$ in $1, 2, \dots, 100$ , and use non-informative priors (e.g. $\alpha_i = \beta_i = 1$ ) for the rest of the movies. This information should constrain things enough to have some idea who the random responders are, and to down-weight their responses for the rest of the movies. This kind of model can be fairly easily fit using standard Bayesian tools like Stan, PyMC3, or JAGS.
