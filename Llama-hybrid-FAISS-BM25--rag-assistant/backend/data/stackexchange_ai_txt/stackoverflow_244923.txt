It looks like IE is caching the response. If you either change your calls to POST methods, or send the appropriate headers to tell IE not to cache the response, it should work. The headers I send to be sure it doesn't cache are: Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache Expires: Fri, 30 Oct 1998 14:19:41 GMT Note the expiration date can be any time in the past.
