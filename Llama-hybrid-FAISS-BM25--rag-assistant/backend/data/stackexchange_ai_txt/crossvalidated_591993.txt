Comparison between regression outputs to transformed and untransformed data

I want to investigate whether the values of ten dependent variables (collected in a monthly resolution) are influenced by time (in years), and, for this, I intend to perform ten linear regressions, one for each dependent variable. As not all these variables had a normal distribution, I transformed the monthly values into annual averages, which normalized the distribution of most variables, although not all. Even so, I performed the regressions with the data transformed into annual averages, and I compared the results with those of the original data regressions. As you can see in the tables below, in both results the values of P are very similar, although the values of $R^2$ and F differ greatly in some cases. Would this difference in the values of $R^2$ and F be problematic? Would it be statistically appropriate do not transform the data into annual averages and perform regressions, even if they are not normally distributed? Regression output to the non-transformed data: Regression output to the transformed data:
