Securely implementing session state and 'keep me logged in' feature

I would like to improve security on a current application regarding session management and I want the users to be logged in until they explicitly logout. How does one implement that securely? Keep session information in database, like sessionid, ip, useragent? Please provide the requirements, possibly a database layout, do's and don'ts, tips and tricks. Note: I know frameworks like asp.NET, rails, codeigniter, etc... already take care of that, but this is not an option. Actually it for a classic asp application. But I think this question does not relate to a specific language.
