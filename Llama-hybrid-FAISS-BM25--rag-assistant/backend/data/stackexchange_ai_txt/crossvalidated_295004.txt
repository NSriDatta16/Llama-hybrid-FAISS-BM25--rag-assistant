How to include seasonality in auto arima with regressors in R?

My forecasting variable(monthly sales) is seasonal and wanted to include seasonality in the auto Arima function with regressors. The distribution of monthly sales data is shown below: I have used the below code: #Creating a time-series object FA = ts(na.omit(usFaceAvg[yrAndMo = startForTsTrain,]$faceAvg), frequency=12,) #Fitting an Arima model with regressor and for a seasonal time series usFaceAvgArima = endForTsTrain], usFaceAvgForecast = forecast(usFaceAvgArima, 12, xreg = tempUsSumOfFaceCountryTestRegressor)$mean) Is this correct? Should I create dummy binary variables for seasonality and use them as regressors? I tried to use without considering seasonality (Seasonal = FALSE & not specifying the frequency in ts()), but the forecast remained the same. How can I successfully include the prevailing seasonality in the monthly sales data? Any inputs will be appreciated. The residual, ACF and PACF plots for usFaceAvgArima residuals are as shown below: [![ACF Plot of residuals][3]][3] [![PACF plot of residuals][4]][4]
