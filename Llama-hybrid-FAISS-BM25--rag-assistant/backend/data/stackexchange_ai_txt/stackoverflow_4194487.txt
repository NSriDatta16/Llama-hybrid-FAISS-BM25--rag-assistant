You are overflowing the byte storage of 255 so it starts from 0. So: a + b is an integer = 376 Your code is equivalent to: byte c = (byte)376; That's one of the reasons why adding two bytes returns an integer. Casting it back to a byte should be done at your own risk. If you want to store the integer 376 into bytes you need an array: byte[] buffer = BitConverter.GetBytes(376); As you can see the resulting array contains 4 bytes now which is what is necessary to store a 32 bit integer.
