Run Function Based off of Data in a Lookup Table

I want to call a method based on a value in a lookup table. The values will be looked up in a database, and will be iterated through. What I am trying to avoid is this: foreach (Row r in rows) { if (r["command"] == "Command1") MyClass.Command1(); else if (r["command"] == "Comman2") MyClass.Command2(); else if (r["command"] == "Comman3") MyClass.Command3(); } This is legacy code that I have to support, but I know there surely is a better way to do this. Currently the code looks like the above but I am looking for a more elegant solution. EDIT: Based on the suggestions below, I am trying to do something like this: static void Main(string[] args) { Dictionary > myActions = new Dictionary >(); myActions.Add("Command1",MyClass.DoCommand1("message1")); myActions.Add("Command2",MyClass.DoCommand1("message2")); myActions["Command1"](); } with my class file looking like this: public class MyClass { public void DoCommand1(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); } public void DoCommand2(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); } } However, I am getting syntax errors saying that an object reference is required for the nonstatic filed, method, or property MyClass.DoCommand1(string). Any ideas? Please note I am using the .NET 2.0 framework.
