Conjugate prior for univariate normal with same mean and unknown sum of two variances

I have a Bayesian inference problem where the likelihood function is conditioned on two unknown variances. $$\log\mathcal{L}(d\mid \sigma_n,\sigma_s) = -\frac{1}{2} \log (\sigma_n^2 + \sigma_s^2) -\frac{1}{2}\frac{(d-\mu)}{\sigma_n^2 + \sigma_s^2}^2$$ where $\mu$ is a known quantity. I would like to find a conjugate prior $\pi(\sigma_s, \sigma_n)$ , possibly separable $$\pi(\sigma_s, \sigma_n) = \pi_s(\sigma_s)\pi_n(\sigma_n)$$ . Is there a standard procedure to construct it? If one of the two variances is known, then the correct prior is the scaled inverse $\chi^2$ or equivalently, to the inverse gamma distribution .
