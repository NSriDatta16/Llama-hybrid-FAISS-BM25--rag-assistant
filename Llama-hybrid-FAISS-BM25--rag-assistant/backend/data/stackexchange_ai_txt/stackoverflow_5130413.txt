Application submit problem

i just try to upload a new version binary of my approved app to itunes connect with organizer. i double check the CFBundleVersion and other things. when i click to validate or submit button, xcode asks me creditials and displays the correct version of app but after that nothing happens and i couldn't upload my binary. anyone has the same problem ? thanks
