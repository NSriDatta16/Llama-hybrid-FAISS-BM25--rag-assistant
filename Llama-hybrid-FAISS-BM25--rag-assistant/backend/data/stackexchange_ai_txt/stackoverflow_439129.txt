Can you reuse fragments of XML (in some kind of variables/references way)?

I am using SLD to style output from my geoserver. I have couple types of objects to be displayed. Each type have different icons, but text description is generated from the same information (text field in the database). I cannot use object_type as image name because you cannot use variable in image name (or I do not know how to do it...). So I Have SLD like (without unimportant parts): object_type 1 image/png 16 1 name Times New Roman Normal 12 #110011 1 object_type 2 image/png 16 1 name Times New Roman Normal 12 #110011 1 And the thing I'd love to do would be writing TextSymbolizer once and using it in two or more places... I have not heard of anything like that in XML, but maybe you have? :-) One solution that comes to me, is to write some very simple generator (xml.erb? :P) and let it generate XML...
