Will binary model be automatically mirrored if train set inverted?

Suppose we are training binary classifier to output 0s and 1s. It is trained and now returning float values y in range from 0 to 1. Now suppose we inverted the train set (replaced 0s by 1s and vice versa) and trained the same classifier again. Will it automatically return exactly 1-y values in the same points? Does this depend on a model type, for example, random forest or neural network?
