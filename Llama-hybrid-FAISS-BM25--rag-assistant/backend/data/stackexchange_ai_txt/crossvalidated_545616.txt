Ironically, this statement is sort of meta and illustrates its own shortcomings. A few people have mentioned the Ecological Fallacy and this statement arguably a way to summarize or describe an aspect of the fallacy. In ecology (or any field that uses statistics which is all sciences and many of the humanities), you are in some way using statistics to summarize or create a shorthand for a more complex system. There is always some kind of trade off in terms of reducing individuals to categories. The more in-depth your statistics, the more you can understand the data you're starting with. For example, if you have a group of 100 students and half score 0% on a test and half score 100% on a test, the average would be 50%. However, if you take the statistics further, you can look at the standard divination a sort of (and I know I'm simplifying this idea) average distance from average. This would tell you that the average is not very representative. You could also use a histogram to look at the data. This would show you very clearly that no one got the average score in this situation. It's not that statistics is "wrong" or "misleading" but if you only include the average, you're not telling the whole story. At the same time, when you summarize a group or a set of data with statistics, you're always removing some sort of information to make it more digestible. Conversely, if you use statistics to try and guess at an individual, you will almost always get something wrong. It's very rare to find an individual within a data set that perfectly matches what the statics for the whole group says they are likely to be. This second half of the ecological fallacy is what the statement refers to. So the statement "statistics is meaningless to the individual" is sort of a caution that you can't characterize an individual based on statistics.
