It looks like the SHPAML preprocessor is not getting invoked BEFORE Django. What I typically do is write all my documents in SHPAML with a .shpaml extension, and then I convert them to Django with the .html extension, and then let Django do its magic. So you will want statements like "extends" and "include" to refer to the .html document that has already been preprocessed. Your base shpaml doc will look something like this: html body #main_page {% block body %} {% endblock %} And then the document that extends it will look something like this: {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block body %} p This is a paragraph about {{ book }}... {% endblock %} And then you want to preprocess them BEFORE Django sees them. I usually preprocess them with a Python script right before doing "manage.py runserver."
