Object data sources are nice for small projects but they do not scale well as you are embedding data-layer information in the UI layer of your application. I would suggest that you only use them for very small applications and scratch-pad testing stuff. If you make a design decision to use them be prepared to struggle with scaling and maintenance issues in the future.
