how to indicate a change in list elements' order using jquery?

i am using jquery sortable. right now i have a list of items that i can ALREADY use drag and drop. which is cool. i will use a submit button at the bottom of the list to submit the new order. the change in the list is not automatically submitted. All i need is somehow indicate that an element's position has changed. I googled quite a bit. no answer. original list: item1 item2 item3 item4 item5 submitbutton here. changed list: i moved item 2 below item3 for eg. item1 item3 item2 * item4 item5 submitbutton here. how do i use the sortable in jquery for me to display a sign on the item 2? i think should be the change event of sortable but i still do not know how to use it since i am a newbie in jquery. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable#event-change thank you.
