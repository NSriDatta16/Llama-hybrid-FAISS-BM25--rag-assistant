Learning R with Coursera's Data Science Specialization

I'm interested in moving into data science and I'd like to learn R. I've looked over previous questions and found a list of resources for learning R here and here . However, these questions were posed before the Coursera data science specialization began, taught by the biostatistics department at Johns Hopkins. Would a program like this be worthwhile, or should I stick with the previously posted list of suggestions. Finally, if the program might be preferable, would paying for the specialization certification be worth anything to employers? Would this even be something to list on a resume, or not advisable? Thanks for any help on this. I've joined cross validated a week or so ago from mathematics stack exchange and I've really appreciated all the insightful input.
