Asp.Net Crystal report

I am working in visual 2008 with sql server 2005 as the back end. I am trying to create a crystal report with xsd file.This is what i did. I created an empty xsd file from "Add New Items".i dragged the stored proc from the server explorer from the database which i want to attach to the crystal on to the xsd. Created an empty crystal report,attached the xsd file on to the report through "Make new connection" and selected the fields which i want to display in the report. Now when i do the print preview of the report is shows me the junk data and not the actual data that stored procedure returns.? I cant understand this behaviour. Am i missing something?
