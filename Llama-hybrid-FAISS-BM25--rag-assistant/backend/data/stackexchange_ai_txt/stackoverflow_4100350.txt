Embedding comments in MySQL statements

Does anyone know of a way to embed comments in MySQL statements? When I search for mysql and comments I get only ways to put comments in tables, etc The idea, if I implement this the way my boss wants it, is to prepend the user id to the statement apparently so that when MySQL is analyzed later (via the binary log) we know who did what. Example: SELECT id FROM customer WHERE handle='JBH' Would now show up as: -- user:jwilkie SELECT id FROM customer WHERE handle='JBH' (or similar) EDIT FOR CLARITY: The reason for this is that we have perl modules that are interfacing with MySQL and we are retrieving the user id by reading $ENV{USER} (which in this case is "jwilkie"). It is a situation where we have one MySQL user defined but multiple people running the perl mod. Does anyone have experience with this? Many many thanks! Jane
