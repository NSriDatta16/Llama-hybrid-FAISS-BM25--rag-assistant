What is the best ViewModel naming convention?

I'm writing an asp.net mvc2 project with a lot of views/partialviews. Reading on good MVC practices, I've been encourage to create ViewModels. Its really nice and makes sense to do so but I'm noticing recently that I can no longer easily remember what model is for what view. I'm hoping there is a nice naming convention for ViewModels that can handle large projects. My question is can this situation be improved?
