Depends on whether or not, within Garage, you are directly referencing Types defined in project Radio. If you are, then you need to create a reference. If the only use you are making of these radio Types is in the Car Assembly, the fact that the Car Types are used in Garage does Not require you to declare a reference to Radio in Garage, (except as mentioned in EDIT Note below). EDIT (based on comment from @Pavel): There is one other scenario/condition where you need to reference another assembly: If you are using a Type from a referenced assembly that derives from a type, (or implements an interface) defined in a third assembly, you also need to reference that third assembly.
