One way is to add a reference to the required resource into the manifest file of the main Jar. The references are relative, so the most common practice is to ensure the main and dependent Jars are in the same directory. If deploying as an applet the Jar can be referenced in the archive attribute of the applet element. If deploying using Java Web Start, the Jar can be referenced in the JNLP launch file. Edit 1: Example of manifest presuming the dependent Jar is in the 'hadoop' sub-directory of the directory where the app. is located. Manifest-Version: 1.0 Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.8.2 Main-Class: org.pscode.wigglyworms.WigglyWorms Class-Path: hadoop/hadoop-core.jar Implementation-Title: Wiggly Worms Implementation-Version: 11.03.13 Implementation-Vendor: PSCode - Andrew Thompson Implementation-Vendor-Id: org.pscode Created-By: 1.6.0-b105 (Sun Microsystems Inc.) Note that a manifest file should end with a single blank line (which is difficult to represent even using the 'pre-formatted' mode for code). For that reason I would strongly recommend you leave the creation of the manifest to a tool that knows how to write them. My choice is the Ant build tool. For further details, see Adding Classes to the JAR File's Classpath section of the 'Packaging Programs in JAR Files' lesson of the Java Tutorial.
