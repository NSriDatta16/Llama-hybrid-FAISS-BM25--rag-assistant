What you are asking for sounds like constrained clustering . The basic idea is that you have additional information in the form of constraints such as must-link cannot-link See e.g. Wagstaff, K.; Cardie, C.; Rogers, S.; Schrödl, S. (2001). "Constrained K-means Clustering with Background Knowledge". Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning. pp. 577–584.
