Such data is often fit using a nonlinear mixed effects model (aka, hierarchical model) using a compartment model for the subject-level model and a simple ANOVA model for the treatment-level model. This is a form of random coefficients model. Instead of trying to capture the data as a series of averages within each treatment group and time point, you instead try to capture each subject's kinetics curve by condensing that data into the kinetics parameters. These parameter values then become the thing that responds to treatment and you look at differences of these values among the subjects across treatment groups. It is an ANOVA where the focus is not on the means-over-time (which are not scientifically interesting) but on the kinetics parameters (which are scientifically interesting). I would suggest you start by looking up nonlinear mixed-effects models, lmer4, nlme, hierarchical models, etc. Singer and Willett's book. Pinhiero and Bates' book. The data you give is NOT the data fed to the model. You have already summarized into mean curves. The analysis will begin with each individual's curve. If I am mistaken about your data and these curves are made up of points that differ for each individual, then this model is not relevant. I do not know your endpoint well-enough to suggest what type of compartment model you need, though. And that is usually the real trick in fitting NLME models...getting a model that actually fits the data.
