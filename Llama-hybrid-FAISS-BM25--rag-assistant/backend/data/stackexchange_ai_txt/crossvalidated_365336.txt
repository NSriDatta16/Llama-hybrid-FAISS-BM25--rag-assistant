Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) sampling from prior vs posterior

I have been reading the original VAE paper, Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes . In VAE, when generating samples, why do we sample from prior instead of the learned variational posterior(Fig 5 in the paper)? Similarly when visualizing learned data manifold why do we take inverse CDF of prior(multivariate unit Gaussian) instead of variational posterior(Fig 4)?
