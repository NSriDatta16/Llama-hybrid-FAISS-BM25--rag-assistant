Short of a graph of the variable I can only say that Logistic regression doesn't really care as long as the response is linear. You can normalize your data in order to lower the weights needed for the cost function and ease its job. Prior to that you can also log transform it a bit, that's just to bring extreme values more together, but as long as the response is linear it should be fine
