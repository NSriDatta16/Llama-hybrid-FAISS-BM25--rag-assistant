The small z-score (third column) tells you that there is "a lot of" uncertainty regarding your estimated coefficients. This is also expressed by the "large" p-value (=1). Essentially this means that your model did not learn anything useful. When you look at the confidence band of your estimated coefficients confint(mod.lg) , you see that the coefficients could be negative or positive (this is what a "high" p-value indicates, that coefficients are not statistically different from zero). Why is that? You have very little training data. Two degrees of freedom left is way too little. You seem to assign "country" randomly. There is no useful information in this random variable. I suggest using other data with more observations. Logistic regression (with R-Labs) is very well explained in " Introduction to Statistical Learning " (Ch. 4). Maybe you have a good read of the chapter and try the "Labs" so to get a sound idea of Logit.
