Neural network idea can be very loosely explained as following: a. Using enough hidden layers can lead to the representation of every function that exists (again, this is loosely and is far from practical) b. Since now you can represent every function in the world with parameters (weights) now use stochastic gradient decent on the weights (this is the back propagation in super short) to get to the optimal classifier (or regressor)
