The problem had to do with preprocessing of the data. Conceptually, the understanding of how RNNs would read an image file is correct, i.e. rows correspond to time steps and columns to features. On the second question, it follows from the first realization and the answer is that RNNs can model spectrograms/multidimensional data fine as the results retrieved after fixing data issues were good.
