need help with memory management

so i have a program i am developing and as im fairly new to objective-c and cocoa touch im not very familiar with the concepts of memory management in ipad app development. my problem is that my program keeps crashing without any warning and without telling me why, i turned on breakpoints and it shows an exc_bad_access signal. which leads me to believe that im not handling the memory properly. or its something else that i've over looked in my efforts. either way i need some help. if anyone can take a look at the app and tell me anything that may be causing it to act the way it is that would be great. the point of the program is that it shows 20 mayan glyphs of the numbers 0-19, you drag the glyphs one at a time into the white 'drop zones' and it adds them and displays the result. however almost every time as soon as the second glyph is dropped in it quits, or it will display the answer and when you remove one of the glyphs to add another set it will quit then. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks stackoverflow :) source files here
