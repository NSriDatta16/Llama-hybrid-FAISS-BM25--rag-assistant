Testing independence hypothesis in logistic regression

One of the primary hypotheses in logistic regression theory is the independence of observations. Once the model is fitted to the data (using likelihood maximization procedure for example), I am wondering, is it possible to test independence of the residuals in logistic regression? (as is common practice in time series area) In my opinion, the independence hypothesis is material in the theory as the likelihood function is based on that fact. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find something about this and I was wondering why.
