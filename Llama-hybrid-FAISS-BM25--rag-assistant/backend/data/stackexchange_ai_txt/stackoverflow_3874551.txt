How do I scroll my Palm webOS application?

This feels like a dumb newbie question. I'm attempting to follow the Palm's online tutorial for developing a webOS app. I ran palm-generate and tried updating the generated index.html file to have a body with a bunch of content (the word "HELLO" repeated 400 times). When I attempt to load that document in the emulator, I find that I'm unable to scroll the screen to read the rest of the text. I drag the screen, but nothing happens. The page scrolls just fine in the Palm web browser. Is there a setting to allow users to drag my app to scroll it? I see documentation for a Mojo.Widget.Scroller, but that seems like it shouldn't be necessary for a simple web page with a bunch of text on it.
