What you may have read might be in regard to some of the penalized regression style methods which are frequentist. In these methods (like lasso, ridge), the estimators do not have any known distribution either exact or asymptotic. This makes it difficult (impossible) to ascertain the error in estimation. Frequentist statistics does not have a profound reputation of not providing uncertainty estimates. Bayesian statistics do have the reputation of always providing uncertainty estimates. Thus in a discussion over Bayesian vs frequentist for penalized regression, this point of difference is often made in favor of Bayesian methods. Most frequentist methods do a good job of uncertainty estimation, especially if they are MLE dependent.
