Image Cannot be Displayed in Silverlight

I have a Silverlight 3 app that allows the user to upload images, and then is supposed to display them. The image gets uploaded fine (I can view it in the browser), but I get the following error from Silverlight: Message: Sys.InvalidOperationException: ImageError error #4001 in control 'Xaml1': AG_E_NETWORK_ERROR Line: 453 Char: 17 Code: 0 URI: http://www.greektools.net/ScriptResource.axd?d=J4B4crBmh4Qxr3eVyHw3QRgAKpCaa6XLu8H_2zpAs7eWeADXG9jQu_NCTxorhOs1x6sWoSKHEqAL37LcpWepfg2&t=fffffffffd030d68 Fiddler reports: There is a problem with the resource you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed. Thanks in advance for your help.
