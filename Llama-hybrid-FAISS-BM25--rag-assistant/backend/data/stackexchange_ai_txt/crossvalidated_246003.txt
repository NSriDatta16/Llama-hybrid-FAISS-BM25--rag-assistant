Reference book for logistic regression

I would like to use matlab to build a logistic regression model which includes both categorical and continuous predictors. But first of all, I would like to figure out the comprehensive theory(the assumptions, analysis, etc) behind such model. Could anyone please suggest the best reference book for logistic regression model. I got some background in linear regression analysis.
