With time series, you cannot test a forecasting model via cross-validation in the normal way because you are then using future observations to predict the past. You must use only past observations to predict the future. The time series equivalent of LOO CV is to use a rolling forecast origin instead. I've written about it in this blog post . I'm not sure if k-fold CV has a direct time series equivalent.
