My emacs-fu isn't so strong, so I don't know if there's a single command to do this, but you can make yourself a (somewhat fragile) macro for it ... drop these lines in your .emacs : (fset 'eval-sexp-in-place [?\M-x ?e ?v ?a ?l ?- ?p ?r ?i ?n tab return ?\M-^ ?\M-^ ?\C-\M-b ?\C-\M-k ?\C-d]) (global-set-key [(control x) (control a)] 'eval-sexp-in-place) This works fine, but there's one issue with it: you need to be at the end of the sexp (i.e. after the last right paren) to get it to work. Also, I picked a random unbound key ( C-x C-a ) -- feel free to change that to something more to your liking.
