What should, and shouldn't, be covered by unit tests?

Clearly, I don't understand unit testing . This is fine, considering I've never done it before. I'm starting a new project, and wanted to bake unit testing into it from the beginning, so I'm looking to learn. I had always equated unit testing with code coverage, thinking that you should have unit tests which cover every function/method in your application, but clearly this isn't the case and I've completely misunderstood the concept. So, What sorts of functions benefit from unit testing? What sorts of functions shouldn't be unit tested?
