Project to learn JavaEE technologies

Attended a 2 week Java EE course and learnt the concepts. Want to try in a simple project and wanted ideas on what that could be? PetStore or Small Business App are so boring... Anything interesting that can be done to learn the breadth but at the same time it not being a full fledged project?
