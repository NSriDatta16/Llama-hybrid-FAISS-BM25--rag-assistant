Any transient state information should be persisted in the Application.Deactivated event and then restored in the Application.Activated event for tombstoning support. If you need to store anything between application sessions then you could use the Application.Closing event, but depending on what you need to store, you could just store it whenever it changes. Again, depending on what you need to store, you can either restore it in the Application.Launching event, or just read it when you need it. The approach that you take depends entirely on your application's requirements and the method and location that you store your data is also up to you (binary serialization to isolated storage is generally accepted is being the fastest). I don't know the details of your application, but saving and restoring data in NavigatedFrom/NavigatedTo is unlikely to be the right place to do it if you are looking to implement support for tombstoning.
