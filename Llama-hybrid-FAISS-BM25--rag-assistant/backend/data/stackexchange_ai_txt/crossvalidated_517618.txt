To test that the model built on one data set is better performing than the model built on the other data set: Let predictions of model 1 be called $y_i$ and predictions of model 2 be called $z_i$ . We want to show that $z_i$ is usually more correct than $y_i$ . Define a score metric for every sample and run a paired t-test to determine that $score(z_i) > score(y_i)$ . See here What you do is: Let $d_i = (score(z_i) - score(y_i))$ and $d$ be the average of $d_i$ over all samples. Let $s_d$ be the standard deviation over $d_i$ . let $t = \frac{d}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}$ This test statistic follows a t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. You mentioned the problem is classification. A common loss function for individual samples in classification problems are 0-1 loss or brier score.
