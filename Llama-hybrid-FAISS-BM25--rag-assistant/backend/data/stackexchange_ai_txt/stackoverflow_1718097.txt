I hardly ever came across this kind of usage. I think it's "inappropriate" :) This is not a common way of use, it is inconsistent with the general conventions. This kind of syntax has pros and cons of course: Cons The code is not intuitive (usual conventions are different) It tends to be fragile (rename of parameter will break the functionality). It's a little more difficult to test (faking the API will require usage of reflection in tests). If expression is used intensively it'll be slower due to the need to analyze the parameter and not just the value (reflection cost) Pros It's more readable after the developer adjusted to this syntax. Bottom line - in public API design I would have chosen more explicit way.
