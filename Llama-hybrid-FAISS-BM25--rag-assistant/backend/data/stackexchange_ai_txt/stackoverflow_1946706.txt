You can use #pragma warning to: save the state disable the warning write the offending code return the warning to their previous state (you need a # before the pragmas, but SO is having a hard time dealing with them and formatting at the same time) #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable: 4127 ) // Your code #pragma warning( pop ) You want to push/pop the warnings rather then disable/enable because you do not want to interfere with the command line arguments that might be chosen to turn warnings on/off (someone may use the command line to turn off the warning, you do not want to force it back on... the code above deals with that). This is better than turning the warning off globally since you can control it just for the part you want. Also you can make it part of the macro.
