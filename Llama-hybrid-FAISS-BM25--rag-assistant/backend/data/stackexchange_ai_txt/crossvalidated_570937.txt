formulation of evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log likelihood

Since the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log likelihood, $\log p_{\theta}(x)$ , is $$\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x), p(z)).$$ But we can also write the above as $$\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z) + \log p(z) - \log(q_\phi(z|x)].$$ So, practically, will training a Variational Autoencoders(VAE) using the formulation in the first formulation be the same as the second formulation? Why or why not?
