You could use something like WinPCap to grab intercept all packets looking specifically for packets on port 80 using the http protocol with a POST. There is a Delphi wrapper available which might be of some help. This is the same engine that is used by WireShark which would be useful by itself if your just having to do this manually or to debug an existing protocol.
