I will give a response from the epidemiological side of causal inference, which uses a slightly different terminology ('exchangeable' rather than 'ignorable') with some subtle differences. Citing from What If (Hernán & Robins, 2023, p. 28, emphasis mine): Rubin (1974, 1978) extended Neyman’s theory for randomized experiments to observational studies. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) referred to the combination of exchangeability and positivity as weak ignorability, and to the combination of full exchangeability (see Technical Point 2.1) and positivity as strong ignorability Then, from Technical point 2.1 (p. 15, emphasis mine), we can see that: Formally, let $\mathcal{A} = \{a, a', a'', \dots \}$ denote the set of all treatment values present in the population, and $Y^{\mathcal{A}} = \{Y^a, Y^{a'}, Y^{a''}, \dots\}$ the set of all counterfactual outcomes. Randomization makes $Y^{\mathcal{A}}⊥A$ . We refer to this joint independence as full exchangeability . [...] For a continuous outcome, exchangeability $Y^{\mathcal{a}}⊥A$ implies mean exchangeability $\operatorname{E}[Y^a | A = a'] = \operatorname{E}[Y^a]$ but mean exchangeability does not imply exchangeability because distributional parameters other than the mean (e.g., variance) may not be independent of treatment . In other words, the distinction between weak ignorability and strong ignorability boils down to whether we are assuming mean exchangeability or full exchangeability (which I deem slightly more informative terms). It is no surprise this distinction is hard to grasp since the bulk of most applications and expositions of causal inference problems is only concerned with average causal effects, so we end up erasing the distinction and just talking about ignorability or exchangeability per se. At the same time, causal assumptions from Rubin's terminology involve more than a single property (especially in the case of SUTVA), so that also does not help with clarity.
