If I understand your question, you are using the initializer in a function call that returns type char* . In that case, there is no problem with using the static storage class. result will keep its value (the memory address you allocated) throughout the life of your program. However, malloc will not be called multiple times in this instance. Only the first time through your function. Also, the memory is still allocated on the heap, thus you still need to free it when you are done. However, this freeing will be performed on your program's exit(), so that could be ignored.
