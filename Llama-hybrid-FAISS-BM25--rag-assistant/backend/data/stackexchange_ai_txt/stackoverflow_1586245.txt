Remotely debug Linux Kernel from Windows?

I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to remotely debug the Linux kernel running under VMWare (and if so, if there's a way to do it in Windows since linux kind of scares me...). Both are x86. I know VMWare has support for this (I saw a post about remote debugging via gdb), but if there was a way to do it from Windows (i.e. Eclipse CDT or something) that'd be awesome. Thanks! -Robert
