You don't have to unescape anything. The doubled-apostrophe form is only used for string literals inside SQL statements. The actual value inserted in the database by INSERT... 'Robert''s Thesis'; is Robert's Thesis , and that is the value you'll get out when you read it from a recordset grabbed from a SELECT . If whatever's inside uspMyStoredProcedureName is doing something weird to cause doubled apostrophes to get returned then it's broken and needs fixing; if you have Robert''s Thesis as an actual value in the database, then you've inserted broken data and you should be looking at fixing the code that's done that, and cleaning up the data.
