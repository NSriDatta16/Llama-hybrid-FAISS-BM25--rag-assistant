As the data in question sounds like variables such as Temp, Conductivity, pH, etc., I would find it reasonable to normalize the variables and to place all variables on even scales first (mean$=0, SD=1)$. From there, I would use Euclidean distance as your resemblance matrix and move on with testing (PCA forces this anyway). With Euclidean distance you are able to use PCA (or NMDS) to visualize things to see if anything of interest arises. Then use PERMANOVA or ANOSIM to test for differences (PERMANOVA is much more robust to correlations and heterogeneous variances; Anderson & Walsh, 2013 ). SIMPER would still be able to identify those variables that account for a large portion of the differences between groups of interest. It won't really tell you if specific variables are significantly different between locations, but it can give you a good idea of what drives sample placement in NMDS or PCA space.
