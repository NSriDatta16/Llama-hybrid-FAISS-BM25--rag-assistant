It looks like you are trying to recommend items to customers that they might need, based on the hidden pattern of a customer's basket might reveal. Well, for a neural network to detect this kind of pattern is not quite efficient, most of this work should be done by your NLP co-workers. They could add tags to an item, and items with similar tags could be thus ranked with higher similarity. Or input a pattern list to your model as a feature, and your model could detect the similar pattern of by this feature. Generally speaking, you should not always rely on a model to automatically detect this kind of high level pattern, with not enough data. It's wise to give your model more information. Thinking of training a model like driving a car to your destination, the input features are like the road signs which will lead your way, the more reliable signs you're given, the higher probability you will reach your final destination.
