zc.lockfile.LockError in ZODB

I am trying to use ZODB 3.10.2 on my web server which is running Debian and Python 2.7.1. It seems like every time I try to access the same database from 2 different processes, I get a mysterious exception. I tried accessing a database from an interactive Python session and everything seemed to work fine: >>> import ZODB >>> from ZODB.FileStorage import FileStorage >>> storage = FileStorage("test.db") >>> But then I tried the same series of commands from another session running at the same time and it didn't seem to work: >>> import ZODB >>> from ZODB.FileStorage import FileStorage >>> storage = FileStorage("test.db") No handlers could be found for logger "zc.lockfile" Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ZODB3-3.10.2-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/ZODB/FileStorage/FileStorage.py", line 125, in __init__ self._lock_file = LockFile(file_name + '.lock') File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/zc.lockfile-1.0.0-py2.7.egg/zc/lockfile/__init__.py", line 76, in __init__ _lock_file(fp) File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/zc.lockfile-1.0.0-py2.7.egg/zc/lockfile/__init__.py", line 59, in _lock_file raise LockError("Couldn't lock %r" % file.name) zc.lockfile.LockError: Couldn't lock 'test.db.lock' >>> Why is this happening? What can be done about it?
