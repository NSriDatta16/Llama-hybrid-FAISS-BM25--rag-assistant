How to grab the contents of HTML tags?

Hey so what I want to do is snag the content for the first paragraph. The string $blog_post contains a lot of paragraphs in the following format: Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 The problem I'm running into is that I am writing a regex to grab everything between the first tag and the first closing tag. However, it is grabbing the first tag and the last closing tag which results in me grabbing everything. Here is my current code: if (preg_match("/[\\s]* [\\s]*(? [\\s\\S]+)[\\s]* [\\s\\S]*/",$blog_post,$blog_paragraph)) echo " " . $blog_paragraph["firstparagraph"] . " "; else echo $blog_post;
