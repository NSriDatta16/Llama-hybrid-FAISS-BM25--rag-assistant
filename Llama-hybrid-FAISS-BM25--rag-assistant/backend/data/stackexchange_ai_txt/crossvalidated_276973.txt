At what point in a logistic regression does a predictor become significant in predicting outcome?

Say we have a logistic regression with outcome equal to a women's pregnancy resulting in a birth =1 and loss=0. The predictor variable is age ranging from 22-50, the Odds ratio point estimate is .819 with CI (.782 - .858). How can we figure out the age in which this result become significant? I.e if this is interpreted as a 1 unit increase in age with a decreases in the chances of live birth vs pregnancy loss of 18%. However, this result is very unlikely if say a women ages from 22 to 23, so at what point in age does this result produce a significant outcome?
