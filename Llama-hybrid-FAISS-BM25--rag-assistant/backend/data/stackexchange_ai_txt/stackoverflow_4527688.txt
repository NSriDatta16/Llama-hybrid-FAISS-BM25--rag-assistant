After reviewing many open source ecommerce packages, only a handful are of good quality. Sadly, I do not believe that Tomatocart is one of them. Despite the many improvements over the infamous OSCommerce, I was very dissapointed to see that they still use a lot of their code, which simply isn't good. As an example, see the class search.php: http://code.google.com/p/tomatocart/source/browse/tomatocart/trunk/includes/classes/search.php?r=383 To sum it up, I believe that there are (much) better solutions out there. An alternative would be OpenCart or Magento , for example.
