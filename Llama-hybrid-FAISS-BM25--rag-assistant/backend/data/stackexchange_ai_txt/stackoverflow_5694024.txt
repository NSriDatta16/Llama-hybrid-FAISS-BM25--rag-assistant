There are modifications of the Levenberg-Marquardt method that add support for inequality constraints. I know about one library that implements such an algorithm: levmar (GPL). If you would like to modify an existing algorithm, rejecting bad solutions won't do, the optimization will likely get stuck. But you can make a variable substitution, e.g. to ensure that X > 0.1 you can use t^2+0.1 instead of X. I use this method as a workaround for the lack of built-in box constraints in my program. Here is a quote from Data fitting in the chemical sciences by Peter Gans that describes it better: https://github.com/wojdyr/fityk/wiki/InequalityConstraints
