It might be useful in C89 where you have an implicit int rule. void f() { a = 0; // syntax error auto b = 0; // valid: parsed as declaration of b as an int } But then, you can just write straight int instead of auto . C99 doesn't have an implicit int rule anymore. So I don't think auto has any real purpose anymore. It's "just the default" storage specifier.
