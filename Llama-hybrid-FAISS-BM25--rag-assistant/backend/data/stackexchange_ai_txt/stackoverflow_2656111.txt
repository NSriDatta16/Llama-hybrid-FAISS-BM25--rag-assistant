You can profile your application using the JVM builtin HPROF. It provides two methods: sampling the active methods on the stack timing method execution times using injected bytecode (BCI, byte codee injection) Sampling This method reveals how often methods were found on top of the stack. java -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,file=profile.txt ... Timing This method counts the actual invocations of a method. The instrumenting code has been injected by the JVM beforehand. java -agentlib:hprof=cpu=times,file=profile.txt ... Note: this method will slow down the execution time drastically. For both methods, the default filename is java.hprof.txt if the file= option is not present. Full help can be obtained using java -agentlib:hprof=help or can be found on Oracles documentation
