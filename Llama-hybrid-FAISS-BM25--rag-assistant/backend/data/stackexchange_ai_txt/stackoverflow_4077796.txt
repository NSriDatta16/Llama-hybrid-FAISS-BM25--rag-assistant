Database Design With Multiple Many-to-Many Relationships

I am designing a database where I need the following entities: Manufacturers: e.g. CocaCola Brands: e.g. Diet Coke, Coke Zero Continents: e.g. North America, Europe Territories: e.g. United States, Canada Regions: e.g. Alaska, California, Quebec Suppliers A Supplier is located within one, and only one, Region, which belongs to a Territory, which belongs to a Continent. A Brand belongs to a Manufacturer. Suppliers, Regions, Territories and Continents belong to at least 1 but possibly more Brands. I can't visualise how to organise the relationships between the tables such that Suppliers could be grouped by either Brand or Manufacturer without leading to duplicates being included within Aggregate calculations when a Supplier has multiple Brands, under a single Manufacturer. I get even more confused when I try to think about adding Regions into that equation, let alone Territory or Continent. Any help with this would be gratefully appreciated.
