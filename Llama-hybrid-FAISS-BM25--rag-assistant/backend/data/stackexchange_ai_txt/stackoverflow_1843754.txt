I have no experience in using Lamson on GAE. However, one important difference between GAE and traditional LAMP hosting is the storage backend and since Lamson already has support for a dozen different storage backends, the interfaces should be well-defined and narrow, so that adding a GAE backend should be rather trivial. (More precisely, Lamson simply doesn't care about the storage backend.)
