If you can enumerate feeds in advance you can create a list of feeds and put it into the template... feeds = [feed_a,feed_b,...] feeds.append(feed_c) ... I've tried an approach below and it did not work , which actually could be made to work since "related_name" only creates an accessor function and does not affect DB tables. #this code does not work in Django v1 class FeedCollection(models.Model): subject = models.CharField(max_length=256) class BloggerFeed(models.Model): collection = models.ForeignKey(FeedCollection,related_name='feed') class CNNFeed(models.Model): collection = models.ForeignKey(FeedCollection,related_name='feed') Django complains that accessor functions FeedCollection.feed_set for the two feed tables clash.
