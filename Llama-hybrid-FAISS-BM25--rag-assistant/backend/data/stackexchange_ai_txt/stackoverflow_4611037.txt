writing byte array to a raw column in oracle

I want to write a byte array to a raw column in oracle. byte[] bArray = new byte[16]; stmt = fConnection.prepareStatement(query); I want to do something like: stmt.setBinaryStream(1, bArray ); However, I couldn't figure out an elegant way of doing it. Can some one please throw in some pointers.
