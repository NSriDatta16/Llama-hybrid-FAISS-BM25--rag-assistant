Coming onto CrossValidated and asking if you should learn R is a bit like going to a football match and asking if anyone likes beer. Nevertheless, with this little bit of selection bias out of the way, here is my view on the matter: R is a widely used statistical programming language in academia and some parts of industry, so learning this skill is likely to be useful for any subsequent statistical analysis you perform. Most data analysis and data science work is performed in either R , Python or SAS these days, with the first two becoming highly popular in recent years. Like anything, devoting time to learning a new skill is a trade-off, and so you should look at opportunity cost. If you decide not to learn R , what will you use that time for instead? How do the alternative uses of that time compare to the value of learning this statistical language? My experience inside and outside of academia is that having goods skills in R programming is highly valued, and there are a lot of people in the clinical/bioscience area that use this language as their primary tool. If you do decide to learn R then I cannot recommend anything more highly than subscribing to DataCamp . (They have a special offer running at the moment to subscribe at 50% off normal price.) This will allow you to do a range of courses focused on each aspect of data analysis and statistical programming, and it is much easier than trying to learn from self-study. In six months you should be able to learn a substantial amount. (I recommend learning the dplyr and ggplot2 packages as top priority, as well as all the basic programming.) Personally, I learned R during university while doing some projects, and was mostly self-taught. I later did the accreditation program at DataCamp and it filled in a lot of gaps and was very simple and helpful. You are very lucky - I wish this stuff was around when I was first learning the language!
