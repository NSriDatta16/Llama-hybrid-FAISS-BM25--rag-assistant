Syntax for loading observers (in a model subdirectory) in environment.rb?

I have a lot of model observers, so I want to organize them in a subdirectory under the model folder. model --> observer --> user_observer.rb, activity_observer.rb, etc. Prior to placing in the subdirectory, I was loading the observers like this: Rails::Initializer.run do |config| config.active_record.observers = :user_observer, :activity_observer end Now when I try to launch the server, I get the following error: `load_missing_constant': Expected /Users/cscairns/source/myapp/app/models/observer/user_observer.rb to define UserObserver (LoadError) What is the proper syntax that I need to use in environment.rb now that the observers look like? Observer::UserObserver
