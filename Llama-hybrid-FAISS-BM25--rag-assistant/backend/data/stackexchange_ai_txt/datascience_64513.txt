You are using the Transformers library from HuggingFace. Since this library was initially written in Pytorch, the checkpoints are different than the official TF checkpoints. But yet you are using an official TF checkpoint. You need to download a converted checkpoint, from there . Note : HuggingFace also released TF models. But I'm not sure if it works without conversion from official TF checkpoints. If you want to use the TF API of HuggingFace, you need to do : from transformers import TFBertForMaskedLM
