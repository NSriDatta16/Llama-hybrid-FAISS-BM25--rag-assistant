why is setAnimationDidStopSelector discouraged?

i saw the following in apples documentation on setAnimationDidStopSelector: "Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. If you are using the block-based animation methods, you can include your delegateâ€™s end code directly inside your block." I tried adding what I was going to put inside the animation stop delegate inside the animation block, but the animation doesn't look the same as when i used setAnimationDidStopSelector. What is the reason for discouraging the use of setAnimationDidStopSelector?
