Bayesian analysis problem

The problem in hand is that the prior distribution which I have received from experts (loan recovery data) ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus a beta distribution was assumed. Where as the actual data shows that loan recovery can be more than 100% due to fees and interest charges. Thus the likelihood function does not follow a beta distribution simply because the values may be greater than 100%. Trying to use conjugate prior method to combine distributions to arrive at the posterior distribution. First I thought the beta-beta conjugate prior method will suffice. Rescaling the likelihood function to 0% - 100% does not seem correct. What do I do. Please help
