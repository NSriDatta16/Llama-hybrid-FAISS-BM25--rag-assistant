The situation is addressed in the following paragraphs of your wikipedia link. It is also easier to look at Bivariate case there, since it directly gives the formulas you need. The conditional variance is $(1-\rho^2)\sigma_1^2$ . Using the bivariate formula in here and assuming zero-means for simplicity, wlog, we can factorize the joint gaussian pdf to find the conditional gaussian pdf for $x|y$ : $$p(x,y)=p(x|y)p(y)\propto exp(-\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)}(\frac{x_1^2}{\sigma_1^2}-\frac{2\rho x_1x_2}{\sigma_1\sigma_2}+\frac{x^2_2}{\sigma^2_2}))$$ $$\propto exp(-\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)}(\frac{x_1^2}{\sigma_1^2}-\frac{2\rho x_1x_2}{\sigma_1\sigma_2}+\frac{x^2_2}{\sigma^2_2}-\frac{(1-\rho^2)x_2^2}{\sigma_2^2}))exp(-\frac{x_2^2}{2\sigma_2^2})$$ Second part is $p(y)$ , first part is $p(x|y)$ and both are in still normal form. Normal form is proportional to $exp(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})=exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}+\frac{x\mu}{\sigma^2}-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2})$ . We just match the insides of the exponentials here. The square term in exponent of $p(x|y)$ is $-\frac{x_1^2}{2(1-\rho^2)\sigma_1^2}$ , which should be equal to $-\frac{x_1^2}{2\sigma^2}$ , which yields $\sigma^2=(1-\rho^2)\sigma_1^2$ , which is the same formula above and the variance doesn't depend on the particular value of $x_2$ . Notice that I assumed zero-mean, but incorporating $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ into these equations will not change the coefficient of $x_1^2$ .
