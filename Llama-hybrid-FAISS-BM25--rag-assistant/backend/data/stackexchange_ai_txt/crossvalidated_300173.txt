Examples of using MCMC for GP regression

This is a reference request. I am in a position of needing to use MCMC to do Gaussian process regression for a project. I have used MCMC before, and I have used GPs before, but never together. It would be very helpful to me to walk through some examples. Best of all would be to have one or more extremely simple examples in addition to some more complex examples; in both cases, the more hand-holding the better.
