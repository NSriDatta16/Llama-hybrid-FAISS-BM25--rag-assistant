Short version: It's undefined behavior. Long version: I checked the CWE site and found that, while it's a bad idea all around, nobody seemed to have a solid answer. Probably because it's undefined. My guess is that most implementations, assuming they don't crash , would either free 1019 bytes (in your example), or else free 1024 and get a double free or similar on the last five. Just speaking theoretically for now, it depends on whether the malloc routine's internal storage tables contains an address and a length, or a start address and an end address. In any case, it's clearly not a good idea. :-)
