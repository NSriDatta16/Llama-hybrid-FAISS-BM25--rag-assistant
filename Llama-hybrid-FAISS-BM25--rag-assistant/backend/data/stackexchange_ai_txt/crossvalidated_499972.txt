Yes, there is a meaning behind this combination. As you can find here , the difference of two normal random variables has the following distribution: $$ U_1-U_2 \sim\ U_1 + a U_2\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}\big( \mu_{U_1} + a\mu_{U_2},\ \sqrt{\sigma_{U_1}^2 + a^2\sigma_{U_2}^2} \big) = \mathcal{N}\big( \mu_{U_1} - \mu_{U_2},\ \sqrt{\sigma_{U_1}^2 + \sigma_{U_2}^2} \big) $$ Hence, the difference of these two comes from a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \sqrt{(0.2)^2 + (0.8)^2}) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.82)$ . For the difference you can use the folded normal distribution. Hence, $|U_1 - U_2|$ has the mean like following (see this link for more details which $Y = |U_1 - U_2|$ in our case): So, expected value of the distribution of absolute difference of two normal variables $U_1$ and $U_2$ is $0.82 \times \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}$ (because $\mu = 0$ in distribution of $U1 - U_2$ ). Finally, as the average of $n$ instance ( $n = 100$ ) from the same distribution (i.i.d.) is an estimation of the mean of the distribution we can say mean(abs(u1 - u2)) = 0.82 * (\sqrt(2/pi)) ~ 0.657952 .
