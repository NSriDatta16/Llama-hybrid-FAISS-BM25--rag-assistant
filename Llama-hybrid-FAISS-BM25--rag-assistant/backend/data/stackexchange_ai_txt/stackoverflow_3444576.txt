Linking Oracle with SQL Server

I'm trying to link SQL Server 2005 to an Oracle 10g database. I've installed the Oracle client on the SQL server and validated that I can connect to the Oracle database using both tnsping and sqlplus. When I try to run a query in SQL Server I get the following: OLE DB provider "OraOLEDB.Oracle" for linked server "ORA_CSSA2APD" returned message "ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve the connect identifier specified". Msg 7303, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 Cannot initialize the data source object of OLE DB provider "OraOLEDB.Oracle" for linked server "ORA_CSSA2APD". Any ideas? I've tried both of the following queries with no luck: select * from openquery(ORA_CSSA2APD, 'select count(rowid) from eservice_op.agent') select count(rowid) from ORA_CSSA2APD..eservice_op.agent
