moving card from one pile to another moving item from one array to another javascript

FIrstly, no DOM, this is on the serverside. My question is pretty much identical to: Elegant technique to move items from one array to another Sadly in Javascript there are no queues. I have a bunch of cards represented as objects in an array called Deck. I want to move from the Deck to the hand in a clean way. I can use splice and concat to the hand array. But I would not like to do that all the time. Ideally I would have a function that I can pass in the card object and the destination array: function moveCard (deck[5], hand) { // return success } Or is there a different structure that can better model the data in JS? Thanks.
