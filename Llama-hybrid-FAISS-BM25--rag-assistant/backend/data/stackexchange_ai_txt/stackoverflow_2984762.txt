Extending folder (LiveFolder?) class

So, I noticed that I can organize apps into folders (HTC Incredible). However these folders are fairly limited in their capabilities. I want to implement an activity that extends the "base" folder activity (at the very least I want to add the ability to rearrange items in folders), but I can't figure out the class name... So, what's the name of the class that is used when adding a "New Folder" to the Home screen? PS I did take a look at the Android developer website . But the discussion there revolves mostly around content providers. I assume that's not quite what I need since I'd have to create a separate content provider for each new folder, or am I misunderstanding something?
