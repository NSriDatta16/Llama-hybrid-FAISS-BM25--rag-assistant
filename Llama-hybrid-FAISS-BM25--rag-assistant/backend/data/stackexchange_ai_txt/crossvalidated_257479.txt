There are ways to incorporate the within-rater variance and the between-rater variance in a single analysis; this is the purpose of generalizability theory. However, to keep things simple for you, I would recommend starting by calculating the raters' agreement at each time point separately, thus focusing on the between-rater variance. To do so, create an item-by-rater matrix and feed this into an ICC function. Your matrix should thus have three columns and a number of rows equal to the number of "points" in your study (you didn't say how many). Repeat this process for the first and second trial separately. If you plan to use the average of all raters in your study, then use ICC(A,k) or ICC(C,k). Or if you plan to use the ratings from a single rater for each item, then use ICC(A,1) or ICC(C,1). You can find formulas and MATLAB functions for all four formulations on my website .
