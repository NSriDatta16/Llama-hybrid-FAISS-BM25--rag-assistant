This is all a very touchy feely data anyway. It really is only relevant to you when it's applied to your average user of your product. Also time plays a factor. It used to be that the main problem was getting people who never used computer to use a computer in there daily work life. Nowadays almost everyone uses computers (and mostly windows based computers). So the focus, I believe, has changed from away from low level standardized user interfaces into flow, feature discoverability, user experiences, etc, etc. So I don't see how any kind of "public" data will help you in any way unless you conduct usability testing with a range of common users with your products and base your facts off that.
