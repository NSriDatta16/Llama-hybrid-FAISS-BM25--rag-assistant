If I have an iPad app with lots of images, is PNG still the best option?

I am working on an iPad application which has hundreds of photo-quality images. I would have naturally assumed to store these images as JPEGs so as to optimize the app file size. However, Apple's guidelines state: Use the PNG format for images. The PNG format provides lossless image content, meaning that saving image data to a PNG format and then reading it back results in the exact same pixel values. PNG also has an optimized storage format designed for faster reading of the image data. It is the preferred image format for iOS. However, if I store the same images as JPEGs at 100% quality, the size of them drops to about half that of the PNG lossless versions. Is there really that much of a performance hit to use JPEG instead of PNG? If I am viewing these images in a carousel or gallery style, do I really need to worry about the performance and use PNGs instead? Thanks!
