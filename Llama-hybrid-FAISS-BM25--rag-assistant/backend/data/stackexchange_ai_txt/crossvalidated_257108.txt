Pair-wise correlations and multicollinearity with logistic regression. Differing results

So currently running a logistic regression and as a precursor i run some pairwise correlation tests and find that some variables are correlated >.7. I then run a multicollinearity test and get all tolerance values greater than 0.4 and all VIF values were between 1 and 3 suggesting no multicollinearity? Does this mean that I can continue my logistic regression? Thank you
