Consider entity embedding s which use "semantics" / "intrinsic properties". "Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables" https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06737 Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up neural networks compared with one-hot encoding, but more importantly by mapping similar values close to each other in the embedding space it reveals the intrinsic properties of the categorical variables. If this looks good then please advise and will share more resources.
