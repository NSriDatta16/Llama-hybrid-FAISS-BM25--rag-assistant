Unless you want to do querying on your objects in Sql Server (or there are other sources that may update/manage relational data), using EF to convert into relation schema is a bit overkill. If all you want is to persist your object graph in different mediums then you should consider runtime serialization or DataContractSerializer. Essentially, you will get binary data or XML that you can dump into any storage medium including Sql Server. This will free you from changing relation schema in sql server when your object structures changes. However, you must consider versioning your objects while going from serialization approach.
