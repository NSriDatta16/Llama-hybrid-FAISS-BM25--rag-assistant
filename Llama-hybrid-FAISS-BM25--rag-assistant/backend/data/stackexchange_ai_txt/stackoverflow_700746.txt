In your case I would develop kind of framework to allow to your colleagues think only about formulas, maths and solvers. I think all of the "good at math" Guys if their work is not only implementing math functions should be aware of the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". You also can pay your colleagues attention to the boost algorithms. There is a graph library you can adopt for your project needs.
