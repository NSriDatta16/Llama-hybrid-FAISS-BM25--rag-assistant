Just my thoughts and experiences: Mentor. Assign a senior or lead programmer to mentor them. Not everyone is geared for this sort of assignment and a good mentor makes a difference. We have a mentor assigned to every new programmer - regardless of how long they have been coding - just to get the new employee familiar with our systems. Start small. Depending on how your organization / team / etc is configured have the new grad start on some small maintenance projects, with a mentor reviewing their code and guiding them. Get them training in the development environment your shop works in - expect that they will know a little about a few languages but that most of their development experience will be with school projects - not exactly solid production code. They will need a solid base to work from in the environment you use. Code review and best practices - give them guidelines and make sure that they stick to them - if you are not using best practices internally, then start. Makes a huge difference when a large development group is involved. Review code frequently - this does not have to be a large group of developers in a meeting - one on one reviews, informal inspections, etc work wonders. Develop an environment of cooperation - allow developers to mingle and talk and brainstorm - give them the opportunity to discuss ideas and thoughts that might not be related to the code at hand - they will rely on each other more then plants in the cube farm and production will higher quality. Allow them to read blogs and sites related to their craft - sights such as this one, coding horror, hacker news, etc. Support them going to local user groups and developer conferences. Productive? That depends on the individual - some new graduates will never be productive coders but might be productive analysts or managers - some will be code machines out of the gate but will quickly churn out 1000 lines of maintenance nightmare code where 20 would suffice. I would say a fresh programmer out of school should be productive in 6 to 8 months - this is to say up to speed with you average programmers on staff, able to take a new project for your product, design and implement it, and able to handle any maintenance task required. It takes time to get the experience required to be productive - experience that can only come from actually developing in a production environment.
