How to override a related set's "add" method in Django

I am working on a Django project and I want to send a signal when something gets added to some model's related set. E.g. we have an owner who has a set of collectables, and each time the method owner.collectable_set.add(something) is getting called, I want a signal like collectable_added or something. Signals are clear to me, but I don't know which manager(?) contains the "add" method that I want to override. Edit for Xavier's request to provide more details: you can easily override a modelâ€™s save method, by simply defining it and calling the "super- save " so it gets properly saved with some extra functionality. But I wonder where to override a related set's add method. Gosh, I think I haven't brought in any further details, but I think it should be clear what I want to do even from the first paragraph. Edit 2: This is the method I want to override. Is it recommended to do so, or do you suggest another way to place the sending of the signal?
