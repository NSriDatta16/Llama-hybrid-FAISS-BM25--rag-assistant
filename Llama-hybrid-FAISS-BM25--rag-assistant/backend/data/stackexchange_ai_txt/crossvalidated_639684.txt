Shap values associated to missing features

I have a model trained with Xgboost on some training data X_train, described by 10 features (x $_{1}$ ,...,x $_{10}$ ) and some of them might exhibit some missingness, i.e. some x $_{i}$ = NaN. This is ok for training a model like Xgboost as it can handle missing entries. Then, I want to tackle the explainability of the model via SHAP, specifically via Tree Shap, in order to calculate the Shap values on a held out/test set X_test: # Tree explainer object explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model) # Shap values shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test) What is the meaning of individual Shap values for missing/NaN entries in X_test? If a feature x $_{i}$ = NaN should its Shap value be zero?
