D+R: How many randomized trials to determine the D value?

I have an unknown fixed integer D. N binary random variables R were added to D. In each randomized trial we can observe the sum D+R. But we don't know D and we don't know the R's outcome in each trial. We only know the sum. R is a uniformly distributed random 0/1 value. N random values were added to D. So you can assume that on average N random values add up to N/2. How many trials of D+R values I need to examine before I can predict the D value with some confidence? Hope my question made sense. I didn't know how else to explain it.
