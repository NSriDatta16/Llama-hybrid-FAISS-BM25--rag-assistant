If you want to read and write from the text file at random locations, your best bet is to use INI files. An INI file contains entries that look like this: [owner] name=John Doe organization=Acme Products To read an ini file, you need a function that you can call like this: Dim s as string s=ReadINI("c:\myfolder\myfile.ext", "owner", "name") ...which will put "John Doe" in s. The code to do this is here: http://cwashington.netreach.net/depo/view.asp?Index=553 Writing the INI file works the same way. Here is another example: WriteINI("c:\myfolder\myfile.ext", "MySection", "MyItem", "MyValue") creates an INI file that looks like this: [MySection] MyItem=MyValue You can have as many different sections and items within each section as you want. All you have to do to retrieve the value that you want is to call ReadINI with the section name and item name of the value you want to retrieve.
