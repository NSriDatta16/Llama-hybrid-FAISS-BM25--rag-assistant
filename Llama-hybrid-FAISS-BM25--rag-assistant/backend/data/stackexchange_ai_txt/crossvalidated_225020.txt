proof of Markov chain Monte Carlo

This is the first step of proof of MCMC in my notes I have a question, how come $\pi(x)\pi(x_p\mid x)=\pi(x_p)\pi(x\mid x_p)$? Is it true for any markov chains which are ergodic and aperiodic? The text says "we start by constructing a markov chain, making it $\pi(x)\pi(x_p\mid x) = \pi(x_p)\pi(x\mid x_p)$... But how can we prove for any any markov chains which are ergodic and aperiodic, we have $\pi(x)\pi(x_p\mid x)=\pi(x_p)\pi(x\mid x_p)$?
