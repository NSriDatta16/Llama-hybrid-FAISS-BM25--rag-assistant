When you only have a single Bernoulli trial, there is little that can be done within the frequentist paradigm. Your maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for $p$ is clearly $\hat{p} = X \sim \text{Bern}(p)$. This is an unbiased estimator with unknown variance $\mathbb{V}(\hat{p}) = p(1-p)$. Since you only have a single value in the sample, there is no basis to estimate the variance of the MLE$^\dagger$. Nonetheless, a $(1-\alpha)$-level confidence interval for the parameter $p$ can be constructed as (hap-tip to guy in the comments): $$\begin{matrix} \text{CI}(1-\alpha) \equiv [\alpha X, 1 - \alpha (1-X)] & & & 0 This gives an interval estimator for the true probability parameter. It is wider than the Bayesian credibility interval in the question, and thus represents a more robust estimate. $^\dagger$ The maximum-likelihood estimator of the variance $\mathbb{V}(\hat{p})$ is zero, which is unhelpful.
