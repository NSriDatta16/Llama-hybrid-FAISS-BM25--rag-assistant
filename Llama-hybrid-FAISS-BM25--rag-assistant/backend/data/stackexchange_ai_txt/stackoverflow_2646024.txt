You could use BigInteger for this. Example: (new BigInteger(1,bytes)).toString(16) You will need to add an '0' at the beginning. A more elegant solution (taken from here ) is: BigInteger i = new BigInteger(1,bytes); System.out.println(String.format("%1$06X", i)); You need to know the number of bytes in advance in order to use the correct formatter.
