For KNN: How to justify that the probability of points to fall into a sphere of volume $V$ is $p(X)V$

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/10701_S19/files/Lecture_3.pdf At the end of these notes, there is a short paragraph. Let $x$ be a test point. Let $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ be its $K$ nearest neighbors. Let $v_x$ be a sphere around $x$ containing its $K$ nearest neighbors. Assuming $x$ is an instance of a random variable $X$ which is uniformly distributed in $v_x$ . The probability of "points" falling in $v_x$ is $p(X) V$ , $V$ is the volume of $v_x$ . How does one make sense of this paragraph? What does it mean for points to fall into $v_x$ (since $X$ is uniform in $v_x$ , therefore isn't it guaranteed to generate a point which fall into $v_x$ ?) Why is the probability given by $P(X) V$ ?
