Getting the id of child element based on the parents class name

I am currently playing around with jqueries drag and drop, basically I currently have a div (.drag_check) that holds a checkbox, I have the drag and drop working but I want to alert out the checkbox's ID once the element is dropped, I assume I have to use child but all my attempts have returned 'undefined'. Below is my code, $('.drag_check').draggable({ containment: 'document', opacity:0.6, revert: 'invalid', helper: 'clone', zIndex: 100 }); $("ul.searchPage").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui) { var param = $(ui.draggable).attr('class') addlist(param) alert(param) } })
