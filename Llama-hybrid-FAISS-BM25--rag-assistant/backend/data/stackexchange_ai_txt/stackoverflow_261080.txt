Resizable Java component

I would like to have a Java component which has a resize icon on the bottom right of the component so that when I drag that icon, the component will automatically resize with it. By resize icon, I mean the following: The above image contains the resize icon in the Google Talk messenger's main window. Is there any Java component which provides this facility?
