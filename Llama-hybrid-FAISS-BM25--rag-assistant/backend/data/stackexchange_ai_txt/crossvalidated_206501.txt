Choosing how many factors to retain based on parallel analysis and on a scree plot without an elbow

When I realize the Factor Analysis (I have 16 items), the PCA says I have 5 factors. But in the scree plot there is no elbow at all, just a decreasing line, that makes me think maybe I shouldn't be using PCA. At the same time I realize a Parallel Analysis to check how many factors I have, and the Parallel Analysis says 4 are above the mean and the percentyles and the 5th is just 0.01 under the mean. Some papers say I should take it some say I shouldn't. Could you help me to know, first if I'm using the right model if in the scree plot there is no elbow and, second how can I check how many factors I have?
