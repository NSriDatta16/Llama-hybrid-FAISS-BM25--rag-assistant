fastest data structure for retrieval info c++

I am Developping Client Application which is a simulator for TCP client may have to simulate 1000 client. each client status info can be of the size 50 byte.The state info is required by the server and client simulator need to store some where. Server can request any client about status info.So for this scenario I wanted to know which data structure can be useful. Server is already implemented.How I can manage these Client status info.As I can't use boost and other third party lib i have to rely on c++ only. About how the status information is managed: The simulated clients know their own status The simulated server can request the status from the simulated client. Each client will have fixed unique numer. The server is aware of this number. When the client is connected server will map the socket with this number to identify the client. Each time the server polls for any client's status, it will poll for all clients status. Which STL/or Other data structure can used in this scenario. Here no third lib party allowed. please suggest me which one is the optimum to use Thanks
