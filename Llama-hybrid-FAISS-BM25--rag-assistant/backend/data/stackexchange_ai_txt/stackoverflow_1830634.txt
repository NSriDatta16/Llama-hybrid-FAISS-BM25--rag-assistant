@property is "merely" a shorthand for method declarations. @dynamic means that you'll dynamically provide the implementations at runtime, an advanced use pattern that is atypical. Thus: @property (readonly) NSArray *recipes; Is, in the header, shorthand for: - (NSArray *) recipes; @synthesize recipes; will synthesize the methods implied by the @property declaration. No more, no less. Since someone mentioned it, @synthesize recipes=_recipes; will synthesize the methods, but use the instance variable _recipes for storage (and not recipes ). If you implement your own getter (since this is readonly, there is only a getter), of the form: - (NSArray *) recipes { return ....; } Then there is no need for either @synthesize or @dynamic .
