Start simple; then add complexity as needed Before you get to the construction of complicated multivariate time-series, the first step here would be to build a standard multivariate linear regression and see how this looks. You say that you have a whole bunch of explanatory variables relating to each of the time-series of interest, so start by fitting a regression and see how much of the variation in the responses this explains. The main advantage of this is that you will be able to filter out the effects of the explanatory variables and see what is left. You can apply appropriate transformations to your response variables to get them on an appropriate scale (e.g., taking logarithms of time-series that grow roughly exponentially) and use standard regression methods as a first pass. You can then look at the diagnostic plots for the regression and see if there is evidence of auto-correlation in the residuals, or seasonality, or other things that would warrant moving to the framework of time-series analysis. Now, perhaps a linear regression will not fit your data well, but you won't know this until you try it and see what ---if any--- deficiencies this type of model has. Common deficiencies you would want to look for are evidence of auto-correlation in residuals, evidence of moving averages in the error terms, etc. If these things are present, you can indeed create larger multivariate time-series models that incorporate AR and MA effects plus explanatory variables. Start simple and then work up to what you need to explain your data well. Once you have tried some simpler models, you can come back here with your results and diagnostic plots and we will be able to give you some advice on how to generalise your model properly.
