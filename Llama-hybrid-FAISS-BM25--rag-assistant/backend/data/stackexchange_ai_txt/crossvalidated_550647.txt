RMSE / MAPE interpretation of graph

I am a ML beginner. For a school assignment I was told to calculate both RMSE and MAPE of some machine learning algorithm. I have done that, but to be honest they both look very similar: My question is, what does the fact that they look almost identical tell us? That we didn't predict many outliers? What would you conclude from this? Thanks!
