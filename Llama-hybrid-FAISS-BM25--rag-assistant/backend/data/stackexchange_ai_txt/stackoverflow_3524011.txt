I'll focus on why (I think) Walther Bright thinks redunancy is good. Let's take XML as an example. This snippet: ... has redunancy, the closing tag is redunant if we use S-Expressions instead: (foo ...) It's shorter, and the programmer doesn't have to type foo more often than neccessary to make sense of that snippet. Less redunancy. But it has downsides, as an example from http://www.prescod.net/xml/sexprs.html shows: (document author: "paul@prescod.net" (para "This is a paragraph " (footnote "(better than the one under there)" ".") (para "Ha! I made you say \"underwear\".")) This is a paragraph (just a little one). Ha! I made you say "underwear". In both, the end tag/a closing paren for footnote is missing. The xml version is plain invalid as soon as the parser sees . The S-Expression one is only invalid by the end of the document, and only if you don't have an unneeded closing paren somewhere else. So redunancy does help, in some cases, to udnerstand what the writer meant (and point out errors in his way of expressing that).
