I would suggest you don't try to optimize away every possible copy of feed data at this stage of development (design, I presume). Concentrate on getting it working and when you're done, if you do some profiling and find that you can indeed save X% of storage if you use links or shared data between feeds, only then and if X is large enough to pay for the time it would take to optimize your DB would I suggest you implement any such more advanced schemes.
