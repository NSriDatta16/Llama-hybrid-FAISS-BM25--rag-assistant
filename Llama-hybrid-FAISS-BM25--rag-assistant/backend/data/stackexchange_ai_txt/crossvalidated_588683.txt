Does Omitted Variable Bias Matter for Prediction?

In the context of linear models, I can see why omitted variable bias may matter, as often we are interested in causal effects. In the context of time series models, we are often interested in prediction. In such a case, wouldn't using biased coefficients on predictors work? Such coefficients would capture the effect of the variable itself, as well as that of omitted variables, and should intuitively lead to similar predictions as the model with unbiased coefficients. I would like to understand if this intuition is correct.
