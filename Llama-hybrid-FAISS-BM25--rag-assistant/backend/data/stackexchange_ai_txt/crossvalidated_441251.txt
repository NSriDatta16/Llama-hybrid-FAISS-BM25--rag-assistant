Time series forecast on daily data to forecast future 30 days

I am building a time series forecasting model to forecast my future volume of sales based on historic data collected on daily basis from September 2017 to September 2019. I have transformed my data suitable for time series forecasting. I was wondering if there is an automated way of finding seasonality and trend in my data and based on the results I can choose which model to use and their components as well? I have put my data in this post. Could any of you please help me working out with this? Also could any of you please let me know if I need to concentrate only on day of the year or weekly or monthly for building my time series object. timeSeriesObjW = ts(ENGLISH $Usual,start=c(2017,09,20),frequency=7) fitW seasonal) seasonalW #Daily Fit timeSeriesObjD = ts(ENGLISH $Usual,start=c(2017,09,20),frequency=365.25) fitD seasonal) seasonalD fitW $Usual, frequency=365/7) fit seasonal) seasonal library(fma) fit1 $Usual) fit2 Usual,model="ANN") deviance $df - attributes(logLik(fit2))$ df #P value 1-pchisq(deviance,df) $p$ -value I get is 0
