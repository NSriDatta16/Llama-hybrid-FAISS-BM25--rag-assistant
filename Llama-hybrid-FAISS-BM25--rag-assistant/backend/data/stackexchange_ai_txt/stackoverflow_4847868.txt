After the hash mark ("#") it is expected the ID of some X/HTML element in the page that has to be highlighted or scrolled to by the user agent. Valid HTML ID attributes cannot contain "!", so it is more or less guaranteed that whatever follows "#" here will not match any element in the page. This trick is used to have many different URLs to the same page, and let a javascript in the page alter it by interpreting what comes after "#", possibly via AJAX. This has faster load times than if the user had to visit different pages. Also, it is bookmark and back button friendly.
