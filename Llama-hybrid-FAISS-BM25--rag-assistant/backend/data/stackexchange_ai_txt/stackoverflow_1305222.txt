People (who have never studied probability) tend to think that "pick a number from 1 to N" means "with equal probability of each", and they act according to their intuitive understanding of probability. Then when you say "pick any positive integer", they still think it means "with equal probability of each". This is of course impossible - there exists no discrete probability distribution with domain the positive integers, where p(n) == p(m) for all n, m. So, the person picking the number must have used some other probability distribution. If you know anything at all about that distribution, then you must base your guessing scheme on that knowledge in order to have the "fastest" solution. The only way to calculate how "fast" a given guessing scheme is, is to calculate its expected number of guesses to find the answer. You can only do this by assuming a probability distribution for the target number. For example, if they have picked n with probability (1/2) ^ n, then I think your best guessing scheme is "1", "2", "3",... (average 2 guesses). I haven't proved it, though, maybe it's some other sequence of guesses. Certainly the guesses should start small and grow slowly. If they have picked 4 with probability 1 and all other numbers with probability 0, then your best guessing scheme is "4" (average 1 guess). If they have picked a number from 1 to a trillion with uniform distribution, then you should binary search (average about 40 guesses). I say the only way to define "fast" - you could look at worst case. You have to assume a bound on the target, to prevent all schemes having the exact same speed, namely "no bound on the worst case". But you don't have to assume a distribution, and the answer for the "fastest" algorithm under this definition is obvious - binary search starting at the bound you selected. So I'm not sure this definition is terribly interesting... In practice, you don't know the distribution, but can make a few educated guesses based on the fact that the picker is a human being, and what numbers humans are capable of conceiving. As someone says, if the number they picked is the Ackermann function for Graham's number, then you're probably in trouble. But if you know that they are capable of representing their chosen number in digits, then that actually puts an upper limit on the number they could have chosen. But it still depends what techniques they might have used to generate and record the number, and hence what your best knowledge is of the probability of the number being of each particular magnitude.
