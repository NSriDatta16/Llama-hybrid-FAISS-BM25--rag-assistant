It's all down to disk caching and file system structure. Some read/write operation will only need to operate on a cache if the data is already in there and be flushed later. Other operations must operate on the disk as the data is not in the cache and will be much slower. The arrangement of blocks in the filesystem could also affect these things. In the extreme, adding that one byte to the GB file may cause a good portion of it to be moved on the disk. Other factors such as fragmentation, block size and the way read/writes are optimised and cached could cause the effects you see.
