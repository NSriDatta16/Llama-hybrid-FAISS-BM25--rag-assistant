Themes for python e-commerce solutions

There are two good open source python e-commerce solutions exist: Satchmo and LFS. But I can't find any theme for them. Does at least one open source theme for them exist? There are thousands themes for Magento, osCommerce, OpenCart, but zero themes for Satchmo. Thanks.
