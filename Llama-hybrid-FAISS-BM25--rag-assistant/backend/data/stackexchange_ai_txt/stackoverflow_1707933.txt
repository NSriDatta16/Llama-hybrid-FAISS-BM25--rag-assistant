Moving local SQL Server 2008 databases over to a single Internet based server

Has anyone any experience moving a number of identical SQL Server databases (with unique data) from individual local servers to a single internet based server? We currently have 10 companies using our Windows app which uses SQL Server 2008 for data storage, but we are finding that maintaining the databases and ensuring they are backed up etc is a major headache as they are all on individual local LANS. We are now looking into the prospect of increasing the client base to 40-50 organisations and also needed to report on the data across all the organisations. If we simply created 50 identical databases on our own internet based server, we could achieve this without too much of a redesign, but is this the best approach? Or should we merge all the databases into one and create an extra column to identify the organisation so they only see their own data? Each organisation has between 2-10 staff members and input about 5000-10000 records per year consisting of 20 fields of mainly chars and ints so it's not too enormous. Any guidance would be appreciated.
