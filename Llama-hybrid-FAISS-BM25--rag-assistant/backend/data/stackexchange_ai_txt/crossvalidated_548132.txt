Calculating Confidence Interval on a Weighted Average

I'm creating a metric which is a weighted average of a parameter $X_i$ . Weights themselves are multiplications of $W_i * T_i$ . In other words, my metric is something like: $my\_metric = \frac{\sum_i(W_i * T_i * X_i) }{ \sum_j(W_j * T_j)}$ How could I possibly measure a confidence interval for $my\_metric$ ? $W_i$ , $T_i$ , and $X_i$ are all observations with unknown independent distributions.
