You want to do three things: Cluster similar customers based on their profiles and their preferences for certain devices Cluster similar devices based on ratings but also device attributes Create a recommender system based on clusterings 1 and 2 Here is how I would do it: Cluster customers via usual means (PCA, K-Means, etc.) based on their demographics For each cluster develop a model that predicts the "rating" of a device based on the devices attributes (e.g. via ensemble learning, association rules, etc.). Then use the model to predict the rating of a new device for each cluster ! Implement a simple recommender based on the cluster membership and a relevant device set based on ratings, this works because of step 2 each device now has a ranking. If you want to "manipulate the customer" further you can add simple rules to add devices below the relevant rating threshold if they satisfy certain criteria (price, "is on sale", etc.). Voila!
