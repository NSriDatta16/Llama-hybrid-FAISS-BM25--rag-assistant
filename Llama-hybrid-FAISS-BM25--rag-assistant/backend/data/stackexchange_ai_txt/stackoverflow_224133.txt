To extend @yogman's answer. Memcached is pure awesomeness! It's a high performance and distributed object cache. And even though I mentioned distributed it's basically as simple as starting one instance on one of your spare/idle servers, you configure it as in ip, port and how much ram to use and you're done. memcached -d -u www -m 2048 -l 10.0.0.8 -p 11211 (Runs memcached in daemon mode, as user www, 2048 MB (2 GB) of RAM on IP 10.0.0.8 with port 11211.) From then on, you ask memcached for data and if the data is not yet cached you pull it from the original source and store it in memcached. I'm sure you are familiar with cache basics. In a cluster environment you can link up your memcached's into a cluster and replicate the cache across your nodes. Memcached runs on Linux, Unix and Windows, start it anywhere you have spare RAM and start using your resources. APIs for memcached should be generally available . I'm saying should because I only know of Perl, Java and PHP. But I am sure that e.g. in Python people have means to leverage it as well. There is a memcached wiki , in case you need pointers, or let me know in the comments if I was raving too much. ;)
