You can use @font-face with: Firefox 3.5 Safari 3.2 Chrome 4.0 Opera 10.5 http://a.deveria.com/caniuse/#feat=fontface For IE, the fallback is working great, but be sure to use the little hack for smooth rendering: http://allcreatives.net/2009/12/05/smoother-font-face-embedding-in-ie-7-8/ Issues : Font rendering quality differs from browser to browsers. As anti aliasing techniques of each browser are different : http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/html5-font-face-is-not-as-ready-as-you-would-think/ Typekit will provide an online tool for that : http://typophile.com/node/65656 (source: typophile.com ) while the font is downloading, the user see the default font during 1 or 2 seconds If the font is provided by your client, He may be concerned by the fact that the font will be downlodable from the website. I've made printing font-face tests : it is just not working (but with sFIR it's ok)
