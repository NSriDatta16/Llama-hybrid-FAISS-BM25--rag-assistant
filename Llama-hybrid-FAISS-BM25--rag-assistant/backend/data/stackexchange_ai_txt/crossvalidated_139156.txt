With so little data, you should not be picking functions essentially "at random" like this. 1) It's essential to use subject-matter knowledge. For example, in the case of pH dependent drug solubility, discussions such as the ones here or here discuss subject matter knowledge that seem to suggest somewhat different forms from those you have, though maybe you can justify something like your last equation using such considerations. 2) Even if all your observations were with no error whatever, you cannot fit more parameters than you have observations 3) Given that observations will contain error, you should have fewer parameters than observations; unless you can bring some external knowledge of likely parameter values (strong priors in a Bayesian context) or similar suitable information, the situation is almost hopeless. If you really want to be able to identify the functional form from data without bringing in a lot of subject matter knowledge and not have the consequences of the model selection impact your estimation, you need enough data to identify a suitable model and to estimate the parameters from different parts of the data (or in some other way to separate the estimation from the bias that identification will bring in). Even with very low noise observations that's likely to require well into the dozens of observations to get a good idea of the function and to estimate its parameters -- and that is only if you consider extremely simple functional forms.
