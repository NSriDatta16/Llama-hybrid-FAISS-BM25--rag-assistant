The time series are usually decomposed into 3 parts, trend, seasonality and irregular. (The link gives 4 parts, but cyclical and seasonality are usually lumped together). Strictly speaking ARIMA type of models are only used for irregular part and by their design these model do not incorporate any trend (I am assuming that trend is some function which varies in time). So if you simply want to estimate AR(2) model no software will estimate the trend for you, since if it did, it would not be fitting AR(2) model. To forecast the trend you will first need to create some sort of model and test it, and only after you are confident that your model truly estimates the trend, then you can use it to forecast the trend. Without such model any forecasting is impossible. Sadly the majority of time series textbooks do not stress this when talking about forecasting.
