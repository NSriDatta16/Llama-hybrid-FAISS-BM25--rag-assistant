On your question "if there is a way to do time-varying relative contributions", I would surmise an answer of yes. Exhaustively, try performing the Shapley decompositions for relative contributions of regressors in the selected linear regression at each point in time, assuming that was the end of the data horizon. As a side comment, a lot of computations for what is solely a simple regression analysis based partial R-square for a variable ${x_j}$ of interest (see, discussion here ). As I have voiced previously on this forum, regression analysis is reportedly not without its issues or necessarily, in the particular application, the most appropriate and/or advanced path forward (as in contrast, for example, the possible employment of also computationally intensive factor regression or time series analysis).
