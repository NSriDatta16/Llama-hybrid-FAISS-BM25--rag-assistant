Django: The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines Django is a high-level python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers and maintained by the non-profit Django Software Foundation (DSF) . it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source. Django follows the mvc ( model-view-controller ) architectural pattern. This consists of: an object-relational mapper that mediates between data models (Python classes) and a relational database ("Model") a system for processing requests with a web templating system ("View") a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller") The django team prefers to think of Django as an "MTV" framework , where 'M' is the model , 'T' is the template and 'V' is view . In django , 'views' describe which data are presented while 'templates' describe how that data is presented.
