Your estimate of $\bar{x}_{t-1}$ is an estimate of a different quantity than your estimate of $\bar{x}_t$. So, you should always update, but recognize you are estimating something else each time. Let's make this more concrete. Suppose your $x_i$ are average interest rates on a particular type of investment. Then $\bar{x}_t$ is the average interest rate over the previous $t$ years. $\bar{x}_{t-1}$ is the average over years $1$ to $t-1$.
