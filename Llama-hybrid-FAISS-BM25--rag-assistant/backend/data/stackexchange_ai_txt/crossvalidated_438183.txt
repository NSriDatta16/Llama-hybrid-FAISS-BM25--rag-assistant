There's no problem with simply averaging. The expectation of a set of correlated samples from the population distribution will still be the population mean. Taking every Nth value will simply throw away information in the full data set. The only issue is in computing its variance or its standard deviation; however, if you have a sufficiently large run (once you've hit the stationary distribution), you can form fairly precise estimates of the autocorrelation function out to some high lag (say, about as far as the gaps you were going to leave where you were assuming independence), and so often get quite good estimates of the standard deviation.
