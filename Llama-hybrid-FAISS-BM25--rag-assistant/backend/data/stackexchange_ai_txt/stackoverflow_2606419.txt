If you want to catch this on a submit event then you can use regex to do that in the submit event hanlder. But if you want to do this when the user interaction with the text box is going on then you will have to manipulate keydown and focus events. By wiring only keypress or keydown events will not prevent the user from entering other characters. He can also drag text into the text box. So focus event will prevent that from happening.
