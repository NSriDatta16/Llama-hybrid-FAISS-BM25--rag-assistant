Buzzwords: interpolation, resampling, smoothing. Your problem is similar to one encountered frequently in demography: people might have census counts broken down into age intervals, for example, and such intervals are not always of constant width. You want to interpolate the distribution by age. What this shares with your problem, aside from the variable width (= variable time intervals), is that the data tend to be non-negative. In addition, many such datasets can have noise, but it has a particular form of negative correlation: a count that appears in one bin will not appear in neighboring bins, but might have been assigned to the wrong bin. For example, older people may tend to round their ages to the nearest five years. They are not overlooked but they might contribute to the wrong age group. By and large, though, the data are complete and reliable. In terms of this analogy we're talking about a full census; in your datasets you have actual electric bills, actual enrollments, and so on. So it's just a question of apportioning the data reasonably to a set of intervals useful for further analysis (such as equally spaced times for time series analysis): that's where interpolation and resampling are involved. There are many interpolation techniques. The commonest in demography were developed for simple calculation and are based on polynomial splines. Many share a trick worth knowing, regardless of how you plan to process your data: don't attempt to interpolate the raw data; instead, interpolate their cumulative sum. The latter will be monotonically increasing due to the non-negativity of the original values, and therefore will tend to be relatively smooth. This is why polynomial splines can work at all. Another advantage of this approach is that although the fit may deviate from the data points (slightly, one hopes), overall it correctly reproduces the totals , so that nothing is net lost or gained. Of course, after fitting the cumulative values (as a function of time or age), you take first differences to estimate totals within any bin you like. The simplest example of this approach is a linear spline: just connect successive points on the plot of cumulative $x$ vs. cumulative $t$ by line segments. Estimate the counts in any time interval $[t_0, t_1]$ by reading off the values $x_0$ and $x_1$ of the splined curve at $t_0$ and $t_1$ respectively and using $x_1 - x_0$. Better splines (cubic in some areas; quintic in many demographic apps) sometimes improve the estimates. This is equivalent to your intuition of weighting the data and gives it a nice graphical interpretation.
