No one will ever prove difinitively one way or the other, and Google likely won't tell, but SEO is pretty much voodoo once you get beyond the basics. Just make sure you have an interesting website that will gain organic deep links, and your PR will rise. Links and keyword density/keyword research are the most important SEO tips. If you're vying for such a hotly contested keyword that you need to worry about micro optimizations, maybe you should work your way down the long tail a little bit (freelance brickmason in miami rather than freelance brickmason)?
