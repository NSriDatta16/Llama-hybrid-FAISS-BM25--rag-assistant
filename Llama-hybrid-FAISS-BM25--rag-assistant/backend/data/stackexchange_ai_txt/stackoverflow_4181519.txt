Quality checker for PDF to Word conversion process

I am doing a PDF to Word conversion process. I need a quality checker which generates a error report for my PDF to Word converted files. I am using ABBYY software for my conversion process. Can you please suggest the best quality checker? I am doing a non-voice process (PDF to MS word conversion process). We all know that checking this output with PDF is a quite time consuming task. I came to know that there is an automatic checker which checks the contents in the PDF and Word and generates an error report for the converted work done. If you need further information, please visit thebinarycomputer.com/SpellCheck.html . The software at that link is not effective; I need better software than this. Khallas Spell-checking Software OVERVIEW This Software is able to compare between Image (PDF / JPG / TIF or Other Type) file & Word file. It can compare more than one file at a time. It is not necessary to check your Word file manually with Image file at the time of converting Image file into Word file using any OCR technology. Our software can detect error from word file as per your image file. And also it is able to do Auto Correction. This is fully automatic in nature. At the same time it shows original Image file, original Word file along with zoomed Image Highlighted portion. This shows error with different color at the time of compare between Image file and Word file. Accordingly, we can take decision easily.
