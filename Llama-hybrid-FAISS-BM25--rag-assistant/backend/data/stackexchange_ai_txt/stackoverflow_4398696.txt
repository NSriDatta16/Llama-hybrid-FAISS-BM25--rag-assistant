How can I ignore one blur listener when a different click listener is used in jQuery?

So it's kind of hard to put into a sentence but here is a simple example: Example Click me. Basically when you focus on an input a paragraph appears and when the focus is blurred the paragraph disappear. However there is also a click listener on the paragraph so when you click it an alert messagebox appears. The problem is when I focus the input box the paragraph appears [expected] but when I click on the paragraph the blurring of the input box is registered first so the paragraph is hidden before the browser detects I clicked on it.
