My advice would be to use the usort, as nikic suggested. It's much more elegant. Also, I wouldn't recommend using Bubble Sort. It's only advantage is being easier to understand. Here's a link to an insertion sort someone impolemented in PHP: http://www.think-lamp.com/2009/08/fastest-insertion-sort-in-php/ If you can adopt this function to sort based on the release date, and use the usort function, you will be in business.
