In my opinion it is best to store large data files in the SD Card as most users have very limited space on internal storage. Also, take a look at the documentation: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal It says "By default, files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them (nor can the user)." So if you are trying to use an another application to play the video, it is probably failing to read the file. Hope it helps.
