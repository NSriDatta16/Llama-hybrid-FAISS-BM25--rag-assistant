How to improve results accuracy for time series forecast?

I would like to share my analysis in order to have guidance on how to improve the time series results. Here you will find a table comparing real values vs forecasted ones. Below you will find the code that generated that output (in R). # Load required libraries library(forecast) library(lubridate) library(tidyverse) library(scales) library(ggfortify) # Load dataset emea I have added in this link the dataset which is used here . My main concern would be how to improve accuracy for forecasted results. I am looking into a possibility to add a machine learning algorithm but I am open to suggestions. Thanks in advance. Edit 24/01: As suggested, you will find the actual results for the prediction and the different outputs.
