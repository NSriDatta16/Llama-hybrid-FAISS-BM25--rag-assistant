Nestor: You seem to be misinterpreting BIC and DIC. They are based on a Bayesian approach. The fact that you observe the likelihood in their expressions is due to an approximation. The BIC was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz, who gave a Bayesian argument for adopting it. It [DIC] is particularly useful in Bayesian model selection problems where the posterior distributions of the models have been obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Log-Predictive scores ARE purely Bayesian and they are NOT plug-in estimators. They are complementary to Bayes factors since evaluate the predictive performance of a model. There also seem to be a contradiction in "It is particularly useful in Bayesian model selection problems where the posterior distributions of the models have been obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation." and "And, if you read carefully my question, I AM searching for something like an information criterion which includes the posterior distribution (and therefore, the variability of the parameters on each model)." Anyway, good luck ...
