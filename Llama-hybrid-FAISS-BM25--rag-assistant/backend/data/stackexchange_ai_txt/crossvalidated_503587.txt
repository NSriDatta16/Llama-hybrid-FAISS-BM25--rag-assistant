Depends what you mean by "B,C,D"; if you mean B AND C AND D, that's an intersection (union corresponds to OR). Supposing you mean B AND C AND D, the basic Bayesian formula applies as follows: $$ P(A|(B\cap C\cap D))=\frac{P(A\cap B\cap C\cap D)}{P(B\cap C\cap D)} $$ It is true that this also equals $$ \frac{P(A)P((B\cap C\cap D)|A)}{P(B\cap C\cap D)} $$ Whether this is a useful equality depends on which of the various terms you have values for.
