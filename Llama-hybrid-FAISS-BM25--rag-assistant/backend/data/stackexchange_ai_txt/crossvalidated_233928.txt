This is a standard problem in DAGs, and the solution is known as Topological Sorting . This can actually be done via Depth First Search , rather than Breadth First Search as suggested in the question. In the case of non-recurrent neural networks, I am no expert but I would imagine that this is essentially always known implicitly. I say this because from my understanding, the common training method known as backpropagation would proceed in reverse topological order.
