Depending on the format of the required answer, there are two ways: If the answer is of a known length or the answer is one of a few choices, you may auto-advance the cursor w/some javascript/jquery. For instance, if you're expecting phone numbers, when the person enters the 10th digit in the box, move the cursor to the next box. If you don't know and you can't apply (1), the quickest way is to encourage users to tab their way through the boxes. Speaking of tabs, if the boxes can be logically grouped, you could create tabs and have the users page their way through the questions. This will create more clicks, but will improve user experience. But holy crap, 2k text boxes on one page is crazy!
