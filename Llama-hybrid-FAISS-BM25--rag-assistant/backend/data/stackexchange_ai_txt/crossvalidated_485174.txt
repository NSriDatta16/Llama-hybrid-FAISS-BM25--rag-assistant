I believe this is because in OLS the average of residuals is $0$ . Hence the formula for standard deviation of residuals ( $\epsilon)$ can be given as: $$\sqrt\frac{\sum (\epsilon_i - \mu_{\epsilon})^2}{n-2}$$ but since in OLS $\mu_{\epsilon}=0$ by construction (see explanation of why this is so in this Mathematics.SE answer) you are left with: $$\sqrt\frac{\sum (\epsilon_i - 0)^2}{n-2}= \sqrt\frac{\sum (\epsilon_i)^2}{n-2} \implies \sqrt\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n-2}$$ since $\epsilon_i=y_i - \hat{y_i}$
