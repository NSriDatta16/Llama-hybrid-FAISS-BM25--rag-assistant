Is using a uniform or non-informative prior for a Bayesian model equivalent in some sense to a Frequentist one?

An idea that keeps bothering me is if there is some parallel between a Bayesian and Frequentist model in using a non-informative/uniform prior. I have heard that the answer is no, but I am wondering if someone could go into more detail why. The intuition is that using a uniform prior gives equal weight to the parameter space as specified by the likelihood, and so it appeals to intuition to think of it that way. What is the reason why this thinking is wrong? Thanks!
