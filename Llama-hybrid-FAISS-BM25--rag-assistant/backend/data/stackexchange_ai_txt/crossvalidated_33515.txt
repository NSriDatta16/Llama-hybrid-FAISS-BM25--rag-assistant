Edwin Jaynes was one of the best at highlighting the connections between bayesian and frequentist inference. His paper confidence intervals vs bayesian intervals (google search brings it up) as a very thorough comparison - and I think a fair one. Small area estimation is another area where ML/REML/EB/HB answers tend to be close.
