There is a JIRA for the ability to use a filesystem asset . Someone has posted patches that should let you do it but it hasn't made it into a release yet. If you do that, you could use @IncludeStyleSheet(value={"file:path_to_css_file"}) in your layout template. An alternate way would be to stream it using a method like this one. The last paragraph suggests that you can include a streamed response in your template so in this case you could do . Then create a streamed response that reads the stylesheet from a known path on the server. Or you could store it in a blob in the database and stream from there - that way you could also create a page to let the designer upload new versions.
