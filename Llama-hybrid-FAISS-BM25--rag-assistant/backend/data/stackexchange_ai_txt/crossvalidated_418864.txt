This may be a bit of an advanced method, but I think it's the one that makes the most sense. You want to run a multinomial logistic regression model with Distribution, Type, and their interaction as predictors and choice as the dependent variable. The coefficients in the model are a bit hard to interpret (and you'll get many coefficients from such a model), but it's straightforward to test whether either of the factors or their interaction are related to the outcome. You can use likelihood ratio tests to choose between models that have the factor or interaction of interest and those that don't. Significant values for this test indicate that the factor does predict the choice. This is the same procedure you would use if you were to use a linear regression on a continuous outcome and weren't using an ANOVA procedure (though mathematically it's equivalent to ANOVA if parameterized correctly).
