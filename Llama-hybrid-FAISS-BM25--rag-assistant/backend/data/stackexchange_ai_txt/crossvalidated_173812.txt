There is not much to answer here. You seem to have had some problems with your script that are by now fixed. There is currently nothing wrong with your visualization and in fact I find it a very nice and adequate illustration. To answer your remaining questions: The slopes of your principal axes will always be $1$ and $-1$ for a standardized two-dimensional dataset (i.e. if you are working with a correlation matrix), as @whuber said in the comments. See my answer here: Does a correlation matrix of two variables always have the same eigenvectors? The ellipse that you plotted (according to my understanding of the source code of stat_ellipse() ) is a 95% coverage ellipse assuming multivariate normal distribution. This is a reasonable choice. Note that if you want a different coverage, you can change it via level input parameter, but 95% is pretty standard and okay.
