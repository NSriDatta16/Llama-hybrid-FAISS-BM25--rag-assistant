From code found in an SEO related class (Mage_Catalog_Block_Seo_Sitemap_Category) $helper = Mage::helper('catalog/category'); $collection = $helper->getStoreCategories('name', true, false); $array = $helper->getStoreCategories('name', false, false); Try to forget that it's a database that's powering your store, and instead concentrate on using the objects that the Magento system provides. For example, I had no no idea how to get a list of categories. However, I grepped through the Mage codebase with grep -i -r -E 'class.+?category' Which returned a list of around 30 classes. Scrolling through those, it was relatively easy to guess which objects might have methods or need to make method calls that would grab the categories.
