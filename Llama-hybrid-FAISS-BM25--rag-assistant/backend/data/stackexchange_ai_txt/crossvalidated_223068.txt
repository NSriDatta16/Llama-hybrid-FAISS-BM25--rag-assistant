How can I quantify unordered categorical data with infinite possible outcomes?

I'm trying to model a very simple supervised machine learning model. Let's say that it's a logistic classification problem. I must take into account some qualitative variables (categories) with a very, very large number of different possible outcomes, and I don't know how to express them. For instance, let's say they can be geographical locations (strictly speaking, they're not infinite, but close to), or different moments in a year with a precision of an hour (so there are 24*365 possible outcomes), or even the color of a pixel expressed with an RGB code (16 million outcomes). You get it. This is unordered data, so I can't say that that particular location is 1, that other one is 2, etc. Otherwise, my weights would treat the outcome with a higher label number as more important on the dependent variable than the other ones. The only way I know to model such a scenario is using binary variables: but that would mean to have an infinite number of possible inputs. Not only: it's very redundant, because if one of these variables is 1, all the other ones must be 0 (one-hot combinations). There must be a way to express quantitatively and unorderly a category variable with a close-to-infinite number of possible outcomes. I'm quite certain that I'm missing something very basilar; unfortunately, my academic background is somewhat fragmented...
