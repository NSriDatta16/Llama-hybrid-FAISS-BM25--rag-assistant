ROR: i18n best practices for large translation dictionaries

When internationalizing a rails app, what is the best practice way for organizing/scoping translations in the dictionary files? Under what circumstance should you use interpolations of variables? Should every phrase be it's entry? Is there anyone who participated in dhh's tolk who can shed some light on how 37signals broke up their dictionary files? After a month and a half of using the i18n gem our en.yml file is becoming gigantic. Is there any benefit to using scoping? We want the dictionary to be easier to translate and to keep our dictionary DRY but want to take into consideration different tenses and still take advantage of situations where we have "Are you sure you want to delete this object?" , "Are you sure you want to mark this as completed?" As "Are you sure you want to {{verb}} this {{noun}}?"
