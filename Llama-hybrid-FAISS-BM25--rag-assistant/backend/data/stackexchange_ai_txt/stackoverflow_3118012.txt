Calling a SQL Agent Job from another Job on a remote server?

Is there a way to trigger a job on a from another job on a remote server without using Linked Servers? The reasoning is that the job being triggered executes an SSIS package on 2008. The calling job resides on a 2005 server, so cannot execute the job directly. The servers are not linked, and I was hoping there was a way to call one from the other.
