Do I need to worry about memory leaks in Mac app development?

I am working on an application for the Mac App Store. Unlike iOS, Mac applications leverage Garbage Collection. My question is, do I need to worry about memory leaks in Mac app development or is it good practice to clean it yourself like you do in iOS?
