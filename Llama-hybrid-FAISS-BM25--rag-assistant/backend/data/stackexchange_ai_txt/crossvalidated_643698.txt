Conditional Probability of the null hypothesis given the rejection region

let $X \sim Bin(10,p)$ We would like to test the following hypotheses: $H_{0}: p=0.5 $ vs $H_{1} : p=0.3$ The Statistic $T(x)$ is defined as $T(x)=x$ and the critical (rejection) region is $R=\{x:T(x)\le4\}$ I want to calculate the conditional probability of the null hypothesis given $T(x)\in R $ That is : $P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R)$ My first solution is: $P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R)=\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta}$ My second solution (according to Bayesian hypothesis): $P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R) = P(H_{0})*L(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R)$ , which is equal to : $P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R) = P(H_{0})*P(T(x)\in R\mid H_{0})$ $P(T(x)\in R\mid H_{0})= P_{H_{0}}(X\le4)=0.37695=\alpha$ while $P(H_{0})$ equal to : $ P(H_{0})= P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\notin R) + P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R)=\frac{1-\alpha}{\beta} +\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta} $ Thus: $P(H_{0}\mid T(x)\in R)=(\frac{1-\alpha}{\beta} +\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta})*\alpha$ Which of the above solutions is correct ?
