Master Pages are designed to hold elements that are going to be static throughout your website, on multiple pages. You could use it to hold footers, headers, and so on. I don't think you should even consider having the same master page for multiple applications, that would limit what you can do with your master pages severely. In fact I encourage you to have multiple Master pages inside one application if you need it. There's nothing wrong with that. If you try to use the same Master Page across multiple applications, you'll have to do some very creative programming to maintain their flexibility, and you know what... Error that would be introduced in one application would percolate to all. So that's definitely a no-no idea. Hope that helps.
