not sure why i can't get addMouseListener(this()), addMouseMotionListener(this()) to work

So this is the panel for my RocketShip and I want to add my MouseListener and my MouseMotionListener to it but it is telling me that "this" is an invalid name. My textbook uses this sometimes and the professor also recommended that we use "this" in this instance so I am stuck about what the problem is. My code is below for example. Thanks for any advice you might offer. import java.applet.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import java.awt.event.MouseListener; import java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener; import java.util.Random; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JPanel; //I cannot understand how to draw my new rocketship or how to update the coordinates for mouse moved, mouse dragged, mouse pressed or mouse released //also not sure how to work with setShooting public class RocketShipPanel extends JPanel implements MouseListener,MouseMotionListener { private final int WIDTH = 300, HEIGHT = 300; RocketShip ship = new RocketShip(); public RocketShipPanel(){ //constructor addMouseListener (this()); addMouseMotionListener (this()); setBackground (Color.black); setPreferredSize (new Dimension(WIDTH, HEIGHT)); } public void paintComponent (Graphics page) { super.paintComponent(page); ship.draw(page, 50); } public void mousePressed (MouseEvent event) { ship.setShooting(true); repaint(); } public void mouseReleased (MouseEvent event) { ship.setShooting(false); repaint(); } public void mouseMoved (MouseEvent event) { Point point1 = event.getPoint(); int x = point1.x; int y = point1.y; ship.move(x, y); repaint(); } public void mouseDragged (MouseEvent event) { Point point1 = event.getPoint(); int x = point1.x; int y = point1.y; ship.move(x, y); //pointList.add(event.getPoint()); repaint(); } //-------------------------------------------------------------- // Provide empty definitions for unused event methods. //-------------------------------------------------------------- public void mouseEntered (MouseEvent event) {} public void mouseExited (MouseEvent event) {} public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent event) {} public static void main (String[] args) { JFrame frame = new JFrame ("RocketShip"); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation (JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.getContentPane().add (new RocketShipPanel()); frame.pack(); frame.setVisible(true); } }
