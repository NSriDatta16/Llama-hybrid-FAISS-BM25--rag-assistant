You're absolutely right - you should only return objects from properties where either the object is immutable, or you're happy for the caller to modify it to whatever extent they can. A classic example of this is returning collections - often it's much better to return a read-only wrapper round a collection than to return the "real" collection directly. On the other hand, pragmatism sometimes calls for just documenting this as "please don't change the returned object" - particularly when it's an API which is only used within a company. Hopefully there'll be more support for immutability in future versions of C# and .NET, which will make this easier to cope with - but it's likely to remain a knotty problem in many cases.
