Bayesian techniques may help answer this. Suppose you start with a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as the prior distribution for $P$. After $1000$ flips and $K$ successes, the posterior distribution will again be a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha + K$ and $\beta +1000-K$. If $K$ is positive then you can stop there; if it is zero, you can repeat, but using the new parameters for the prior for the next set of $1000$ flips. Eventually you will stop (with probability $1$), and then the posterior distribution will have parameters $\alpha + K$ and $\beta +N-K$. This does not just give you a central estimate for $P$ with the expected value being $\dfrac{\alpha + K}{\alpha + \beta + N}$, but also a way of looking at the uncertainty in this estimate of $P$. Note that if originally you started with the improper parameters $\alpha=\beta=0$ then the central estimate will be $\frac{K}{N}$. There are also arguments for starting with $\alpha=\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ or $\alpha=\beta=1$, but these differences in initial assumptions usually only affect the final distribution slightly when you have large samples.
