Most data structures books are going to be rooted in some programming language. I would suggest finding one that uses Java and go from there. That being said, DS and algorithms are great, but those alone won't make you a 'really good Java programmer'. Here's a link to a Google Shopping search for Java data structures books. I'll date myself by saying that I've never read any of them, and the DS book I read in college was written for C. You should also have a look at the Pragmatic Bookshelf (Google it, I can't paste multiple links with my low rep) as well, they have books about the craft of programming, rather than just languages. Very handy indeed.
