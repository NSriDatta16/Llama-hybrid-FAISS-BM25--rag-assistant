Using an IV as a DV

I am doing my thesis, and in my study design (a simulated negotiation) participants could choose from different messages (i.e., their negotiation strategy). The strategy variable is categorical (FR or IR) and therefore can be coded as binary (1,0) as it was for logistic regression exploring it as the outcome variable. Strategy was therefore a DV, as we were exploring how two different conditions impacted the way that participants chose their strategies. HOWEVER. My other DV was the subjective assessments of the negotiation which were made at the END of the experiment. I am now wondering, how can I validly explore whether the negotiation strategy had a positive or negative relationship to the subjective assessments? I am aware that using an single variable as both IV and DV is not ideal, but it seems incomplete to not look at this relationship. Is there a way to do this? Perhaps the study design allows it? If so, does anybody have a reference I can look at? Thank you.
