The method getRealPath() doesn't work under war , and would return null , AFAIR. You must use relative path in order to make it work. Request.getResourceAsStream() is a better option. The use of getRealPath() is very much discouraged for the very reason. [Edited] Found a thread of coderanch confirming my doubt.
