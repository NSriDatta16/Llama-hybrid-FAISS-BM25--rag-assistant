You answered your own question: Do the index on all four columns. And measure the size difference. Considering the storage capacity of the iPhone, you're probably out of balance trying to reduce storage. The rule of thumb with SQLite performance is not to doa query that isn't indexed. You can see what SQLite is actually doing by creating your database on the Mac using the same schema and EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN. (There's also EXPLAIN, which is more detailed but less obvious.)
