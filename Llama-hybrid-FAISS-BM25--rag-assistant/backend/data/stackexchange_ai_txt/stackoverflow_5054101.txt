That is an interesting paper that Oded has linked to - if you are using Sql Server 2008 with its FileStream feature the conclusion is similar. I have quoted a couple of salient points from the linked FileStream whitepaper: "FILESTREAM storage is not appropriate in all cases. Based on prior research and FILESTREAM feature behavior, BLOB data of size 1 MB and larger that will not be accessed through Transact-SQL is best suited to storing as FILESTREAM data." "Consideration must also be given to the update workload, as any partial update to a FILESTREAM file will generate a complete copy of the file. With a particularly heavy update workload, the performance may be such that FILESTREAM is not appropriate"
