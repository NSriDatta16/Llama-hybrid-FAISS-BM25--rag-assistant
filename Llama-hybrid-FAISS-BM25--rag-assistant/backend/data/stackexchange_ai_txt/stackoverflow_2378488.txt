all variable inside a process (application) are shared across threads, any modification to a variable or memory will have effect to all threads that have access to it, unless you are using thread local storage (TLS). If you delete an array, then another thread using it, the result will be like when you delete an array then you re-access it somewhere in your code (mostly crash due to access violation). as for "which level" question, i think it is better to deallocate an object by the thread which create the object to avoid confusion, and be sure that those objects are no longer needed by another thread.
