Magento: get order id to use in outside application

I want to set up an affiliate program for an online store that uses Magento for e-commerce. How could I save the order id of a sale to be used to update my affiliate table? Please do not recommend 'Affiliates for all'. It is about as inflexible as Magento, and the reason that I am going with a custom made solution. Any help is appreciated.
