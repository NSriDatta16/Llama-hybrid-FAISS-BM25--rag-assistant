meta-analysis: expected Q and observed Q

I understand the equation for observed $Q$ : $$ \Large Q = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{V_i} (Y_i - M)^2 $$ But I don't understand why the expected $Q$ is just the degrees of freedom ( $k - 1$ ), where $k$ is the number of studies. The reason I kept seeing is that because $Q$ is a standardized metric or because we divide each deviation by the variance for its study, the expected $Q$ for our group of studies is the degrees of freedom, $k-1$ . Can someone explain or provide a proof for the expected $Q$ ? Update: Thanks for the responses! Yi is each effect size, M is the summary effect size (the meta-analytic average effect size; mean effect size weighted by the inverse of variance), Vi is the variance of each effect size, k is the total number of studies, Q is the observed Q-statistics
