left-censored dependent variables and prediction

I'm coding up a monte-carlo analysis; I've got a deterministic model that depends on parameters that are uncertain. One of those uncertain parameters is a partially-observed vector of prices by country -- I want to predict missing values in a manner similar to what is used in multiple imputation via chained equations. I've got a few candidates for modeling those missing values: A linear model with censored predictions -- I simply censor negative predictions at zero. Average predictions will probably be biased upwards because of the left-censoring. A linear model fit to a log-transformed price. Average predictions will be biased upwards because of the unnaturally fat right tail, and the probability of responses at the right tail will be unnaturally fat. A glm with gaussian errors and a logarithmic link. I don't really have the intuition for this, but examining a few predictions gives me results that are even crazier than for #2. A tobit model. This is the best choice, but how does one even think of a prediction interval in that case? How does one code it? Edit: when I say "prediction" I'm talking about a random draw from the fitted model's predictive distribution.
