One thing to check is whether there is a linear relationship between the log odds of cancer and each of your 5 predictor variables. This is an assumption in logistic regression. If this does not hold you might want to consider adding higher order terms to the model, or even a nonlinear relationship between log odds of cancer and some of the variables (by fitting a generalized additive model). From your output, it looks like these 5 predictors do not do a good job of classifying cancer vs non-cancer. I'll take a look at the data and add more to this question later. After taking a look at the data I have confirmed that indeed these variables are terrible at predicting cancer. If you plot the variables against cancer status you will see that, although for some of them the non-cancer patients have a little less variability, there is very little difference between the cancer and non-cancer patients. For example: So if you told me that you had a patient who had a C variable of 30...I would have no idea if that is a cancer patient or a non-cancer patient. A bit more about your output: When you don't add any variables in it says you correctly predict 91.8% of the patients. The next table that lists significance values for adding in more variables means if you add them in one at a time.
