If you use a regression model you may start with ordinal logistic regression since your dependent variable has an ordinal scale of 11 levels. Then you may want to look at the threshold values as you may find that they are equidistant (after some transformation), in which case you may go for linear regression. Tree based methods are able to capture some non-linearities, interactions and they are very good at finding thresholds in the explanatory variables. You may be able to explain some of these by adding transformed versions of the explanatory variables to the feature set of the regression analysis. Playing with ACE or AVAS may help finding suitable transformations. As it is important for you to discuss the influential features I recommend you to do extensive exploration with trees, regression models and graphs to understand the biology behind the data and models. I would start with your last question, understand the biology first, and then formulate a conformable model.
