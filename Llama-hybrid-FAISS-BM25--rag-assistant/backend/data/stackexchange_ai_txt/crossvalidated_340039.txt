When is multicollinearity a good thing or acceptable?

I was looking through a few scenarios where it might be okay to use variables that have high VIF here . But most of such discussions and remedies I have seen use it in the context of linear regression models. So the question that I have is- Is multicollinearity a bad thing for all models. More specifically, do I need to check for multicollinearity when building the following models Random Forest Decision Trees Boosting methods (GBTrees and XGBoost) SVM Also, a second part I'd like to add is that- does it make a difference if I'm performing classification instead of regression. Do I need to interpret multicollinearity differently in these two cases?
