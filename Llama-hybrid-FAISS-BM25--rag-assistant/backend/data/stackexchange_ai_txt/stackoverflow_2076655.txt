From the documentation ... $(selector).load(..) Load HTML from a remote file and inject it into the DOM. $.ajax(...) Load a remote page using an HTTP request. This is jQuery's low-level AJAX implementation. load is specifically for fetching (via GET unless parameters are provided, then POST is used) an HTML page and directly inserting it into the selected nodes (those selected by the $(selector) portion of $(selector).load(...) . $.ajax(...) is a more general method that allows you to make GET and POST requests, and does nothing specific with the response. I encourage you to read the documentation.
