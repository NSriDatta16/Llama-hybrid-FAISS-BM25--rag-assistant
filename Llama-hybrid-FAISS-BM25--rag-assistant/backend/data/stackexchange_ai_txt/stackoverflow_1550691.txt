Embedding a predefined SQLITE doc in Core Data Application

Thanks for the help. I have a woking Core Data doc based app. that solely supports SQLITE docs. I would like to distribute the application with a previously created database document with predefined data embedded in the application bundle. How do I instruct the application to run the embedded file at runtime? thanks. -paul.
