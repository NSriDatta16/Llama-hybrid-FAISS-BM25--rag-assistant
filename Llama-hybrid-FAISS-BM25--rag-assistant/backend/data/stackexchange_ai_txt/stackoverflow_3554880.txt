Editable timetable using Drupal

I'd like to manage a timetable using Drupal 6, there are several pieces of equipment on which an administrator distributes people who get to use the equipment. Essentially I want a table of equipment versus day of the week. The plan shows the occupation of all equipment for the whole week. What makes it more complicated is that the editing of the timetable should be very easy and quick. Usually people have the equipment for multiple days, so one should be able e.g. to drag an entry and fill out more days this way. I'd also like to have a selection of people visible that one could drag onto the timetable and fill it out that way. I assume one can do that with javascript, but I have no experience with that. Is it possible to create something like that with the Drupal Forms API? Any pointers/examples for the dragging javascript? Or is there some existing software or Drupal module that can do that?
