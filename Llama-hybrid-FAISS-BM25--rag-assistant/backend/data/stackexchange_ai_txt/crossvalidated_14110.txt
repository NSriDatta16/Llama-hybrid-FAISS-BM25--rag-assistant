R package for smooth transition regression models

Is there a R package that I can use to specify Smooth Transition Models. I'm looking specifically for something that allows me to specify a TAR model for a given time series. In 2008, a package, RSTAR , was presented in the R User Conference by Mehmet Balcilar. However, the packages doesn't seems to be published and I was wondering if there is any other alternatives in R.
