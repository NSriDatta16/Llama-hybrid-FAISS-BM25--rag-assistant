File size always remains same as 12288 bytes for small files

I am using Wp7IsolatedStorageExplorer to get some small files (say max 20 bytes ) stored in IsolatedStorage.But every time I download file the Filesize remains 12288 bytes (for small files) .Is IsolatedStorageExplorer appending something at last OR Is it How small Files are stored in IsolatedStorage by default ? Thanks vaysage.
