RRDTool by Tobi Oetiker, definitely! It's open-source, it's been designed for exactly such use cases. EDIT: To provide a few highlights: RRDTool stores time-series data in a round-robin data base. It keeps raw data for a given period of time, then condenses it in a configurable way so you have fine-grained data say for a month, averaged data over a week for the last 6 months, and averaged data over a month for the last 2 years. As a side effect you data base remains the same size all of the time (so no sweating you disk may run full). This was the storage side. On the retrieval side RRDTool offers data queries that are immediately turned into graphs (e.g. png) that you can readily include in documents and web pages. It's a rock solid, proven solution that is a much generalized form over its predecessor, MRTG (some might have heard of this). And once you got into it, you will find yourself re-using it over and over again. For a quick overview and who uses RRDTool, see also here . If you want to see which kinds of graphics you can produce, make sure you have a look at the gallery .
