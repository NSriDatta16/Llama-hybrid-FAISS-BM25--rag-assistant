Compare Leave-One-Out cross-validated performance of classifier across two datasets

I am trying to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the performance of a SVM classifier on two different datasets. The performance of the classifier is determined through Leave-One-Out cross-validation. Each dataset has 480 samples, and is binary categorical: correct prediction or incorrect prediction. It is my understanding that it isn't possible to use a chi-squared test as the separate outcomes from cross-validation tests are not independent within the dataset itself - the same sample is used 479 times. If anybody could suggest to me where to look or how to go about this, I would really appreciate it!
