You can do the first one by writing it as a mixture of half-normal and a degenerate distribution at 0, and using the law of total expectation . The expectation of the half-normal is straightforward. The second can be done by symmetry. The final product is trivial (when $z^+>0$, what's $z^-$? from there it should be clear). Note that the other two products must have the same variance as each other. Then use whuber's suggestion* of writing $z=z^++z^-$ and take the expectation of the square. * not the only way to do it, but simple and elegant
