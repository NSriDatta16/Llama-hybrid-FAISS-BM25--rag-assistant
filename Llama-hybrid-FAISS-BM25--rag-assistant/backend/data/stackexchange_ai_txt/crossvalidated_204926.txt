Are there analytically derivable posteriors that save from doing MCMC other than conjugate priors?

Posteriors for conjugate priors can be analytically derived and save us from doing MCMC. Conjugate priors simply have a posterior in the same family as the prior distribution. Are there other analytically derivable posteriors that save us from doing MCMC?
