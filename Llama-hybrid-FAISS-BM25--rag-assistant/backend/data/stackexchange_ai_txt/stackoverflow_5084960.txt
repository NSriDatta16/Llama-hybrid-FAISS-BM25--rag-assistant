Don't use string-generation for SQL. If placeholders are used there will no problem (with storage) and no magic escaping is required . Just store it as VARCHAR type. Done and done. Sanitization for output ( and during input) should likewise be done using the appropriate libraries -- there are two different operations ; however, this is a separate issue than storage. Edit See PDO as one prepared-statement (read: placeholder) implementation. Others may exist (I do not use PHP, but feel obligated to correct the perpetuation of design mistakes relating to manually built string-based SQL queries.) The parameters to prepared statements don't need to be quoted; the driver automatically handles this. If an application exclusively uses prepared statements, the developer can be sure that no SQL injection will occur (however, if other portions of the query are being built up with unescaped input, SQL injection is still possible). Sounds too-good-to-be-true. Now quit using string-generated statements . Please. Happy coding.
