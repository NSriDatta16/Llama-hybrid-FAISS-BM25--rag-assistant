In what settings would confidence intervals not get better as sample size increases?

In a blog post , I have found the claim that "I believe WG Cochrane the first point out (roughly 1970â€²s) that with confidence intervals in an observational setting, small sample sizes result in better coverage with large enough samples providing near zero coverage!" Now I assume that the CI width should approach 0 with increasing sample size, but the idea that coverage would concurrently worsen is not convincing to me. Is this claim true, and under which circumstances? Or am I misreading it? I've run a simulation using random normally distributed data with sample sizes from 10000 to 1000000 (one-sample t-test, 95% CI), 1000 runs at every sample size, and coverage did not get any worse for the higher sample sizes (instead, I found the expected near-constant ~5% error rate).
