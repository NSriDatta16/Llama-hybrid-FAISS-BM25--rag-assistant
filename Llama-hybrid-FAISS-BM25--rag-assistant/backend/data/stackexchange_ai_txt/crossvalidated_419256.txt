The answer here depends on how you best simulate the population you will be generalizing towards post-deployment of your model. If the population is balanced, then balance your test/validation folds. If you anticipate the population balance to be random, then randomly sample. If you expect it to be consistently imbalanced, then enforce an imbalance. Short story: Your k-folds enable your validation, and the meaning behind your validation is tied to how well it represents the population, as that is what will dictate actual performance. Caveat: If you expect significant heteroscedasticity of the balance over some dimension or metric, then sample across that metric or dimension accordingly, so that you get a realistic estimate of the population of balances you might see in the future. Example: Time series forecasting is usually validated with folds taken over continuous periods of time to simulate seasonality, or time-correlated heteroscedasticity.
