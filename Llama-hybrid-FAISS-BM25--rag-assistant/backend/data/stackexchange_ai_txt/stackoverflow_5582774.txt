I agree with the other users answers, in particular, the @thephpdeveloper user focused the attention on an important detail: the Front Controller Patter . Generally, when you use a framework like Zend Framework, all requests are received by an index.php files wich is responsible to initialize the environment and analize the url requested (extract the module, controller, action, and so on). In such case the index.php file can be viewed as a web application start point.
