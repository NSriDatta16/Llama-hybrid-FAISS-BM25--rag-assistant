Suggestion: Use Hypermedia. Benefit: Your choice of URIs doesn't matter as much. If providing sources in a visible fashion to your end-user, in the course of their normal use of your web application: Click here for CSS source code. Click here for JavaScript source code. If providing sources to developer users, outside course of their normal use of the web application, it might make sense to reference them in a non-visible section of the source: These links will only be available to developers who view the source of the HTML, or folks who have really tricked-out user-agents. Along the same lines, you could put the non-minified CSS (but not JS) source as an alternate stylesheet. Note: rel="sourcecode" isn't a standard (I just made it up), but I'm pretty sure it doesn't violate spec; and along with the title it helps to communicate the purpose of the link.
