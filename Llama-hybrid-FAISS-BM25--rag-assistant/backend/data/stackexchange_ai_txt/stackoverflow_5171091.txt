Sqlite convert text to decimal?

I have an Sqlitedb, with a column: amount text not null In column amount, I store dollar values in this format: $1.01, $40.58, etc. I'm trying to sum up the dollar values using SELECT SUM(amount) FROM record WHERE date LIKE '"+date+"'" However, it doesn't work, presumably because you can't add text. I know this isn't the ideal storage but how would I go about parsing the amounts so that I can add them up?
