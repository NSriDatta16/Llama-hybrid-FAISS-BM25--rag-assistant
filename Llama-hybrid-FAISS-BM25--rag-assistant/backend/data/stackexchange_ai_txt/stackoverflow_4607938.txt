get all recent job failures in Autosys

What's a command to list all recent failures in Autosys? I was thinking of autorep -d -J ALL followed by some kind of grep , but the autorep report comes in paragraphs, with the job name and the status in separate lines, so I need to write a custom filter in Perl unless I'm overlooking some quick and simple option.
