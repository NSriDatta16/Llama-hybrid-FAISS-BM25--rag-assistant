How can I make a .NET class library read its own configuration file?

I have a .NET class library that provides a set of helper functions that are used by several Web Services. This class library must store a single setting, specifically, a connection string, which need not be seen by the Web Services themselves, since they all must query the same datbase. Unfortunately, .NET provides no means to easily read a DLL's app.config file. The only "easy" solution would be to store the connection string in every single Web Service configuration file, which is completely bollocks. Normally, I care about code elegance, but this time I really need a solution, even if it is a hack. Is there any way to make a .NET class library have its own configuration? EDIT: Technically, I could merge all those Web Services into a single Web Service. But, for business reasons (each Web Service will be sold separately), I cannot do that.
