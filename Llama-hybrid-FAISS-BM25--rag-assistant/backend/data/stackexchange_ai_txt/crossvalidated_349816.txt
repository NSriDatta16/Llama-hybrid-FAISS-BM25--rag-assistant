When to calculate sample size?

Should I calculate sample size before collecting data? Or I should calculate sample size after collecting some data (probably can collect more if needed)? It is because I would like to do logistic regression, but I am not quite sure the statistics about the prevalence etc. What should I do? It would be great if you could also share the equation/ formula for calculating sample size for multiple logistic regression. Thanks!
