There is no way to put all the movies in one .fla without all the media from each movie appearing in the main .fla's library. One way to keep it organized is to drag the folder structure of each sub-movie's library into the main movie BEFORE you copy the frames over. If you copy and paste the frames first, everything will be put on the top level of the library which is a mess. One thing to note is that all the media must have distinct names. If this is a problem, there is a command you can install into Flash CS that adds a prefix or suffix to the names of each item in the sub-movies to avoid conflicts.
