Bing map AJAX vs Bing map control

Im just trying to ascertain the pros and cons of using Bing maps http://www.microsoft.com/maps/isdk/ajax/ and using Javascript to interact with the API by embedding the map into a web page, or actually creating an account and using the control http://www.microsoft.com/maps/developers/web.aspx Do both ways give you all options or are there limitations to either option. Thanks
