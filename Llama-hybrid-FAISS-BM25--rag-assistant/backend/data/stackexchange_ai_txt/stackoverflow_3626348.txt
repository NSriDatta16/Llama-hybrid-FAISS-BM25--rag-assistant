Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated 13369344) (tried to allocate 1572864 bytes) in [clientroot]\htdocs\product\lib\Zend\Date.php on line 2379 Can't allocate 1.5MB? The person running our client's "dedicated server" is shafting them. Time to bring out the beasts... For anyone with unknown problems in magento, add this in index.php below the error reporting settings: error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', 1);
