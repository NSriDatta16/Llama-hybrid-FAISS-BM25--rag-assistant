The Extending and Embedding PHP book written by Sara Golemon is an interesting read, when it comes to the internals of PHP and its extensions system. It's not really speaky about PHP's internals per se, but, as extensions are close to those internals, the informations given in that book are close internals. (Humph, even I had to re-read my sentence to understand it...)
