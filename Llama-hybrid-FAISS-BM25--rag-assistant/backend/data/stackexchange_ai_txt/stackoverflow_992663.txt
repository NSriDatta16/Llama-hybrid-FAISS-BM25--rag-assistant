Embedding .net remoting program in WEB

So, here is a deal. I have client-server application(dotNet remoting). Client side has few trackbars, checkboxes, buttons and picturebox. Server is a console application and does only calculation from client. Client's picturebox make some visualisation of calculation in picturebox. All calulations and relative classes are in dll file. Now I have to embed client application in web site. All kind of technologies are accepted, but I want to minimize forces applied to embedding. So, what is the best way to do embedding?
