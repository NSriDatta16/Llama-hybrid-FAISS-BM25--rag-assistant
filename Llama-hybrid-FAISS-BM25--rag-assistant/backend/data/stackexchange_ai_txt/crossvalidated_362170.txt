A time series is evenly spaced. You should transform your data set into something evenly spaced. This may require going up to a higher level of aggregation (will that render the result irrelevant?) or imputing the missing values (and there are several different ways you could do so). What do you expect the forecast to look like? Is there a cycle or seasonality in the data? A flat line is not necessarily a bad thing. If there's no slope, and no cycle, a flat line is what you will get. If you can go up to a higher level of aggregation this will help to smooth out some of the volatility and may help uncover a cycle that is obscured at the lower level by all of the noise. Exploring this, and getting a grasp on the decomposition of the time series, are my suggestions of where you start.
