The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is that the conditional distribution of its present value conditional on past values depends only on the previous value . So every Markov chain is "without memory" to the extent that only the previous value affects the present conditional probability, and all previous states are "forgotten". (You are right that it is not completely without memory - after all, the conditional distribution of the present value depends on the previous value.) That is true for MCMC and also for any other Markov chain.
