You can use a clustering algorithm such as k-means to divide the generators into groups. You never know what kind of groups you'll get until you try it. Try and assess the character of each group of generators as you increase the number of clusters. At some point you should find a meaningful division of generators. The inputs to your k-means algorithm will be the criteria you mentioned in your post: the number of times it was activated, the number of activation problems, and so forth. When you are finished, the group a generator belongs to is its ranking. This method will not generate a ranking of 1-1000 if you have 1000 generators. Rather it will give you, for example with k=3: a group of 243 outstanding generators, 320 average generators, and 446 terrible generators.
