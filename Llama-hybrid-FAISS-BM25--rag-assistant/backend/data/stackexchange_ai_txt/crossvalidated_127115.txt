Determine distribution of test statistic

I have a set of normally distributed parameters, $\hat{b}_{i}$, with different but known variances $\sigma_{i}^2$, that is $\hat{b}_{i}\sim N(b_{i},\sigma_i^2)$ where the $\hat{}$ indicates a measured value and the paramter without the $\hat{}$ the true value. I want to test if the $b_i$'s, $i=1,\dots,k$ are equal. To do this I think I should use a test statistic like $z=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{b_i-\bar{b}}{\sigma_i^2}$, where $\bar{b}$ is a weighed avarage, $\bar{b}=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{b_i\cdot 1/\sigma_i^2}{1/\sigma_i^2}$. I know that if the variances are equal the test statistic $z$ is $\chi^2$ distributed with $k-1$ degrees of freedom. My problem is that the variances are not equal, so how do I determine the distribution $z$ is taken from? My guess is that there should be some $k$-dependent factor times the $\chi^2$ distribution, but I don't know how to find it. I hope someone can help.
