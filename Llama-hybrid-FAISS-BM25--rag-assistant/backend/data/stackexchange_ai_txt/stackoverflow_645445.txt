I find myself using Google Chrome most recently and you can drag tabs between instances. It's mighty handy. I'd guess that there may be a Firefox extension that will add this handy feature. You're not going to get very far with IE on this front, I don't think. If you find an extension for Firefox that will handle this for you and still need to use IE, you can also get the IETab extension so you can use IE within Firefox.
