Distributed mutexes are tricky structures. You need to handle all sort of weird conditions that do not exist with a single machine based implementation. In particular you need to handle situations where agents lose comms with the group and still hold a lock on a shared resource. Additional to that scenario there are complex scenarios where your group is fractured and you grab a lock on a resource. When the fractured groups join into a big group you need some way to reconcile the locks which is far from trivial. I would strongly recommend looking into some messaging based middleware such as Erlang and JBoss I would also recommend posting separate questions on the particular distributed algorithms / data structures you need implemented. It's possible that you could get away with an out-of-the-box implementation in a middleware library that could be adjusted to meet your needs.
