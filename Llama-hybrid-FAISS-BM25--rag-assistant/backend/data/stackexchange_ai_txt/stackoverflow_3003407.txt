USB mass storage devices do not perform Autorun on Windows. You need to enumerate as a USB CD-ROM device in order to support autorun. If you have a U3 capable USB drive, you can often replace the U3 data with your own CD image. If this is a custom USB device, you will need to implement a composite device with the Mass Storage and USB CD-ROM device (or just the CD-ROM if you don't want to supporting writing).
