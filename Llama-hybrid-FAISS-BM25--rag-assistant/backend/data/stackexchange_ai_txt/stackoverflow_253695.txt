Workaround for UpdateSourceTrigger LostFocus on Silverlight Datagrid?

I have a Silverlight 2 application that validates data OnTabSelectionChanged. Immediately I began wishing that UpdateSourceTrigger allowed more than just LostFocus because if you click the tab without tabbing off of a control the LINQ object is not updated before validation. I worked around the issue for TextBoxes by setting focus to another control and then back OnTextChanged: Private Sub OnTextChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As TextChangedEventArgs) txtSetFocus.Focus() sender.Focus() End Sub Now I am trying to accomplish the same sort of hack within a DataGrid. My DataGrid uses DataTemplates generated at runtime for the CellTemplate and CellEditingTemplate. I tried writing the TextChanged="OnTextChanged" into the TextBox in the DataTemplate, but it is not triggered. Anyone have any ideas?
