You should firstly get the client to clarify these requirements, and make sure they actually research the subject as they may not currently have any idea about it and will just add the requirements further down the line when someone points it out (trust me, I've worked within a Scottish government organisation!) Back when I worked in government (2004 - 2006), it was the e-Gov guidelines that were important and there was one on accessibility. I can't remember if these were publicly accessible or only available on an intranet, but I did find this page with what looks like the same documents: Web Guidelines . Again, you should clarify with the client what is the correct document to adhere to. They may also have their own accessibility standards, depending on what organisation they are (not that you can say of course, but I doubt one of the smaller councils is likely to have this). The documents can be quite bland and hard to read, and often result in ugly websites because people believe simplicity is the only way to achieve accessibility. Of course this isn't true, so it's up to you to interpret the guidelines and provide justification for breaking them were necessary. On the subject of tools, I assume you mean some kind of automated testing? If so, the answer is yes they exist, but please don't rely on them as your sole testing method! No amount of automated testing can ever tell you how truly accessible a website is, only real-world testing can do that. One place where a tool can come in handy however is checking colour contrast, there are several that will render your page using algorithms that emulate various forms of colour blindness.
