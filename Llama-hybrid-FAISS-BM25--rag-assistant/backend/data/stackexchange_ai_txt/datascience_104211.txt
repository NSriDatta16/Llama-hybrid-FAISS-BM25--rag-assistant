How to fill missing consumption data on time series?

I have a dataset that contains consumptions. These consumptions are measured every month. But some months are not measured. So the measured month after the unmeasured month is actually worth the sum of the two months (or more). My dataset; difference date 2019-01-01 50.0 2019-02-01 60.0 2019-03-01 NaN 2019-04-01 140.0 2019-05-01 90.0 So we can understand that the 4th month's value is actually a sum of the 3rd and 4th months. It is necessary to organize this data with this logic. Because 140 is not a correct value for the 4th month and the 3rd month's consumption is not zero. difference date 2019-01-01 50.0 2019-02-01 60.0 2019-03-01 70.0 2019-04-01 70.0 2019-05-01 90.0 This (mean) can be one of an approach to avoid this problem on the dataset. After that, I can use this data set to predict next month's consumption. I want to know if this approach has a name. What solutions can I implement on this type of time-series datasets? How can I search this problem?
