Can MySQL Cluster handle a terabyte database

I have to look into solutions for providing a MySQL database that can handle data volumes in the terabyte range and be highly available (five nines). Each database row is likely to have a timestamp and up to 30 float values. The expected workload is up to 2500 inserts/sec. Queries are likely to be less frequent but could be large (maybe involving 100Gb of data) though probably only involving single tables. I have been looking at MySQL Cluster given that is their HA offering. Due to the volume of data I would need to make use of disk based storage. Realistically I think only the timestamps could be held in memory and all other data would need to be stored on disk. Does anyone have experience of using MySQL Cluster on a database of this scale? Is it even viable? How does disk based storage affect performance? I am also open to other suggestions for how to achieve the desired availability for this volume of data. For example, would it be better to use a third party libary like Sequoia to handle the clustering of standard MySQL instances? Or a more straight forward solution based on MySQL replication? The only condition is that it must be a MySQL based solution. I don't think that MySQL is the best way to go for the data we are dealing with but it is a hard requirement.
