Solution for $J_1$ But what is J1? What is the expected number of steps for a frog that has only one leaf to go? The solution is $J_1 = 2(e-1)$ and other terms $J_n$ can be expressed as a sum. Rewriting the recurrence relation as a sum The recurrence relation is not gonna solve the problem entirely (because one term in the initial conditions is not known), but it does allow us to express $J_n$ as an expression in terms of a finite sum. The recurrence relation can be rewritten. (for n>3) $$J_n - J_{n-1} = n (J_{n-1} - J_{n-2})-1 $$ let $D_n = J_n - J_{n-1}$ $$D_n = n D_{n-1}-1 $$ and with starting point $D_2 = 2x $ and we can write (note the recurrence relation is a bit different for $n = 2$ as @quester noted in the comments): $$\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcr} D_1 &=& 3 + 2\,x \\\\ D_2 &=& 2\,x\\ D_3 &=& \overbrace{6 \,x}^{\times 3} &-&1\\ D_4 &=& \rlap{\overbrace{\hphantom{\begin{array}5040\,x&-&7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \end{array}}}^{\times 4}} 24\,x&-&4 &-& 1 \\ D_5&=& \rlap{\overbrace{\hphantom{\begin{array}5040\,x&-&7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 &-& 7\cdot 6\cdot 5 \end{array}}}^{ \times 5}} 120\,x&-&5\cdot 4 &-& 5 &-& 1 \\\\ D_6&=& 720\,x&-&6\cdot 5\cdot 4 &-& 6\cdot 5 &-& 6 &- & 1 \\\\ D_7&=& 5040\,x&-&7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 &-& 7\cdot 6\cdot 5 &-& 7\cdot 6 &- & 7 &-&- 1 \\\\ D_k &=& k! x &-&\rlap{\sum_{l=3}^{k} \frac{k!}{l!}} \\ \end{array}$$ and $$ J_n = x \sum_{k=1}^n k! -\sum_{k=3}^n\sum_{l=3}^{k} \frac{k!}{l!} $$ Closed form expression for $x$ Lets rewrite $D_k$ $$\begin{array}{} D_k &=& k! x - \sum_{l=3}^{k} \frac{k!}{l!}\\ &=& k! \left(x - \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{1!}{l!} - 2.5 \right)\end{array}$$ If we conjecture that $\lim_{k \to \infty }D_k$ is positive and finite then this leads to the requirement $\lim_{k \to \infty }\left(x - \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{1!}{l!} - 2.5 \right)= 0$ and $$x = \lim_{k \to \infty } \left(\sum_{l=0}^k \frac{1!}{l!} - 2.5\right) = e-2.5 \approx 0.2182818 $$ The argument that $\lim_{k \to \infty }D_k$ is finite is still a conjecture but it seems plausible to me. Closed form expression for $D_k$ Filling in $x$ into the expression of $D_k$ will lead to: $$\begin{array}{} J_1 &=& D_1 & = & 2e-2 \\ &&D_2 & = & 2e-5 \\ &&D_k & = & k! \left( e - \sum_{l=0}^k \frac{1}{l!}\right) \\ \end{array}$$ Is $J_n$ finite? We can argue that $J_n$ (the mean number of steps to reach the finish) is finite for any starting point $n$ , because the mean position from the finish is decreasing to zero bounded by an exponential decay. The mean distance from the finish: Say a frog starts in position $x$ . Then after one jump the frog will be somewhere in position $0 \leq y \leq x+1$ (each option with probability $\frac{1}{x+2}$ ), and if $y \neq 0$ then after after two jumps the frog will be somewhere in position $0 \leq z \leq y+1$ (each option with probability $\frac{1}{y+2}$ ). Then the mean position $\bar{z}$ of a frog that started at $x$ and makes two jumps will be: $$ \sum_{y=1}^{x+1}\sum_{z=1}^{y+1}\frac{z}{(x+2)(y+2)} = \frac{x^2+5x+4}{4x+8} \underbrace{\leq\frac{10}{12}x}_{\text{if $x\geq1$}}$$ So whatever the position of the frog, after two jumps, he will be on average at least 1/6 closer to the finish. Probability a frog is still in the game: Note that the probability of a frog still in the game relates to the mean distance of a frog in the game. The mean distance after $k$ jumps is $\mu_{\bar{x},k} \sum_{x=1}^\infty x f(x,k)$ , where $f(x,k)$ is the probability of the frog to be in position $x$ after $k$ jumps. The probability of a frog to be still in the game is: $$ 1-F_{(\text{finished at or before jump k})}(k)=\sum_{x=1}^\infty f(x,k) . Finiteness of $J_n$ The mean number of steps necessary can be found by $\sum_{k=0}^\infty k f(k)$ with $f(k)$ the probability that it takes $k$ steps. But you can also take $\sum_{k=0}^\infty 1-F(x)$ with $F(k)$ the probability that it takes $k$ or less steps (note that the integral of the CDF is related to the mean or more generaly the expected value of any quantity is related to the quantile function ). And since $1âˆ’F(k)$ is smaller than some decreasing exponential function of $k$ , so must be the sum smaller than the integral/sum of that function and that is finite. Starting with a simpler problem With the recurrence relation $D_n = n D_{n-1} - 1$ it is problematic to solve the case because the starting condition is not defined. We can instead try to pose a simpler problem (suggested in the comments by @quester and @Hans). Let's say that there are only $m+2$ leaves (instead of infinite), and thus the frog with only $m$ leaves in front of him will not be able to jump backwards. Then $J_m = J_{m-1}$ (the frog in point $m$ has the same options as the frog in point $m-1$ ) and we will have $$D_{m} = m! \left(x_m - \sum_{l=0}^m \frac{1!}{l!} - 2.5 \right) = 0$$ which gives a solution for $x_{m}$ as: $$x_m = \sum_{l=0}^m \frac{1!}{l!} - 2.5 $$ and the limit of $x_m$ as we start adding leaves is: $$\lim_{m\to \infty} x_m = \lim_{m\to \infty} \sum_{l=0}^m \frac{1!}{l!} -2.5 = e-2.5$$
