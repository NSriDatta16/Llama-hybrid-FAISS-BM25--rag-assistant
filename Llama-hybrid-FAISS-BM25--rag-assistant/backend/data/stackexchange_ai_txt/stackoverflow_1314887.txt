How to fork a git project given only the .git directory?

So there is the guy on the internet who wrote a ton of code and stored it all on github. One day, said guy just up and disappears deleting all of his repositories. Thankfully, there were many forks of his main projects but still there were many smaller repos that were not forked. However, I managed to use the Github API to periodically pull down said guy's repos and therefore have a copy of all of the aforementioned "small projects". However, there is one problem: what I have are the contents of the individual repo's .git directories. I am unclear how to leverage these .git dirs in order to effectively fork them, thus creating fairly complete mirrors of their corresponding repos. Any guidance? -m
