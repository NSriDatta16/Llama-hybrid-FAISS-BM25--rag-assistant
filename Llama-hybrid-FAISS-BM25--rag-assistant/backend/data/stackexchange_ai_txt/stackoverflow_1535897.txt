What's your solution for free-text search and sort?

AFAIK,MySQL performs really bad at this, what's your solution? BTW,what's the solution of SO? EDIT Please pay attention that free-text search itself is pretty fast in MySQL, but not the case when the result also needs to be sorted on an attribute!
