Sorting multiple items at the same time using jQuery UI

I'm trying to setup a way to sort multiple items at the same time using jQuery UI's Sortable plugin . I have come up with a partial solution, where the checked items go with the drag, but I can't get them all to move positions. Here is what I have: http://jsbin.com/ecela What do I need to add to ensure the items move to their new location and get removed when dragging starts. Also, I'm wondering if there is a way to use selectable and sortable together. I'm guessing not because they both require you to click on the items to select and drag/sort them.
