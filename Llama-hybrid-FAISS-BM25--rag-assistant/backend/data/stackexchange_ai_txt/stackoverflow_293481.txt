This can also be accomplished through a naming convention to follow Zend_Loader . Keep your model files in the models folder under their module folder. Name them as Module_Models_ModelName and save them in a file name ModelName.php in the models folder for that module. Make sure the application folder is in your include path and assuming you are using Zend_Loader for auto loading, you can then just reference the models by their class name. This has the advantage of keeping your model code grouped in with the actual module it is for. This keeps the module contained within a single folder structure which helps encourage encapsulation. This will also help in the future if you need to port the module to another project.
