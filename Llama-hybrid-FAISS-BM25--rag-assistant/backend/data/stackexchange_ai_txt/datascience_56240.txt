Super Resolution CNN vs Regular CNN

I am digging into finding a solution for background subtraction and one of the requirements is to not loose in quality of input image. Found that there is a specific type of CNN like Super Resolution CNN. I was looking to find something when specifically this type of CNN is used and what is usually its accuracy. But everything that I find is about its structure. Can someone explain me what are the pros and cons of SRCNN vs regular CNN?
