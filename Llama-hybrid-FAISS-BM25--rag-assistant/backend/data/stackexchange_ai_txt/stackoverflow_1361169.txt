Possible to add data to the body of a HTTP request using cURL in PHP?

I would like to add some data to the body of a http request using cURL in PHP. Is this possible? How? I'm sending a HTTP request to a remote server. I have added all the headers I want, but now I need to add some more data to the HTTP body but I cant figure out how to do it. It is supposed to look something like this: Host: stackoverflow.com Authorization: Basic asd3sd6878sdf6svg87fS User-Agent: My user agent ... other headers... I want to add data to the request here
