Yes, there are differences -- the browser tends to send plenty of additionnal HTTP headers , I'd say ; and the ones that are sent by both probably don't have the same value. Here, after doing a couple of tests, it seems that passing the HTTP header called Accept is necessary . This can be done using the third parameter of file_get_contents , to specify additionnal context informations : $opts = array('http' => array( 'method' => 'GET', //'user_agent ' => "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100301 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.6", 'header' => array( 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*\/*;q=0.8 ' ), ) ); $context = stream_context_create($opts); $f = file_get_contents("http://mobile.mybustracker.co.uk/mobile.php?searchMode=2", false, $context); echo $f; With this, I'm able to get the HTML code of the page. Notes : I first tested passing the User-Agent , but it doesn't seem to be necessary -- which is why the corresponding line is here as a comment The value is used for the Accept header is the one Firefox used when I requested that page with Firefox before trying with file_get_contents . Some other values might be OK, but I didn't do any test to determine which value is the required one. For more informations, you can take a look at : file_get_contents stream_context_create Context options and parameters HTTP context options -- that's the interesting page, here ;-)
