Forecasting turnover on retail industries with time series

I'm working on a project of forecasting turnover on retail industry. I have the turnover of different products for a 2 years period of time My final goal is to forecast a global turnover with and without promotional markdowns for a given period of time. Could you help me on which method I should use ? At the moment, I've tried to modelize my problem with only one product. There is the weekly turnover of my product during a period of about 2 years : I have a weekly time series with turnover of the given product. I read a lot about time series and forecasting, so I've tried to apply what I learn't : Transform with Log, Then took if the series is stationary: Then differencing series Then modelize with ARIMA Then predict values, and compare with original values. But it's pretty bad. What do you think of it? Do you have any advice?
