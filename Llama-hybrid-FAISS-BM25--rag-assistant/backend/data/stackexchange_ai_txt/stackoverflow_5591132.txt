When you update the manifest file (actual change or a version comment) your browser will download every single file listed in the CACHE and FALLBACK sections. It's up to the browser to implement this how they see fit, but the better implementations out there will do it in smart ways. Current implementations do not all work in interoperable ways though. For example, browsers can check for HTTP code 304 "Not Modified" instead of blindly downloading the files. Check out: http://appcachefacts.info/ --this one says that " If any [files listed in the CACHE section] are already in the browser's cache, they will not be downloaded again separately.
