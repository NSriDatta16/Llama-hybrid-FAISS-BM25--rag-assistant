Independent of paint fumes, the question can be thought of figuring out if a coin is biased or not, based on one (or more if you prefer) toss. One logical way to make inference is using Bayesian framework, but we need priors. Just as in example in here , assuming a non-informative prior, i.e. uniform distribution, which is the same with beta distribution with $\alpha=1,\beta=1$ , the outcome of the experiment can be incorporated into the PDF estimation, yo come up with a posterior. The posterior is again Beta distributed, with $\alpha=\alpha_0+s$ , $\beta=\beta_0+f$ , where $\alpha_0,\beta_0$ represent your initial belief, i.e. prior, and $s$ number of positive outcomes, and $f$ number of negative outcomes after $n$ trials. In your case, $n=1,f=0,s=1$ . And, when you select the non-informative prior, i.e. $\alpha_0=1,\beta_0=1$ , you end up with a Beta distribution for $p$ with $\alpha=2,\beta=1$ :
