I might have misunderstood your question, but this seems to me like a job for multilvel/hierarchical models, possibly with poststratification. Models like this are often used for opinion polling. Let's say you want to know what is the public support for gun control in Alabama, but you have only few pols, or none in Alabama, but you have polls from Texas, Mississipi, Georgia etc. Then you can infer support for each demographic group (e.g. black, white, educated, rich) in Alabama based on those other polls, and use posstratification to get the overall state level support, taking into an account difference in demographic characteristics. There are whole books dealing with these problems, the main one is Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models by Gelman and Hill, that deals with frequentists and bayesian approaches to problems like this (not sure if it includes poststratification). So the name is hierarchical/multilevel models which can then by followed by poststratification. This is sometimes also called random effects or mixed effects models. This would also lead you to learning theory or algorithms for these problems. In general, these are just regressions of regressions thus the algorithms and theory is pretty standard. Bayesian statistics deals with this by putting a prior over the individual coefficients that is then estimated from the data (i.e. emprical bayes)
