We use the following dumb but working approach: we store all the GUIDs relevant to COM classes and interfaces as #define s in one header that is included into the .idl file. When we need to break compatibility we just open that file and manually replace all the GUIDs. Not very elegant, but reliable and works. So my suggestion is that you just search for all the GUIDs in your project and replace them. I guess you'll be better off moving them all in one place at the same time.
