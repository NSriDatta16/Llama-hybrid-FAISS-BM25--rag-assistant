Yes, it is possible, and I do this in my organization. See: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Email-ext+plugin quoting: This plugin allows you to configure every aspect of email notifications. You can customize when an email is sent, who should receive it, and what the email says. This plugin extends Hudson's built in email notification functionality by giving you more control. It provides customization of 3 areas. •Triggers - Select the conditions that should cause an email notification to be sent. •Content - Specify the content of each triggered email's subject and body. •Recipients - Specify who should receive a email when it is triggered. The trigger you want to select is the "Failure" trigger, and be sure to check the "Send to Committers" checkbox.
