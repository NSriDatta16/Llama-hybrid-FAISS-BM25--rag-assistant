send() is not atomic in most implementations, so sending to 1000 different sockets from multiple threads could lead to mixed-up messages arriving on the client side, and all kinds of weirdness. (I know nothing, see Nicolai's and Robert's comments below the rest of my comment still stands though (in terms of being a solution to your problem)) What I would do is use threads for sending like you use them for receiving. One thread to manage sending to one (or more) sockets that ensures that you don't write to one socket from multiple threads at the same time. Also look here for some additional discussion and more interesting links. If you're on windows, the winsock programmers faq is an invaluable resource, for your issue see here .
