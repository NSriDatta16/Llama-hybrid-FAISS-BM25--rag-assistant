Found my own answer, I assumed the GEE would control for cluster-level confounding, which is not true. Conditional logistic regression conditions out the cluster-specific effects entirely so it yields unbiased estimates in the face of omitted cluster-level confounders. In my simulation the GEE did reduce the bias by about 60%, but still produced biased estimates. The method I found to produce unbiased estimates using GEE was to include the cluster mean of the confounded dependent variable as a co-variate. It serves as a proxy for the omitted cluster-level effect. I believe there are some more complicated solutions as well.
