Time series that are correlated in levels but not first differences

Is it correct to say that the two time series are correlated in levels, but not first differences? $$x_{t}=\phi t+u_{t}\\ y_{t}=\rho t+\epsilon_{t}$$ where $\epsilon_{t}$ and $u_{t}$ are mutually orthogonal white noise processes, and $\phi$ , $\rho>0$ . The first differences of these time series are: $$\Delta x_{t}=\phi+\Delta u_{t}\\ \Delta y_{t}=\rho+\Delta \epsilon_{t} $$ The level series will clearly be correlated as they both have a deterministic time trend. The first differences, however, do not. Is this reasoning correct?
