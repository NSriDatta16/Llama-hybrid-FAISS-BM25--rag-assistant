Low average variance extracted (AVE) for a construct that measures self-reported behavior

I want to use a latent variable as a dependent variable in a path analysis. The indicators of the variable are self-reported behaviors like donate to an environmental NGO, recycle, and use public transport. After I perform confirmatory factor analysis, I find that the average variance extracted (AVE) for the variable is less than the recommended threshold of .5. My questions are: When self-reported behavior is measured, few behaviors are easier than others, and frequency of these behaviors varies among participants. So, in case of latent variables that are attempting to measure self-reported behavior, can we use a lower value of AVE as a threshold for assessing the convergent validity of our measurement model? Is there any reference that gives guidelines of what to do to deal with the low AVE? I should add that the value of alpha reliability and composite reliability are above the commonly recommended threshold of .70.
