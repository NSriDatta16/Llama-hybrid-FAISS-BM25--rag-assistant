You could do something similar to what we do (though we generate a domain layer). Take the MS DSL tools and construct graphical DSL that contains the elements of your DAL (procs, tables, triggers etc). That is not too hard. Add say drag and drop from the server explorer window to allow reverse engineering of persistence mappings and then write a few T4 templates to generate the code of the DSL model.
