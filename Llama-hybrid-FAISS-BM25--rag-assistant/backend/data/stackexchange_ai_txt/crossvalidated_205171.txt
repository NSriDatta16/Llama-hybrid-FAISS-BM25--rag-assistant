Conceptually, to do Bayesian inference, one has to serve a conditional likelihood function, with specific pdf. In your case, you have to provide the actual joint distribution of (X,Y). Perhaps potential function can help but the idea is the same, the final entry point to do MCMC should be a specific log pdf. If X and Y are independent, then the sum of their pdfs is the convolution of the two pdfs. so Z ~ Normal(thetax)*logNormal(thetay). Maybe the convolution integral can be evaluated.
