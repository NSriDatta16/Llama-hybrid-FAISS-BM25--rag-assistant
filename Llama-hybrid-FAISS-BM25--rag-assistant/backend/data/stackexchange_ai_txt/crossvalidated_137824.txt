I agreed with the currently top-voted answer that MASS4 was a pretty good fit to the request and have the same experience as another respondent with difficulty meeting its requirement of a fairly high level of statistical sophistication. MASS3 was in fact my first "Rbook" and it served me fairly well in that capacity. I did buy Crawley's "The R Book" and found it unsatisfactory for both an inaccurate description of the R language and being little more than a set of worked examples that seemed to lack depth of statistical theory. However, with the passage of time, I have found Harrell's "Regression Modeling Strategies" (RMS) a better fit for the "biostatistical" focus of this question as well as having good depth. It's not an introductory text on R. For that one needs to look elsewhere and for that I recommend one of Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R [ http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420068726] or (despite its name) "R for Dummies" written by a couple of long time contributors to StackOverflow's R posting tags. I only have RMS in its first edition when it was more focused on S, but since that time Harrell has switched over to R and fully supports the rms/Hmisc R package duo. I believe it satisfies @gung's suggestion for specialty coverage in several of the listed domains, although not for spatial analysis or mixed models.
