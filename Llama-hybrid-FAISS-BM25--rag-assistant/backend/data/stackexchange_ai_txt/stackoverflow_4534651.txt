You can. You'll just have to republish your app into another data center. Now, moving data will be very tricky, as you'll have to move your data by yourself. Having your app in one data center talk to your storage accounts in another maybe cost prohibitive and defeating the purpose of having the app be responsive to local users Yep, just redeploy your app with changed configuration If I understood your question correctly, you can. ie: you can have small web role and xtra-large worker role in one deployment. That totally depends on your app. I suggest profiling both scenarios. It is real easy to redeploy your app with different configurations w/o users noticing. Hope this helps
