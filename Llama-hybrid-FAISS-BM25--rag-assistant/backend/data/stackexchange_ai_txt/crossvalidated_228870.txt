How can I prepare the input layer for recurrent neural network if there are many categorical variables?

I am building a recurrent neural network (RNN). The feature set contains many categorical variables. Some of them are like users and items. In this case, if I use one-hot encoding and concatenate these vectors into a big one, the resulting vector will be super sparse. Is it fine to do this? I am not sure if this is normal for RNN. Is there any other way to handle this case?
