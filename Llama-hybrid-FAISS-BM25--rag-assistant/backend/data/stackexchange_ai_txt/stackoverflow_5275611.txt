Database design question (unknown number of columns?)

I am just starting my journey into learning databases/SQL and the like. I decided to make some databases for one of the companies I work for as practice and to help us organize a little. One of the tables will simply contain all of the individual parts we have in our inventory with columns like: PartNumber, Description, and StockQty. The other table would contain all of the hardware kits we make. All of which are made up of a combination of parts we have in our inventory. My initial thought was to have columns such as: PartNumber, KitName, Part1Number, Part1Qty, ... PartNnumber, PartNQty etc. The numbers in the parts columns would be part numbers of items in the first table. So since not all kits have the same number of parts I would just have to know how many parts are in the largest kit and make that many Parts columns. But then what if I have to add a new kit with more parts? Is there a better way to do this? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
