Fixing TextView background issue

I want to set a single background to a number of textViews. So i put all the text Views in a linearLayout and add background in this linear layout. There is a heading text and some content text which is organized into multiple TextViews. The Problem i am facing is: When i put large text in 2nd textView it is expanding the layout but i want that the background image should be fixed should not expand on adding text. And all the text Should reside into the background bounds only. I know this is not much tricky but I am new to android so facing this problem. I know one way to give fixed width(in px or dp) to the linear layout but it would not be a good approach (if I am correct). Is there any other way? here is the screen shot you can figure out the problem by this: http://postimage.org/image/1a8d1g538/
