If P(x) is 70% then should p(x) * 100 be >= 70 70% of the time, no? No. The confidence is not related to the probability in this way... What you are doing is in the second method is tossing a biased coin 100 times and returning true if you get 70 or more heads. As you have fixed your coin so that on average is will give you heads 70% of the time you would expect to get 70 heads out of 100 tosses "sometimes", but that "sometimes" is not 70% of the time.
