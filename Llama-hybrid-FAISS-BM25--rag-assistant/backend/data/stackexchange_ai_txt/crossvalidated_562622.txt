Regression assumption violation: lagged dependent variable as regressor

I am studying regression and a bit lost with conceptually understanding why having an independent variable correlated with the error term is a regression assumption violation. Just to give more context... I am looking into model specifications errors related to Time Series, where a lagged value of the dependent variable is included as an independent variable. And it's said that if we include such lagged dependent variable as independent , then it will be correlated with the error term, thus violating a regression assumption.
