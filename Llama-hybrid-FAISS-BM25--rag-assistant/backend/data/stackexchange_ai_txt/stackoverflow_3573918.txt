Consider the maven way : In a maven project, soruces are organized this way src |--main | |--java |--test |--java Your source code goes in src/main/java, your junit test code goes in src/test/java, they both are source folder (and as a consequence you can put your jUnit code in the same package as your Java code, but in a different source folder). The interest is that for usual coding, your jUnit classes are in code packages, but on jar creation, you can take classes coming only from src/main/java and not release your tests.
