There are several ways to do this. If you have a document like this: Test Hi There Bye Boo And you only wanted the paragraphs inside box, you could specify a context to the search: $('p','#box'); // only find paragraphs inside of #box Or you could use functions such as find or children : $('#box').find('p'); // will return both the paragraphs inside of #box $('#box').children('p'); // will only return the immediate children Instead of having really long selectors I usually like to separate the search terms as much as possible because a) I think it makes more sense to think of it this way, b) it helps jQuery out with parsing so it is slightly faster. So whenever I only want to search part of a document, I sometimes use a combination of the context and the additional functions: $(myelement, mygreatercontext).find(myrefinedsearch);
