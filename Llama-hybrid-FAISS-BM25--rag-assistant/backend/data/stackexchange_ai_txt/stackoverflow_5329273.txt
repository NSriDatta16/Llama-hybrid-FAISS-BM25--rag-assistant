Sharepoint 2007 - Custom webpart deployment doesn't work

I have a custom webpart for Sharepoint 2007. I am trying to deploy it to a new Sharepoint web application. I am using WSPBuilder with VS2010 to do the deploy. When I examine the wss\VirtualDirectories\ folder for the web app, the wpcatalog folder does not exist there. When I go to the Web Part Gallery and click "New" button, the web part is no there either. What could be causing this behavior? Are there any other ways to troubleshoot it? Thanks.
