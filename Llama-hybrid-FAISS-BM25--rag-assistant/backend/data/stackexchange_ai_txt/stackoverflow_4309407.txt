How to let user upload multiple images without pre-defining the number of HTML upload input box?

I'm looking for a way to have user upload as many images as they want (perhaps via drag and drop) or dynamically adding more upload box. I thought statically fixing (say 6) HTML upload input box is slightly limiting and the user have to click "Browse" button (6 times in this example) and navigating to the folder to pick the file. What is the best practice to achieve this so users find it easy to use? Perhaps with some AJAX magic? I also wouldn't mind having the user click "Upload more" to reveal (say 6 more) HTML upload input box. Was wondering if there is a better way! Thank you.
