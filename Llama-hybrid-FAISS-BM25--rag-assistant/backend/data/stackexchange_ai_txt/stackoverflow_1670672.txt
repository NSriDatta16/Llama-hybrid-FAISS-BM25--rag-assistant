Trouble Using Third Party Framework In Xcode 3.2

I am attempting to set up my own project using a third party library (MPOAuthConnection) for connecting to an oauth REST API. Steps I've gone through thus far: Downloaded source for MPOAuthConnection. Built source and had a resulting MPOAuth.framework in the Product tab. Opened my existing project and dragged the MPOAuth.framework into the "Linked Frameworks" of my project. Build my project and it fails at Runtime with the following error [Session started at 2009-11-03 16:41:37 -0600.] Warning - No location found for "OAuthClientController.m:68" GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1344) (Fri Jul 3 01:19:56 UTC 2009) Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Program loaded. run [Switching to process 32686] Running… dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Frameworks/MPOAuth.framework/Versions/A/MPOAuth Referenced from: /Users/markpowell/Documents/Programming/Cocoa/Celery/build/Debug/Celery.app/Contents/MacOS/Celery Reason: image not found No memory available to program now: unsafe to call malloc Data Formatters temporarily unavailable, will re-try after a 'continue'. (Not safe to call dlopen at this time.) So apparently, it can't find any of the framework information at runtime, but can at compile time? I'm a bit new to the OS X platform, so still struggling a bit with the tools. Any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: I did add a new Build Phase -> New Copy Files Build phase, dragged the Framework (MPOAuth.framework) to the dialog and set it to go to Frameworks. But still got the same error.
