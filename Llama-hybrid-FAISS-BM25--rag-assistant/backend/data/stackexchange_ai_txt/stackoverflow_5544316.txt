Depend on the purpose of the application, you can do either one. One thing to consider is does the user has to go through the flash video to obtain the code . If so, you need to organize the flow of the application in a way that the user can't cheat their way to obtain the code. The ideal way is to have the flash called aspx page at the end of the movie to obtain the dynamic code. This can be done using URLLoader in ActionScript 3.0 or LoadVars in ActionScript 2.0. URLLoader example //this is the data var data = "This is data"; //url of your aspx code var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest("http://www.yourdomain.com/GenerateCode.aspx"); request.contentType = "text/xml"; request.data = data; //use POST method request.method = URLRequestMethod.POST; var loader:URLLoader = new URLLoader(); try { //execute the request loader.load(request); } catch (error:ArgumentError) { trace("There is an ArgumentError."); } LoadVars example: //create LoadVars object var lv_in:LoadVars = new LoadVars(); var lv_out:LoadVars = new LoadVars(); //set onLoad event lv_in.onLoad = function(success:Boolean) { //if success, meaning data has received response from .net page, run this code if (success) { //lv_in.status is use to get the posted data from .Net page statusMsg.text = "Thank you!" + lv_in.status; } //if fail, run this code else { statusMsg.text = "Error!"; } } //this is the data lv_out.data = "This is data"; //begin invoke aspx page lv_out.sendAndLoad("GenerateCode.aspx", lv_in, "POST"); There another easier way but not the best practice i should say. The easier way would be to direct user to aspx page that generate dynamic code after users finish the flash movie. The negative side is, the page can be accessed although users did not finish the flash movie.
