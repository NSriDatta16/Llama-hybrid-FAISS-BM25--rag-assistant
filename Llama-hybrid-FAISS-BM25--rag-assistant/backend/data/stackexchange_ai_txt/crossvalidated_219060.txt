Interpreting overlapping arrows on a PCA biplot: does it mean that the variables are redundant?

I'm new in principal component analysis (PCA) and I don't really understand the biplot representation of its results, so I would really appreciate some guidance. Having the example of the illustration shown below. Could I say that variables x1 and x2 are telling me the same , and so there is no need to record the values of one of the two? In my case variables are geometrical deviations of a part where the points measured are close to each other. Therefore, I would like to know if based on the PCA biplot I could stop measuring the values for x2 if I already measured x1 values.
