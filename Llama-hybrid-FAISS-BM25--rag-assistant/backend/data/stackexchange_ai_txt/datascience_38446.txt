Context of my Response : There has been great responses so far. But, I want to extend the conversation by assuming you are speaking about a machine learning application to predict future values of this particular time series. With that context in mind, my advice is below. Advice : Look into traditional statistical forecasting strategies first (ie. Exponential Smoothing, SARIMAX or Dynamic Regression) as a baseline for prediction performance. Although machine learning has shown great promise for a variety of applications, for times series, there are tried and true statistical methods which may serve you better for your application. I would draw your attention to two recent articles: Statistical and Machine Learning Forecasting Methods: Concerns and Ways Forward by Spyros Makridakis et al. The article points out that for many time series, traditional statistical time series analysis outperform machine learning (ML) models. In essence, ML has a tendency to overfit and any ML model assumptions regarding to independent entries is violated. Simple Versus Complex Forecasting: The Evidence by Kesten C Green et al. The article compares and examines the time series output of peer reviewed journal article reporting time series analysis with and without comparisons to a variety of models. In conclusion, researchers over complicate their analysis with models which are more difficult to interpret and have worse performance. Commonly, this occurs because of poor incentive structures. If you are looking for good performance, choose a metric to compare against several models (ie. like MASE) and sweep through several statistical (references below) and machine learning models (with feature development strategies mentioned above). Cheers, Resources for Learning Statistical Forecasting : I would start by reviewing the free textbook by Rob J Hyndman here: https://otexts.org/fpp2/ . The text is based upon a R package you can easily incorporate into your analysis: https://otexts.org/fpp2/appendix-using-r.html . Finally, please please be aware of the difference between cross sectional cross validation and time series cross validation as explained here: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/ .
