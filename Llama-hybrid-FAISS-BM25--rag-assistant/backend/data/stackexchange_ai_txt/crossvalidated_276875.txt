Can you get exact 0 or 1 fitted probabilities from logistic regression?

I am trying to understand logistic regression, and I have a very basic question. Given that the sigmoid function $\phi(z) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-z)}$ gives 0 or 1 only when $z=-\inf$ or $z=\inf$ respectively, I think it is impossible that we get exact 0 or 1 fitted (or predicted) probability for any combination of the finite number of real-valued input variables. Is that correct?
