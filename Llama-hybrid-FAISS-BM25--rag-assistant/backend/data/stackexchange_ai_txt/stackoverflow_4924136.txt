XPATH - How to select a value of 1 tag based on the value of other tag

Here is the XML. Now i want to select all the /Home/Identifier/HomeNumber values that have a /Home/Coverages/Coverage/Identifier/CoverageName = 'WorkersCompensation' as the value. I ve tried some answers in this forum for similar questions but doesnt seem to work. I need help in constructing the XPATH expression. 1 PersonalLiability WorkersCompensation NumberOfInServants 1 . . .
