We use pbwiki . It's a nice hosted solution. But for svn access, and bug tracking, we use trac alongside, and link to the trac page from the wiki. Advantages of pbwiki: Per page access rights can be set, general organisation is easier, has support for templates for task assignment, time tracking etc.
