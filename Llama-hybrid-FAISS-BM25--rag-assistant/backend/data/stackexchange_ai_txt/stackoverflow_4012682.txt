Ususally the path for an SD card is \\Storage Card - you have to use the full path. You can just navigate to the file through ActiveSync or in the device itself and see the path you used to get there. The path you specify means that under the root "folder" (My Device) there is a folder named test and under that a folder named WindowsCE and under tht you have the file.
