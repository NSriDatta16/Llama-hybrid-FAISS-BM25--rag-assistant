We use Infragistics for the bulk of our needs, primarily for their grid and date controls. In addition we use XtraReports from DevXpress for the reporting tool. Niether are perfect but have offerred the best bang for the buck for both Windows and ASP.NET development as they provide both in one set. I would also look at Telerik, have not used them but from what I hear they are in similar regard as Infragistics. EDIT: Just as an added note, I find it better to stick with 1 or 2 control sets than picking a choosing individual across multiple vendors, it makes learning the controls' structure easier and easier for deployment sicne most will use some common libraries withn a suite of controls.
