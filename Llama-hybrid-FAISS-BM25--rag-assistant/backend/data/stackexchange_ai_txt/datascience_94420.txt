Even though you have 100 unique values - Do you see a pattern where perhaps 80 of those unique values appear only once or twice - and the remainder 20 occur much more often. In that case - you may want to encode the 80 with a special "Other" value. By doing this you lose information - by not being able to distinguish between the 80 categories - but perhaps it doesn't matter to your problem. The other option is - You can convert your categorical data into an integer (perhaps the ID approach you are talking about ?) and run a Decision Tree model (e.g. Random Forests) on it. My experience with Random Forests is that they work pretty well on such data.
