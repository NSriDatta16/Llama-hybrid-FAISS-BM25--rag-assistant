If you are interested in FED interest rate, I would look at how well the different models are able to predict it out of sample, namely, what is the expected loss from the (one-step-ahead) forecast errors from the different models. This can be estimated either (1) directly by using time series cross validation or (2) indirectly by taking in-sample loss and adjusting it for model complexity. E.g. AIC offers an indirect estimate of the expected loss defined as twice the negative log-likelihood. (However, taking AIC of an entire VAR model is not what you want, as that would reflect the models' ability to predict not only the FED interest rate but also all other dependent variables. What you want instead is the AIC of the equation for the FED interest rate alone. You could obtain it by specifying the single equation for the FED interest rate.)
