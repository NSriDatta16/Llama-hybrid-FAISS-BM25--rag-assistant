NSFetchedResultsController Mac OSX Cocoa equivalent

I am porting some Core Data code from iPhone to Mac OS X. Problem is that the Core Data Framework on Mac OS X does not have NSFetchedResultsController.h nor NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate protocol declared; at least I am not able to force a Cocoa application to see this class even if I drag Core Data Framework from the iPhone project to link with the Mac Application. Anyone faced this problem ?
