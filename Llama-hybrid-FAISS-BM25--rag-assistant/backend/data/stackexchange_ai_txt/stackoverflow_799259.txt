I think people need to get over knee-jerk negative reactions to using table tags in their (x)html. It's a valid set of tags, and it renders and organizes "square" data very well. If you're going to be vehemently opposed to them, be smart and specify that and the rest are inappropriate for semantically inappropriate uses . Don't use a table to lay out your logo and header. This is not tabular data. Are you displaying data in a square-ish way that shows relationships between rows and columns of information? Then go ahead and use tables! For your particular use, I would recommend, given my understanding of semantic markup (thanks Dan C.!) either a table or a definition list. This accurately describes what you're trying to write.
