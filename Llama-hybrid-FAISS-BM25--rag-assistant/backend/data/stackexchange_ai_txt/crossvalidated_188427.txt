This second answer provides a more detailed derivation of why the asymptotic distribution is multivariate normal with identity covariance matrix for $Y_t$ white noise. (Notation differs slightly from the question and previous answer, in that autocorrelations are denoted by $\rho$ and that we look at $p$ of them, following Brockwell and Davis, Time Series - Theory and Methods more closely.) Brockwell and Davis, Thm. 7.2.1, states that the distribution of the correlation coefficients $\hat{\rho}=(\hat{\rho}_1,\ldots,\hat{\rho}_p)^\top$ if $Y_t$ is a general linear process $$ Y_t=\mu+\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_j\epsilon_{t-j} $$ with $E|\epsilon_t|^4 To show the desired result for $Y_t$ white noise, note that the diagonal elements are \begin{eqnarray*} w_{ii}&=&\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\rho_{k+i}\rho_{k+i}+\rho_{k-i}\rho_{k+i}+2\rho_{i}\rho_{i}\rho_{k}^2 -2\rho_{i}\rho_{k}\rho_{k+i}-2\rho_{i}\rho_{k}\rho_{k+i}\\ &=&\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\rho_{k+i}^2+\rho_{k-i}\rho_{k+i}+2\rho_{i}^2\rho_{k}^2 -4\rho_{i}\rho_{k}\rho_{k+i} \end{eqnarray*} If $Y_t$ is white noise then $\rho_i=0$ for all $i\neq0$. Hence, $$\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\rho_{k+i}^2+\rho_{k-}\rho_{k+i}+2\rho_{i}^2\rho_{k}^2 -4\rho_{i}\rho_{k}\rho_{k+i}=1+0+0-0=1,$$ where the unit entry obtains when $k=-i$. The second term is always zero because the two terms cannot simultaneously have index zero. For $i\neq j$, note from $i,j,k>0$ that $$ w_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}0+0-2\cdot0+0+\rho_{k-i}\rho_{k-j}-2\cdot0-2\cdot0-2\cdot0+4\cdot0 $$ The only remaining entry must also be zero as $i\neq j$ such that not both $\rho_m$ can have index $m=0$.
