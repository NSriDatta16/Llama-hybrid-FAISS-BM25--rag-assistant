Sql for average daily increase

I've got a db table that has a date field, a username field, and an integer points balance field. There is a record for every day, storing the balance at the end of the business day. I'm looking for the most efficient way of calculating the average daily increase for each user, sorting highest average daily increase to the lowest.
