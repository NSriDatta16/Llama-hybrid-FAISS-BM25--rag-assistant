Fast and Responsive GridView for data acquisition?

My use case is to log millions of messages into a customizable grid GUI (e.g. similar features of DevExpress and Telerik's Win Form Datagrids). Since this should be used for logs from specific hardware I'm forced to use as a storage a file or a flat database (excluded SQL&Co) The gridview shall be customizable and fast on inserting new rows and when grouping/filtering/formatting. All these operations need to be done while the grid collects data on a pace of ~1000 events/second. Does somebody used one of these grids for this specific purpose? What you would recommend? Thanks PS: After a rough test, Telerik's Grid looks to have better performance.
