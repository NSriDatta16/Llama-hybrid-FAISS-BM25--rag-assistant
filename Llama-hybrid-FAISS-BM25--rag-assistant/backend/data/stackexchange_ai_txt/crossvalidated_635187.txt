This is a very interesting consideration. I cannot claim to give a definitive answer, but I will offer my thoughts. As far as I understand, in the terminology of your question, ALE nudging is nothing more than Rung 1 of the ladder of causation: correlation/association . It is important to understand that ALE does not attempt to directly describe the true relationship between input variables and an outcome. Rather, ALE describes a model's characterization of the relationship between input variables and the outcome. Any statistical or machine learning model is, on its own, nothing more than a mathematical relationship between variables. At that level, any model is fundamentally correlational. This is what ALE describes. Although its manipulations of controlling for effects by bounding them might superficially resemble experimental manipulations, these are simply mathematical tricks to account for interactions among variables. To advance on the ladder of causality, the research design needs to incorporate elements outside of the mathematical model such as random assignment and temporal precedence. ALE is agnostic to such measures. It only describes the mathematical, correlational model.
