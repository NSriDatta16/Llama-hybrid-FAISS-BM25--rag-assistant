Yes, we can use a non-linear estimator to reduce the variance and get more accurate results. There are many different techniques. To start of, for example, BART ( Bayesian Additive Regression Trees ) has been found to be an excellent algorithm for such "out-of-the-box" causal inference tasks, see Automated versus do-it-yourself methods for causal inference: Lessons learned from a data analysis competition by Dorie et al. (2017) for a more detailed investigation. In the last 5 to 6 years representation learning-based methods have also blossomed (starting with the work of Johansson et al. (2016) Learning Representations for Counterfactual Inference ) offering often very competitive results too.
