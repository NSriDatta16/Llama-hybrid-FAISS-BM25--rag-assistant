The three variables you describe are, in order, an ordered categorical variable, a binary categorical variable, and a count. If you were thinking of logistic regression then that is fine for the biary one. For the ordered categorical you need an ordinal regression model and for the third a Poisson regression. For descriptives you might consider frequency tables or proportions for the first and second and the median with inter-quartile range for the third.
