There is definitely a lot of blogs and explorations and tutorials out there, unfortunately I don't know any. IF you want explanation check Udacity georgia techs ML course, they have a section about PCA/ICA(maybe NMF) You can stack them. Sometimes PCA is run to reduce dimensions so then ICA/NMF doesn't have to as much work. I suppose to run first ICA/NMF and then PCA wouldn't really make much sense. Yes you can train them only on a subset of the data. It should probably have predict and fit functions implemented (or something similar)
