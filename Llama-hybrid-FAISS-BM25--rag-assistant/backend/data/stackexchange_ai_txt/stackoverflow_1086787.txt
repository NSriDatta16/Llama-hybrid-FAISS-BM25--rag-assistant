I have recently experienced the same problem, but I can't connect it to a reboot. It seemed to happen when I checked the solution from source control - we use Team Foundation Server. After disabling the service account a bazillion times, it somehow healed itself and began behaving. I found this post and checked my project folder for the rptproj.user file that benson mentioned, and it has a modified date of the day I had problems, but a create date of close to what I can remember as having created the project, so I will pay attention to this in the future. Did anyone come up with anything new on this issue?
