I'm dealing with similar problem these days. I have hundreds of feature to build classifier. After trying different models (ex: random forests, gradient boost, etc...), I still got low precision/recall. So I'm trying to do some clustering then build classifiers in different groups. My concern is, just like Anony-Mousse says, how can I gain more information from the classifier if I use all the information in clustering? So here's what I gonna do next: Use some features (less, according to prior knowledge) to do clustering. Use other features (more) to train classifiers. I think it may also helps to reduce complexity, wish it helps.
