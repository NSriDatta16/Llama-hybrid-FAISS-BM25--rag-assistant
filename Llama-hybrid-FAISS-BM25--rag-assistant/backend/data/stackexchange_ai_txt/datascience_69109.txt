how to build word2vec content based recommendation?

I am building a content-based recommendation system for hotel accommodation. I have a hotel name, hotel description and location. I combined hotel name, description and location. Then, applied NLP and converted into vectors using TF-IDF. I am taking hotel name and location as an input and recommend the hotel based on cosine similarity. I wanted to use word2vec instead of TF-IDF and make a recommendation. Anyone can suggest how to do this?
