Disclaimer: The previous answers do a pretty good job of explaining how PCA in its original formulation is non-convex but can be converted to a convex optimization problem. My answer is only meant for those poor souls (such as me) who are not so familiar with the jargon of Unit Spheres and SVDs - which is, btw, good to know. My source is this lecture notes by Prof. Tibshirani For an optimization problem to be solved with convex optimization techniques, there are two prerequisites. The objective function has to be convex. The constraint functions should also be convex. Most formulations of PCA involve a constraint on the rank of a matrix. In these type of PCA formulations, condition 2 is violated. Because, the constraint that $rank(X) = k, $ is not convex. For example, let $J_{11}$, $J_{22}$ be 2 Ã— 2 zero matrices with a single 1 in the upper left corner and lower right corner respectively. Then, each of these have rank 1, but their average has rank 2.
