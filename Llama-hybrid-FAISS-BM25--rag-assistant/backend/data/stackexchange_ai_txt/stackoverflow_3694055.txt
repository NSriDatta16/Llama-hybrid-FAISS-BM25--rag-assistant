android emulator/eclipse deletes application files on redeployment

My Application downloads a file from a server and stores it in: /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.test/files . (the /mnt/sdcard is derived from Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); ) Everytime I redeploy the Application from eclipse(run menu) to the emulator it deletes the file. The Checkbox 'target/wipe user data' in the run configuration is unchecked. I close all the BufferedOutputStreams properly so I don't think it is my application itself. Am I using the right directory for persistent data storage? (my Files are around 70-100M) Any hints?
