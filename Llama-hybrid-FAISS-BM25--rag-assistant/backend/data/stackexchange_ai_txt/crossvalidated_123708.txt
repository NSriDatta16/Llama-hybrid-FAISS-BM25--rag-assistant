Log transformation in logistic regression

I have a model with a natural log transformed variable in a logistic regression and I'm looking for some help in interpreting the odds ratio. The odds ratio is 1.78 (coefficient 0.58). I know there are similar questions on this list however I just wanted to check how to interpret in the situation of using natural logs. many thanks
