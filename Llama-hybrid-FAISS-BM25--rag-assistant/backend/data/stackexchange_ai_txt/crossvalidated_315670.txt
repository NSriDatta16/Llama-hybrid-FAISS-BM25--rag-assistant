Ross describes three versions of this "paradox" in the Example 6a in his textbook . In each version, 10 balls are added to the urn and 1 ball is removed at each step of the procedure. In the first version, $10n$ -th ball is removed at the $n$ -th step. There are infinitely many balls left after midnight because all balls with numbers not ending in zero are still in there. In the second version, $n$ -th ball is removed at the $n$ -th step. There are zero balls left after midnight because each ball is eventually going to be removed at the corresponding step. In the third version, balls are removed uniformly at random. Ross computes the probability of each ball to be removed by step $n$ and finds that it converges to $1$ as $n\to\infty$ (note that this is not evident! one actually has to perform the computation). This means, by Boole's inequality , that the probability of having zero balls in the end is also $1$ . You are saying that this last conclusion is not intuitive and hard to explain; this is wonderfully supported by many confused answers and comments in this very thread. However, the conclusion of the second version is exactly as un-intuitive! And it has absolutely nothing to do with probability or statistics. I think that after one accepts the second version, there is nothing particularly surprising about the third version anymore. So whereas the "probabilistic" discussion must be about the third version [see very insightful answers by @paw88789, @Paul, and @ekvall], the "philosophical" discussion should rather focus on the second version which is much easier and is similar in spirit to the Hilbert's hotel . The second version is known as the Ross-Littlewood paradox . I link to the Wikipedia page, but the discussion there is horribly confusing and I do not recommend reading it at all. Instead, take a look at this MathOverflow thread from years ago . It is closed by now but contains several very perceptive answers. A short summary of the answers that I find most crucial is as follows. We can define a set $S_n$ of the balls present in the urn after step $n$ . We have that $S_1=\{2,\ldots 10\}$ , $S_2=\{3,\ldots 20\}$ , etc. There is a mathematically well-defined notion of the limit of a sequence of sets and one can rigorously prove that the limit of this sequence exists and is the empty set $\varnothing$ . Indeed, what balls can be in the limit set? Only the ones that are never removed. But every ball is eventually removed. So the limit is empty. We can write $S_n \to \varnothing$ . At the same time, the number $|S_n|$ of the balls in the set $S_n$ , also known as the cardinality of this set, is equal to $10n-n=9n$ . The sequence $9n$ is obviously diverging, meaning that the cardinality converges to the cardinality of $\mathbb N$ , also known as aleph-zero $\aleph_0$ . So we can write that $|S_n|\to \aleph_0$ . The "paradox" now is that these two statements seem to contradict each other: \begin{align} S_n &\to \varnothing \\ |S_n| &\to \aleph_0 \ne 0 \end{align} But of course there is no real paradox and no contradiction. Nobody said that taking cardinality is a "continuous" operation on sets, so we cannot exchange it with the limit: $$\lim |S_n| \ne |\lim S_n|.$$ In other words, from the fact that $|S_n|=9n$ for all integer $n\in \mathbb N$ we cannot conclude that $|S_\omega|$ (the value at the first ordinal ) is equal to $\infty$ . Instead, $|S_\omega|$ has to be computed directly and turns out to be zero. So I think what we get out of this really is the conclusion that taking cardinalities is a discontinous operation... [@HarryAltman] So I think this paradox is just the human tendency to assume that "simple" operations are continuous. [@NateEldredge] This is easier to understand with functions instead of sets. Consider a characteristic (aka indicator) function $f_n(x)$ of set $S_n$ which is defined to be equal to one on the $[n, 10n]$ interval and zero elsewhere. The first ten functions look like that (compare the ASCII art from @Hurkyl's answer): $\quad\quad\quad$ Everybody will agree that for each point $a\in\mathbb R$ , we have $\lim f_n(a) = 0$ . This by definition means that functions $f_n(x)$ converge to the function $g(x)=0$ . Again, everybody will agree to that. However, observe that the integrals of these functions $\int_0^\infty f(x)dx = 9n$ get larger and larger and the sequence of integrals diverges. In other words, $$\lim\int f_n(x)dx \ne \int \lim f_n(x) dx.$$ This is a completely standard and familiar analysis result. But it is an exact reformulation of our paradox! A good way to formalize the problem is to describe the state of the jug not as a set (a subset of $\mathbb N$ ), because those are hard to take limits of, but as its characteristic function. The first "paradox" is that pointwise limits are not the same as uniform limits. [@TheoJohnson-Freyd] The crucial point is that "at midnight noon" the whole infinite sequence has already passed , i.e. we made a "trasfinite jump" and arrived to the transfinite state $f_\omega = \lim f_n(x)$ . The value of the integral "at midnight noon" has to be the value of the integral of $\lim f_n$ , not the other way around. Please note that some of the answers in this thread are misleading despite being highly upvoted. In particular, @cmaster computes $\lim_{n\to\infty} \operatorname{ballCount}(S_n)$ which is indeed infinite, but this is not what the paradox asks about. The paradox asks about what happens after the whole infinite sequence of steps; this is a transfinite construction and so we need to be computing $\operatorname{ballCount}(S_\omega)$ which is equal to zero as explained above.
