Machine Learning on tabular data with spherical coordinates

I am wondering if any work has been done on machine learning with high dimensional spherical coordinates for tabular data. Because with tabular data, upon encoding the data for machine learning, we will end up with a vector of the input dimension n. So then the machine learning model for classification or regression will be from $R^n$ to $R^{c}$ for classification, or R for regression. So, does that mean if we take the data points which are points in $R^{n}$ , we could also re-write the same data point into a different coordinate system for $R^n$ to $R^c$ or R. But I have not been able to find any resources about this.
