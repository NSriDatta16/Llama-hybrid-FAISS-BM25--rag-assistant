Can I merge Emma coverage data from unit and integration test targets?

We have our TeamCity builds set up using a build chain, so that our unit tests and and integration tests can run in parallel when triggered by a commit: Build Chain - dependant on: Unit tests Integration tests I am looking for a way that we can combine/merge the coverage data generated by the unit and integration tests in the build chain, so that we can get a better picture of how much actual code is covered by the two combined. The plan then is to be able to monitor changes in coverage of committed code, and perhaps failing builds if percentages fall!
