3D Engines for development on any mobile platform

I am planning to develop a game for all of the mobile platform and have pretty much zeroed down on the concepts of the game. but the only issue I'm facing as of now is that I have no idea what would be the best libraries + 3d Engine to us to achieve the best results on the hardware on some of the upcoming mobiles. I'm talking about the iPhone 3GS, the new WinMo and Android devices with the famed Snapdragon, other processors from Samsung, ARM, Qualcomm and even Intel and AMD. as of now i plan to use the ogre libraries for now, but then what will offer portability?? This is much more of a design question rather than just coding. Any help is appreciated, others who wish to collaborate are very much welcome too. just drop me a mail.
