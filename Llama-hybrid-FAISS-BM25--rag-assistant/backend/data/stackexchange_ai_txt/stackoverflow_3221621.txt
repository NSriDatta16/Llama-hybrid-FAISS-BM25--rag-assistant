iPhone useragent string: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Mobile/8A293 Safari/6531.22.7 Can't find anything specific to iPhone 4 I'm afraid. You could create a prompt if they are on iPhone asking them if they are on an iPhone 4 or not before the page loads, I think that is a reasonable action.
