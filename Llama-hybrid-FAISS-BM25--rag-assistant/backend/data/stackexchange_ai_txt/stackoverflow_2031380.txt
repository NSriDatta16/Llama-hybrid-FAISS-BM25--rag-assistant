I think it entirely depends on what you want to do. There a few proper types for time/date types (see: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/date-and-time-type-overview.html ) DATE - typically 3 bytes, range: 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 . DATETIME - 8 bytes, range 1000-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59 TIMESTAMP - 4 bytes range 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC to 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC. Then, there are some semantic issues to be aware of: (int is 4 bytes like TIMESTAMP, bigint is 8 bytes like DATETIME) date stores calendar days, datetime and timestamp both store date+time at a second precision (sub-second precision is supported in date arithmetic, but not for storage) timestamp stores an UTC value. That is, any value you stick in there is converted from the session's timezone (by default, the server's timezone) to UTC and stored. On retrieval, the UTC value is converted back again to the timezone in effect in the session. timestamp can be declared to automatically get the current timestamp on insert or update or both. you best study the manual for the details (see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/timestamp.html )
