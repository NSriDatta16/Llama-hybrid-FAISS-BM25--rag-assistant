Maximum gap between samples drawn without replacement from a discrete uniform distribution

This problem is related to my lab's research in robotic coverage: Randomly draw $n$ numbers from the set $\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ without replacement, and sort the numbers in ascending order. $1\le n\le m$ . From this sorted list of numbers $\{a_{(1)},a_{(2)},…,a_{(n)}\}$ , generate the difference between consecutive numbers and the boundaries: $g = \{a_{(1)},a_{(2)}−a_{(1)},\ldots,a_{(n)}−a_{(n-1)},m+1-a_{(n)}\}$ . This gives $n+1$ gaps. What is the distribution of the maximum gap? $P(\max(g) = k) = P(k;m,n) = ? $ This can be framed using order statistics : $P(g_{(n+1)} = k) = P(k;m,n) = ? $ See link for the distribution of gaps , but this question asks the distribution of the maximum gap. I'd be satisfied with the average value, $\mathbb{E}[g_{(n+1)}]$ . If $n=m$ all the gaps are size 1. If $n+1 = m$ there is one gap of size $2$ , and $n+1$ possible locations. The maximum gap size is $m-n+1$ , and this gap can be placed before or after any of the $n$ numbers, for a total of $n+1$ possible positions. The smallest maximum gap size is $\lceil\frac{m-n}{n+1}\rceil$ . Define the probability of any given combination $T= {m \choose n}^{-1}$ . I've partially solved the probability mass function as $ P(g_{(n+1)} = k) = P(k;m,n) = \begin{cases} 0 & k m-n+1 \end{cases} \tag{1} $ Current work (1): The equation for the first gap, $a_{(1)}$ is straightforward: $$ P(a_{(1)} = k) = P(k;m,n) = \frac{1}{{m \choose n}} \sum_{k=1}^{m-n+1} {m-k-1 \choose n-1} $$ The expected value has a simple value: $\mathbb{E}[P(a_{(1)})] = \frac{1}{ {m \choose n}} \sum_{k=1}^{m-n+1} {m-k-1 \choose n-1} k = \frac{m-n}{1+n}$ . By symmetry, I expect all $n$ gaps to have this distribution. Perhaps the solution could be found by drawing from this distribution $n$ times. Current work (2): it is easy to run Monte Carlo simulations. simMaxGap[m_, n_] := Max[Differences[Sort[Join[RandomSample[Range[m], n], {0, m+1}]]]]; m = 1000; n = 1; trials = 100000; SmoothHistogram[Table[simMaxGap[m, n], {trials}], Filling -> Axis, Frame -> {True, True, False, False}, FrameLabel -> {"k (Max gap)", "Probability"}, PlotLabel -> StringForm["m=``,n=``,smooth histogram of maximum map for `` trials", m, n, trials]]
