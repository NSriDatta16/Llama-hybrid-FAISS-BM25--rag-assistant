In the old days DotNetNuke was a viable platform, but the underlying technology seems ancient compared to the new Orchard Project. http://www.orchardproject.net/ While it is still very early, I would expect this to be the defacto CMS for many people. It is just so architecturally robust and optimized to leverage the latest technologies in the .NET space.
