If what you want to do is select a certain text/varchar column, but you want to strip its data of everything but numbers, you have two options to choose from really: Strip non-numerics on retrieval Use this query: SELECT your_column FROM table WHERE ... And strip all non-numeric characters as you're retrieving the results from the database programatically. or... Strip non-numerics pre-insert As you're inserting the data into the database, strip all characters before the insertion takes place, and use the same query as above for selecting. Depending on your situation, one of the above may be more appropriate than the other. Good luck!
