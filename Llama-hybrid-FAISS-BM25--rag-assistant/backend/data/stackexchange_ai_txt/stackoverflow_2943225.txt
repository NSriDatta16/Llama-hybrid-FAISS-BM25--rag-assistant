Specify temporary directory in .jnlp

I'm accessing a java applet that is running on a website (which i can't access/modify the content) you can find the applet here : xxx I want to be able to specify a temporary folder at start because if i have two instances of that applet running they will overlap the files, they store in the same temporary folder. I wonder if it's every possible to tell the applet to write in a specified temporary folder. Tried to add property : But doesn't work. Any idea ?
