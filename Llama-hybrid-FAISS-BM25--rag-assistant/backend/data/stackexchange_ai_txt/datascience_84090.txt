As you've described in the comments: you are performing a multi-class classification problem after the rolling-window aggregations. As this is the case - construct as many features as you can. Consider stuff like the stddev, the range of values, the change over the start and end of the window, etc... Your classifier will ultimately decide if these features are important and it behooves you to give it many options to choose from. Personally I don't see the value of scaling as you have described in #3 - but it could be an avenue of future investigation after you've gone through the first pass of feature engineering & classification. Having done this sort of problem before: what will really impact the performance of your model is the window size you choose for classification. Make sure to keep this as a variable so you can iterate through different window options & track performance.
