Does C parameter in Linear SVM guarantee the margin does not increase?

From my understanding a large value of the C parameter in SVM decreases the number of misclassified instances and narrows the margin. My question is - considering that SVM with linear kernel is used, with soft margin - does increasing the value of C always guarantees that the margin is not getting bigger or there is a chance that it still can?
