How to measure good or bad luck in roulette

I want to analyze and represent the performance of a bet (X numbers out of 37 total roulette numbers) for a series of spins (N spins). For example, let's say that I choose 5 numbers (my bet) and these 5 numbers win in 10 out of 100 spins. How can I measure (and show) how lucky or unlucky I was? What if I use a scale from 1 to 10.. 1 for worst results against my favour, 5 neutral and 10 for most favourable results. I thought about comparing the actual win % to the expected average win %, but i don't really know how to do it. As for visualizing the results, I would like to represent variance/deviation/luck with a bar like that
