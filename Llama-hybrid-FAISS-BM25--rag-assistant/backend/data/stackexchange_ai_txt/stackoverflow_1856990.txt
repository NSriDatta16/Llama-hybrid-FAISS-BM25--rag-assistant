XBAP applications won't download: The operation has timed out?

Trying to download any XBAP application on a workstation that used to be able to, the presentationhost loads and then sits at "Downloading Application" with zero bytes downloaded for several minutes. Eventually it comes up with "Application Download Error" with the error log shown below. Also several folders are created under my profile apps\2.0 but no files are actually downloaded. I can download the app from another workstation so the app appears to be good. This application and IIS are all running on my local workstation so there should be no network or firewall issues. I've tried: Clearing out isolated storage and app\2.0 folders Running mage.exe -cc Running the xbap permission fixer (xbappermfx_sx.exe)-- which found and fixed something but didn't fix the issue Creating a new user and trying to browse to the app logged in as that user Uninstalling all .NET and reinstalling through 3.5sp1 Any thoughts on what else to try?
