Memcached if you need to preserve state across several web servers (if you're load balanced and it's important that what's in the cache is the same for all servers). APC if you just need access to quick memory to read (& write) on a (or each) server. Remember APC can also compile and speed up your script execution time. So you could for example be using APC for increased execution performance, while using memcached for cache storage.
