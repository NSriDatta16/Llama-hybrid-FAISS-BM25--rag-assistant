What excellently works with comparing time series is so-called "dynamic time warp" (you can use the ouptut of this procedure to cluster your data). It is worth to take a look. What also seems to work well are autoencoders (also GANs). The main idea is to train an autoencoder and use the loss function as an anomaly Score. Clusters can work well, but you have to choose one clustering method that fits your data. This can be challenging in respect to anomaly detection, because you maybe do not know how your data will cluster. If your data and anomalies cluster in blobs, you can use Euclidean distance applying K-Means or more general distance metrics applying K-Medoid Clusters. You can see here what kind of clusters there are and how they can fail.
