How can I use IEnumerable interface and at the same time, have XMLSerializer not use GetEnumerator()?

I have a class that parses very large file (that can't fit in memory) and I'm currently utilizing the IEnumerable interface to use foreach so I can easily grab the parsed contents of the file line by line. Currently, I'm trying to write this to file using an XMLSerializer. It insists on enumerating the class and in my case, this means dumping large, parsed content of files to the XML. Is there anyway (hackish or elegant) to use this interface and still get the "expected" functionality out of a XMLSerializer? (I only call this "expected" because this seems an expected outcome if I was implementing some collection interface rather than IEnumerable. Perhaps my concepts of IEnumerable and collections is all out of whack. :( )
