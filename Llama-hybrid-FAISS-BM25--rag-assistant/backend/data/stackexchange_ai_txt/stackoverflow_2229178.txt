Disable ScrollView action

In my application i've a line for increasing the width of a widget(by dragging the line to right/left) and i've the ScrollView enabled in the same activity. I need to disable the scroll view action when the user touches the line and when user releases, it should be enabled. The ScrollView should be in visible state but the action of the scroll view should be disabled. Please help me in solving this problem. I've tried with these but none of them is working. scroll.setEnabled(false); scroll.setFocusable(false); scroll.setHorizontalScrollBarEnabled(false); scroll.setVerticalScrollBarEnabled(false); Thanks in advance.
