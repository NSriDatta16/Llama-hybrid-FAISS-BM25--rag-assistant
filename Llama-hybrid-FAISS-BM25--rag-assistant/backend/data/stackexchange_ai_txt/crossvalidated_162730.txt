Yes and no. No because the results of a "fail to reject" finding means either there is no difference or you did not have enough power to detect a difference. We never conclude that the null is true as the result of a null finding. Plenty of evidence that we collect is consistent with incorrect hypotheses. That is why we state them first, then falsify them. Yes because the data are meaningful insofar as they were collected as part of a study. You can summarize grand aspects of that sample and, using a confidence interval, infer what range of values this mean is consistent with. For instance, in public health data, you may collect evidence on BMI and race with the hypothesis that BMI differs in race groups. The grand average BMI and its 95% CI summarizes the variability in your data as well as the general trend. If the data are nationally representative, they summarize the current state of the nation. It contextualizes how "big" some differences are, in case some appear to be "clinically meaningful" (such as a difference of 5 kg/m^2) but not statistically significant. Basically, it is all a matter of how you report it.
