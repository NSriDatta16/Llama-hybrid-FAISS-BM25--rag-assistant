ehcache auto-discovery (via multicast) between 2 instances on the same host

I run 2 tomcat instances on the same host. Each instance runs the same web application which tries to communicate some ehcache caches via RMI replication. I use the autodiscovery configuration in ehcache so I don't have to explicitly define which are the hosts and which are the caches I want to replicate. The ehcache instances do not manage to find each other and communicate: DEBUG (RMIBootstrapCacheLoader.java:211) - cache peers: [] DEBUG (RMIBootstrapCacheLoader.java:133) - Empty list of cache peers for cache org.hibernate.cache.UpdateTimestampsCache. No cache peer to bootstrap from. If I try the same thing but this time run each tomcat instance on a separate host (box) then everything works like a charm. Am I doing something wrong, or isn't autodiscovery via multicast possible when the instances are on the same host? My configuration uses the defaults presented in the RMI Distributed Caching documentation : And inside each cache region I want to replicate I have: thanks
