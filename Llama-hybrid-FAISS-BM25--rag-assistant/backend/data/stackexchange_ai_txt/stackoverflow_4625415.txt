Try like this : Also make sure that there's no some javascript that could interfere with the form submission sending an AJAX request and forgetting to include the values. And finally make sure that Model.customer.CustomerID is not empty. Use FireBug to see exactly what is the request being sent to the server. UPDATE: According to the specification : If the method is "get" and the action is an HTTP URI, the user agent takes the value of action, appends a `?' to it, then appends the form data set, encoded using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type. This means that you should not use query string parameter in the form action with GET method. You need to use hidden fields inside the form to pass those values to the server.
