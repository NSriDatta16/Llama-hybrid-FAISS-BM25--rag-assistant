oXygen has a grid view for editing . oXygen is not free, but they do have a 30 day trial. Great editor for XML based work. The price is reasonable for all the features. The XML document is displayed in the XML Grid Editor as a structured layout of nested tables in which the text content can be modified without directly interacting the XML tags. considers the child elements and attributes of the recurring elements as columns. The tables can be expanded and collapsed with a mouse click to show or hide the elements as needed. Also the document structure can be changed easily with drag and drop operations on the grid components.
