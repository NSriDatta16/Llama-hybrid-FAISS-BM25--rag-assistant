Rare event as categorical predictors - avoiding bias

Are there rules to determine when a binary categorical variable is unfit to be included in a regression model due to extreme rarity in one of the levels of the variable? For example, a binary predictor variable with 1990 blues and 10 reds; or even worse 1999 blues and 1 red. Currently, I'm constructing contingency tables with these rare events predictor variables and the response variable, then estimating the expected counts of the table and only consider such variables in my regression model if the expected counts are all greater than zero and none of the actual cell values is 0. Note that the underlying regression model is design-based (survey-weighted logistic regression) and there are currently no penalized likelihood functions as in regular logistic regression
