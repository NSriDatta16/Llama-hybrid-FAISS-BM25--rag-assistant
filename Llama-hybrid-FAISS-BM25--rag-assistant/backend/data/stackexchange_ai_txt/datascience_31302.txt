autoEncoder as LSTM input, any benefit?

When training my LSTM, is there any incentive to pre-pass its inputs through an auto-encoder, or should I always supply as raw data as possible? I have is a small amount of training data, and it contains only a few very rare significant events (spikes, spaced out in time)
