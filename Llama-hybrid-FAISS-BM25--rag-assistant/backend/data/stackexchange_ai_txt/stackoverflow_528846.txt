Generating JUnit Testcases

Our application depends on numerous resources that are provided by another system. To ensure the existence of those resources, we currently have a JUnit test case (probably more an integration test), that takes a list of all the resources as a textfile, fetches each and tracks success/failure. This is a very long running testCase that is not very "tool friendly". What we would really like to have is something along the lines of one test-method per resource. I am aware that this is not what JUnit was meant to do. But is there a way to generate those testmethods on the fly? Maybe something a bit more "elegant" than writing a perl-script to generate hundreds of methods? Thanks a lot!
