Machine Learning is hot and is where the money is. People call things they're trying to sell whatever is hot at the moment and therefore "sells". That can be selling software. That can be selling themselves as current employees trying to get promoted, as prospective employees, as consultants, etc. That can be a manager trying to get budget approved from a company bigwig to hire people and buy stuff, or to convince investors to invest in his/her hot new startup which does Machine Learning as the key to making an improved sexting app. So software does Machine Learning and people are Machine Learning experts, because that's what's hot and therefore what sells ... at least for now. I did all kinds of linear and nonlinear statistical model fitting more than 30 years ago. It wasn't called Machine Learning then. Now, most of it would be. Just as everyone and their uncle is now a Data "Scientist". That's hot, that's supposedly sexy, so that's what people call themselves. And that's what hiring managers who have to get budget approved to hire someone list positions as. So someone who doesn't know the first thing about math, probability, statistics, optimization, or numerical/floating point computation, uses an R or Python package of dubious correctness and robustness of implementation, and which is labeled as a Machine Learning algorithm, to apply to data they don't understand, and call themselves a Data Scientist based on their experience in doing so. This may sound flippant, but I believe it to be the essence of the situation.

(I'm not sure who came up with this but it's a gem )
