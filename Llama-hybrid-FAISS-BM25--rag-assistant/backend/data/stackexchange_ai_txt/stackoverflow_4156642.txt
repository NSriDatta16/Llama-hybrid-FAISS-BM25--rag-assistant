If the application is embedding images, that means they are part of the SWF. You probably don't need to copy the assets folder to your production server. I'd try recompiling your project (Use a Flash Builder Clean) and test it locally to make sure things are updated, then move the SWF live and test there. IF it still doesn't how up, you may be having caching issues, so be sure to force the browser cache to clear. If it still doesn't show up, I'm at a bit of a loss.
