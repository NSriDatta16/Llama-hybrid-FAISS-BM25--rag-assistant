First, why do you want to add Spring? What is your goal in doing so? To answer the question, yes, you could find a way to slowly start integrating it into an existing app, but you'll need a pretty good reason in my opinion. If you really want to 'modernize' the application with a major change like that (and you have a justification), personally I'd start with a brand new project and just import the stuff you can reuse into that. Applications that change over time (virtually all) get messy and accumulate a lot of "junk" the older they get. Eventually they're unmaintainable, whether it's because some SME in the app finds another job, or because it just gets too confusing and fragile. I can't help but think doing something like this (adding into an existing app) is just accelerating that aging process (how confident will you be in removing the "old" stuff without the urge to leave it "just in case"?), so much better to clean house while you can. Unless you're talking a small app that's in pretty good shape, but that's rarely the case in my experience.
