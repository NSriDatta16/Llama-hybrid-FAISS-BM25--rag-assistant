How to add external regressors in a MGARCH-DCC model

For my research, I am using the MGARCH-DCC model using the rmgarch package in R. However, this package only allows for external regressors in the mean and variance equation, but not directly in the DCC model. I have found a paper that implements a so-called DCCX model (Prange, 2021), however I don't know how to program this model. My question consists of two parts: Is there a programming package that allows directly implementing the external regressors? Is there a other way to test the significance of external regressors with regards to the dynamic conditional correlations (except for OLS regressions)? If not, how could I implement the DCCX model? (I already have the standardized residuals of the GARCH model) paper Prange, Philipp. "Does online investor attention drive the co-movement of stock-, commodity-, and energy markets?
