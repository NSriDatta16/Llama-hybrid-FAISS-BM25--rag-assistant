Football manager like drag&drop interface

I am creating a soccer management system in PHP and Javascript (jquery) to organize teams and matches. I am now develping the match part and I would like to show to the user a drag&drop based interface to place players on the soccer field. I could write the code by myself but that would require a big effort and I'm sure that someone has already thought about this and may suggest some implementation I could use. Anyone has a solution for this? Thanks in advance!
