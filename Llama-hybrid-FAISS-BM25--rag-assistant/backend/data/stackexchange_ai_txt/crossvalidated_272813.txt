One area of statistics/applied mathematics where differential geometry is used in an essential way (together with a lot of other areas of mathematics!) is pattern theory . You could have a look at the book by Ulf Grenander: https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Theory-Representation-Inference-European/dp/0199297061/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8 or the somewhat more accessible text by David Mumford (a fields medal winner no less): https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Theory-Stochastic-Real-World-Mathematics/dp/1568815794/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1568815794&pd_rd_r=Q40ESHME10ZPC7XYVT59&pd_rd_w=fBcaR&pd_rd_wg=LIesY&psc=1&refRID=Q40ESHME10ZPC7XYVT59 From the preface of the last text: The term “pattern theory” was coined by Ulf Grenander to distinguish his approach to the analysis of patterned structures in the world from “pattern recognition.” In this book, we use it in a rather broad sense to include the statistical methods used in analyzing all “signals” generated by the world, whether they be images, sounds, written text, DNA or protein strings, spike trains in neurons, or time series of prices or weather; examples from all of these appear either inGrenander’s book Elements of Pattern Theory [94] or in the work of our colleagues, collaborators, and students on pattern theory. One example where differential geometry is used is for face models. Trying to answer the question (in comments) by @whuber, look at chapter 16 of Grenander's book, with title "computational anatomy". There manifolds is used to represent various parts of human anatomy (like the hearth), and diffeomorhisms used to represent changes of these anatomical manifolds, enabling comparison, modeling of growth, modeling of action of some sickness. This ideas can be traced back to D'Arcy Thompson's monumental treatise "on growth and form" from 1917! Grenander goes on to cite from that treatise: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself may have to be left unanalyzed and undefined. This process of comparison, of recognizing in one form a definite permutation or deformation of another, apart altogether from a precise and adequate understanding of the original “type” or standard of comparison, lies within the immediate province of mathematics and finds its solution in the elementary use of a certain method of the mathematician. This method is the Method of Coordinates, on which is based the Theory of Transformations. The most well-known example of this ideas is when is some child has disappeared, say three years ago, and one publishes some photo of his face, transformed (usually using splines), into what he might look like today.
