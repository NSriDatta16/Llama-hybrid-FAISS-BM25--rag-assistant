time_select() helper + jQuery UI datepicker

I have a form with a time_select and a jquery datepicker, I want to be able when I submit the form to merge the values of the time_Select and the datepicker into one datetime of my ActiveRecord model ... Is there an elegant way to do that ? Should I do it client or server side ... I'd like to keep my action as simple as that : def create @drive = Drive.new(params[:drive])) if @drive.save flash[:notice] = 'Drive created !' render :action => :show else render :action => :new end end I don't know ... should I do it with virtual attributes in the model and merge them before_save or maybe in javascript when the form is submit or maybe you have a better idea ... What do you think ?? Thanks, Mike.
