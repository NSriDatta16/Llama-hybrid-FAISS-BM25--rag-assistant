sum wants a starting value, which is 0 by default, but 0 can't be added to a timedelta so you get the error. You just have to give sum a timedelta() as the start value: # this is the average return sum(delta_list, timedelta()) / len(delta_list) To print it out you can do this: print str(some_delta) If you want something customized you can get some_delta.days and some_delta.seconds but you have to calculate everything between.
