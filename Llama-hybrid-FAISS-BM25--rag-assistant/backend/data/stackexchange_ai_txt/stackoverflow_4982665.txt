Saving to localStorage not working in Firefox and IE

I've been playing with this code, and I admit that I really don't know what I need to do to get it to work in Firefox or IE. Works great in Webkit and Opera. I can do basic HTML and CSS, but I'm clueless when it comes to JavaScript. I ran the code through jslint and it validated. A general idea of what I'm doing; I have a form name="f" , textarea onkeyup="doSetItem();" with some dummy text, save link onclick="addTodo(); return false;" . When you click save, the textarea text should be saved to a hidden div. For the sake of brevity, I included a link to a fiddle I created that can be tested in all browsers. Any help would be greatly appreciated! jsfiddle.net
