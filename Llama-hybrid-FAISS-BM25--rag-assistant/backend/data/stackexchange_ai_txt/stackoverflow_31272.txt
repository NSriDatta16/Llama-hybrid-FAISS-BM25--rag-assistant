For organization, use namespaces as already stated. For global data I like to use the singleton pattern because it helps with the problem of the unknown initialization order of static objects. In other words, if you use the object as a singleton it is guaranteed to be initialized when its used. Also be sure that your static functions are stateless so that they are thread safe.
