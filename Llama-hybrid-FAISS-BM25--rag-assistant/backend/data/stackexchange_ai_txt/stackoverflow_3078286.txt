I have done that in my project. The trick is that photos need a column that will be used in has_one condition to distinguish between primary and secondary photos. Pay attention to what happens in :conditions here. has_one :photo, :as => 'attachable', :conditions => {:photo_type => 'primary_photo'}, :dependent => :destroy has_one :secondary_photo, :class_name => 'Photo', :as => 'attachable', :conditions => {:photo_type => 'secondary_photo'}, :dependent => :destroy The beauty of this approach is that when you create photos using @post.build_photo , the photo_type will automatically be pre-populated with corresponding type, like 'primary_photo'. ActiveRecord is smart enough to do that.
