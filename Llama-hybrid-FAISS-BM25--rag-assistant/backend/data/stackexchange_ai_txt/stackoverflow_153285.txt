Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - A. Einstein One of the most misunderstood things about TDD is the first word in it. Test. That's why BDD came along. Because people didn't really understand that the first D was the important one, namely Driven. We all tend to think a little bit to much about the Testing, and a little bit to little about the driving of design. And I guess that this is a vague answer to your question, but you should probably consider how to drive your code, instead of what you actually are testing; that is something a Coverage-tool can help you with. Design is a quite bigger and more problematic issue.
