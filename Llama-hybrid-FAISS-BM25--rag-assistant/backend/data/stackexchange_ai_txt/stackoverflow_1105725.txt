Thanks everyone for your answers. They have been very helpful. While I was thinking about my model a little bit more, I sketched something new that I think would be better. My thinking was this: When a user logs into the site the system finds their account and then returns a list of organizations they are apart of and it gets this info from the user_organizations object. When a user clicks on one of the organizations they are apart of it directs them to the organization's control panel. The selected organization then looks up that user's role in its org_user_details to know what access the user should have to that organizations control panel. Does that make sense? :) I feel like that would be good in a model but I'm having some doubts about the DB implementation. I know I shouldn't even worry about it but I can't break my bad habit yet! You can see that there is kind of duplicate data in the user_organizations object and the org_user_details object. I'm not a DB pro but is that a bad DB design? Should I instead combine the data from user_organizations and org_user_details into a table like the one in my first post and just tell NHibernate that User looks at it as a Many-to-Many relationship and Organization looks at it as a One-to-Many relationship? That sounds like I'm tricking the system. Sorry if I seemed really confused about this. What are your thoughts on this? Am I over thinking this? :P
