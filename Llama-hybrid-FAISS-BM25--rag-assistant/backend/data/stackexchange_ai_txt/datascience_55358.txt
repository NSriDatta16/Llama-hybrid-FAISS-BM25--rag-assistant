Keep in mind that Accuracy is not the perfect evaluation metric in Multi-Label Learning. The reason is simple, as you also mentioned in your question. Predicting 5 from 6 correctly is far better than predicting 0 from 6. There are different metrics to use in MLL. MicroPrecision - MicroRecall You can try Micro-Precision and/ord Micro-Recall. What you do in that case, is to calculate the Precision (or Recall) for each class and then get the average of those values. Hamming Loss Another metric is the Hamming Loss which is the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted If you still need to improve your model, then you can try another approach on how you design it. For example, you can use a Classifier Chain For each label you have and you need to predict, you create one Binary Classification Model. For example, a Random Forest. For the first label, you use all the features and you try to predict just the first label. For the second one, you use your features + the prediction of the first label. For the third, the features + the predictions of both first and second label.
