My approach would be to leverage some variant of hierarchical modeling. This seems like a natural approach given that students are nested within schools. The hierarchical structure would have an advantage over GLMs (treating the schools as factors in ANOVA) in that it would shrink the errors substantially. A good, education-centric introduction is Judith Singer's pdf Using SAS PROC MIXED to Fit Multilevel Models, Hierarchical Models, and Individual Growth Models . Forget that it has SAS in the title, it's just a great, brief intro to this class of HLMs, available here: https://www.ida.liu.se/~732G34/info/singer.pdf The difference between your model and hers is that your dependent variable is 0,1 for Pass/Fail where her DVs are grades and test scores (for the most part). In addition, depending on how "rare" failing students are, you may need to integrate zero-inflated considerations into your model. At this point, the issues do become software specific in terms of how you deal with these challenges.
