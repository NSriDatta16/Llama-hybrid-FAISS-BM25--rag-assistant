yield return and return

I often find myself writing sth. like this: if (condition) { yield return whatever; yield break; } I find it quite verbose to have to use two yield statements for the standard paradigm "return one value and exit method". I know I can just return new List () { whatever }; but that would defeat the benefit of using yield in the rest of the method. Is there a more elegant way to yield return a value and exit the method?
