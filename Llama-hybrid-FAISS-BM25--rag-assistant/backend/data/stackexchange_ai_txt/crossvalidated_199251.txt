NEVER use downsampling to make a method work. If the method is any good it will work under imbalance. Removal of samples is not scientific. Logistic regression works well under extreme imbalance. Also (1) logistic regression is not a classification method, (2) make sure you use proper accuracy scoring rules, and (3) logistic regression is not a multivariate (multiple dependent variables) method. It is a multivariable regression method.
