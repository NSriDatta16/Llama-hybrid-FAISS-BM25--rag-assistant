What can be a robust model validation strategy for time series modelling?

I am working on time series data where I am using FB Prophet algorithm. I am willing to build a dashboard to produce validation results to my clients. What could be a possible model validation strategy, keeping in mind that I want to present the status of the model in the form of a Red-Amber-Green (RAG) status.
