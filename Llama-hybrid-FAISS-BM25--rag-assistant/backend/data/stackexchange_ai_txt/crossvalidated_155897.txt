Interpreting main effects in the presence of an interaction in logistic regression

I am carrying out logistic regression to determine which factors affect whether lasers are effective bird deterrent devices. In my model, a success (1) is when a bird flies away and a failure (0) is when they do not. I built a model, but I am having some trouble interpreting it. In my model, I have: Laser colour (categorical, 2 levels) Light (continuous) Light x laser colour From the beta coefficient for laser colour, I calculated an odds ratio for laser colours and found that colour A is 6x better than colour B. The statement that colour A is more effective than colour B is consistent over all light levels, but the magnitude of this difference changes (as evidenced by the interaction term in the model). I determined (from plotting predicted probabilities) that the lasers are very similar when it is dark (both effective) and bright (both not effective) but differ at intermediate light levels. My question is: Does it make any sense to interpret the odds ratio from the laser colour main effect? Can interpret the 6x as the average difference, or the maximum difference, or is it not meaningful at all in the presence of the interaction?
