logistic regression when data consists of shared and non-shared variables

Could someone point me toward a specific method to model data that consists of two groups of observations having the same dependent variable and sharing some explanatory variables, BUT also having explanatory variables that are defined for one group and not for another? A situation like this: binary dependent var: y shared explanatory variables for all groups: x1 and x2 if group=1, then x3 and x4 are among explanatory variables if group=2, then x5 and x6 are among explanatory variables My first reaction was to interact the group variable with the non-shared variables, but I don't think that's a good idea. I appreciate any hints and clues.
