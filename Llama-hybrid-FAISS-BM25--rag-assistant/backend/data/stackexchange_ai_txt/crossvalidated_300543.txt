If each neuron in a neural network is basically a logistic regression function, why multi layer is better?

I'm going thru the Cousera's DeepAI course (Week3 video 1 "Neural Networks Overview") and Andrew Ng is explaining how each layer in a neural network is just another logistic regression, but he doesn't explain how it makes thing more accurate. So in a 2 layer network, how does calculating logistic multiple times make it more accurate?
