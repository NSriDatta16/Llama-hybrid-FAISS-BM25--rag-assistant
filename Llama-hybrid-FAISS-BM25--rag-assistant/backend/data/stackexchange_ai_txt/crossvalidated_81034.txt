Through the predictSurvProb -function you use the model to predict the survival probability (probability to be alive at that specific timepoint) for each individual at each timepoint you enter in the times -argument. Theoretically, if the model predictions would perfectly correspond to the observed situation, the predicted survival probability would be 0 for an observation who died before the particular timepoint for which you want the prediction. However, in reality this is never the case and the model provides you with a predicted probability between 0 and 1 which is most likely for a given combination of covariables. Thus, for individual observations, the predicted suvival probability for 1 person will never be equal to the observed probability as the latter is either 0 (death) or 1 (alive). However, depending on how well your model performs, the predicted probabilities should correspond to the observed probabilities on a group/population level. (E.g. for observations with a certain combination of predictor values, on average, the predicted survival probabilities should correspond to the observed survival (KM-estimates)). This is also why you will have to validate your model by assessing the predictive performance. For discrimination see the functions cindex -from the pec -package or validate from the rms -package. To evaluate the calibration it is advisable to make a calibration plot. Futhermore, to assess the clinical benefit of a model you could consider decision curve analyses (see paper by Vickers and this overview paper ). For further reading also see the books by Harrell and Steyerberg . P.S. There is no need to take quantiles for your timepoints, just enter c(24,48,72,96,120) in the times -argument when calling predictSurvProb .
