I can see no downside to embedding server-generated .js files. I personally would choose the "custom route" option so it's clear it's a generated file, leaving the .js extension to static resources. However, serving the markers in a pure data format like JSON, and loading them using Ajax would have the advantages that you have the data in a neutral "meta format" that you can re-use elsewhere without having to build a new data source you can keep the Loading / HTML generating process in one place, the parent page or one of its static scripts, instead of controlling the way the HTML looks in the server-side script the amount of transferred data is probably reduced It's cleaner overall
