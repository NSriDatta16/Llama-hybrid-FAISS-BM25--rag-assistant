Organizing css for large sites

I have a more general design question relating to css and websites. I know that it is good computer science to normalize code as much as possible and avoid duplication. So it would stand to reason to me, at least in theory that one would do the same when organizing stylesheets for a website. So when I started on my most recent website I started out with this same philosophy. It worked ok for my first few pages and while I was only testing in firefox... However as my site grew and as I added pages, multiple layouts (and browsers) I found this philosophy broke down really quickly. Ultimately over time I have moved to the following approach: I have a very limited top level css file for each master page layout in my site, it contains classes for well known styles across that layout as well as css for the master page. I keep specific css styles for each page. I keep specific css styles for embeddable page elements / controls I ended up taking this route so that I could trust that changes on one page wouldn't accidentally break other pages in the site resulting in a lot of regression bugs. What do other people do when approaching this? Is this a good / bad approach... I do see cons to this approach, some pages are very similar so making a significant change means changing more css code, I also feel that the pro's outweigh this on a daily basis. What do other developers think about this philosophy? Good? Bad? Just curious really... To me its one of those situations where I weighed the difference between my ideals (I try to keep very tight code), and the frustration of changing requirements on one page breaking 20 other pages because I changed a div width by a few pixels (upsetting a float on another page for instance). Thanks for your input
