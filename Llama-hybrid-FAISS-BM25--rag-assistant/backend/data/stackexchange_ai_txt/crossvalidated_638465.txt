Need help deciding about regression or appropriate statistic

I need to check if presence/absence of repetitions on a verbal test occur due to frequency of external distractions, frequency of self-distractions, or a count of words spoken from original word to the repetition word. There are also scores of general cognition, education years and gender which could be considered as probable contributing factors. Update: I did a binomial logistic regression first. The DV was 1 and 0 coding for presence/absence of repetition (across three groups), and the IV was separate counts of self and external distractions, education yrs, overall cognitive score. Now my professor would like me to analyze, among those had repetitions (for three groups), can we check which of the factors contributes most towards repetition: 1.words between original word and repetition, 2.internal distrators, 3.external distractors, and education (not necessary). Could some please let me know the next possible steps?
