You are trying to find an estimate of any individual's chance to win a medal, knowing that the "data" we have is just the number by country. It's a great question a fair solution being closer to the spirit of Olympics. Basically, this is a statistical problem which is well approximated by your method as the average number (frequency) of medals (for each color) relative to the population. But how reliable is this method? This is pretty close to the problem of estimating the reliability of a binomial toss from different number of throws which has applications for instance to compare the quality of resellers in Amazon based on different feedback numbers (see this thorough explanation ). In this particular case, the population number is always enough to make the approximation of the beta distribution with a normal - such that it is certainly possible to compare the significativity of each estimate for each country.
