nodeValue from DOMDocument returning weird characters in PHP

So I'm trying to parse HTML pages and looking for paragraphs ( ) using get_elements_by_tag_name('p'); The problem is that when I use $element->nodeValue , it's returning weird characters. The document is loaded first into $html using curl then loading it into a DOMDocument. I'm sure it has to do with charsets. Here's an example of a response: "aujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui". Thanks in advance.
