Well, one method would be to do a fetch for specific value. That returns just a dictionary and I'm pretty sure it won't trigger all the notifications associated with fetching faults or objects. You should be able to extract just the one date you want without setting off all the bells and whistles. However, I've never tested that in this particular circumstance. Another approach would be to create the managedObject directly i.e. just like a non-managedObject, populate the attribute as you want and only then insert the managedObject into the context. Not very elegant but it will work and it won't set off a bunch of notifications. Some Core Data hands write their own insertion class methods for their NSManagedObject subclass. You might want to employ that here. E.g. +(OrderMO *) insertOrderMOIntoManagedObjectContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *) aContext{ OrderMO *newOrder=[[OrderMO alloc] init]; // pefrom fetch on aContext to find the next order date newOrder.orderDate=//... fetched order date [aContext insertObject:newOrder]; }
