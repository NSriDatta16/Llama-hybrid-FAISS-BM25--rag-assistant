I'd agree with your philospohy but if it was me I'd probably call the class CsvFile and have a Parse method in addition to the Scan one. In OO programming it's always desireable to make your classes represent "things" (nouns in English). That aside if I was asked to maintain your code I'd grasp what a CsvParser class is likely to be doing whereas MyFileScan would send me into fits of rage and cause me to have to read the code to work it out.
