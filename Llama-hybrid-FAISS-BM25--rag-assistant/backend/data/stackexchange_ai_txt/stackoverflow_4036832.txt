Replacing a *specific* term in an XML file

I want to replace the text PATHTOEXPORT with the contents of a variable passed on the command-line that would have a folder path in it (for example, /Dev_Content/AIX/Apache ) I came across this article that discusses how to use sed to replace a value in an XML file with another. However, not having used sed before, I'm unsure how to read the directions. The script is as follows: # Check that exactly 3 values were passed in if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then echo 1>&2 “This script replaces xml element’s value with the one provided as a command parameter \n\n\tUsage: $0 ” exit 127 fi echo "DEBUG: Starting... [Ok]\n" echo "DEBUG: searching $1 for tagname and replacing its value with '$3'" # Creating a temporary file for sed to write the changes to temp_file="repl.temp" # Elegance is the key -> adding an empty last line for Mr. “sed” to pick up echo ” ” >> $1 # Extracting the value from the element el_value=`grep “ .* ” $1 | sed -e “s/^.* ”| cut -f1 -d” - '$el_value'" # Replacing elemen’s value with $3 sed -e “s/ $el_value / $3 /g” $1 > $temp_file # Writing our changes back to the original file ($1) chmod 666 $1 mv $temp_file $1 Is there a better way to do what I need to do? Can I do it in situ rather than using an intermediate file?
