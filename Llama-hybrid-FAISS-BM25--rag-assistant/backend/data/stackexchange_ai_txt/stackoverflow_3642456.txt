KeyDown event and drag'n'drop

Can i capture keyDown event when user drops a file on application icon in the dock? For example, if user drops on application icon some files, that's handle with "method_one". And if user drops on application icon some files and holding the option key, that's handle with "method_two". And all "UI" in this application it's just a dock icon. No windows, panels etc. thanks
