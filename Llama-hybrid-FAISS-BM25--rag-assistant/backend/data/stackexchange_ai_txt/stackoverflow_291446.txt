I think part of the reason has to do with the limited options for human interaction that most web apps offer (unless you get fancy). For instance, I used to work at a company that made healthcare software, and we had a heck of a time getting the users to understand right-clicking and drag-and-drop. So, for every action in the program, we had to have a right-click menu option, icon in the toolbar, and menu option such as File->Options->Export. In a web app, it seems like most of the time, you've got two options - either a link or a button (sure, I understand you can do everything that any thick app does, but I'm just saying most of the time, you only run into buttons and links). Because of this, it seems like a lot of users have less trouble figuring out web apps. They just look for the button labeled "Save" and click it. Therefore, those users prefer the web apps, because they see them as easier to use. And, since the nature of web apps also means that a lot of times you navigate away from a page that has any kind of menu on it (there is usually not a "File, Edit, Help" menu at the top of every page), there is less noise for them to get confused by. They just look at a page, which is full of fields and dropdowns, and see two little buttons at the bottom, labeled "Save" or "Cancel". It's rare that I see a thick app that is restricted to that level.
