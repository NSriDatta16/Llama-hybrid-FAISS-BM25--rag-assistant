Try Function Point Analysis . For CRUD stuff it gives good ballpark figures. It's main advantage is that it's based not on what you are going to implement, but on what the user has asked for. You'll need to find out what your FP productivity is, though. You can use past projects in the same language to do that. You could use average productivity for the target language if you just can't build a historical dataset. It will give you something, not necessarily approaching reality, but will at least let you compare efforts for different projects. Now, mind you FPA is bad on algorithmically-heavy software, and it relies on AVERAGES, meaning you'll probably overestimate or underestimate each project.
