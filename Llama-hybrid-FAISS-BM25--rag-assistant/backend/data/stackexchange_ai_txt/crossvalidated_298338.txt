caret package offers variable importance for neural network models along with others. You can refer to this here which says: Neural Networks: The method used here is based on Gevrey et al (2003), which uses combinations of the absolute values of the weights. For classification models, the class-specific importances will be the same. It also includes feature selection by Recursive Feature: Recursive Feature Elimination: Variable importance is computed using the ranking method used for feature selection. For the final subset size, the importances for the models across all resamples are averaged to compute an overall value. Here's what you can do : library(caret) # varimp control
