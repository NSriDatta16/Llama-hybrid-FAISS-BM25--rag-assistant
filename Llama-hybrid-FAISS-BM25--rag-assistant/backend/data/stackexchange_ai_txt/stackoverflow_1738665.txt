Showing only the uptime from uptime [unix]

I'd like to trim the output from uptime 20:10 up 23 days, 3:28, 3 users, load averages: 3.84 1.06 0.64 so that it just shows: 23 days I've tried using sed, but I'm not sure it's the right tool for the job, and don't have much experience using it. How can I achieve the output I want?
