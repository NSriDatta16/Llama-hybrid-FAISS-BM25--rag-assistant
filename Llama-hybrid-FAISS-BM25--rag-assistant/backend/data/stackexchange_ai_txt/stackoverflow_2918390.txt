I'm not too sure for Linux, but on Windows it's been explained that you can't ask the system to not interrupt you for several reasons (first paragraph mostly). Off my head, one of the reasons is hardware interrupts that can occur at any time and over which you have no control. EDIT Some guy just suggested the use of sched_yield then deleted his answer. It'll relinquish time for your whole process though. You can also use sched_setscheduler to hint the kernel about what you need.
