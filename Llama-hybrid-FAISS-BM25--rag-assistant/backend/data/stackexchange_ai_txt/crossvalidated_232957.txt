Darts is the simplest of games. Each player starts with a score of 501 and takes turns to throw 3 darts. The score for each turn is calculated and deducted from the players total. Bullseye scores 50, the outer ring scores 25 and a dart in the double or treble ring counts double or treble the segment score. Image from Now the probabilities have been examined elsewhere . On that site, we are told "A medium skilled darts player will have a larger standard deviation; even though the shots may, on average, be centered around the same target, they will be distributed over a broader region. A poor darts player will have a high standard deviation and their shots will be, probabilistically, scattered over a much wider region." That is, . Thus, to answer the question, we do what we always do. We build up a histogram of scores, and for the game itself we might use 501-score, and then we fit a density function, and then we test that density function against other players' density functions. So, we need enough data so that our location and its deviation have enough predictive power to discriminate properly between players. The less data, the more fuzzy the answers, and there is no magic number for it, the more the merrier.
