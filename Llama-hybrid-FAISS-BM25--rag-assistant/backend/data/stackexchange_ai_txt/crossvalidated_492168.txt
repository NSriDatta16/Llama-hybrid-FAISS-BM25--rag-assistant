The paper is clear enough, noise-tolerant learning, in this case, is about label noise . In this case the labels are medical diagnosis, in part decided automatically by some algorithm. Such decisions can be noisy so the labels will be noisy. So this is about learning algorithms which is robust against possible label noise. To give some context, the first part of the abstract of that paper is Objective Accurate electronic phenotyping is essential to support collaborative observational research. Supervised machine learning methods can be used to train phenotype classifiers in a high-throughput manner using imperfectly labeled data. We developed 10 phenotype classifiers using this approach and evaluated performance across multiple sites within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. And the paper 23 from the references is General Bounds on the Number of Examples Needed for Learning Probabilistic Concepts , which indeed contains theorems about classification noise (the term used in that paper.)
