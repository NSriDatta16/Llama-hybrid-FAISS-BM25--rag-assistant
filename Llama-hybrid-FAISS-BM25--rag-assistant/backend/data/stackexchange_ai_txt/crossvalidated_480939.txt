Is gradient descent scale invariant or not?

I know we should scale the input and output (assuming regression task) before we feed it to the neural network. Then the gradient descent will give the better minima much faster. But I have subtle confusion whether gradient descent with feature scale and without feature scale gives the same result or just gradient descent is not scale-invariant.
