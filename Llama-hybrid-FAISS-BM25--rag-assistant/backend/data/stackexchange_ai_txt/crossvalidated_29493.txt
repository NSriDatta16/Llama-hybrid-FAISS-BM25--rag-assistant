Great question!! On the top of my head, a consequence of the Markov property, is that conditionally on $X_{t-1}$, $X_t$ is independent of $X_{t-2}$, $X_{t-3}$, ... (this is used in Bayesian network modeling). So you can prove the Markov property if you can prove $P(X_t, X_{t-2}, X_{t-3}, ...|X_{t-1}) = P(X_t | X_{t-1}) P(X_{t-2} X_{t-3}, ....| X_{t-1})$ for every index. The only case that this will be (relatively easy) is if the variables are multivariate Gaussian. Otherwise it can be quite hard to to implement, especially if you observations are continuous. Still, you can use tests for independence such as $\chi^2$, or more advanced techniques based on Kullback-Leibler divergence as shows in this article for instance.
