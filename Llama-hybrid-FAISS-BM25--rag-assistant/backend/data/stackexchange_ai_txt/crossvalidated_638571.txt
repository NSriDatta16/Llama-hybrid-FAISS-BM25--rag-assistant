As long as you can write the null hypothesis clearly, the problem will be solved head-on... For a regression analysis with a dummy variable (categorical variable consisting of several groups), your attention is on the reference group and comparing other groups with it by t-test. For ANCOVA, your attention is on the entire factor (categorical variable), and check if this factor is significant by F-test (or LRT). After passing the test, people usually investigate further by a pairwise t-test with some correction, like Bonferroni correction. The difference between ANCOVA and ANOVA is just whether doing an adjustment of other covariates. As they said, if you do ANCOVA and regression on SPSS, you will get the same model. The only difference is how you do the inference (test) next. If people can realize that a t-test is also essentially a regression analysis (with some assumptions), then will easily distinguish modeling and inference...
