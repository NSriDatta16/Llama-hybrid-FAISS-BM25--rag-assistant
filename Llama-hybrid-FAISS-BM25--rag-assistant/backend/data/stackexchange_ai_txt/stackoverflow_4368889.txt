Few possible options: 1) On the binding inside DataTemplate, set the source to be the parent using ElementName, and bind using OneWayToSource. This will transfer the value from the binding target (the element inside the DataTemplate) to the binding source (the parent control) 2) Use a common object that both the DataTemplate and the control bind to. The DataTemplate will bind to it using OneWayToSource and the control will bind to it with OneWay. It can even be a resource, so you can access it from XAML. 3) Use RelativeSource and FindAncestor. 4) Use some kind of a routed event, and handle it at the control level. It will be fired from the data template by an attached behavior (google it!). The event will deliver the data and the event handler will set the relevant property on the control. Options 1,3 are similar to what you suggested. Options 2, 4 are different. In terms of elegancy, I prefer option 2. In addition - be aware of conflicts in all solutions. If the DataTemplate is instanciated many times inside a single control all the instances will attempt to set the property of the control. The effect will be the effect of the last executed set attempt and it can be problematic in some cases if you can't control their order. Alex.
