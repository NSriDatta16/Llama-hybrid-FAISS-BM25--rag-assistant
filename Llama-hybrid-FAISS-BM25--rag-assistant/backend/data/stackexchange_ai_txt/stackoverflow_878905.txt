It sounds like this isn't a content problem. Users don't see the spam, because the vast majority of the submissions are somehow mis-formatted. You've got a couple of options, depending on the control you have over your software: If you wrote the forum software, or are able/comfortable with modifying it, you could catch the most common exceptions that these broken submissions throw. (It sounds like you've already identified those exceptions.) You could write those exceptions to a different "spam log" or some such, which would allow you to do stats and reporting down the road. Using either the data from your spam log, or maybe even what you have currently logging, you could identify IPs or ranges that often send these bad submissions and block them at your firewall . If this is realy spamming, though, chances are that they have ways to get around it, since that's a pretty basic spam-blocking strategy. It's also possible that this isn't spam, but instead it's a bad browser. If you could add User-Agent information to the exception/spam logs , you might be able to trace that. You might get lucky and it might turn out that fixing your forms for IE5Mac or Mini Opera or something like that would not only prevent these exceptions but also bump your visitor numbers. Unless these submissions are making a measurable impact on the performance of your site, I don't think there's going much use in doing a lot more than that. Adding CAPTCHAs wouldn't prevent spam from being submitted, just from being successfully submitted (which it doesn't sound like is a problem right now). The only thing that's worth your time at this point is breaking the bad submissions into a separate log.
