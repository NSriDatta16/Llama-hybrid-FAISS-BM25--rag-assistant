A technique implemented where i work. For each user story write it on a piece of card with a heading.Get each person to take a card and write on it the number of hours they think it will take to complete. Get them to place the cards against the task without showing them to each other. Once you have all the results in look at the figures and see the top and bottom values.You will normally get figures quite close to each other. For those values way above or way below ask the developer or person with the input why they think it would take so long or so short compared to the average. Coming up with a concensus from the team as opposed to an individual means everyone gets their take on the task. This is an idea from a book I read on agile techniques and have forgotten the author to credit them with it.
