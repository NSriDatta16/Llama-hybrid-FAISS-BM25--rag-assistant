Mocking datetime was my first thought as well but as LaundroMat pointet out in his blog post himself, this is rather hacky and bad. I came up with another solution: I just gave up on .json fixtures. I don't even know why Django encourages to use them. They look ugly and they are impossible to maintain. Instead I added a module test_data.py to my fixtures folder. That module imports my models and defines some nice methods that create test-data for me. In my tests.py I dropped the fixtures = ['some_json_file'] line and added a setUp() method instead. This method executes my 'dynamic fixtures' from my test_data.py module. This is so simple and obvious that I wonder if there is anything wrong with this approach. If no one comments on this solution, I will mark is as accepted in a couple of weeks or so...
