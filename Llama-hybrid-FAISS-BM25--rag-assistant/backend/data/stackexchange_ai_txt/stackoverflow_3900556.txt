I know this is an old question, but I recently came up with something that, despite a severe lack of elegance, works beautifully. \catcode`~=11 % make LaTeX treat tilde (~) like a normal character \newcommand{\urltilde}{\kern -.15em\lower .7ex\hbox{~}\kern .04em} \catcode`~=13 % revert back to treating tilde (~) as an active character Now you can use \urltilde inside of a \url tag (even in a .bib file) and: 1) the URL will render perfectly; 2) clicking on the URL will take you to the correct address; and, 3) copy-paste will put the correct address in the clipboard. This is the only solution I have found that satisfies all three of these requirements. I hope it helps somebody out there.
