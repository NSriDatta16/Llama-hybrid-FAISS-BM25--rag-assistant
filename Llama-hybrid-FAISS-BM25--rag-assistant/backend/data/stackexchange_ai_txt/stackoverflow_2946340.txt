Visual Studio 2010 Web deployment task failed

I am trying to use VS2010's 1-Click Publish feature to deploy a test site from my laptop to my server. I have the firewall turned off on both machines and the MS Deployment Service is up and running on both my laptop and the server. However, when I try and publish from VS2010 on my laptop I get the following error: Error 1 Web deployment task failed.(Remote agent (URL https://192.168.1.181/:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=LocationsTest ) could not be contacted. Make sure the remote agent service is installed and started on the target computer.) The requested resource does not exist, or the requested URL is incorrect. Error details: Remote agent (URL https://192.168.1.181/:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=LocationsTest ) could not be contacted. Make sure the remote agent service is installed and started on the target computer. An unsupported response was received. The response header 'MSDeploy.Response' was '' but 'v1' was expected. The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found. 0 0 Test.Web Any idea what I am doing wrong here?
