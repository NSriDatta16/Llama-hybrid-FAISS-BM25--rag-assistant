NDepend, TestDriven and HostType

I'm making use of the TestDriven.NET plugin for visual studio to run all my tests to check for code coverage with NDepend. All is working fine apart from my tests with a HostType attribute. These aren't getting run. Does anybody knopw how to fix this or is there a specific reason for it? Thanks in advance
