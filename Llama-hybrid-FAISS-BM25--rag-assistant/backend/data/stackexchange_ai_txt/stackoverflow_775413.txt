Since you say, "Nothing too fancy here", I'm not sure you realize this: Your original code is broken; or if you're lucky it might not be broken right now, but it's quite fragile and will break as soon as someone does something more than look at the MySubType class. The problem is that you're passing a MyType* to foo() but it really points to an array of MySubType . If a MySubType object happens to be larger than a MyType object (which is pretty likely if you've added anything to the derived class), then the pointer arithmetic done in the foo() function will be incorrect. This is one of the serious and classic pitfalls of arrays of derived class objects.
