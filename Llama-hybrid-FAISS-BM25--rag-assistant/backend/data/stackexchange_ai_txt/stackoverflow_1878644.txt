You can define the reports once and have them scheduled to output to PDF, saved to the system to be viewed online or to a file system. The dates can be rolling (as in Last Week, Last Month) and so always deliver based on what you need. The design is drag-and-drop, the dashboards are interactive, the reports are available when you need them, and there is security to lock down access to the dashboards/reports and control of who can design dashboards/reports. The flexibility is surely there for whatever combination is needed.
