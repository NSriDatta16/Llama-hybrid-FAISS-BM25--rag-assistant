I realize that there are library constraints on this question, but for completeness if you have N points in an Nx2 numpy ndarray (2D system): from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist x = numpy.array([[9.5,7.5],[10.2,19.1],[9.7,10.2]]) mindist = numpy.min(pdist(x)) I always try to encourage people to use numpy/scipy if they are dealing with data that is best stored in a numerical array and it's good to know that the tools are out there for future reference.
