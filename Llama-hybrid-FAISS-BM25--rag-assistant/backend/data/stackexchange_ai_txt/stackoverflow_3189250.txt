Batch script to pngcrush all files in all subfolders

I have a folder structure with one main parent folder containing many subfolders, and in these some PNGs, something like: .../data .../data/013523/ .../data/345343/ .../data/395338/ .../data/013523/filex.png .../data/013523/filey.png .../data/345343/filea.png .../data/345343/fileb.png .../data/345343/filec.png I'd like to crush all these PNGs with a Windows batch-script knowing only the location of the parent data folder (ie the folder names and png names are unknown, it should just crush all PNGs in all folders). I took a look at Drag and drop batch file for multiple files? but this didn't seem to be quite what I was after. Oh and no fancy naming options required, crushing in-place is fine.
