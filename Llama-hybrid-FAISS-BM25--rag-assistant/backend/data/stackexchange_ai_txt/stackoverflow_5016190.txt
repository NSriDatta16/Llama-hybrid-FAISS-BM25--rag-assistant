From questions I asked in comments and their respective answers, the conclusion I offer is this: It seems to me that the server agent service may be set with a startup mode of Manual . This means the service will only start as and when required by an application: Manual starts a service as required or when called from an application (according to definition, but only some of the time in practice, depending on the service) To mitigate this you could create a custom install action which would, as part of your product installation, set this startup mode to Automatic - this would cause the service to start when Windows starts.
