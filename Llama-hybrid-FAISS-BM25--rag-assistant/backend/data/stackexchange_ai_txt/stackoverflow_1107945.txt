This gives the container, for example, the power to see an event before its children. This is useful in many cases, as e.g. disabling children, hover animations, drag'n'drop, selecting a parent container before continuing checking/clicking the child widget etc. In other words, IMO it's easier to create a new container for a custom UI behavior and preview the events (tunneling) that go to stock widgets, than to create custom widgets and using a stock container (bubbling).
