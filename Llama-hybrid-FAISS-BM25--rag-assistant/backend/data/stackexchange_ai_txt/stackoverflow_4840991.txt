I have a similar problem. I used SharePoint Designer 2007 to create the accordion on a basic page - but within each 'tab' I put a Web Part Zone (WPZ) holding a Content Editor Web Part (CEWP). Each CEWP has various kinds of content. The reason for putting CEWPs within each tab is so the client can change the text/images themselves whenever they want. However - the animation is craggy - and at the end of an expand or collapse action - the whole accordion sort of 'flashes' just before completion. Using straightforward html versions of the accordion work fine. I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that there is a lot more code accompanying each CEWP - but I could be wrong. Any insight by the experts would be appreciated.
