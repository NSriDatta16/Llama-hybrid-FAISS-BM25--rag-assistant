javascript code to analyze the url and generate the summary like google buzz?

I am using google buzz, one of it's functionalities is when I paste a URL into the input box, it will begin to fetch the url and generate a small summary box of that page. It basically consists of the title of the page, the images inside the page and possible the first paragraph of the page. I want to know how google did that? Is there any library that I can use in my website?
