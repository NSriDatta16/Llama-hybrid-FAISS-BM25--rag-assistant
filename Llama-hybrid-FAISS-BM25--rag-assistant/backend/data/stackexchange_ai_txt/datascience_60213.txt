Deploy local deep learning web app to web

So I've built a (relatively) simple web app with a deep learning image classifier, and I have it running on localhost. How do I upload this to the web so that I can link to it from my website? The usage will not be very high at all, but the model needs GPU so it would be better if it's a pay/hour used or something similar. What are the best services to use to do this (as cheap as possible)? Thanks!
