Actually, it has to be a balance between read and write. If you are OK with updating a bunch of rows on every insert, then nested set (or an equivalent) will give you easy, fast reads. Other than that, a simple FK on the parent will give you ultra-simple insert, but might well be a nightmare for retrieval. I think I'd go with the nested sets, but be careful about the expected data volume and usage patterns (updating several, maybe a lot of, rows on two indexed columns (for left and right info) for every insert might be a problem at some point).
