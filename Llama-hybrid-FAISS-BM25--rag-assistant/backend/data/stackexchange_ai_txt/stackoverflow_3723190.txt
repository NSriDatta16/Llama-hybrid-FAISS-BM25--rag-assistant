Don't replace / remove any binaries unless you are in dire need for storage. In that case too, the mileage is very little in removing them. You can simply make 3.1 as default with : defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 3.1 There are other ways to ensure that you use 3.1 by default, I have not used them though. export VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=3.1
