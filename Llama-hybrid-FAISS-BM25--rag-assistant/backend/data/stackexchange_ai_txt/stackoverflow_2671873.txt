If you are trying to set a way to auto log in (or similar) on the second site, and you control that site, you only really have one option (maybe there are more too I don't know about). Generate a nonce and store in db Associate the current date / time and the user agent with it Attach it to a link to the 2nd site via GET Now, when the 2nd site receives an inbound link with this GET param, it should Verify nonce exists Verify user agent hasn't changed Verify the time between nonce created and requested isn't too long (I go with 10 minutes). Delete nonce Be Warned This session could be hijacked, for example by some man in the middle. But the person that hijacks it must do all these things View the outgoing nonce Copy it and access the site before the original person does Have the same user agent string Keep that in mind. You could also check for the IP being constant, but this may cause some people to not be authenticated if their IP changes, and it won't help multiple people using the same external IP.
