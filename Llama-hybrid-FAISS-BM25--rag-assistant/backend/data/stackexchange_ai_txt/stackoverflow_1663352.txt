For C++ a lot of what you propose could be done using the macro functionality of the pre-compiler. For Java, it wouldn't be hard to use reflection to implement the above example. Your example is pretty sparse though. Can you give a use case for why you'd be interested in doing this? If you're just looking for a mechanism for setting up the initial state of your program, then what you want to look for is information on Inversion of Control . In Java, Spring is the big IoC library out there. I don't know what C++ equivalents there might be. I suspect C++'s lack of reflection functionality will make IoC much harder. EDIT: I didn't really read your last paragraph before. Serialization to and from XML can be accomplished a number of different ways, but in Java if you just want to be able to serialize and deserialize the state of an object JAXB is a library that allows this.
