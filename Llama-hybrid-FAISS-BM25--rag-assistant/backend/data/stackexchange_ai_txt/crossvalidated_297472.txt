I don't see how this is circular. RF predictions are the fraction of votes for a particular class. Those predictions can be ranked, and ROC analysis and AUC only cares about ranks of negatives and positives. By contrast, if you're solely making predictions by majority vote, you're implicitly making a number of assumptions which are not necessarily appropriate to whatever problem you're trying to solve. For example, you can have AUC = 1 if all positives are scored at 0.49 and all negatives at 0.48. For another, if you pay a very large cost for FPs, then you should select an operating point at a low FPR. Essentially every machine learning model (logistic regression, etc) are not classifiers , but yield some sort of score which, with a decision rule, can make binary decisions.
