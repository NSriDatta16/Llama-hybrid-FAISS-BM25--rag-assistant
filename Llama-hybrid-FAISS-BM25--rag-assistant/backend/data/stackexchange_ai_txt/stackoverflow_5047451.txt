How can I make JQuery.ajax synchronous with a timeout?

I have a calendar with data that is on the server. When the user moves forward by a month, I might (based on previous actions) need to fetch that data BEFORE I can display that month. My code handles the failure (404), but I can't make it deal with a timeout, because the call is synchronous. I know that timeout is ignored when the .ajax call is synchronous, what I want to know is how do I make a synchronous wait around the async call? I want properly deal with the timeout, but short of a spin loop, I don't know how to elegantly do this in javascript. I have a modal dialog over the page to stop clicks, I simply need to hold the user back until I can render the next month, or if a timeout happens, to prevent them moving to that month, since the data on that month isn't valid. I don't quite see how the jquery code is pulling this off...
