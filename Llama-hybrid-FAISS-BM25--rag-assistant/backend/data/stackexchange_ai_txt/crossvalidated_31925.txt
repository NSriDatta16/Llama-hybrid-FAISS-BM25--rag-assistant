Are there references for plotting binary time series?

Does anyone know of recommendations/references for plotting binary time series data? Or categorical time series data? I'm looking at win/loss records, and it seems like there should be plots that exploit the binary nature beyond just a simple line plot. Late edit: I'm familiar with Tufte's suggestions, especially those given in the sparklines chapter of Beautiful Evidence ( see whuber's answer below ). I'm interested in other references, particularly those that provide justification for their recommendations. Second edit: To clarify some of the questions in the comment... the key issue for me is the binary nature of the series. I'd be interested in references to anything that discusses special issues that come up when plotting binary (or categorical or ordinal variables in general) time series instead of interval/quantitative variables. Highly technical papers are fine, as are nontechnical books aimed at a popular audience. It's really the binary vs. general distinction that I'm interested in, and I don't know of any references beyond those listed in the answers below.
