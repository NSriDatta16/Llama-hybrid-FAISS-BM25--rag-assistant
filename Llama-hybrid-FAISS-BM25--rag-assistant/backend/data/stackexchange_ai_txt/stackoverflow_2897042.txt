I'm going to provide another vote for XNA. The comment that it's too "game centric" is a non-starter - it provides a rendering loop with feedback on how fast everything is running so you can adjust your rendering to try to maintain a specific framerate (if you want). This isn't particularly game-centric as it's something that most 3D applications should worry about. The only thing that's really unusually game-centric about it is that it provides easy access to game controllers. Feel free to ignore that bit if you don't want to use it. The only downside for you using XNA is your requirement that it be click'n'run, XNA has a redistributable that you have to worry about. Note that Win7 has this installed by default, but Vista and earlier don't. EDIT: XNA is made for applications that are strictly 3D. As such it doesn't natively support using typical windowing controls inside of an XNA project. But, there are ways around this... A few useful links.
