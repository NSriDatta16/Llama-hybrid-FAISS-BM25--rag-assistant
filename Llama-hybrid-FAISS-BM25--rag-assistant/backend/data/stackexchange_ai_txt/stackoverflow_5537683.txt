Diary Web Application

I'm developing a Diary application, currently at the beginning stage. With regards to OO, the Diary is an Object. Underneath the Diary would contain a Notebook and a Scheduler. Notebook: Contains a few paragraphs on today (life story etc) Scheduler: Contains ToDo, e.g. visit Dr at 9:30am. The question is would they both be Object separated from Diary in a UML? Or would they be part of the Diary? I imagine they'd be separate objects?
