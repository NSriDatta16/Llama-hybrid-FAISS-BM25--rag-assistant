How to translate shutter speed values into usable data?

I'm gathering light statistics of EXIF data for a large collection of photos and I'm trying to find the simplest way (i.e. performance doesn't matter) of translating Exposure Time values to/from usable data . There is (as far as I can find) no standard for what values camera manufacturers might use i.e. I can't just scan the web for random images and hard-code a map. Here are is a sample set of values I've encountered ( " indicates seconds): 279", 30", 5", 3.2", 1.6", 1.3", 1", 1/1.3, 1/1.6, 1/2, 1/2.5, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, 1/13, 1/8000, 1/16000 Also take into consideration that I'd also like to find the average (mean) ... but it should be one of the actual shutter speeds collected and not just some arbitrary number. EDIT: By usable data I mean some sort of creative? numbering system that I can convert to/from for performing calculations. I thought about just multiplying everything by 1,000,000 except some fractions when divided are quite exotic. EDIT #2: To clarify, I'm using ExposureTime instead of ShutterSpeed because it contains photographer friendly values e.g. 1/50. ShutterSpeed is more of an approximation (which varies between camera manufacturers) and leads to values such as 1/49.
