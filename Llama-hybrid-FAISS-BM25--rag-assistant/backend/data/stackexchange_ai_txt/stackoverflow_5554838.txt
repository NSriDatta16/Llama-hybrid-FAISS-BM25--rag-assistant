Assets on storage card

I have an application that stores a lot of data in the assets folder (html, audio, video, etc.). I use the file:///android_assets to access these files. But due to the apk size limitation of 50 MB imposed by the market I will be migrating these files to a storage card. Is it possible to install the application on phone memory and have the assets directory on the storage card, so that they can still be accessed using file protocol?
