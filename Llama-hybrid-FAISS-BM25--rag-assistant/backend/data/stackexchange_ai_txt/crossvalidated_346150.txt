Even if you include the term b4 in your model, as long as the model determines that this term is not significantly different from 0, then you can consider that the term in your model is 0, for simplification. Hence your simplified model in your case would be: Performance ~ a + b1 * drugA And you interpret it as: the average performance for subjects when not taking drugA is a (which means this is the performance in the saline and drugB conditions), and the average performance for subjects when taking drugA is a + b1 . To obtain this, simply replace drugA by 0 or 1, depending on the condition. Now, if b4 came out significant, then you would need to include the interaction effect in your model: Performance ~ a + b1 * drugA + b4 * drugA x uncertainty Now, using the same logic as before, we can replace drugA and uncertainty by real values depending on the conditions. When drugA == 0 , so patient either have the saline solution or the drug B, then your model equates to Performance ~ a + b1 * 0 + b4 * 0 x uncertainty Performance ~ a Now, when drugA == 1 , we end up with Performance ~ a + b1 * 1 + b4 * 1 x uncertainty Performance ~ a + b1 + b4 * uncertainty To further understand this, you would need to make uncertainty vary, but basically: when uncertainty == 0 then you end up in the situation earlier, and you obtain the average score when participants take drugA and the task uncertainty is 0. When uncertainty is different from 0, then you start adding up a certain value b4 proportionally to uncertainty . If you want to say that in English, you would say that drugA has an impact on Performance , and that the uncertainty has an impact only under the drugA condition and no impact otherwise.
