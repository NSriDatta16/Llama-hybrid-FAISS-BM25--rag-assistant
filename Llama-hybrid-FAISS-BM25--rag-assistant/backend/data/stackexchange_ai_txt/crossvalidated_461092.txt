Variable Importance values from Random Forest into PCA

I intend to do some analyses on the relationship between tree growth (chronological series of values indicating the yearly increase in stem radius) and climatic variables. An important point is also to determine if different species have different growth/climate relationship. One common approach in the field is to use bootstrapped response function ( https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450%281971%29010%3C0845%3AMTFSTG%3E2.0.CO%3B2 ) to calculate response coefficients. Those response coefficients are then introduced into a Principal Component Analysis. The PCA aims at reducing data dimensionality while retaining as much of the original variation as possible, thus allowing to see if different variables are grouped together and if such grouping discriminates the species. For an example of such method, see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.06.001 . In my case, given that I expect to see strongly non-linear climate-growth relationship, I was wondering if I could use Regression Random Forest models to calculate Variable Importance values for each climatic variable and then introduce those VIMP values in a PCA. Are VIMP values suited for this? To be more precise, RF models would be calculated for each of my 31 study sites separetaley and then, the VIMP values would be introduced into a PCA to discover spatial patterns of growth-climate relationship and differences between species.
