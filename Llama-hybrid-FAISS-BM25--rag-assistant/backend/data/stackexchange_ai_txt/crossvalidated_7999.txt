How to efficiently repeat a function on a data set in R?

Let's say I have a function funToRepeat : funToRepeat I want to operate funToRepeat on dfTest (a toy data set), multiple times, say n . dfTest How would I do this and average the n outputs of funToRepeat in R , efficiently? A very bad example with n=10 may be: dfAvg Please notice, I am not trying to bootstrap. I want to operate funToRepeat on my data set and take the average of the n outputs. I want to do this as I am adding err , a random term, to my data.frame and want to provide a reasonable answer. (I am not doing exactly this in real life, but something very similar)
