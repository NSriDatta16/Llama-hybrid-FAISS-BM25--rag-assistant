Sales Predictions Over Time

I'd like to model the evolution of the sales of a store. Here are the data I have : Customers are aggregated into monthly cohort depending on the date of the first purchase eg : customers who did their 1st purchase in Jan 2015 are in the cohort 1, customers who did their 1st purchase in Fev 2015 are in the cohort 2. Sales : aggregated for each Month * Cohort (cohort 4 is not visible because there is no line for only 1 record) if we put all the cohorts at the same origin: Question: How to predict the spending of the next 2 months, ie : the spending of the cohort 1 in its aging 5 and 6 the spending of the cohort 2 in its aging 4 and 5 the spending of the cohort 3 in its aging 3 and 4 the spending of the cohort 4 in its aging 2 and 3 But also for the cohort who don't exist yet : the spending of the cohort 5 in its aging 1 and 2 the spending of the cohort 6 in its aging 1 I have 2 methodologies in mind, but don't know if they're good: Polynomial regression by using 2 parameters: aging: because there is a clear evolution over the time, up then down. cohort number: because more recent cohort seems to spend less. Time series : I didn't perform time series recently I'm a bit rust so I would prefer to use something else but I think it could fit with this problem. Indeed it seems obvious that y t-1 t in y t-2 ... are good predictors of y t but how to predict spending of future cohort with no history ?
