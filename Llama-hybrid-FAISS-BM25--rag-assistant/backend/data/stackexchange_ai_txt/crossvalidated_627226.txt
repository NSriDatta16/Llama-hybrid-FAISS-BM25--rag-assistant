You don't need to generate the random predictions. You may want to do this if you would like to simulate the distribution of possible outcomes, e.g. for different $X$ 's draw at random multiple predictions. Predicting the probability $p(y|X)$ and taking this as a prediction is perfectly fine. See, for example, the Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? thread. Many people would argue that this is the most reasonable thing to do. Alternatively, if you need a binary classification, you can use a threshold such that if the probability is larger than some value, you predict one outcome, otherwise another.
