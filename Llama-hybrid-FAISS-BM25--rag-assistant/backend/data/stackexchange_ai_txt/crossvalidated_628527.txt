As your sample size is quite large, have you considered using $\bar{x}$ with s-chart? Remember that R-chart were developed at a time when the standard deviation formula was known but it was hard to compute by hand. That is the reason the range statistics was as an alternative for control chart theory. I think, before the application of control charts, you need to test for noncorrelation of your data. Since is a time series it is possible that autocorrelation is playing an important role in your analysis. If your data is correlated can't be used to set up control charts. In R software acf or pacf functions could do the job.
