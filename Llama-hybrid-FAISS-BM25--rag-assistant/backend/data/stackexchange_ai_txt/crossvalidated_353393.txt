Linear or logistic regression with aggregated data

I'm kind of stuck on a simple question: I have aggregated data over 15 years for each year how many people in a patient group have received a certain medication X (1105 with X from 2566 patients total in 2016...). The question is now is there a trend? In a similar paper, a logistic regression was calculated and an odds ratio reported. I'm not sure how to calculate a logistic regression from this aggregated data?!? I would have simply calculated a simple linear regression over the relative frequencies (the total number of patients treated varies from year to year)? What would be a correct handling of this kind of data? | drug X . | All Patients| year | |------------|-------------|--------------| | 1394 | 1491 | 2001 | | 1463 | 1544 | 2002 | | 1492 | 1585 | 2003 | | 1511 | 1587 | 2004 | | 2041 | 2146 | 2005 | | 2271 | 2383 | 2006 |
