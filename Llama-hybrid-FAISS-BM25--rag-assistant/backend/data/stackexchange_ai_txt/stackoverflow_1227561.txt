CGI script not executing every page visit

I have a CGI script that generates a file on the server and then redirects the browser to that newly generated file. #!/bin/bash printf "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; cat /myspecialdir/foo > /httpd/foo.html echo " " echo " " echo " " echo " " The file /myspecialdir/foo contains some dynamic content that I want to be in /httpd/foo.html. I then want the script to redirect there after the generation of the new file. The problem I have is that the script doesn't get new data on every hit from a browser. For example, if I visit http://myip/cgi-bin/genfoo.cgi the first time in IE the data gets generated and it gets redirected to foo.html. After that, if I go to the CGI page using the back button, it doesn't re-run and I get redirected to stale data. How can I force the CGI script to execute even from the back button? EDIT : I tried doing this with the HTTP headers approach, but this doesn't seem to be working. Here's the new script, am I missing something? #!/bin/bash cat /myspecialdir/foo > /httpd/foo.txt printf "Pragma-directive: no-cache\n\n"; printf "Cache-directive: no-cache\n\n"; printf "Cache-control: no-cache\n\n"; printf "Pragma: no-cache\n\n"; printf "Expires: 0\n\n"; printf "Location: /foo.txt\n\n"; printf "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; All this does when I visit via IE is to print the headers in the page, like so: Pragma-directive: no-cache Cache-directive: no-cache Cache-control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Expires: 0 Location: /BACtrace.txt Content-type: text/html EDIT: It turns out this was an issue with the HTTP server I was using (busybox v1.12.1). I was unable to send the HTTP headers as originally recommended, but I was able to get this to work with a combination of META tags and a setting in IE8 (Tools --> Internet Options --> Browsing History --> Settings Button --> check "Every time I visit a website"). The META tags I used are: echo " " echo " " echo " " echo " " echo " " echo " "
