HashMap copy all the keys into HashMap and initialize values to zero

What is the best way ? Just looping through and putting the key and zero, or is there another more elegant or existing library method. I am also using Google's guava java library if that has any useful functionality ? Wanted to check if there was anything similar to the copy method for lists, or Map's putAll method, but just for keys.
