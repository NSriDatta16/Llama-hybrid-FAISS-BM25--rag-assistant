Here's the steps that finally worked for me. I wanted to get the working with RemoteAgent, but couldn't get that working no matter what I tried. You don't have to do exactly like this, but this is how I got it working Configure WMSVC Make sure the service is started Configure an IIS user (click on the TOP MOST SERVERNAME in IIS) and go to 'IIS Manager Users'. I suggest making it different to your windows name. Make sure the user account for WMSVC (LOCAL SERVICE for me) has write permissions to the IIS directory you're using In my case I'm using an SSL certificate (even though it is hitting localhost). Remember these are all arguments to MSBUILD added within the TFS Build definition /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:DeployTarget=MSDeployPublish /p:MSDeployPublishMethod=WMSVC /p:MsDeployServiceUrl=https://staging.example.com:8172/msdeploy.axd /p:username=sweaveriis /p:password=abcd1234 /p:DeployIisAppPath=staging.example.com/virtual_directory_name /p:AllowUntrustedCertificate=True Note: staging.example.com is actually the local box with a hosts file entry pointing to 127.0.0.1. Localhost would probably work here too. Useful articles: Troubleshooting MSDeploy issues More troubleshooting
