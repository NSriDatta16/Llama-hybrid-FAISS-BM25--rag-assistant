Use an object (key/value pairs, the nearest JavaScript has to an associative array) for this and not the array object. Other than that, I believe that is the most elegant way var foo = {}; foo['alfa'] = "first item"; foo['beta'] = "second item"; for (var key in foo) { console.log(key); } Note: JavaScript doesn't guarantee any particular order for the properties. So you cannot expect the property that was defined first to appear first, it might come last. EDIT: In response to your comment, I believe that this article best sums up the cases for why arrays in JavaScript should not be used in this fashion - "Associative Arrays" considered Harmful
