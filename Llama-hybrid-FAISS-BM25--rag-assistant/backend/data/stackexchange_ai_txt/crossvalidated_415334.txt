Even though I am currently not familiar with brms , logically speaking you are fitting a mixed effects logistic regression. In this case the intercept is the log odds when Cond is zero, and the coefficient for Cond is the log odds ratio between Cond=1 and Cond=0 . Note though that the interpretation of these coefficients is conditional on the random intercepts you have included; for more information on this check here . In your output these coefficients are quite large in magnitude (i.e., to transform to the more easily interpretable scale of odds and odds ratio you need to exponentiate them). This in combination with the behavior you have observed from the different priors suggests that you potentially have a separation issue. In this case, a stronger prior for the fixed effects coefficients is preferable, e.g., the $\mathcal N(0, 1)$ you have tried or a Studentâ€™s t prior with mean zero, scale parameter one, and three degrees of freedom.
