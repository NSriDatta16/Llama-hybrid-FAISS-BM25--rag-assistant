If the interactions are using touchesbegan: and touchesmoved: then use a UIView instead of a UIButton . A button is a UIControl, and the way to interact with UIControls is - (void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents. I'm not sure this two ways of getting events mix well.
