Detecting Ramping Events for Wind Power Time Series in R

I'm working with a dataset that spits out a power generation reading from a wind turbine every 5 minutes. Because of the variability in wind speeds the plotted time series are very jumpy, with lots of movement up and down... I want to characterize all ramp events ( steep up or down movements in power production) above a certain threshold, like 40% increase or decrease of rated power over x amount of time, but I'm having trouble thinking through how to accomplish this. I would also like to be able to change the threshold to vary the sensitivity of what constitutes a ramp. Here is an example time series from 2015:
