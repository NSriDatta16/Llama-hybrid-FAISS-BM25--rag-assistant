Page not fully loaded (html source cut off) in IE8

I have a strange problem: I have a PHP application that's working in all common browsers. But some pages are not fully loaded in IE8. If I look at the source code, it has been more ore less randomly cut off and half of the html source is missing, sometimes in the middle of a tag. The strange thing is, it appears only on some IE-installations (in a big company), on others (I'd say the majority) it's working. If I look up the apache error logs it says: [notice] child pid 9393 exit signal Segmentation fault (11) I don't know if it's related somehow, but how can the same page (called with the same parameters) work on one machine and not on another one (reproducable)? I have not a single clue if it's some rendering problems in IE, if the browser is crashing internally or if the server really crashes and serving only half of the html source. (Unfortunately I can't provide an example as it occurs on a web project yet to be released) Update: I did some testing: Upgraded Apache2, PHP5, libPHP5 on the Debian machine. Updated, activated, deactivated xdebug, mimicked the request header (user-agent) with apaches mod_header - still the same problem. Honestly I'm not sure, if the seg fault has something to do with the problem that IE only delivers half of the content. Can this also be due to a virus scanner? Does anyone know of circumstances that IE only gets half the source code when there is no server error?
