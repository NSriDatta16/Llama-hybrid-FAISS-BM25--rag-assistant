When to use statistical tests to compare two machine learning models

I saw a paper comparing two ML models based on a statistical test. They tested these two models using different datasets and then they compared their accuracy results using a statistical test to see if their is any statistical significant. I was thinking if i were the author, I would just calculate the mean of the accuracy results and compare the two models based on their means. So, when to use statistical test and when to use simpler approaches like comparing the two means?
