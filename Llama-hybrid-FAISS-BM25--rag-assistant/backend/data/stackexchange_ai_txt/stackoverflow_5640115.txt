The list shouild drag and drop for you. Set dragEnabled=true, dropEnabled=true, and dragMoveEnabled=true and you're done. Dragging from within the list will reorder it. If you want to manually implement the drop, you should do your work on a dragDrop handler, as that only executes on a valid dragDrop. The dragComplete event fires even if there was no valid drop (dropping the item when a component was not marked to accept the drag).
