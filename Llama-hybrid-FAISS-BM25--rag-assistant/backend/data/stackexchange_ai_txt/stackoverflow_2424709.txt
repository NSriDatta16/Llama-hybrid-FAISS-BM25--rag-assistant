Word comparing and replacing

I need some comparing and replacing code in PHP Our mission is to empower consumers to Praise Good Service when they receive it and to Report Poor Service wherever they have to endure it. I need this paragraph to xcompare for some words (for example mission, Good ) and replace that word like this m*****n and G**d So the result will be like this Our m*****n is to empower consumers to Praise G**d Service when they receive it and to Report Poor Service wherever they have to endure it. How can i do this in PHP? Please share your ideas and code if any. Thanks
