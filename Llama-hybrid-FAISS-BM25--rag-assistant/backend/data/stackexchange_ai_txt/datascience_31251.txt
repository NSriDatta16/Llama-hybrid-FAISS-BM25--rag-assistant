Help me choose a Data Science book in Python

I've been a Data Scientist for a few years now, but I've only recently started to do most of my work in Python (boy, do I miss ggplot2 ! But altair is coming to the rescue). I want to improve my Python skills and, since most of my work is related to developing Data Science & Analytics applications, I'd rather learn from a book about these topics than from a book on, say, Application Server frameworks. Also, since I mostly develop Deep Learning models, I was looking for a PyTorch book. However I could only find two, of which one is really crappy, and the other one is from authors I really respect, but on a topic I don't work with (NLP): https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-PyTorch-Applications/dp/1491978236 So I've done a bit of research and found about the following books: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython (second edition recently came out) Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data Which book would you choose? You're free to suggest other titles. Requirements, in order of importance: It should be a good book about Python, so the code should be Pythonic It should be about about PyTorch, but not only about NLP (this requirement will probably be unfulfilled, for reasons above). Not about Keras, or mainly about Keras: I already have a reference for that. It should be about Data Science Price is not an issue.
