I am afraid that the question you are asking doesn't have an answer that would be satisfactory for you. Causal inference us used for finding causal relations in noisy data. A neural network is a mathematical function. It is deterministic, so it directly causes the result to be what it is. Everybmuktiplication, by every weight, addition of every bias, every other mathematical transformation has some , deterministic, impact on the result, so it “causes” it. Surely some of the parameters have a greater impact than others, but causality is not about the strength of the relationship. What you could do is you could build a simpler model that approximates the neural network and using it will allow you to understand better how it works and this is exactly what expandability tools like LIME do.
