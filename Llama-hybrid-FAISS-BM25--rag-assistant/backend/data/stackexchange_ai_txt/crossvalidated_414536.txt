What kind of statistical test is appropriate for the following example?

I ran an experiment varying the temperature and the quantity of chemicals added for the removal of 4 contaminants (A, B, C and D). The data obtained from this experiment was (in R): temperature I'd like to use a statistical test (or some statistical tests) to answer questions like: Is the temperature or the quantity of chemicals the most relevant variable of the process? Are the removals of the contaminants related? I was thinking of using a PCA, however I'm not sure. If there is a graphical way to explain it, that would be great. EDIT 1: As Izy suggested, I used the GLM for all contaminats: > glm(contaminant_A~temperature+chemicals) Call: glm(formula = contaminant_A ~ temperature + chemicals) Coefficients: (Intercept) temperature chemicals -65.1750 3.6625 0.8033 Degrees of Freedom: 11 Total (i.e. Null); 9 Residual Null Deviance: 12030 Residual Deviance: 327.1 AIC: 81.72 > glm(contaminant_B~temperature+chemicals) Call: glm(formula = contaminant_B ~ temperature + chemicals) Coefficients: (Intercept) temperature chemicals -18.23 0.80 0.21 Degrees of Freedom: 11 Total (i.e. Null); 9 Residual Null Deviance: 604.9 Residual Deviance: 26.77 AIC: 51.68 > glm(contaminant_C~temperature+chemicals) Call: glm(formula = contaminant_C ~ temperature + chemicals) Coefficients: (Intercept) temperature chemicals 91.1250 -1.4875 -0.3833 Degrees of Freedom: 11 Total (i.e. Null); 9 Residual Null Deviance: 2090 Residual Deviance: 99.71 AIC: 67.46 > glm(contaminant_D~temperature+chemicals) Call: glm(formula = contaminant_D ~ temperature + chemicals) Coefficients: (Intercept) temperature chemicals 59.51667 -0.37500 -0.05667 Degrees of Freedom: 11 Total (i.e. Null); 9 Residual Null Deviance: 2615 Residual Deviance: 2498 AIC: 106.1 Using contaminant A as example, can I say that the temperature is more relevant than the quantity of chemicals because the coefficient is bigger? What value of these results informs about the relation like a R^2?
