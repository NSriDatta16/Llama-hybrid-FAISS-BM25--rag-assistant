How to measure the contribution of each input channel to a network's accuracy?

As the title says, let's assume we have some neural network. More specifically, a regression network in case that changes anything. It takes multiple 2D input channels. How could one measure how much each input channel is contributing to the accuracy of the network on a validation set, to know which channels to keep and which are not really necessary?
