Two important factors are: the ISA of the CPU, or more specifically how closely CPU instructions map to the operations that you need to perform - if you can perform a given operation in one instruction one CPU but it requires 3 instructions on another CPU then the first CPU will probably be faster. If you have specific crypto instructions on the CPU, or extensions such as SIMD which can be leveraged, then so much the better. the instruction issue rate of the CPU, i.e. how many instructions can be issued per clock cycle
