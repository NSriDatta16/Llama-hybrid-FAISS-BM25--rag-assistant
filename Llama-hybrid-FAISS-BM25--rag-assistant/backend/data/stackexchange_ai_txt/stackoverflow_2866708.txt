Firefox jQuery Drag and Drop File Upload together with PHP

I am after a jQuery/PHP means of allowing a user to drag and drop files and then via PHP, upload one or more files to a specific directory on a Linux box. I only have Firefox 3.6 as my base browser but can also move to FFox if need be. Can use any HTML5 features as long as I'm using Firefox 3.6 Can someone possibly point me to any examples/sites where this process is demonstrated? I have had a look at http://www.plupload.com/index.php but this does not work in IE6. As mentioned, would like it to work in FFox only.
