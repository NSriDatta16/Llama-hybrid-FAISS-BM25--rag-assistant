How should I go about writing a naive Bayesian classifier in Python?

I need to create a weather prediction system in Python. What it will do is take in a file which contains weather data — such as temperature (mean, max, min), wind, dew point, humidity, condition (fog, rain, snow, none) etc. — and use this to train a naive Bayesian model so it can then predict the condition of the next day, i.e will the next day be fog, rain, snow or none. This is part of an assignment so they provided code which handles the input of the data file, I just need to create the classifier but I am not sure how to do it. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
