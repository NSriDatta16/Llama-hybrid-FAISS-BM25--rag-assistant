There are three basic design choices: Sync, Async, or Sync + multi threaded. Pick one or more than one if your an insane genious. Yes you need to understand acceptable performance expectations of your customers during the design phase of your application to be able to make the right choices up front. For any non-trivial project it can be quite dangerous and time consuming to treat high level performance expecations as an afterthought. If sync does not meet customer requirements: CPU limited systems require selection of multi-thread/process IO limited systems (most common) can often go either Async or MT. For IO limited leveraging technologies such as state threads can allow you to have your cake and eat it too. (Sync design /w async execution)
