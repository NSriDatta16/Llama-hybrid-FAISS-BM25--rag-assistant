If you go by ganeti (which respects PEP 8) you should choose the third option. something = { 'foo1': 'bar1', 'foo2': 'bar2', 'foo3': 'bar3', ... } I like this esp. because you can select only the elements you want. And I feel removing or adding elements to either ends is faster this way. Note: As pointed out in the comment there should be no whitespace before ':' (E203) as per PEP.
