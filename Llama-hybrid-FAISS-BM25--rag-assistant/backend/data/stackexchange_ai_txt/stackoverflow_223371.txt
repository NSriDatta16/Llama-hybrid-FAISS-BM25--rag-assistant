Well, we must take into account what an SELECT returns in Oracle. There are two modes. By default an SELECT returns data as that data looked in the very moment the SELECT statement started executing (this is default behavior in READ COMMITTED isolation mode, the default transactional mode). So if an UPDATE/INSERT was executed after SELECT was issued that won't be visible in result set. This can be a problem if you need to compare two result sets (for example debta and credit sides of an general ledger app). For that we have a second mode. In that mode SELECT returns data as it looked at the moment the current transaction began (default behavior in READ ONLY and SERIALIZABLE isolation levels). So, at least sometimes it is necessary to execute SELECTs in transaction.
