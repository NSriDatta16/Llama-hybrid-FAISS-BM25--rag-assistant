In this case, I think you want a seasonality correction in the ARIMA model. There's not enough date here to fit the seasonal model, but this should get you started. library(zoo) start In my tests the ARMA(3, 3) is really close, but that's just luck. With a longer time series you should be able to calibrate the seasonal correction to give you good predictions. It would be helpful to have a good prior on what the underlying mechanisms for both the signal and the seasonal correction to get better out of sample performance.
