What's your favourite ReSharper's plugins, what is still missing in?

I'm new in ReSharper - I found it very useful but also noticed some gaps I'd like to fill. I wonder to know 1) what ReSharper's plugins you use . 2) what missing functionalities you are extremely interested to have in inside? From my side: PLUGINS: A) spell check my XML comments (have to use Agent Smith ) LACK OF FUNCTIONALITIES a) numbered bookmarking (Deplhi-like) (forced to use DPack ) b) right align variables / operands (as described here ) c) possibility to collapse all projects in solution browser (again need use DPack)
