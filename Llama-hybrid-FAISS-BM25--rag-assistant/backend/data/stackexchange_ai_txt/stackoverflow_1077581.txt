In a HashSet/HashMap, you could mutate a contained object to change the results of compareTo() operation -- relative comparison isn't used to locate objects. But it'd be fatal inside a TreeSet/TreeMap. You can also mutate objects that are inside an IdentityHashMap -- nothing other than object identity is used to locate contents. Even though you can do these things with these qualifications, they make your code more fragile. What if someone wants to change to a TreeSet later, or add that mutable field to the hashCode/equality test?
