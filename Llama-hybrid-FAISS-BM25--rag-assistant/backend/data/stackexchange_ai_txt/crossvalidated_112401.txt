Dynamic models that update the abilities at each time step are generally better, but hard to implement. If you want to use lots of things like number of passes, then you will generally want to be using some sort of regression somewhere in your model. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12015/abstract is a paper that predicts a player's goal scoring ability with a mixed effects model. State-space models give a way of estimating the abilities of football teams, given the number of goals scored in a match, over time. An example is this paper http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12042/abstract . There are a number of ordinal regression models. A dynamic one, which aims to rate teams, is http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9884.00236/abstract . There is the also pi-football model, which uses a detailed Bayesian network that uses lots of information: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705112001967 . Hopefully these papers will give you some good ideas on how to tackle the problem.
