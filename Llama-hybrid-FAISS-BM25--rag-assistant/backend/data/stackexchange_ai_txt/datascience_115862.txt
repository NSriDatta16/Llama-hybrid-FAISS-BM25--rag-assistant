From a purely pragmatic perspective: If you have 6 variables, the sum of which are exactly your target variable, then you have no need to build a predictive model. You can use deterministic methods to get the answer which you need, without bias or potential error, which all predictive models carry. If you will have only a subset of these values (the same ones each time) available in the future, and other correlated variables it might be worth building a predictive model. But you should only use the variables that you will have, and then only if they are in someway individually correlated with your target and you cannot compute the outcome directly.
