transforming RGB to grayscale lead to loss of important information of colours It would be easier to ask this to a radiologist instead of a statistician. From the statistical point of view you try both and see which performs better. However, whether or not the RGB channels have different (and important) information might already be answered based on theoretical considerations like 'how is the image created?'. Another consideration: Images can sometimes have a slight hue instead of being completely black and white (like old sepia photo's), but possibly the light intensity captures all the information if this is just an artifact from the imaging. To test this you could create a plot of the colour as function of light intensity and see whether this creates a one dimensional scale (ie. only a single colour occurs at the same intensity and you get a single curve in the plot). In the case that your images are not completely black and white, and instead have a hue, then it might be useful to use all rgb channels because it is input with a higher precision. To have this work with a deep learning network you could convert the RGB to a single scale but with a function that is not simply taking the light intensity and instead uses the colour information as well.
