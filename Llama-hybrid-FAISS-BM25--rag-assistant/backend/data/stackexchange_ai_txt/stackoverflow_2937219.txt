PHP recaptcha send mail issues

Hey guys, if anybody can help me out i'd love it... What i have is a form, that went sent, uses doublecheck.php is_valid) { die ("Sorry please go back and try it again." . "" . $resp->error . ")"); } if ($resp->is_valid) { require_once('sendmail.php'); } ?> And then my sendmail.php Date: Attention: Message: ", $notes); echo $notesout; ?> Next Page What i'm having a hard time with is when its succesful i need to send out $notes but $notes is always blank. Should i just put my sendmail php inside of my successful php? Or can someone explain to me why $notes is blank. I do have my recaptcha key in, and also i do have an email address. I kept some things private, also there is a notes textarea in my HTML Here is my html for that table: Your Prayer or Concern
