Cannot get the MPMoviePlayerViewController to play my media file

Having some issues getting this MPMoviePlayerViewController to work. I have two sample URLs pointing to the same Quicktime movie. The commented out URL doesn't work; the other one works fine. I've monitored both via Fiddler and I can't see any issues in headers/etc. Basically I'm trying to figure out a way to play an Azure hosted media file with some sort of security; either via pass through WCF service. Any one have this figured out? I'm pulling my hair out. //NSString *moviePath = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"http://www.nov8rix.com/Services/CPipeline.svc/Media/42"]; NSString *moviePath = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"http://nov8rixstorage.blob.core.windows.net/searchpad/tutorial_portrait.mov"]; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:moviePath]; [url retain]; MPMoviePlayerViewController *mp = [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:url]; [self presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated:mp]; [mp release]; [url release]; Update: This is the error I'm receiving: NSConcreteNotification 0x892e540 {name = MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification; object = ; userInfo = { MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishReasonUserInfoKey = 1; error = "Error Domain=MediaPlayerErrorDomain Code=-12939 \"The server is not correctly configured.\" UserInfo=0x892ecb0 {NSLocalizedDescription=The server is not correctly configured.}"; A brief search on the web mentions that my problem may be that my media connection doesn't support byte Range Requests. This is probably true. Is there a way to allow Range Requests with WCF?
