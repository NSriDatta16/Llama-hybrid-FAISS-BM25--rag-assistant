Have you considered attaching from Excel directly to Analysis Services, and using the built-in drag-and-drop query functionality? Excel will generate the MDX for you. I've never done it, but it should be possible to integrate ADOMD.NET into a VSTO application, which will then run inside Excel. You might also be able to access some of Excel's MDX query machinery directly that way....
