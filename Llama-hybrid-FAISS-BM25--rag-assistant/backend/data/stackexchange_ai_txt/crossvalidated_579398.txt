Is normal distribution better than skewed distribution for machine learning input features?

Distribution of a particular feature in my ML dataset is skewed as shown below. Log of this feature looks like a normal distribution. Can the latter distribution offer better predictability in a neural network model? P.S. Rest of my features in the dataset are like normal distribution and I applied z-score normalization. (Addon qn: Is there a thumb rule like it's better to have normal-like or uniform-like distribution for ML predictability?)
