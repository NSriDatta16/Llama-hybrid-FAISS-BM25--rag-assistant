To open a file from say, the sdcard in android you use the getExternalStorageDirectory() method that is defined in android.os.Environment . Be sure to also check that an sdcard is available on the system first. You use the File object (it is a directory) returned from the getExternalStorageDir method to get the actual file and from that new file object (the actual file) you can call MediaPlayer.create with the uri of the actual file. Consider: File dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDir(); File file = File(dir, "filename.mp4"); MediaPlayer player = MediaPlayer.create(context, file.toURI();
