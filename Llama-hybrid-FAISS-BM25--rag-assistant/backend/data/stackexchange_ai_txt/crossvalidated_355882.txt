Can I run a logistic regression with a small sample size and perfect convergence?

I'm hoping someone will be able to help me with my question. I have a dataset with 71 records and 4 variables. Three of the four variables are independent, and one is dependent. All four variables are nominal with two levels, 0 or 1. The three independent variables, respectively, have 26, 17, and 9 "successes" (where the score is 1). The dependent variable has 44 "successes". However - the "successes" in the dependent variable ALWAYS overlap with one or more "successes" in the independent variable. A "success" in one independent variable means that the dependent variable was also a "success." Given the small number of responses in my sample and the 1:1 overlap between "successes" in the independent and dependent variables, is it possible for me to run some variation of logistic regression on these variables to detect a relationship between the dependent and independent variables? Thanks in advance!
