Here is Minitab output for simplified cases with 3 Algorithms, 5 Subjects, and 10 replications. First, output for the Friedman test on 15 averages of 10. Friedman Test: AvgScor versus Al blocked by Sub S = 6.40 DF = 2 P = 0.041 Sum of Al N Est Median Ranks 1 5 109.33 6.0 2 5 113.00 10.0 3 5 116.57 14.0 Grand median = 112.97 There are significant differences among algorithms. It seems fair to say Algorithm 3 has a higher score than Algorithm 1. Beyond that you could do 2-sample Wilcoxon tests to see if Algorithm 2 is significantly different from the others, perhaps using a Bonferroni procedure, working at a reduced significance level to avoid 'false discovery'. I haven't seen your data, but by the time you average 30 scores, you might be able to rely on results of a two-way standard ANOVA with 3 Algorithms and 5 subjects, with one observation (the average) per cell. Analysis of Variance for AvgScor Source DF SS MS F P Al 2 156.825 78.413 11.62 0.004 Sub 4 11.489 2.872 0.43 0.787 Error 8 53.975 6.747 Total 14 222.289 S = 2.59747 R-Sq = 75.72% R-Sq(adj) = 57.51% Here you could use an ad hoc Tukey HSD procedure to determine which pairs of Algorithms are different. You also know that the Subject variance is too small to reject $H_0: \sigma_{Sub}^2 = 0.$ Alternatively, use a MLE analysis in R that provides an estimate and CI for $\sigma_{Sub}^2.$ For this demo, I generated fake normal data (with SD 5.0), so the full ANOVA with 10 replications in each cell would be legitimate. You could try this with your data, capture the residuals, and look at them in a normal probability plot to assess how seriously to take findings about interaction and estimates of within-subject variance $\sigma_e^2.$ Even if information about variances is imperfect, it might give useful ballpark estimates for power computations, so you would have some idea whether 30 replications per subject are necessary.
