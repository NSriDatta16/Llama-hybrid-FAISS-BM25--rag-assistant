Well, I've already spent way too much time and energy on this question so I think I came up with a pragmatic workaround for my particular case - but no real solution! The problem is apparently due to the programms running at different integrity levels (Outlook = medium, VS2010 = admin or high). Office runs by default on a medium level and so will my future application once deployed. So there shouldn't be any trouble, since if the CRM and Outlook run at the same level, there's no problem. For development I just let em both run on high, or medium (starting my compiled files from the debug folder). In any other case a Messagebox warning is shown informing the user of the different integrity levels that cause an exception and prevent access. At the code level, when I try to read any (by Outlook) prepolutated, protected properties and the object model guard raises the exception, I just catch it and use default values instead. Why I had to read them in first place is currently beyond me - but so were the specs which were handed to me. Anyway thanks for reading and if I ever come up with a solution I'll be sure to psot it - until then keep in mind that a pragmatic solution is better then none! Happy Father's Day everyone!
