choosing most important predictors for logistic regression

I have a dataset of cars with price label as binary outcome including " affordable " and " costly ". I aim to predict the whether a car is of "affordable" or "costly" using logistic regression model, with 80% of dataset as training set, and will predict the binary outcome later. But before training, I have so many independent variables (over 80 columns/independent variables) that I want to check which predictors are important for the model. My purpose is to choose only important predictors so that the prediction later is of best performance. My steps are as follows: Split into training and test set Build a "draft" logistic regression model using the training set and see in the result which predictors are statistically significant. Check the output of this model, for categorical variables such as " Vehicle_brand ", (now in the result this variable is split into multiple vars because it is a factor), I use Wald test to see whether the Vehicle_brand as a whole is significant for the model. If significant, keep " Vehicle_brand " for fitting into training set later. Only retain the predictors that are significant in the first model to fit into training set the second time, then use this model to predict on test set. label_index #train the logistic regression model trn_price_LR % mutate(price_label = relevel(factor(price_label), ref =="affordable")) "Draft" model price_LR_mod : price_LR_mod #Wald test for some categorical variables regTermTest(price_LR_mod, "Vehicle_brand") #The output of my first "Draft" model is as below, since " affordable " is reference level, the result below is predict whether a car is more or less likely to be "costly" based on the sign of coefficients (if p-value is statistically significant) Call: glm(formula = price_label ~ ., family = binomial, data = trn_price_LR) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.0661 -0.0780 -0.0001 0.1010 3.9243 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std.

And if my way of choosing important variables is correct, how could I get the names of all significant predictors? For example I want to choose the predictors that are significant such as ABS, Electric_front_windows, Power_steering, CD etc. by coding rather than manually typing for my improved model?
