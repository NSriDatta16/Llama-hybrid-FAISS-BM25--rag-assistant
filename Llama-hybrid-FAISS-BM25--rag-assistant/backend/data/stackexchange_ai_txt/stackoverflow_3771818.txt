Your question does not explicitly state that you want to stick with NSIS. So I take the chance to bring your attention to Java Web Start which requires relatively little setup work and allows to distribute updates without much hassle (and no user interaction required). NSIS does not support updating as it seems, and trying to implement it in Java will lead to a portability nightmare. Web Start seems to be "just the right tool".
