The issue of large storage requirements for KNN can be addressed by storing only "prototype" samples and using these during the Nearest Neighbour lookup process. Some widely cited paper reviewing such techniques are A Taxonomy and Experimental Study on Prototype Generation for Nearest Neighbor Classification and Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classification: Taxonomy and Empirical Study . Unfortunately there are not many good open-source implementations of these techniques. One Python library is scikit-protopy , but it has not been updated since 2015.
