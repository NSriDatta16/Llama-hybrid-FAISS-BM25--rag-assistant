DBSCAN will always mark noisy points according to epsilon and min_samples parameters, so there is no way to avoid that unless you have very compact and "well defined" clusters, what seems unlikely.The short answers will be to use another clustering algorithm such as gaussian mixture , k-means , or Birch If your problem really needs you to use DBSCAN, you can try performing a quantile tranformation ( uniform ) prior clustering Example: scaler = Pipeline([("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy= "constant", fill_value= 0)),("transformer", QuantileTransformer(output_distribution = "uniform"))]) model = Pipeline([("scaler", scaler), ("cluster",HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=10, min_samples=1))]).fit(data)
