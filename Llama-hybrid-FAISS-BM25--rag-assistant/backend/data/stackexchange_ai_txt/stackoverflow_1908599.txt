Creating an object from another object

Forgive the dumb newby question but... I'm moving data from one table to another. The destination table schema is identical to the source table except it has a few extra columns. Linq to SQL generates classes to represent each of these tables. If I have a source object, how do I create a destination object from it? E.g., source object has properties A,B,C. Destination object has A,B,C,X,Y. I want to do something like: Destination dest = new Destination(Source source, int x, int y) { this.X = x; this.Y = y; ... // somehow set all the destination properties to // their corresponding source value } Is there an elegant way to do this other than explicity setting each of the properties? Can I make Destination inherit from Source somehow? Would that help?
