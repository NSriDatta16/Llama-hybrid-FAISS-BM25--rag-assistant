No, g_slist_free does not free data you store in the list (e.g. strings). It has no way of knowing whether and how you want to free this data. You might store the same pointer in multiple lists. Also, you can store non-pointer types in the list, or types that aren't allocated with malloc . The collection doesn't let you provide a destructor function. So you do need to loop through and free your data before freeing the list. Also, g_slist can use memory pools, so valgrind may not always give correct results. Other types, such as GPtrArray , let you provide a destructor ( GDestroyNotify ) for element data.
