Python source file organization

I'm starting a new Python project, and want to follow standard conventions as closely as possible. I've read that import statements should come first, for example. But I haven't found any conventions for things like putting all function definitions before or after all class definitions. Are there any conventions for things like this? Or does everyone typically just organize things like function and class definitions in whatever order seems to make sense?
