I would disable it. Very few organizations use internal domains, and those that do generally use "acme.localhost" or "intranet.com" or something else of the like. There is some sort of configuration going on in the DNS that they use to make it work. Regardless, internal email is nearly dead anyway: with the advent of instant messaging, Twitter, and SMS along with the increasing availability of external email for every member of a company, it is almost entirely likely that you will never get a TLD-less domain in an email. For the folks that do require it, they can always tweak the regex themselves, as they were savvy enough to set up a custom hostname to handle internal email.
