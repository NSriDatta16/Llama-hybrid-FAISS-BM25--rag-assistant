SQLite query throwing exception in Android

Im trying to get an object form my SQLite database in my Android application. I know that the contact is in the database because when I add it and try finding by ID, it returns the object. When I try finding by first and last name, though, it throws an exception and Im left with a null reference. Here is the query: cursor = mDb.query(DB_CONTACTS_NAME, new String[] {KEY_ID, KEY_LAST_NAME, KEY_FIRST_NAME, KEY_EMAIL_ADDRESS, KEY_ORGANIZATION_NAME, KEY_LABEL, KEY_LABEL_POSITION}, KEY_FIRST_NAME + "=" + first + " AND " + KEY_LAST_NAME + "=" + last, null, null, null, null ); Ive also tried to find just by first name and just by last name. Same result as above. Edit: The exception is an SQLite exception no such column: aurelius: , while compiling: SELECT _id, last_name, first_name, email_address, organization_name, label, label_position FROM contacts WHERE first_name=marcus AND last_name=aurelius And also happens when trying to select just first or last name no such column: marcus: , while compiling: SELECT _id, last_name, first_name, email_address, organization_name, label, label_position FROM contacts WHERE first_name=marcus
