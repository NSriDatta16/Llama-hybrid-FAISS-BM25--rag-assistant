Acts_as_tree - one-to-Many: Show Records associated with children on parent page

I have a relatively simple one-to-many relationship and use acts_as_tree to get it organized in the view. It kinda looks like this: Root |_Product 1 |_Product 2 |_Category 1.1 |_Product 3 |_Product 4 |_Category 1.1.1 |_Product 5 The way I set it up is that I list products in the 'show' action of the category. However I can't seem too figure out how to show: Product 1-5 in the 'show' for Category 1, Product 3-5 in Category 1.1 and so on ... Does anyone have a hint, from where I can pick it up? Thanks! Val
