@StatsStudent has already provided a nice answer that I agree with, but let me add to it. Instead of coding the answers yourself by hand, you should rather employ independent coders that will do that for you. Imagine that you, as a researcher, are interested in obtaining a certain result and so during the coding you are more prone to (semi-consciously) "see" certain themes in the answers written by responders. This would distort your results. There is also a reason to employ more then one coder to code the same answers (or at least a part of them): imagine that a certain coder has some kind of "bias" in his reading of the answers (say, he always considers them as "positive") - if you used his coding, the results would get biased. If you employ more than one coder, then you can compare their codings so to assess their agreement/reliability (almost for sure they won't be the same, they never are) and on another hand, you could assume that the more codings you have the less biased they get on average (e.g. there are both "positive" and "negative" coders, so in the end they cancel out).
