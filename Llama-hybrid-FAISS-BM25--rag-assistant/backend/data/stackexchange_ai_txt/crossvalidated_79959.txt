Struggling with simple standard deviation problem

I don't know how to grasp what this question is asking, nor how to attempt to solve it... The Polk Company reported that the average age of a car on US roads in a recent year was 7.5 years. Suppose the distribution of ages of cars on US roads is approximately bell-shaped. If 95% of the ages are between 1 year and 14 years, what is the standard deviation of car age? I could calculate the variance but I don't know N. Not sure what the 95% part is there for either or what to do with it. This isn't technically a homework question, but it's on a practice exam. I'd really like some help as to how to go about solving this, the wording is messing me up.
