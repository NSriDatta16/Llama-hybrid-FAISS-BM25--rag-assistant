Which statistical test should I use to compare two models (multiple runs) on the same (big) dataset?

I want to compare the performance of two stocastic models on the same datasets (>10k samples). To this end, I run 5 runs for each model (different seed) and I can compute the mean and std for each model. If I now want to run a statistical test to assess the significance of the difference in their performance, is a corrected paired t-test appropriate? Does it depend on the metric (e.g., accuracy vs f1)? What should I consider? E.g, assume I have model A and model B and I run them 5 times each on dataset D (50K samples). Once averaged the 5 runs, I get: Model A: Acc mean 90.10, std 5 Model B: Acc mean 92.4, std 7 Is there a test I could use in this case? Would this one be appropriate? Why?
