ANIZ in orgANIZation is not a complete word -- it's a part of a word. Your pattern btw is not what you wrote -- a*z would not match as you describe; you're probably using a.*z instead, which would. So, try a[^ ]*z so it won't match spaces. If there are other characters besides spaces that you don't want to match, e.g. some kinds of punctuation, stick them in the [^...] construct as well, of course.
