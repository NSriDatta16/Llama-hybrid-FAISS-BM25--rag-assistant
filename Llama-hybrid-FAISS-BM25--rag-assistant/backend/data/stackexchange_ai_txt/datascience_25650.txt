What is LSTM, BiLSTM and when to use them?

I am very new to Deep learning and I am particularly interested in knowing what are LSTM and BiLSTM and when to use them (major application areas). Why are LSTM and BILSTM more popular than RNN? Can we use these deep learning architectures in unsupervised problems?
