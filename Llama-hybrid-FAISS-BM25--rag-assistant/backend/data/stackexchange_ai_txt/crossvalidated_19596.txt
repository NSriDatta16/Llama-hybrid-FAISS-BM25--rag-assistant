I have edited this and tried to meet some of Cardinal's sage and continually positive and mature advice regarding postings/answers. The question is how to efficiently convert/characterize an observed series in terms of a Transfer Function/ARMAX Model.There are four possible ways to include a deterministic/dummy 0/1 variable and the OP wishes to create a map between data and a possible representation. The 4 ways are Pulses, Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and Local Time Trends. A step/level (St) 0 before intervention and 1 after intervention) and a pulse Pt (1 at intervention and 0 elsewhere) interventions, the model then can be expressed as Yt=β1St+β2Pt+ηt where nt is an ARIMA process Also because there may different responses to the interventions, say graduate change in level is by ωSt1−δB or decayed responses ωPt1−δB. Your three examples reinforce the idea that all models are wrong but some are useful. It is possible to represent your three series with and wthout incorporating ARIMA structure. In 1) 20 20 33.5 33.5 33.5 33.5 33.5 33.5 33.5… might be handled by two pulses followed by a level shift y(t)=b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 No ARIMA structure needed where x1 and x2 are pulse series and x3 is a step/level series 2) 20 25 28 30 32 33 33.5 33.5 33.5 … can be approximated by a combination of memory/ARIMA and dummy series. [(1-B* 1)]Y(T) = +[X1(T)][(1-B *1)][(+ .417)] :PULSE 5 +[X2(T)][(1-B**1)][(- .114)] :PULSE 8 +[X3(T)][(1-B**1)][(+ .229)] :PULSE 6 + [(1- .635B** 1)]**-1 [A(T)] Alternatively if one wanted to supress the ARIMA component. Note that a step = [1-B]trend thus a trend = step/[1-B] . REstated a step is a difference of a trend and a pulse is a difference of a step Y(T) = 19.784 gradual +[X1(T)][(+ 2.6434)] :TIME TREND 1 +[X2(T)][(- 2.5298)] :TIME TREND 6 +[X3(T)][(- .123)] :TIME TREND 11 +[X4(T)][(- 2.4278)] :PULSE 1 +[X5(T)][(- 1.0012)] :PULSE 5 + [A(T)] OR in terms of step/level variables and pulses Y(T) = 19.784 gradual +[X1(T)][(+ 2.6434)]/[1-B] : STEP/LEVEL 1 +[X2(T)][(- 2.5298)]/[1-B] : STEP/LEVEL 6 +[X3(T)][(- .123)]/[1-B] : STEP/LEVEL 11 +[X4(T)][(- 2.4278)] :PULSE 1 +[X5(T)][(- 1.0012)] :PULSE 5 + [A(T)] 3)… 20 20 20.25 21.5 23 25 29 33.5 33.5 . In terms of no ARIMA and no differencing operators Y(T) = 18.336 gradual-perm +[X1(T)][(+ .932)] :TIME TREND 1 +[X2(T)][(+ 1.2098)] :TIME TREND 6 +[X3(T)][(- 2.1723)] :TIME TREND 11 +[X4(T)][(+ 4.0747)] :PULSE 8 +[X5(T)][(+ 1.9325)] :PULSE 9 + [A(T)] If one wanted to represent this time series using a combination of ARIMA and dummies [(1-B* 1)][(1-B *1)]Y(T) = .73605E-08 gradual-perm +[X1(T)][(1-B**1)][(1-B**1)][(+ 4.2000)] :PULSE 8 +[X2(T)][(1-B**1)][(1-B**1)][(+ 1.8333)] :PULSE 7 +[X3(T)][(1-B**1)][(1-B**1)][(+ 2.3000)] :PULSE 9 +[X4(T)][(1-B**1)][(1-B**1)][(+ .833)] :PULSE 10 + [A(T)] Andreas, these models were easily/automatically developed by commercially available software that I have had a role in developing (AUTOBOX). SAS and others attempt to form similar models but often fail, in my opinion. I am sure that some of this could be duplicated in other programming languages.
