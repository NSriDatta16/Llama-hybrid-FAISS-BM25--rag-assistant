Disclaimer: I just glimpsed at the linked articles. My answer focuses solely on Gaussian processes per se. Your example If you understand your example $f(x)=x^2+Y$ as a random function of $x$ , then it is a Gaussian process, if and only if $Y$ is a Gaussian random variable. If it has any other distribution, it is still a stochastic process but not a Gaussian one. But no matter what kind of process, you can determine the mean and covariance function. The mean function is $m(x) = x^2 + \mathbb{E}[Y]$ and the covariance function $C$ is $$C(x_1,x_2)=\text{Cov}(f(x_1), f(x_2))= \text{Cov}(x_1^2 + Y, x_2^2 + Y)=\text{Cov}(Y,Y)=\text{Var}[Y].$$ This is because $x_1$ and $x_2$ are non-random, which means the respective covariance terms are zero. This particular covariance function does not depend on $x$ i.e. it is constant. This reflects the fact that your set of random functions is the parabola $x^2$ which is just randomly shifted up and down as a whole by the values of $Y.$ Parametric families If you can express your parametric family as a span of basis functions, as is the case for example for polynomials, you can easily turn them into a Gaussian process. Say your family consists of functions of the form $f(x)=\sum \alpha_i \phi_i(x)$ for a set of some basis functions $\phi_i$ then you can turn those into Gaussian random functions simply by turning the coefficients $\alpha_i$ into Gaussian random variables $Y_i$ to arrive at the Gaussian process $$ G(x) = \sum_i \phi_i(x) Y_i.$$ This works only because linear combinations of Gaussian variables are again Gaussian variables, and explains what is so special about the "Gaussian" in Gaussian processes. For other distributions, including discrete ones, this is no longer true. The idea is straightforward for finite dimensional spaces, but with the proper technical assumptions even possible for infinite dimensional spaces. Final remark If you want to discuss how functions look or what they do "on average" you need to find a way to express probabilities for functions. As demonstrated above, Gaussian process provide an easy and flexible way to turn any space of functions into a space of random functions. The source and purpose of those functions, i.e. whether they are regression functions or loss functions or time series of beaver dams built, does not matter the least.
