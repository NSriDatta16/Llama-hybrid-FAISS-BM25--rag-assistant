Conditional Expectation has the minimum mean prediction error

Consider $\{X_t\}$ as a general time series including random variables $X_t$. Assume that we have observed $X$'s until time t. The goal is to come up with a function of the observed $X$'s to predict a future X, let's say unobserved $X_{t+h}$. Condsider $h(\vec{X}) = h((..., X_{t-1}, X_t))$ as our proposed function. We define mean prediction error as: $$E\{(X_{t+h} - h(\vec{x}))^2 | \vec{x}\}$$ Goal: I want to show that among all possible functions h, the function $E(X_{t+h}|\vec{x})$ has the minimum mean prediction error . Thank you for your help
