To use Leptonica from C++, simply call it like you would in C. You can use the existing Leptonica samples as a starting point for calling the routines. You will want to look at ...\leptonlib-1.xx\prog\skewtest.c for a pretty complete example of how the skew routines are used. In fact, you could probably just compile the skewtest program and drive it using your Qt GUI. The algorithm is pretty simple: rotate the image by a test angle, then compute the average intensity of each scanline, then find the variance of all these averages. The best deskew angle is (in theory) achieved when the variance is at a maximum. The different search algorithms used in skewtest take different approaches to finding this point of maximum variance.
