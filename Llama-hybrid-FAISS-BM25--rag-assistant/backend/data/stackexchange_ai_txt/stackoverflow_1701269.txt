The last time I checked, you couldn't do that: I am pretty sure it is related to security concerns & same origin policy. Since a site isn't supposed to have access to resources of other sites, I really doesn't make sense to expose additional degrees of liberty at this API level. Furthermore, what value would that confer to the WEB application? I could only really serve the needs on the client host side which is not really a priority for Gears.
