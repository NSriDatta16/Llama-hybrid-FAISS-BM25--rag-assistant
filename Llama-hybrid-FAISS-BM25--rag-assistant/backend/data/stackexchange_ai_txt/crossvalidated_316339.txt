If the underlying process is linear, linear regression will be superior. What comes to mind is estimating calories on food; the amount of calories will be strictly linear (i.e., they won't interact with each other). A neural network (etc) could be trained to do this but it would be more computationally demanding and prone to overfitting. That said, I think that people will choose linear regression over machine learning less because of the problem domain and more because of their own goals. If you want an accurate prediction, then a well-trained model will be superior most of the time and linear regression wouldn't be considered seriously. In other cases, predictive accuracy isn't really interesting: social scientists will frequently publish regression models with accuracy (that is to say, $R^2$) well below .1, because the interest is in the contribution of individual factors to the outcome rather than predicting the value of Y given X. A neural network, rather, doesn't really care about the marginal effect of changing an input, it just runs the model again and returns its prediction.
