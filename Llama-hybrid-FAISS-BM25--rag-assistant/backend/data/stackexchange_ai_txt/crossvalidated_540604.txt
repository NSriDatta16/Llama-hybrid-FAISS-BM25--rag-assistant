Interpretation of Odds Ratio in logistic regression

I have the following question: If I perform a logistic regression for "amount of fluid" (independent variable, unit is milliliters) and the outcome "pass = 1 vs. fail = 0" (as dependent variable) and receive the following results for b = 0.205 > so the odds ratio is 1.227 (EXP of 0.205). Is it correct to say that: an increase of 1 milliliter of fluid results in an increase of odds for pass by 1.227 and this is equal to an increase by 22.7 percent a decrease of 1 milliliter of fluid results in a decrease of odds for pass by 0.814 (1 / 1.227) and this is equal to a decrease by 18.5 percent (1 - 1/1.227) As one milliliter is of less interest than a change of 10 milliliters - is it correct to say that an increase of 10 milliliters of fluid results in an increase of odds for pass by 7.768 (1.227^10) and this is equal to an increase by 776.8 percent? a decrease of 10 milliliters of fluid results in a decrease of odds for pass by 0.127 (0.814^10) and this is equal to a decrease by 12.7 percent? Another question is the following: How do I interpret an OR negative! ) leading to an OR of 0.991. So how do I interpret this for an increase of 1 milliliter a decrease of 1 milliliter an increase of 10 milliliters a decrease of 10 milliliters Thank you so much for any help! It would be really helpful for me if the answers use my numbers with the three digits so I can retrace them.
