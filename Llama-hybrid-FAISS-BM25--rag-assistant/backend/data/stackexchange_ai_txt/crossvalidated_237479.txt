A random variable is a quantity whose value appears to be random when measured. As @ilan man describes, the observation of Heads or Tails in a coin flip experiment is one simple example. You could also define a random variable to be the average value of the last ten tosses of the coin (mapping H to 1 and T to 0, for example). The time that you get to work each day is also a random variable. Your weight every morning is a random variable. Etc. We characterize random variables by their distribution, which, broadly speaking, gives a description of how likely particular values are to be observed. The Expected Value of the random variable is a measure of the center of this distribution and the Variance is a measure of its spread. (The Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance, which is a nice measure since it has the same units as the variable - roughly speaking it is measures the "width" of the distribution.) Note that both of these measures are "non-robust", meaning that they are sensitive to outlying values. There are also "robust" statistics for the "center" and "width". The median , which is the value for which there are as many points larger and smaller, is a robust measure of the centroid. Since it only depends on the count of values larger or smaller, the details very far from the median do not have an affect on the median. There are a number of robust width measures but the one most similar to the median is the "median absolute delta" , which is $$ median(|X - median(X)|) $$ where X is the random variable in question.
