Long-term frequentist decision strategy. How to "unreject" H0 when false positive occurs?

TLDR: How to quantify the H0/H1 plausibility, when there are multiple statistics available on the matter? What is a good source to learn more about frequentist decision making strategy? Once in a while we hear about flawed studies, wasting a lot of resources on follow-up research e.g. testing a drug that turns out to not work. False positive (negative) results are unavoidable in statistics, leading to "debunking" articles, replications or metanalyses "showing no significance" being published, refuting previous beliefs. Bayesian statistics provides (at least in theory) pretty intuitive framework to deal with such decision-making process: take prior beliefs and correct them with the new data. We can even weight the beliefs by the cost of false positives and negatives. What is frequentist response here? Say the hypothesis $ H_0 $ was rejected at $\alpha$ and I acted as if it was false, but after some time I start questioning my choice. What is the proper methodology to change my decision? What is there are multiple studies available, assigning $p$ -values $0.05, 0.08, 0.7$ and $0.006$ to the same hypothesis $H_0$ ?
