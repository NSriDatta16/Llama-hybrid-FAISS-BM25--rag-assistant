As already mentioned by Chris Haug, stl is a non-parametric method. It returns the components (trend, seasonal, irregular) by smoothing the data; no model is involved in the analysis. An alternative approach is to fit an ARIMA model to the original data and decompose it into ARIMA models for each component. This approach is well suited for quarterly and monthly time series data. The methodology is developed and described, among others, in Burman (1980) and Hillmer and Tiao (1982) . The software SEATS ( Gómez and Maravall ) implements this methodology and is commonly used in statistical offices. A Matlab implementation is described in Gómez, 2015 . In R, you can try the package tsdecomp . This document introduces the methodology and the R package. Illustration with your sample data.

Of particular interest are the AR roots allocated to each component and the variances of the components.) print(res) #Roots of AR polynomial #---------------------- #(1 - L)(1 - L^4) = (1 - 2L + L^2)(1 + L + L^2 + L^3) # Component Root Modulus Argument Period Cycles.per.Year #1 trend 1+0i 1 0.000 Inf 0 #2 trend 1+0i 1 0.000 Inf 0 #3 seasonal 0+1i 1 1.571 4.000 1 #4 seasonal -1+0i 1 3.142 2.000 2 #5 seasonal 0-1i 1 4.712 1.333 3 # #MA polynomials #-------------- # #Trend: #(1 + 0.205L - 0.795L^2)a_t, a_t ~ IID(0, 0.0178) #Seasonal: #(1 - 0.153L - 0.48L^2 - 0.367L^3)c_t, c_t ~ IID(0, 0.0768) # #Variances #--------- # #trend seasonal irregular #0.01777 0.07683 0.25647 # #Roots #----- # #Component Root Modulus Argument Period #1 trend 0.7949-0.0000i 0.7949 0.000 Inf #2 trend -1.0000+0.0000i 1.0000 3.142 2.000 #3 seasonal 1.0000+0.0000i 1.0000 0.000 Inf #4 seasonal -0.4235+0.4327i 0.6055 2.345 2.679 #5 seasonal -0.4235-0.4327i 0.6055 3.938 1.596 Summary plot: plot(res) Note: the example is done for the logarithms of the data; you may take the exponential on the estimated components in order to recover the original scale.
