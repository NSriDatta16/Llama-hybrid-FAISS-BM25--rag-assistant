How to do one-vs-one classification for logistic regression?

I have a dataset with 4 clases and I want to apply logistic regression with one-vs-one classification. So, first I train for each pair of classes a logistic regression classifier (i.e. calculate the weights (theta)). Then, for a new data point I apply all the previously trained classifiers and take the class with the most votes as the winning class. But how should I handle ties, i.e. when two or more classes have the same amount of votes? Should I just pick the class with the heighest weight (theta) among these classes or should I sum up the weights (theta) for these classes and then pick the class with the highest value?
