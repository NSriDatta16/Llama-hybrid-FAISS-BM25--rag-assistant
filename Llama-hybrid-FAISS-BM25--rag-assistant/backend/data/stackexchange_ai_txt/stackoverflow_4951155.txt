You need to run your program after the monitor starts: > vsinstr /coverage hello.exe > start vsperfmon /coverage /output:mytestrun.coverage > hello.exe > vsperfcmd /shutdown When you run step 3, you should see some notification in vsperfmon.exe that hello.exe has started. If you plan on doing multiple test runs, you only need to run steps 2-4. In other words, you only need to instrument your binary (step 1) once after it's built.
