What do we learn from training a dataset for logistic regression

What do we learn from training our dataset in Logistic Resgression? Like in Linear Regression, with the help of training set we are able to generate a best fit line(y = mx+c) where m and c come from training our dataset. Similarly, once we train our model for logistic regression, what is that the model learns which is then used to predict a class for a particular input?
