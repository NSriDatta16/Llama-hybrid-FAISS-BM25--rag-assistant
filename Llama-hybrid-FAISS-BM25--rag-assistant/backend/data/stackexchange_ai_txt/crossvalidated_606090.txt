(Quick note: $p$ is properly the ratio of positive responses in the population . The ratio estimated from your sample is $\hat p$ .) Both calculators are probably assuming $p=0.5$ . This gives a "safe" or "conservative" upper bound on the margin of error, because (to use the Qualtrics site's notation) the margin of error $$MOE = Z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$ is maximized by $p=0.5$ . Imagine plotting the parabola $p(1-p)$ ; it has a peak at $p=0.5$ . If you happen to be in a situation where you have good prior knowledge that $p$ is likely to be much closer to 0 or 1, you could plug that in instead of 0.5, and get a smaller MOE. ...but in practice, users who aren't statistically savvy might just plug in different guesses of $p$ until the calculator tells them they can get the MOE they want with just a tiny $n$ , and then make up a story to justify why this $p$ is reasonable. I have to respect Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey for discouraging users from shooting themselves in the foot this way.
