i would recommend using a user control that has two textboxes, one for the whole number part, one for the decimal part. it looks like an inelegant solution but if your software needs to work on clients with different regional settings, the standard thousand seperator and decimal seperator might cause a problem in the future. limiting the number of characters on the textbox with decimal part will solve your problem. i would also recommend jquery for masked textbox formatting which is much more elegant than asp.net standard masked input controls. http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
