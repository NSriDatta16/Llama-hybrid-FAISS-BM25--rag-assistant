How to reposition UILabels and UIImageViews whose dimensions change dynamically?

I have a UITableView with many rows that push a DetailViewController depending on the selection. This detail view contains a UIImageView , and several UILabels (let's say book description, book comments etc). In viewWillAppear I assign the proper content to these outlets, in order to display content for the selected row. My problem is that the text might be one sentence, or a couple of paragraphs. So, if I have one outlet for book description and one other for book comments, how am I supposed to position these components properly, so that their horizontal distance is always the same? I thought of creating a UIWebView and load there dynamically generated HTML, but there has to be a cleaner way, right?? Here is a visual something if that helps :) ------------------------------ | Description | | [multiple lines go here] | | | | [Image] | | | | Comments | | [multiple lines go here] | ------------------------------
