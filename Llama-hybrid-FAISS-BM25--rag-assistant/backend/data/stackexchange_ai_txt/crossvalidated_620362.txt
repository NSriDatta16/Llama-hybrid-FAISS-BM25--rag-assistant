Bayesian inference based on a 3$\times$3 contingency table

How do I make inferences about population parameters based on a 3 $\times$ 3 table of observations? In "Bernoulli's Fallacy", Aubrey Clayton provides this (Table 5.8). Democrat Republican Unaffiliated Total High income 2 6 2 10 Middle incom 4 1 0 5 Low income 6 3 1 10 Total 12 10 3 25 Let $(h_D, m_D, l_D)$ be the proportions of high-, middle-, and low-income individuals among Democrats, and let $(h _R, m_R, l_R)$ and $(h_U, m_U, l_U)$ represent these same proportions among Republicans and unaffiliated persons, respectively. We can say the probability of observing the values given in the table is proportional to $$h_D^2 m_D^4 l_D^6 \cdot h_R^6m_R^1l_R^3 \cdot h_U^2m_U^0l_U^1$$ About the prior distribution: "...we give each triple the independent uniform prior distribution representing a state of information where all we know is that the proportions add up to 1." Based on the posterior distribution: $P(h_R > h_D) \approx 0.97$ $P(l_D > (l_R + m_R)) \approx 0.51$ $P(| h_U - h_D | How do I reproduce these calculations? Does this mean using something like a symmetric Dirichlet prior with concentration parameter = 1? Do I get a Dirichlet posterior distribution? If so, how do I get the above probabilities out of it? If this requires statistical software, I can try in R. I appreciate any advice or a book reference for how to do calculations like this.
