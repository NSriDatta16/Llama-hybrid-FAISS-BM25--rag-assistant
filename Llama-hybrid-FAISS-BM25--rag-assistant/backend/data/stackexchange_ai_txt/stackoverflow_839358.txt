If I understand correctly what you want to do, I don't think that it's possible. You will have to try some other way. Plugins have dependencies on other plugins. Fragments don't exist as separate runtime entities, but only as extensions of a plugin. So your plugin can only refer to the 'editor' plugin. Classes provided by a fragment can't (and shouldn't) be accessed directly. They can be returned by the original plugin (A) if they are implementing an executable extension provided by plugin A. If you refer to the fragment's code from another plugin (B), the classes will be loaded by plugin B's classloader and be different from the ones that are loaded by plugin A. What is the purpose of your fragment? Do you want to get access to internal code in plugin A? Do you want to extend an eclipse editor? If you want to extend functionality that the original plugin is not exposing as extensible, I think the only way is to write a plugin, extend the editor class from the original plugin, register it alongside the original one and use it instead. [Edit] Maybe this link will explain better: Eclipse FAQ Hope this helps, Vlad
