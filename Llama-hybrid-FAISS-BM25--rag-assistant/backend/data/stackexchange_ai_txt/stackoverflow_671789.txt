What is known as a clustered index in SQL Server world is in Oracle world called an Index Organized Table. Table metadata is available in the all_tables or user_tables system views described here . My guess after skimming that link is that you can determine that a table is index-organized by checking whether the IOT_TYPE column is non-null.
