Clarification regarding ActiveX cab Version

I'm building CAB for ActiveX contol and I need the following clarification: I've control.ocx which have 2.0.0.1 version. When I'm embedding my control I'm putting the following tag: Tommorow, I'm adding new functionality to my ocx and versing it as 3.0.0.1 How my tag should look like? Should it content codebase="control.cab#Version=3,0,0,1" attribute? Is it correct? Can I set version for cab file? How can I tell my client to update my ActiveX component? Best regards, Danny.
