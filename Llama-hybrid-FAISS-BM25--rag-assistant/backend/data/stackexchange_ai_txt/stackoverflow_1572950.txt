How to make jQuery draggable with fixed X and Y axis?

I am wondering if there is a way to make the jQuery draggable to only drag straight up, down and left, right. I want to prevent the user from dragging a div diagonally. Using the grid option in the draggable UI is not possible in my situation. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement How is this possible? Thanks!
