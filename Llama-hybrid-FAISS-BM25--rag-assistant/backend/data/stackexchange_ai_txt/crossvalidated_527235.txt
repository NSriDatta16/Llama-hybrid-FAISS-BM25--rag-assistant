How to interpret axis of UMAP?

Hi in PCA one can interpret the level of variance with x vs y, with x often times explaining much of the variance. As one plot higher dimensions the variance percent would go down. My question is, are the axis in UMAP plots similar. What does it mean when the axis is -5 to 2 vs something that is -10 to 15? thanks!
