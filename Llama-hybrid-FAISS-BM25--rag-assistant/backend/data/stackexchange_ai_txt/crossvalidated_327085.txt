What attributes to apply laplace smoothing in naive bayes classifier?

I am reading naive Bayes classifier from the book "Data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques". The example of naive Bayes is given using the below dataset. As ( Outlook =Overcast | Play =No) has 0 counts, the book suggests using Laplace smoothing. For this, I have to add 1 to numerator and 3 to the denominator (as there are 3 different outlooks. I understand this part). Now my question is do I have to use Laplace smoothing on ( Outlook | Play =Yes) too? Do I have to use Laplace smoothing for other attributes too? Or using Laplace smoothing on only the attributes that have 0 count enough? (in this case ( Outlook | Play =No)).
