One simple way to do this is bootstrapping . I.e. draw samples with replacement, fit your regression equations for each bootstrap sample, calculate the quantities you are interested in for each bootstrap sample and then obtain hypothesis tests/confidence intervals from this bootstrap distribution for these quantities. Another standard approach for this type of situation is to derive standard errors for the quantities of interest using the delta method and some software would do this for you automatically (e.g. PROC NLMIXED in SAS). If your software does not do this for you automatically, then bootstrapping should require much less effort on your part and might be attractive for that reason alone. For either approach the right transformation of the parameters may matter - especially for small sample sizes. E.g. it would typically be better to work with a log-odds than a probability, even if you are interested in the probability (in which case you would derive a confidence interval/test for the log-odds and back-transform afterwards). This should also be pretty straightforward to do, if you were willing to be Bayesian and to specify some reasonable vague priors on the individual model parameters. You would get any desired posterior probabilities simply from calculating how often any condition you are interested in holds for the set of MCMC samples you obtain.
