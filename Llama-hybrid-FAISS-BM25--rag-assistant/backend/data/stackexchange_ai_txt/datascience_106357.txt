extracting data from unstructured pdfs

I have about 200,000 PDFs made up of 20 different designs. i.e In an organization, different (20) departments issue monthly award submission requirements. Each department has its own document format. These documents are collected by the organization. Now I need to extract the paragraphs, bullet points, or sentences from each of these PDFs, organize it properly, specify if it is a requirement or not (label the data), and store it in storage. This process needs to be repeatable/automated for any future PDF. A lot of the pdfs are not structured, have no tags or bookmarks, have no table of content. I want to know what is the best technique or method for handling this type of problem?
