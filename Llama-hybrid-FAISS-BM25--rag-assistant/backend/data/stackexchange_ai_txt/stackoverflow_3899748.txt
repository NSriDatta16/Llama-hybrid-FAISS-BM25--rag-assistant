How to reuse common subelements of a custom UITableViewCell with iOS Interface Builder?

I have several custom UITableViewCell , which share a lot of common subelements. I tried creating a UIView and using it as a subview for all the table cells, but obviously this wouldn't work, since entities in IB are object instances, not classes or templates. How can I capture these common subelements in a custom control and drag it into all table cells? Ideally it would be a solution where one doesn't have to muck around with programmatic Nib loading and whatnot.
