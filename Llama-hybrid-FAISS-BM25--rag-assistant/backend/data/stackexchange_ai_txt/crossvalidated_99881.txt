How to export and use results of PCA from R?

My ultimate goal is to run a cluster analysis on a data set with > 1 million records. The input variables for the cluster analysis will be the results of a Principal Component Analysis, as well as other variables not included in the PCA, for a total of maybe 10 variables input into the clustering (the variables I input into the PCA were all very highly correlated with one another while the other variables are not so I chose not to include them in the PCA). #read data mydata From the results, I have decided I would like to retain the first three components, which capture ~87% of the total variance in the dataset. Now I want to extract/save/export these first three components for use in the cluster analysis with my other variables. How do I do this?
