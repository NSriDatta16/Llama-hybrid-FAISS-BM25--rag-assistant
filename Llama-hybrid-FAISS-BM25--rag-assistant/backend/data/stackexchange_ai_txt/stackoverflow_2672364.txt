If I understand correctly, you've got an instance of SecondViewController with secondView connected to an instance of UIWebView in Interface Builder. What you want to do is call goToPage on that instance of SecondViewController from RedDragonAppDelegate . (In particular, note that I'm talking about instances of these--I believe this is the underlying issue.) In tabBarController:didSelectViewController: , when you do SecondViewController * sv = [[SecondViewController alloc] init]; , you are creating a new instance of SecondViewController and you can call its goToPage method, but sv is not the same instance of SecondViewController that appears in Interface Builder and has secondView connected to the UIWebView (that is, when you create a new instance of SecondViewController , the ivar secondView is unset and seems to be nil , but I don't know that it's guaranteed to be nil ). What you probably(*) want to do is add IBOutlet SecondViewController *sv; to the @interface of RedDragonAppDelegate , make sure that you have an instance of RedDragonAppDelegate in Interface Builder, connect the new IBOutlet sv of RedDragonAppDelegate to the instance of SecondViewController in Interface Builder, and delete the line in tabBarController:didSelectViewController: that defines and initializes sv . (*) I'm not 100% certain on this because I don't do iPhone stuff and I don't know how your various views/objects/etc. are arranged in XIB/NIB files, but if everything's in one XIB/NIB file, I'm pretty sure it'll work.
