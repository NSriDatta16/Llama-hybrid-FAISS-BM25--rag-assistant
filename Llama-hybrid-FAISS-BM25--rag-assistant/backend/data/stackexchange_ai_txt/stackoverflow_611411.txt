Make sure you set all required CURL options: CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true, CURLOPT_HEADER => false, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION => true, CURLOPT_ENCODING => "", CURLOPT_USERAGENT => "spider", CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER => true, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT => 120, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 120, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10, I will also suggest you echo out errors also using something like this: $hostconnect = curl_init($url); $errmsgcurl = curl_error($hostconnect); echo $errmsgcurl; The above code is not tested and it just serves as an example. Also would suggest trying out your code on a local apache server this way you can tell where the problem sits easily.
