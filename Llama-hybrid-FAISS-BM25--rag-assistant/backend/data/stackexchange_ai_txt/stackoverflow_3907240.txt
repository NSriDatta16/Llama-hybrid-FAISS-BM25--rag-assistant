Django Monthly/quartarly grouping of DateField() data

I've got a django model which contains, among other things, a DateField() attribute: class Table(): date = models.DateField() value = models.FloatField() I'm writing a view that groups this data by week, month Quarter and year. I've hardcoded a calculation that gets my monthly value simply enough - by adding up all the values in that month and deviding by how many entries there were - but I feel like there must be a more elegant way of doing this. What I'm aiming for is something like this: get_monthly(Table.objects.all()) >>> [123, 412, 123, 534, 234, 423, 312, 412, 123, 534, 234, 423] get_quarterly(Table.objects.all()) >>> [123, 412, 123, 534] Where the values in the list are averages of each month. Can anyone help me?
