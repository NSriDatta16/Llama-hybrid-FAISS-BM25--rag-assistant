I'd strongly recommend running with warnings as errors as much as possible, and certainly in all the code you're writing yourself. It is way eaiser to fix the warnings here and now, than wait until later and try to do them all in one pass. There are several reasons why you want to run with warnings as errors: The majority of warnings actually indicate that there is a problem with your code. If you have a lot of warnings, you won't notice if a new one appears in the middle. I've seen this happen a lot. If there is a warning which you think is bogus or you for some reason just can't fix it right away, you can switch it off. Use the /w option or suitable #pragma. Note that you can switch it of for only a particular file, or even in a particular place in your code. If you still want a notice when compiling, but a #pragma message there. If there is code which is outside of your control, but you just have to compile it into your program, switch of warnings for that particular module or source file, or even run it without /WX. Chances are you aren't modifying the code anyway, so point 2 is probably not so relevant. I really cannot see any valid reasons for not running with /WX (or -Werror).
