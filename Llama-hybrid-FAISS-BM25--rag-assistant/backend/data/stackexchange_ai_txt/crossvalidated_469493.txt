Capacity and expressivity of a neural network

How exactly is the capacity of a NN related to its expressivity ? However informal their usage may be, do these terms refer to one and the same concept? or is there a subtle difference between them? Some definitions: E.g. for neural network capacity : "Informally a model's capacity is its ability to fit a wide variety of functions. Models with low capacity may struggle to fit the training set. Models with high capacity can overfit by memorizing properties of the training set that do not serve them well on the test set" E.g. for neural network expressivity : "The fundamental question of neural network expressivity; how the architectural properties of a NN (depth, width, layer type) affect the resulting functions it can compute, and its ensuing performance"
