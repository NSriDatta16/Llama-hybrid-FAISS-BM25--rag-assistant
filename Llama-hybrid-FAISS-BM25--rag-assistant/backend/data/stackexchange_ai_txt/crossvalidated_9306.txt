STFT statistical analysis

I am using the evolfft function in the RSEIS R package to do a STFT analysis of a signal. The signal is one hour long and it was acquired during 3 different conditions, in particular 0-20' control, 20'-40' stimulus, 40'-60' after stimulus. Visually, I see a change in the spectrogram during these 3 periods, with higher frequency and increased FFT power during the treatment, but I was wondering whether there was some kind of statistical analysis I could do to "put some numbers" on it. Any suggestion? EDIT: as suggested I will add an example of the data I'm dealing with The treatment is between 20' and 40', as you can see it produces an increase in the power of the FFT over a fairly wide range of frequencies. I have 50-60 of these STFT for each experiment (for 10 total experiments). I can average the spectra for each experiments and still get a similar type of pattern. Now, my problem is how to correctly quantify the data I have and possibly do some stats to compare before, during and after the treatment.
