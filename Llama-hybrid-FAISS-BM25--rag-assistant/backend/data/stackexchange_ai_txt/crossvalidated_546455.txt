Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and idiosyncratic components may be easier than you think. Suppose our dates are in years since 2020, so that $t=0.0$ is January 1, 2020, $t=1.0$ is January 1, 2021, and $t=1.5$ is July 1, 2021. Trend and Seasonality We can analyze seasonality with sines and cosines, which is especially simple when the maximum and minimum seasons are six months apart. We get both trend and seasonality for such a time series $y_t$ using a linear regression of the form $$y_t = a + bt + c\sin(2\pi t) + d\cos(2\pi t)$$ A significant $b$ in the equation can show significant trend, and a significant $c$ or $d$ can show significant seasonality, if the model is not invalidated by autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, or nonnormality. By using a two-argument arctan function like atan2 in R or math.atan2 in Python), we can also rewrite the equation as $$y_t = a + bt + \sqrt{c^2+d^2}\cos(2\pi t - \arctan(c,d))$$ Then the peak month in this model is roughly $\text{round}(1/2+6\arctan(c,d)/\pi)$ , and we can classify the seasonalities by those months. Cyclicality and More Terms For a cycle starting at time $0$ , we can detect a combination of trend, seasonality and cyclicality by adding the term $$e(1-\cos(2\pi t/p))$$ to the regression, where $e$ is the coefficient to be fit, and $p$ is the period of the cycle (in years). E.g. we can model the current solar cycle , which has an estimated period of $p=11$ years, and started with minimal sunspots at the beginning of 2020. We can extend this model easily for cyclicality starting at other times, for trends that speed up or slow down, and for seasonality where the maximum and minimum have different shapes. If this gives us more significant coefficients, then some clustering analysis may be useful. Meanwhile, the basic analysis above is practical and can already give some insight.
