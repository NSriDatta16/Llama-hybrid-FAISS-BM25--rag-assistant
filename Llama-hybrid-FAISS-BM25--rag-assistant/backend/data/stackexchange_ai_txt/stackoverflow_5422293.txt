Magento :: Categories and Subcategories

Please anyone can help me how to design category and subcategory listing as below http://www.officemax.com.au/office-supplies/writing.html PS:: Magento default design is when you click a category it will list all products in that category straight. What I really want to do is , it should list all the subcategories first in the page like the above sample site http://www.officemax.com.au/office-supplies/writing.html and then list all relevent products of that subcategories I will greatly appreciate if some one can help me.
