How Can I Move An UIImageView Around In A UIScrollView?

In my application, I have a UIImageView inside a UIScrollView. I want to zoom and drag the UIImageView. I managed to do the zooming but I can't seem to find a way to drag the image inside the UIScrollView using touchesMoved. I have Googled around but it seems that the only method I have found was only possible in iOS 3.0+ but is now obsolete in iOS 4.0+. So how can I drag an image with my finger that is inside a UIScrollView?
