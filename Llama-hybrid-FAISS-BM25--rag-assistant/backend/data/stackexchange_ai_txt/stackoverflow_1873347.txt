From a normalization point of view I'd say have a base table and implement an IS-A relationship between your tables (so that would be "separate tables"). From a pragmatic and performance-oriented point of view I'd say you better use one table for all of them and have a column like type or something similar. Your first logic example doesn't make sense. What if the guy logs in, gets the 50 records and promptly adds another friend? No information for that guy... Thus, I'd go with your second suggestion.
