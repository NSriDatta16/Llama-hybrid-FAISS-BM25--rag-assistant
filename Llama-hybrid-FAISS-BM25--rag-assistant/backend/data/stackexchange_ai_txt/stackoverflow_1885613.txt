OpenNLP has Named Entity recognition. Check the section English Name Finding in the docs. But my experience suggests, it identifies entities but there are no tags associated with it. (To be precise, I found the tags to ambiguously assigned.) So, if you have the sentence "My friend Joe Smith went to the Walmart store", OpenNLP identifies two named entities - "Joe Smith" and "Walmart". I couldn't get it tag "Joe Smith" as Person and "Walmart" as Organization. As suggested by Matt, you can try LingPipe, though it's a commercial tool. Some of the open source alternatives are MorphAdorner and Stanford NER .
