First of all you should reconsider organization of your data model. You've named sqlite on one hand and a global array on the other. I would point you to Core Data to store your parsed data in a convenient way. Finally all you need is to query the Core Data db and fetch what you need. This would be more memory efficient than storing your data in a global array. Have a look at Apple's Core Data tutorial or at this nice turorial: "superdb-core-data-app-with-sections" To share a managed object context you can use a singleton. Have a look at this blog post , it provides a solution without a singleton by passing references of the managed object context down the relevant objects. It is created in the app delegate.
