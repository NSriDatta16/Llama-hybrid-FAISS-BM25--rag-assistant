The way it encourages you to hardcode HTML strings is one of my pet hates with jQuery. I generally just end up using the standard Javascript : document.createElement('TD') If you are creating a lot of nodes of the same type it's best/faster to cache them and use cloneNode(true) to create the new nodes: var nodeCache; nodeCache.td = document.createElement('TD') var newTD = nodeCache.td.cloneNode(true); I understand this isn't makeing much use of jQuery but I think jQuery's way of handling this is inelegant.
