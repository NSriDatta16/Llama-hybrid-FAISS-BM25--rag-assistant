Multicollinearity for ordered logistic regression

How is multicollinearity calcuated for an ordered logistic regression if R^2 is not determined for this type of regression? Because the formula for vif says: 1/(1-R^2) In R the looking up ?vif says that the polr function in MASS package can be sued to determine vif. However in the regression summary of polr R^2 is not determined. So I just got a bit confused. Anyone that can help me to clarify and understand this in an easy way? Any kind of source would also help.. I could not find a good one.
