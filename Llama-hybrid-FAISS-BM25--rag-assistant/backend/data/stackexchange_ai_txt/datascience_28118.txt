Have you spent any time exploring your data descriptively? Have you look at at simple counts and percentages of emails opened vs not opened by year, month, day, and perhaps time of day? The reason I'm asking is that you may find some answers simply by conducting an exploratory analysis and reviewing descriptives before you jump into modeling. With regard to modeling, you could start with a logistic regression model where the outcome is email opened (1) vs email not opened (0). I don't think you should include email not sent as you do not need to predict that action; you know if the email was sent or not. For your predictors, you could partition your datetimes into multiple features, such as month, day, time of day, year, etc. You could also consider including additional predictors in your model, such as recipients' age, gender, location, etc., if these data are available to you.
