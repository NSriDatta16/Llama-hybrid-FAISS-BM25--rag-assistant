What should I be careful when using the word "supervised" in paper writing?

I am a biologist using machine learning tool for my research. I modified matrix decomposition ( $V \approx WH$ ) to fit my data and wanted to describe about that in my paper. If I fixed one matrix factor ( $W$ ), can I write the following sentences? The dictionary ( $W$ ) is supervised This is a supervised method I think 1. is correct because the dictionary is given/supervised. However, 2. is wrong because I do not aim to train the method with the labeled data. So, here is unsupervised learning but the dictionary is provided (as hyperparameter?). What should I be careful when writing the word "supervised" in interdisciplinary research paper?
