The saga is not over yet it seems. I eventually ended up turning everything into a ragged array of int . But with that is lost the idea of items in a line which the self-referential mechanism behind the triplets was depending on. Am now looking into using Euphoria rather than C, because of its superior support for ragged arrays. One can build standard DLLs with Euphoria and, once I figure out how to hand back a variant array of BSTR and write a Typelib ... Mind you, I suppose I could stick with C and store triplets as just three ints in a row, and store the strings as pointers cast as integers. And that would save me a rather large rewrite of the VBScript that built the self-referential dictionary in the first place.
