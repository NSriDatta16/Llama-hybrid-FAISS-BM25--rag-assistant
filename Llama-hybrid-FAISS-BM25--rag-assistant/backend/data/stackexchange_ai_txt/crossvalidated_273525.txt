Matched DiD - Should we match at the baseline and hold matching constant?

I have panel data (both ex-ante and post-ante data) and want to examine the effect of a policy change on my treatment group relative to the control group through a matched DiD test using propensity scores. How should the matching be conducted when you do a DiD? Should you match control and treatment at the baseline and then hold the matching fixed throughout the experiment? My concern is that ordinary PSM-tools in stata like psmatch2 might match treatment individuals ex-ante with control individuals ex-post. Dataset: I have panel data with a time series of 3 years before the event (t=0) and 3 years after (t=1). Do you have any suggestions on how to conduct this experiment? Many thanks!
