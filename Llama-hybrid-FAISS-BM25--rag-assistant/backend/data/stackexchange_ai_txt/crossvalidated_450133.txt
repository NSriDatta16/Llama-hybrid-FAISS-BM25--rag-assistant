There are a couple of issues in this example that lead to the strange-looking predictions. Non-stationary (i.e. explosive) behavior Short time series The first problem is that the autoregression model assumes the data fluctuates around a stable mean value. This is not true of your data, which appears to increase something like exponentially. The second problem is that you have a short time series, so the risk of overfitting is high. The combination of these two things means that the model is severely overfitting your data. As usual, this leads to very poor out-of-sample performance. In particular, the fit method selects the order of the autoregression. In this case, it is selecting an AR(6) model. Since you have only 8 datapoints, this is pretty good evidence of overfitting. Note that AR models typically perform better than this, even with short samples, but since your data is non-stationary, it is not an appropriate model for your data. You would be better off with a simpler model, like an exponential smoothing model, or by modeling your data with e.g. a linear trend, e.g.: mod = sm.tsa.SARIMAX([1,7,8,20,59,133,223,247], order=(1, 0, 0), trend='t') res = mod.fit() res.forecast(3) which gives array([290.63186209, 336.18574776, 383.12951135]) You could alternatively take differences to make your data stationary.
