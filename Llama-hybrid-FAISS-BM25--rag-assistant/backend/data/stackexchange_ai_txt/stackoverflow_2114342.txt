Convert this SQL query to Linq (Not Exists + sub query)

I would like this SQL to be converted to LINQ. (it shouldl select rows from input which do not exist in table production based on 3 columns. If a column in both tables contains NULL, it should be considered as having the same value) SELECT i.* FROM INPUT AS i WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT p.Agent FROM Production AS p WHERE ISNULL(i.CustID,'') <> ISNULL(p.CustID,'') AND ISNULL(i.CustName,'') <> ISNULL(p.CustName,'') AND ISNULL(i.household,'') <> ISNULL(p.Household,''))
