I suppose it looks like this: site name page name section some stuff different paragraph a list next section different stuff ... you could iterate over all direct children of html. At first h3 you start collection all subsequent items until the next h3. if a next h3 comes or page end you create a div, and add it after the starting h3 all collected elements should be removed from their parent (the html) and added as children of the div. looking at http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing this should be easy. I'm not an expert on jquery, but it should be doable.
