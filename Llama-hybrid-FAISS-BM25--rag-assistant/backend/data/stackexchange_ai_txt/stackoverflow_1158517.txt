Most scripting languages allow embedding in C and usually allow you to expose certain objects or even functions from your C code to the script so it can manipulate the objects and call the functions. As said Lua is designed for this purpose; embedding, using the interpreter you can expose objects to the script and call lua functions from C, search for embedding lua in C and you should find a lot of information, also don't miss the lua manual section "The Application Programming Interface" Although Python is more suitable for stand-alone usage, it can also be embedded, it can be useful in case your scripts use the vast amount libraries provided with Python.
