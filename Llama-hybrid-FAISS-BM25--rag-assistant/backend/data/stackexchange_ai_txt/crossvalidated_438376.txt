Prove that $E[e^{2(m−1)X^2}]\le m$

I'm reading " Understanding Machine Learning: From theory to algorithms ". The problem is as follows, which is Exercise 31.1 of the book on page 416. Let $X$ be a random variable that satisﬁes $P[X \ge\epsilon]\le e^{−2m\epsilon^2}$ . Prove that $E[e^{2(m−1)X^2}]\le m$ .
