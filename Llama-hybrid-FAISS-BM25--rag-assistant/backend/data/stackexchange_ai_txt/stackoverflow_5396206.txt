This code expects DB to be on this location: mnt\sdcard\SMSconfApp1\SMSconfApp1 First, App Dir is constructed as : File appDbDir = new File( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "SMSconfApp1"); This would result in : mnt\sdcard\SMSconfApp1\ , later once DB File Name is added it becomes mnt\sdcard\SMSconfApp1\SMSconfApp
