You are thinking around the correct lines. When you designing your solution around a specific platform you should target the encapsulate the dependencies in a way that the consumer of the platform specific functionality is shielded from the implementation.This is where you do things like Create abtraction to the platform intefaces. Use IOC containers or any other approach to decouple components. Clearly seperating the plaform related code from other logic. For example if using Azure storage library keep the storage handling code in a seperate project altogether. Easier said than done, but same holds good for Azure too. If the team is aware of these facts during design and development, you can have a solution which can be migrated to any virtualization platform.
