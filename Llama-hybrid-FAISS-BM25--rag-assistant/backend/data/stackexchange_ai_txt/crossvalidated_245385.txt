How to make a confusion matrix when testing a model on data with only positive cases?

I have recently encountered a problem with the function confusionMatrix in R from the caret package regarding a machine learning procedure. In detail, I have trained a binary classifier with two levels ("Cancer" & "Normal") and I'm trying to test it in independent datasets. However, one of my test datasets had represented only one of the levels regarding the response variable - that is only cancer samples. So, final.classes.xgb.gse and my "true labels"-reference for this dataset factor variable: head(test.labels.gse) [1] Cancer Cancer Cancer Cancer Cancer Cancer Levels: Cancer But when I type: confuse.mat.gse18088 Is there a way to solve this ? As this test dataset has only samples belonging to only one class of the two?
