How can I let Non-Transformed Values through Scikit-Learn's Column Transformer?

I'm working with a heterogenous dataset that includes numerical and categorical columns. I want to use Scikit-Learn's ColumnTransformer to OneHotEncode the categorical data, however, ColumnTransformer will only recombine the columns that I apply a transformer to. I don't want to apply a transformer to the numerical columns, how can I let the non-transformed values through the function unchanged and included in the output?
