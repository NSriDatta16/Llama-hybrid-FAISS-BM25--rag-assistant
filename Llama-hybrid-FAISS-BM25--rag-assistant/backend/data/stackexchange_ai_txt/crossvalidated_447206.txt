Statistical method to control for differences

here's a problem I am trying to solve with no luck so far. Say I am working off two different horse racing tracks - Track A and Track B for a racing distance of 1200m. I have race time information on a historical basis for both the tracks. I can easily compute the pars/averages for each track : Mean(RaceTime). I can also easily compute the pars/averages adjusted for the class rating (a discrete variable where 1 = higher quality races and 5 = lower quality races) by doing group_by(RaceClass) %>% mutate(RaceTime_cls_adjusted = mean(RaceTime)). That's the easy bit. What I am trying to achieve thou is derive a rating or a score that might be comparable across Track A & Track B AND across different race class. The subtle difference here is that Track A always has higher quality races so the pars are lower compared to Track B. This subtle difference could be tracked by the class rating system (i.e Track A might have races from class 1 to 5 where Track B might just have races from class 3 to 5). What's the best statistical way of controlling these effects? Regards
