Testing REST webservices

My organization is working on building RESTful webservices on JBoss appserver. The QA team is used to testing SOAP webservices so far using SoapUI. SoapUI has a new version that has REST capabilities. We're considering using that. Are there any publicly available RESTful services available on the net for free that someone could test ? What tools are available(and used) for testing RESTful web services ?
