Consolidating separate Loan, Purchase & Sales tables into one transaction table

INFORMIX-SE with ISQL 7.3: I have separate tables for Loan, Purchase & Sales transactions. Each tables rows are joined to their respective customer rows by: customer.id [serial] = loan.foreign_id [integer]; = purchase.foreign_id [integer]; = sale.foreign_id [integer]; I would like to consolidate the three tables into one table called "transaction", where a column "transaction.trx_type" [char(1)] {L=Loan, P=Purchase, S=Sale} identifies the transaction type. Is this a good idea or is it better to keep them in separate tables? Storage space is not a concern, I think it would be easier programming & user=wise to have all types of transactions under one table.
