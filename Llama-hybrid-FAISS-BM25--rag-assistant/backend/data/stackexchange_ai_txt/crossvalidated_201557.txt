model fit in logistic regression

I have developed a model for simple logistic regression with 1 independent ordinal variable and 4 binary independent variables. The model gives 64% correctly predicted cases, a Nagelkerke r2 of 12% and Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.125. I used forward stepwise LR where all variables were included in the equation, but if I leave out one of the variables I get 68% correctly predicted cases, nagelkerke 25% and Hosmer Lemeshow 0.450. Would you stick to the first model or in this circumstance leave out the variable for a better fit of the model...?
