magento bundle product displaying as out of stock

I have created a bundle product in Magento 1.4.0.1. All the components of the bundle are in stock but when the bundle is displayed on the front end, it shows as out of stock? How do I get that product to display "in stock"? In the admin system, there isn't an option to add inventory for the bundle, so I guess the stock level is worked out from the component parts (if at all?) - perhaps using the lowest stock count of a component item as the basis for the stock level of the entire bundle? I really don't want that to happen (if it is?). I just need the bundle to display as in stock. Can anyone help?
