Book to understand time series, then use it for forecasting

I want a deep, mathematical understanding of time series (at the level of a statistics major). I intend to use this knowledge for forecasting for fun (probably in finance but can branch out). Where should I start? I'm looking for a brief outline of what to do, e.g. learn book A, then learn book B, then try predict C using D. Please provide (at least) a brief reason for your recommendations! :)
