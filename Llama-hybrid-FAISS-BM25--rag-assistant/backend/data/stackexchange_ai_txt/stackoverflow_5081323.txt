how to avoid 'operation not permitted' with sudo command from hudson

I am trying to run a bash script on a MacOSX Node (master is on windows) through hudson, but get 'Operation not permitted' when script invokes sudo command ( su as well). I added the following line to /etc/sudoers: 'user' ALL:(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 'user' is logged on the Mac Node, java agent started with the same user. still getting this error... any idea ?
