I used this document a couple of times to move from a SQL Server database to another, and if you follow each steps, it is pretty straightforward. One of the steps is really important, the step #5 describe that some basic security information is given to SQLAccessGroup. If it's not done, the entire process does not work. Also the agent jobs are rarely created automatically. So keep in mind that they should be backed up, and restored on the new server. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910044/ . The CRM deployment should work without it, but will become slower as the database is growing.
