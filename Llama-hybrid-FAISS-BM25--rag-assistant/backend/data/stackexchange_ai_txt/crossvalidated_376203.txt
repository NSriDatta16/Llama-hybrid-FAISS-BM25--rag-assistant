categorical_encoding in h2o - what is the difference between the options

I'm trying to understand the pros/cons and when to use the various encoding options that are available to me in h2o with the parameter 'categorical_encoding'. It would be helpful if people could point out general rules of thumb on how to use this. Typically I use the 'Enum' value because I like how all categorical values are grouped together when looking at feature importance. On the other hand, xgboost's default value is 'label-encoder' I believe, which breaks things up by categorical level/value. Unfortunately, I don't really know where to begin or questions to ask around these other values available: one hot internal one hot explicit sort_by_response enum_limited enum label encoder Again, I primarily stick with enum, sometimes label-encoder, but honestly I don't know practical implications of these various options. Would love a generalized understanding of when one might be better than other from someone knowledgeable !
