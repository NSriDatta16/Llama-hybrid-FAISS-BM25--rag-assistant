Testing for overdispersion in logistic regression

R in Action (Kabacoff, 2011) suggests the following routine to test for overdispersion in a logistic regression: Fit logistic regression using binomial distribution: model_binom Fit logistic regression using quasibinomial distribution: model_overdispersed Use chi-squared to test for overdispersion: pchisq(summary(model_overdispersed)$dispersion * model_binom$df.residual, model_binom$df.residual, lower = F) # [1] 0.7949171 Could somebody explain how and why the chi-squared distribution is being used to test for overdispersion here? The p-value is 0.79 - how does this show that overdispersion is not a problem in the binomial distribution model?
