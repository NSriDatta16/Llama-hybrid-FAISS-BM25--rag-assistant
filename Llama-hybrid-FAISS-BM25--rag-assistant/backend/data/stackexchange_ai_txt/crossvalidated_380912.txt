Statistics in medicine, any literature recommendations?

I work in the field of medicine as Ph.D. student. My primary work right now is modeling. And the more I get into it, and its statistics, I can see that I lack a lot, and what I have done, and others (not statisticians) are sometimes invalid, or at least it could be done better due to wrong assumptions, wrong tests, and so on. As stated, I am really focused on this now, but the people I am usually around are not really "good" at statistics. They know the basics, as many do, but then not much more. I am not saying I want to become a statistician (since that in general would a new Master's), but I would like to be come a bit better than the average user of statistics. So could anyone recommend some great literature on stuff primarily used in the field of medicine? As of now I am going through Frank Harrell's "Regression Modeling Strategies", which I find pretty good so far. But I would also maybe like something a bit more digestive, if possible?
