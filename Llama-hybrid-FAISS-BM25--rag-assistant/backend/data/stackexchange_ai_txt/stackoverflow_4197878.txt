Adding Customers to Magento in raw SQL

I'm new to Magento, and I want to add customer details to the customer_entity table of Magento. My question is, if I run the following query (via PHP): INSERT INTO `customer_entity` ('entity_type_id', attribute_set_id, foo, bar, baz) values ('some', 'placeholder', 'values')" ); Is that enough to create a proper Customer record? When I look at the databse, I see a lot of tables related to customers, such as customer_entity_datetime customer_entity_decimal customer_entity_int customer_entity_text customer_entity_varchar customer_group I'm trying to produce a script which is not connected to the Magento code. It should be independent, but I want it to be able to insert customers in the Magento tables. How I can do this?
