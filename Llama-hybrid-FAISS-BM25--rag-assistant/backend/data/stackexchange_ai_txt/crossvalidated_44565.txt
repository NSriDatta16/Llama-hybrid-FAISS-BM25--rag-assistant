Probably the best thing to remember is that SVM training algorithms are trying to find the best classifier to your training data, and they're usually doing that by solving a convex program. Another way to put it is that they're essentially just doing math -- they can't figure out what's "right" at a higher, more intuitive level. They can't take information into account that isn't encoded in the problem. When dealing with SVM algorithms, the data that you feed them and the labels that you assign are all they get. What that means with zero classifier coefficients is that there is probably an equivalent or better predictor of your data present in the other features (i.e., it's redundant). It may not be an intuitively obvious choice, but it's a choice that that particular algorithm found. A different algorithm (e.g., LibLinear) may have something different to say. It's best to judge a trained classifier quantitatively, for example with test set accuracy or a different, testable measure.
