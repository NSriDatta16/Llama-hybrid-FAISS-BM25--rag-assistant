Difference between various linear regression implementations

Aim: To find the coefficients for the regression line (hyperplane in case of multiple variables?) that models the data best. Let's call this w What is the difference between: 1) Estimating using MAP: $w=(XX^T+\lambda I )^{-1}Xy^T$ where $X$ is the input training data and $y$ is the training outputs and 2) Using a neural network to perform regression (I don't know how this is implemented) (and any other method used for linear regression)
