git-svn pushing existing repository mapping usernames the other way

My team and I are currently working on a university project. We were given the project but it hadn't officially started, so we began work in GIT to get a head start. The coordinator of the project has now forced us to use SVN so I am attempting to use git-svn to interface the two repositories. I can move our commits into the svn repository by .git/info/grafts so that is not the issue. My problem is that in our course we are given participation marks which are based on our commit histories. However obviously all of our commits have my svn username because I moved them across (which im not sure would please my team mates very much). I have looked into the git authors file, but as far as I can tell it is only used for the reverse lookup. Now I understand that with ssh+svn I would obviously need their ssh logins (we may be willing to go to this extreme though) to spoof this information, however I have access to the repository via file:// if that helps. So to summaries: I need "git svn dcommit" to map git authors to their respective svn usernames and if possible (less important) have the date information correct. One caveat on that is a few authors on git have multiple git authors (which have already made commits) so I need to be able to map multiple git authors to a single svn username. Thanks in advance for any help provided :)
