Git: branch has lost its history?

Something wierd has happened — my develop branch has lost all it's history till the last commit. Can anyone suggest the reason? Last things I've done — installed that forked brotherbard GitX and started to use it (primarily for history viewing, but also tried to do on merge). But before develop was staring from master and going in parallel, 'feature-shape-fill' branch was merged into develop two times. I also did git stash in develop. Right now git log for develop branch just shows the last commit. Doesn't says anything like 'detached'. * I'm already afraid of GitX (official and this fork), since last weeks smth wierd happened aswell — binary .fla file hasn't been saved for the past evening in several commits. All the text files were fine, but that binary was like 4 commits behind. Other working directory wasn't updating at all while switching between branches (I was working in console and git didn't said about any error, it was fine to him). Donno if it's smth to do with gitx? upd: Looks like the same problem mentioned here http://groups.google.com/group/gitx/browse_thread/thread/71a0f759d115fee5 Here's what I got: $ git reflog 157cfca HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill to develop 46a6163 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from develop to feature-shape-fill 157cfca HEAD@{2}: commit: Rotated drag tip 7f6c394 HEAD@{3}: commit: TextShapesCanvas is working, 4765eed HEAD@{4}: merge feature-shape-fill: Merge made by recursive. ed44a2c HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill to develop 46a6163 HEAD@{6}: commit: More tight packaging (thnx to TextLineMetrics), 59b6d2d HEAD@{7}: checkout: moving from develop to feature-shape-fill ed44a2c HEAD@{8}: merge feature-shape-fill: Merge made by recursive. 67d08b3 HEAD@{9}: commit: Basic grid functionality, need to add text shapes and fix resize-generation 505479c HEAD@{10}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill to develop 59b6d2d HEAD@{11}: commit (amend): Simple retrovirus non-optomized algorithm 5ec1b70 HEAD@{12}: commit: Simple retrovirus non-optomized algorithm b9eaf18 HEAD@{13}: commit: The most ugly suitable version of fill algorithm 757f1b7 HEAD@{14}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill-predefined to feature-shape-fill 757f1b7 HEAD@{15}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill to feature-shape-fill-predefined 757f1b7 HEAD@{16}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill-auto to feature-shape-fill b8e284f HEAD@{17}: commit: Auto fill first steps 757f1b7 HEAD@{18}: checkout: moving from feature-shape-fill to feature-shape-fill-auto 757f1b7 HEAD@{19}: commit: Test document created, components::TextShape base draft 505479c HEAD@{20}: checkout: moving from develop to feature-shape-fill 505479c HEAD@{21}: checkout: moving from master to develop Looks like they are not lost, but how to get my history back?
