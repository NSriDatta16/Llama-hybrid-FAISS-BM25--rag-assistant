Clustering is done on unlabelled data returning a label for each datapoint. Classification requires labels. Therefore you first cluster your data and save the resulting cluster labels. Then you train a classifier using these labels as a target variable. By saving the labels you effectively seperate the steps of clustering and classification. This enables you to use any classification algorithm (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, ....). The problematic part of this pipeline is the lack of robustness of the kmeans algorithm. Therefore you will have to evaluate the clustering result and possibly repetitivly perform k-means. Alternatively you could use other clustering algortihms and compare results.
