Normalized Data vs. Non Normalized Data in SVM Training

Im training an SVM on a dataset containing 17000 events with 30 features. as I see it, this amount of features against the dataset size should suffice by itself for avoiding overfitting. Im training an RBF kernel and I get somewhat strange results. Im pretty sure my training flow is correct, so it is not the main issue. The main issue is the difference between normalized to non normalized data and it's effect on the training error. Here is what I do: Im training a classifier with 'rbf' kernel, C is 16 and gamma is 8. Im checking the training error by plotting the ROC on the training set. Im doing this once for the original data, and once for the normalized data (I normalize by removing the average and dividing by (max-min) for each column) I get the following graphs: For normed data: For the original Data: This is quit different. Any ideas why it is like that?
