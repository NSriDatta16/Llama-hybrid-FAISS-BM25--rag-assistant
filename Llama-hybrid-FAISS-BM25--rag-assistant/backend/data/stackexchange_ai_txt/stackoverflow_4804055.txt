Get the Network Interface Name in C#

I'm writing a program which uses the wPCAP library. I managed to get out the list of interface names: \Device\NPF_{A9734063-CA83-4D91-A35B-CC727749256A ... Now my question is: how do I know which interface this is? I'm attempting to get the IP of the interface with that name. I tried the NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces() function, but in those classes I could only find the "readable" name, and not the \Device... name. Thank you! Yvan Edit: I need to get the IP address of the device with the name "\Device\NPF_...". How do I accomplish this?
