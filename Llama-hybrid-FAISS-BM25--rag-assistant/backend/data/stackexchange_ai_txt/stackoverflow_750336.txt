Is STL vector a better version of realloc?

In C++, I believe, a better way of dealing with reallocation is to use a STL vectors, as it guarantees the contiguous storage locations. I have couple question to understand the difference: Is there any scenario in which I need to prefer realloc over vector ? Is there anything else ( apart from vector ) which is equivalent to realloc in C++?
