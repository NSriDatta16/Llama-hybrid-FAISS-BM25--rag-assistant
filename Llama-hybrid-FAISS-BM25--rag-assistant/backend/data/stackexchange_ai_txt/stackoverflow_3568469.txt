Stop thinking in terms of SQL. Start thinking in terms of Magento's Models. Magento's models just happen to use SQL as a backend. Querying for things via raw SQL is possible, but is going to vary from version to version of the Magento, and may differ depending on the backend you're using. Run the following from a test controller action, or somewhere else you can execute Magento code from. It queries the model for products with no image //this builds a collection that's analagous to //select * from products where image = 'no_selection' $products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('image', 'no_selection'); foreach($products as $product) { echo $product->getSku() . " has no image \n \n"; //var_dump($product->getData()); //uncomment to see all product attributes //remove ->addAttributeToFilter('image', 'no_selection'); //from above to see all images and get an idea of //the things you may query for }
