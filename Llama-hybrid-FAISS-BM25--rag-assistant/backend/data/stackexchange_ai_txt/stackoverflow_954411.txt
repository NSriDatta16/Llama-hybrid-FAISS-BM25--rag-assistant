The "uplink" port on your SOHO switch is internally crossed over. It relieves you of having to use a crossover cable to connect two switches. That is the only difference. BTW: There isn't a "this goes out to the internet" port on SOHO switches either. You're confusing switches and routers/gateways. This confusion may be encouraged by manufacturers putting the two logically separate devices in one piece of hardware, e.g., a router with a 4-port switch. While we're at it, a wireless router w/ 4 port switch is actually logically three separate devices (router, switch, and access point). BTW #2: A switch (well, except for layer 3 switches, which arguably are only switches to the marketing department) actually learns where MAC addresses are. It neither knows about nor cares about IP.
