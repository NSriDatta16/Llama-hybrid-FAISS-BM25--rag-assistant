Multiple Dates Query

I need help in creating a query to get info for year selected and previous year of the year selected. Needs to be by quarter(QTR) for both years. QTR1 will always be the month 03, QTR2 month 06, QTR3 month 09, & QTR4 month 12. No computations are required or averaging. Fields/columns are YEARMONTH stored as mm/dd/yyyy with dd always being 01, ACTUAL_MONTH(float)for all QTRs based on current YEARMONTH selected and one year prior,TARGET_MONTH(float) for all QTRs based on YEARMONTH selected, and PROJECTION_MONTH(float) for all QTRs based YEARMONTH selected. Table YEARMONTH (PK, Datetime) ACTUAL_MONTH(Float) TARGET_MONTH(Float) PROJECTION_MONTH(Float) Should look like this if any YearMonth in 2010 was selected Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 09-Actual xxx xxx xxx xxx 10-Actual xxx xxx xxx xxx 10-Target xxx xxx xxx xxx 10-Projection xxx xxx xxx xxx
