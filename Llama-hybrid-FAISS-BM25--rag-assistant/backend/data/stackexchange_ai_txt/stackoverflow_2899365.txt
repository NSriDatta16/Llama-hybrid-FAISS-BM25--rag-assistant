Well if you mean the 'ABC' then they split into two sequences a-z and A-Z, the simplest way I think would be to use a char variable and to increment the index by one. char letter='c'; letter++; // (letter=='d') same goes for decrement: char letter='c'; letter--; // (letter=='b') thing is that the representation of the letters a-z are 97-122 and A-Z are 65-90, so if the case of the letter is important you need to pay attention to it.
