An easy one to try would be average ranks, where you take the mean of the ranks for each feature. For your example, $ \begin{array}{cc} \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Avg. Rank} \\ 1 & 1.5 \\ 3 & 2 \\ 2 & 2.5 \\ 4 & 4 \\ \end{array} $ You could also weight the ranks by the size of the dataset, if the datasets that you are testing on are not the same size.
