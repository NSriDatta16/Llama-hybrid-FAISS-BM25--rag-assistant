You should not have that [self.tableView reloadData] there when using a NSFetchedResultsController . When you delete an object, the right NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate method will be called for you, where you should take care of updating your table view. Create an empty Navigation-based Application and check the Use Core Data for Storage checkbox. What you will get is an empty project that does all this correct. It will be a good example.
