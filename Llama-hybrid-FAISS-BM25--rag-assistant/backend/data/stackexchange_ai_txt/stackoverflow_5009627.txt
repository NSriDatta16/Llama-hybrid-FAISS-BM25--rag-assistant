In computing, memory refers to the physical devices used to store programs (sequences of instructions) or data (e.g. program state information) on a temporary or permanent basis for use in a computer or other digital electronic device. The term primary memory is used for the information in physical systems which function at high-speed (i.e. RAM), as a distinction from secondary memory, which are physical devices for program and data storage which are slow to access but offer higher memory capacity. Check the tag ram for more details. Primary memory stored on secondary memory is called "virtual memory", which can be seen under the tag virtual-memory . An important facet of programming is the interaction with a computer's memory. For specific issues with memory management, check the memory-management tag.
