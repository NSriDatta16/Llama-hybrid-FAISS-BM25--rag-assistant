Enabling Foreign key constraints in SQLite

I'm using SQLite with C# and have some tables with foreign keys defined. Now, I know that by default foreign key constraints are not enforced in SQLite, but I'd like to turn them ON. Is it possible to do this through code? I have looked up a related question , but I'm not sure how to do it through C# code. I'm using the latest plug-in of SQLite available for Visual Studio 2008 for designing my tables. conn.Open(); SQLiteCommand cmd = new SQLiteCommand("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON", conn); cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); conn.Close(); I need this change to persist when this connection is reopened. Is it possible?
