GridView problems with touchlisteners

I'm trying to create a custom GridView but i'm having troubles with the touch listeners. What i want to do: Create a GridView with custom Views . Longpress on an item so it becomes 'editable'. Drag the view horizontal or vertical to move it's position in the GridView . Here's where i'm having trouble: I'm implementing GestureDetector.OnGestureListener for the longpress functions, because for some reason using the gridview.setOnItemLongClickListener() isn't working when overriding the onTouchEvent() of the GridView itself (Which i need for the dragging part). So everything is fine at this point. Now i only need to know when the longpress is finished. So i though: "Well this shouldn't be hard." I couldn't have be more wrong. I've fiddled around for quite some time with this and it looks like using different touch events isn't helping me :/ When stepping through the onTouchEvent() i noticed that only 1 action is given: MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN . So what am i doing wrong? i need the MotionEvent.ACTION_UP ...
