Japanese text garbled while passing to a http restlet service

I have a Perl client which is calling an http restlet service (put method). Some of the parameters in this call contain japanese text. When I printed the contents of these request parameters in the restlet service I found these chars garbled ! This is my PERL client code: my %request_headers = ( 'DocumentName' => $document_name, --> This name is a JAPANESE String 'DocumentDescription' => 'Test Japanese Chars', 'content-length' => 200, 'Content-Type' => 'application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8', 'User-Agent' => "JPCharTester", ); $s->write_request('PUT', '/test-document/TEST/TEST_DOCUMENT' , %request_headers, $content); in this call both the values of $context and $document_name are JAPANESE Strings. But ONLY the document_name is received as garbled in my backend service. Here goes the Service code: String URL_ENCODING = "UTF-8"; String documentName = requestHeaders.getFirstValue("DocumentName"); System.out.println("Encoded Document Name : "+documentName+" documentName is garbled here try { documentName = URLDecoder.decode(documentName, URL_ENCODING); System.out.println(>>> Decoded Document Name : "+documentName+" documentName is garbled here } catch (java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException ex) { throwException(ex.getMessage(), Status.SERVER_ERROR_INTERNAL, ex); } both the above log statements printed GARBLED TEXT !! Can someone tell me what is the mistake I am doing and how to fix this ? Thanks in advance for your help. Regards, Satish.
