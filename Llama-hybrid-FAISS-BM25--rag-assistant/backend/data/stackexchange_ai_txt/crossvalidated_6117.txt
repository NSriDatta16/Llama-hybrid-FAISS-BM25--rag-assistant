This question appears to confuse two distinct things. Any additional parameter in the model would (by definition) describe the distribution of $i$, not the distributions of any of the $w_i$. Unless you adopt a Bayesian prior for $\vec{w}$ (which does not seem to be part of this question), the parameters do not have any distribution at all: they are what they are. When you use a particular procedure to estimate $\vec{w}$, however, then the estimates $(\hat{w_i})$ do have a distribution. It makes sense to talk about the variance of that distribution. It can be estimated in standard ways, such as the inverse of the expectation of the Hessian of the log likelihood . It is unnecessary--and meaningless--to introduce yet another parameter to capture that information.
