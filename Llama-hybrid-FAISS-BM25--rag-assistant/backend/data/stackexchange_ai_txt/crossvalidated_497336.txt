It is probably not easy to exactly compute the distribution. For instance, when $\theta = 1$ then $\bar X$ follows the Bates distribution . That is not easy to integrate over. However, we can approximate the mean by using a simulation or by using a function that approximates the distribution. Using an approximation of the distribution We can approximate the mean of $n$ variables $\bar{X}$ by another beta distribution that matches the mean and variance. For this approximate distribution we have the following parameters $$\begin{array}{} \alpha'&=&\alpha\frac{\alpha n+2n-1}{\alpha+1}\\ \beta'&=&\frac{\alpha n+2n-1}{\alpha+1} \end{array} $$ The mean will be then $$E\left[\frac{\bar X}{1- \bar X}\right] \approx \frac{\alpha'}{\beta'-1}$$ You should be able to derive this by using integration. I just looked it up from a table. We can do this because the variable $X/(1-X)$ is distributed as the beta prime distribution. Simulation With this method we simply simulate a large sample of $\bar{X}/(1-\bar{X})$ and compute the sample mean. If the variance of $\bar{X}/(1-\bar{X})$ is finite then this simulation will get as close as we want. Coding and comparison For $\theta = 3$ and $n=10$ we get the following distribution of $\bar{X}/(1-\bar{X})$ . The histogram is the simulation and the curve is the approximate distribution with $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ . The results give values > sum(x/(1-x))/m [1] 3.273982 > aprox/(bprox-1) [1] 3.266667 which are very close. set.seed(1) theta = 3 m = 10^4 ### sample size for simulation n = 10 ### number of variables to average ### average of 10 beta variables x
