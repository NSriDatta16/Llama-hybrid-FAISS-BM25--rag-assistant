Calculating VC-dimension of a neural network

If I have some fixed non-recurrent (DAG) topology (fixed set of nodes and edges, but the learning algorithm can vary the weight on the edges) of sigmoid neurons with $n$ input neurons which can only take strings in $\{-1,1\}^n$ as input and lead to one output (that outputs a real value that we round up to 1 or down to -1 if it is a certain fixed threshold away from 0). Is there any fast way to compute (or approximate) the VC-dimension of this network? Notes I asked a slightly more precise algorithmic reformulation on CS.SE: Efficiently computing or approximating the VC-dimension of a neural network
