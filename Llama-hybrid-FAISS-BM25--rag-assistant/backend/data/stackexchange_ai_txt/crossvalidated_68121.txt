The log-rank test compares the observed and expected (under $H_0$) number of events in the two groups. It will have low power, when the observed number of events matches the expected one even though the survival functions are not the same. A typical scenario for this is when the survival curves cross: one group has more events early on, the other has more events later, and the overall number of events balances out. You might be interested in the following paper by Logan et al, 2008 .
