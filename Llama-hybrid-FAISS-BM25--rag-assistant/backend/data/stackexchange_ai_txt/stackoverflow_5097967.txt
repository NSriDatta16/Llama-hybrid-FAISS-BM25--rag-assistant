Try this instead of your if/else structure: function body(year:String):String { switch(year) { case "future": return " saw a flying saucer and descided they wanted do be an alien."; break; case "colonial": return " just got off the the Mayflower and descided they wanted to eat some turkey."; break; case "roman": return " are taking a break after a fierce battle with the Romans."; break; case "medieval": return " saved the princess in shining armor after slaying the dragon."; break; case "fail": return " just got an F on their exam."; break; default: return " just got an F on their test."; break; } } You weren't exactly checking against the parameter, so it defaulted to "future" every time. It works with this function supplanting the previous version.
