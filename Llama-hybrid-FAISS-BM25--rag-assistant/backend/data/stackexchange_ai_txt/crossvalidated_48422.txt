Variance of log-odds probabilities

I am wondering how I could express the variance of log-odds into understandable terms. For example the variance in the log-odds of crime being reported to the police between neighbourhoods is 0.07 (0.01), and the mean log-odds is -0.65 (0.03). Just transforming this variance to probability given me 0.51. So if the probabilities have a variation of 0.51, the standard deviation is then 0.7, which would make the 95% coverage bound wider than 1, which is impossible for probabilities. Another idea was to calculate the 95% coverage bounds of my log-odds: $(-0.65) +/- [1.96\sqrt{0.07}] = [-1.19, -0.15]$ If I transform these to probabilities: $\exp(x)/[1+\exp(x)] = [0.23,0.46]$ So the chance of a crime being reported to the police can vary from 23% to 46%. So the 95% range is actually only 0.23 or 23%. Could someone explain me why this first calculation was wrong, and whether the second is correct? Would you have any other suggestions on how to make this variance more graspable?
