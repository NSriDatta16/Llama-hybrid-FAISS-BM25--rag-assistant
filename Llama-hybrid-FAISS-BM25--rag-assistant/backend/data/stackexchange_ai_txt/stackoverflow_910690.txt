I was just about to suggest the border trick (that you posted yourself). Another thing that I usually do is that I hook up event handler for the MouseEnter and MouseLeave events for the Splitter control, and add this code there: private void Splitter_MouseEnter(object sender, EventArgs e) { ((Splitter)sender).BackColor = SystemColors.ControlDark; } private void Splitter_MouseLeave(object sender, EventArgs e) { ((Splitter)sender).BackColor = SystemColors.Control; } That way the Splitter "lights up" (or rather, shadows down...) when the mouse passes it, drawing attention to that there is a control that you can interact with there.
