In fact, you can build the whole database without real FKs in mysql. If you're using MyISAM as a storage engine, the FKs aren't real anyway. You can nevertheless do all the joins you like, as long as the join keys match. Performance impact depends on how much data you stuff into a referenced table. It takes extra time if you have a FK in a table and insert data into it, or update a FK value. Upon insertion or modification, the FK needs to be looked up in the referenced table to ensure the reference integrity. On highly used tables which don't really need reference integrity, I'd just stick with loose columns instead of FKs. AFAIK InnoDB is currently the only one supporting real foreign keys (unless MySQL 5.5 got new or updated storage engines which support them as well). Storage engines like MyISAM do support the syntax, but don't actually validate the referential integrity.
