I think i would go something like: ROC * ( HDT * HDD^2 * LOC^(1/2) )^(-1) * (ln(HFII / HFIB) + 1) ROC - readability of code HDT - hours of development time ( or hard is do develop n amount of code ) HDD - hours of debug time ( or how hard is to debug n amount of code ) LOC - lines of code HFII - how fast it is HFIB - how fast it needs to be This is problem specific metric. So you would need to get average over several typical problems. Any suggestions to make formula better are welcome.
