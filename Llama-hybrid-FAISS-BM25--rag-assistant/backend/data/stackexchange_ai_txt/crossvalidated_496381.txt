From the description in the question and the comments, it appears that a mixed effects model with random intercepts for subjects would be the preferred analysis model for these data. However, given the small number of subjects, this is not appropriate within the usual frequentist paradigm. So, I would suggest fitting fixed effects for subjects (ie just a linear model, within random effects), which will also control for the non-independence of observations within subjects. I might also consider a Bayesian mixed model approach with random effects for subjects if I knew what intra-class correlation was likely, in order to set a reasonable prior on the variance of the random intercepts for subject (this might be available from prior studies).
