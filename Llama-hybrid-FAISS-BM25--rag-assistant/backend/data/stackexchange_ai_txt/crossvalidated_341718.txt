I don't really understand your experiment at the moment - what exactly is "cumulative ecological value", and how do you calculate it? My suggestion would be that you rarefy your data back to the lowest sample size. Rarefying involves randomly removing trees from your plots, so that all samples have the lowest number of trees (43 in your case), and can therefore be compared. You can use the function rrarefy in the R package, "vegan". An alternative would be to estimate the total cumulative ecological value of each plot before comparing them. People sometimes do this when comparing species richness of sites, estimating the number of 'unseen' species using estimates such as Chao or ACE (also in the vegan R package), although I think rarefying is seen as a more conservative option.
