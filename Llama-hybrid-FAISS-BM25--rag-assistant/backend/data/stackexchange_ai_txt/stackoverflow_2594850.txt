Interfacing my application with existing authentication systems

I'm writing a web based application that will have its own authorization/authentication mechanism (traditional cookie/session based user/pass). However, depending on the organization that licenses the software, I want them to be able to plug in their own existing internal authentication system as a way to replace mine. Ideally, they'd have to run as little code as possible on their end; I'm trying to make this a mostly hosted service. I'm aware of the existence of OAuth, but don't entirely understand how I would go about implementing the system at a higher level. Any tips would be appreciated.
