Is the GA R package the best Genetic Algorithm package?

I am learning about Data Science and I love the Healthcare part. That's why I have started a blog and my third entry is about using Genetic Algorithm for solving NP-Problems. This post is https://datasciencecgp.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/the-amazing-genetic-algorithms/ I have some expertise with GA package solving problems like the TSP, but do you know any most powerful R package? Thanks so much!
