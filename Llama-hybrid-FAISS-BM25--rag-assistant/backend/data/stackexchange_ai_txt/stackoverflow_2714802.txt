Valid Dates in AppEngine forms (Beginner)

In AppEngine, I have a form that prompts a user for a date. The problem is that when the clicks enter there is an error: "Enter a Valid Date" How do I make my Form accept (for example) %d-%b-%Y as the date format? Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this? # Model and Forms class Task(db.Model): name=db.StringProperty() due=db.DateProperty() class TaskForm(djangoforms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Task # my get function has the following. # using "now" for example. Could just as well be next Friday. tmStart = datetime.now() form = TaskForm(initial={'due': tmStart.strftime("%d-%b-%Y")}) template_values = {'form': form }
