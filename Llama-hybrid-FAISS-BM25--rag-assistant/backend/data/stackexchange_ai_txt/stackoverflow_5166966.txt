Consecutive XML HTTP Requests seem to block on Google App Engine

I am working on an application on Google App Engine. Roughly this is what I do: The user screen is split into 2 parts (actually 3, but lets leave that out for now). The left part (this takes upto 75% of the screen) has a document with some words highlighted. When one of these highlighted words are clicked the right part displays various meanings of it, example usage etc. The way this works is clicking the word send an XML HTTP Request to the server, where the sample usage(s)/meaning(s) are retrieved from the datastore. This data is returned and displayed. My problem: After I click on a few words consecutively, the application seems to "hang" - say, I click on 5 words in quick succession, clicking on the 6th word (or any word after that) doesn't replace the info regarding the 5th word on my right panel. Since some data store columns (at least single valued properties) are indexed by default I'm guessing retrieval is not the bottleneck here. It is probably the requests. Is such an issue known with the GAE? Any workarounds possible? Kind of in a soup with this - the application was supposed to go live today. Urgent help required! Thanks! :)
