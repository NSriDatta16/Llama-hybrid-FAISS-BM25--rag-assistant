I have the SCJP certification, and the Sierra book was sufficient for me. I never worried about the JLS or particular implementations of the JVM. There are some questions, particularly about concurrency, where the correct answer is that one cannot know the output, as it depends on the JVM. In such cases, if you were an expert in a particular JVM implementation, it could actually hurt you. If you find it difficult to remember some of the test items, then you should probably practice writing code the uses those items, until it seems more natural. Finally, don't be discouraged if you fail the mock exams included with the Sierra book. They are absolutely brutal. I think I barely failed all three, and then smoked the real exam. The important thing isn't passing the mock exams, but giving them your best shot, and then coming to understand why you missed each question.
