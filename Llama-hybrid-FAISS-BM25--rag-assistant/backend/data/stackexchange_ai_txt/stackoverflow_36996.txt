If you want results you can rely on you need to make the testing scenario as realistic as possible, which makes option 1 by far your best bet. As you point out if you get results that aren't good enough with the other options you won't be sure that it wasn't due to the different database behaviour. How you generate the data will depend to a large degree on the problem domain. Can you take data sets from multiple customers and merge them into a single mega-dataset? If the data is time series then maybe it can be duplicated over a different range.
