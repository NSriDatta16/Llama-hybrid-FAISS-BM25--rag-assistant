Maybe you could start by actually and precisely defining what you want to do with your data. Apparently you'd like to predict some probability for each type of alert (which I assume is given by the TYPE column), and find which one gets the highest probability (that boiling down to finding what type of alert is the most likely to happen in a given time interval). Well if it's what you want to do, maybe have a look a time series forecasting ? May be an starting point... Considering the fact that you only have nominal qualitative variables, some kind of one-hot-encoding maybe could help with clustering, for example you could encode each variable for each observation, then compute cosine similarities. That would be a way of getting a glance at a kind of distance between your observations... even it's a very basic idea.
