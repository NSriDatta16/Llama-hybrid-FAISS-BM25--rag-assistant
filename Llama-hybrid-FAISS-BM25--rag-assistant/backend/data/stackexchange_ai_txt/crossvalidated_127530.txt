Resources to deal with non-stationary data

I am currently reading Introduction to Statistical Learning, and Applied Predictive Modelling. I'm also doing the John Hopkins course on Data Science. I haven't completed any of these yet. But one thing that seems to be common is that they all deal with well behaved data sets where the out-of-sample data behave the same as in-sample data. In most instances this makes sense. In biological data expressions are going to be similar or mostly the same. But I am working with very non-stationary data, specifically financial data. To give an example, usually profitable companies perform better than unprofitable companies. Except in 1999 when unprofitable companies outforformed profitable companies by 98%. A seemly conservative and safe strategy of going long (owning) profitable companies and going short (simplistically owning negative numbers of shares of) unprofitable companies would have lost 98%. For the next 3 years the markets rectified this with absolute vengeance, unprofitable companies were slaughtered. However this is hard to model because of the non-stationary nature. Are there any good resources on the Internet or in book form for how to deal with non-stationary data? For instance even the simplest of questions, should I use the most accurate models (random forest, svm etc) or looser models, I don't even know the answer to this?
