SideBySide error on another computer with MSVC++ 2005 installed

I'm having some strange issues building and running a project on another computer. It's a side-by-side error. Usually the cause is that c++ redistributable is not installed on the machine etc. However in this case the project is compiled on that machine. MSVC++ 2005 is installed, the runtimes should be there (I installed the runtime again for good measure anyway). Why is the linker referencing a runtime library that isn't available on the machine? I'm dynamically linking to runtime library. Any ideas on how to debug this issue? Thanks. EDIT I didn't want to start another post because it's related. Because of this DLL version mess, is this a good reason to statically link to runtime? Will I avoid all these problems? I don't see any advantages to dynamically link to runtime any more. I was under the impression that with DLL runtime you get the benefit of updates/bug fixes with new DLLs. However because of the SxS and manifests it ensures that it loads the specific version (old version) of the DLL anyway? So what's the point of dynamic runtime at all? Maybe a few kb of space saved because you're not embedding the re-used functions in all the dependent libraries. But compare this to the cost of your app won't run because some ancient runtime version is removed from the machine, isn't it worth it? Thanks again. Still tracing the original problems and will probably have to recompile every single library I'm using.
