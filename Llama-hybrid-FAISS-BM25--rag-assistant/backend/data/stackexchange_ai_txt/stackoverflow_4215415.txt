Edit: A simple example of a POP3 server can be found here: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/534131-pypopper-python-pop3-server/ You will have to replace the message serving mechanism, but you would need to do that anyway. For an IMAP server implementation using Twisted, see https://github.com/davglass/twimapd . If you want email, then you're looking at SMTP, POP and IMAP. That's what email is by definition. Actually, for delivery, SMTP should be enough; POP/IMAP is for retrieval and is not really that useful if your applications can always connect to each other directly. If you don't need to use email specifically, you might want to look into alternative protocols, such as XMPP (Jabber): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol
