You have a partitioning issue, but you are not alone, everyone who adopts SOA comes up against this problem. How best to organize or partition my system into relevant pieces? For me, Roger Sessions is talking the most sense around this topic, and guys like Microsoft are listening in a big way. The papers that changed my thinking in this can be found at http://www.objectwatch.com/whitepapers/ABetterPath-Final.pdf , but I really recommend his book Simple Architectures for Complex enterprises. In that book he introduces equivalence relations from set theory and how they relate to the partitioning of service contracts. In a nutshell, The rules to formulating partitions can be summarized into five laws: Partitions must be true partitions. a. Items live in one partition only, ever. Partitions must be appropriate to the problem at hand. a. Partitions only minimize complexity when they are appropriate to the problem at hand, e.g. a clothing store organized by color would have little value to customers looking for what they want. The number of subsets must be appropriate. a. Studies show that there seems to be an optimum number of items in a subset, adding more subsets, thus reducing the number of items in each subset, has very little effect on complexity, but reducing the number of subsets, thus increasing the number of elements in each subset seems to add to complexity. The number seems to sit in the range 3 – 12, with 3 – 5 being optimal. The size of the subsets must be roughly equal a. The size of the subsets and their importance in the overall partition must be roughly equivalent. The interaction between the subsets must be minimal and well defined. a. A reduction in complexity is dependent on minimizing both the number and nature of interactions between subsets of the partition. Do not stress to much if at first you get it wrong, the SOA Manifesto tell us we should value Evolutionary refinement over pursuit of initial perfection . Good luck
