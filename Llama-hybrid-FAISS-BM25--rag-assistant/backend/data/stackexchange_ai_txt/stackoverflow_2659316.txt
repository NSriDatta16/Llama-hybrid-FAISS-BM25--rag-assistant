One of the classic ways to get embedded stuff like that is to use a WYSIWYG editor like TinyMCE . I've used the plugin TinyMCE and there is also TinyMCE Plus . There are probably plugins for TinyMCE itself to handle some of the embedding stuff. If you start to allow some tags in your body posts, make sure you are protecting yourself from scripting attacks etc, with something like sanitize to clean up tags you don't want to allow. Make sure you read about XSS and HTML/JavaScript injection .
