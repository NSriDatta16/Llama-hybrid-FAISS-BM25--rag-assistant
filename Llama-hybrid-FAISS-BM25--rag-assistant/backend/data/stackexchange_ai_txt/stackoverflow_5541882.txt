RFC-3986 is the authority regarding URIs. Appendix B provides this regex to break one down into its components: re_3986 = r"^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?" # Where: # scheme = $2 # authority = $4 # path = $5 # query = $7 # fragment = $9 Here is an enhanced (and commented) regex (in Python syntax) which utilizes named capture groups: re_3986_enhanced = re.compile(r""" # Parse and capture RFC-3986 Generic URI components. ^ # anchor to beginning of string (?: (?P [^:/?#\s]+): )? # capture optional scheme (?://(?P [^/?#\s]*) )? # capture optional authority (?P [^?#\s]*) # capture required path (?:\?(?P [^#\s]*) )? # capture optional query (?:\#(?P [^\s]*) )? # capture optional fragment $ # anchor to end of string """, re.MULTILINE | re.VERBOSE) For more information regarding the picking apart and validation of a URI according to RFC-3986, you may want to take a look at an article I've been working on: Regular Expression URI Validation
