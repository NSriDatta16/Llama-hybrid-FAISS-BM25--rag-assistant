The Jacobian formula does produce the density of the transform: when $\alpha=\Psi(\theta)$ , $$f_\alpha(\alpha)=f_\theta(\Psi^{-1}(\alpha))\left|\frac{\text d\Psi^{-1}(\alpha)}{\text d\alpha}\right|.$$ But, once the MCMC simulation is over, the Jacobian has no role to play whatsoever. Namely, if $x_1,\ldots,x_T$ is an MCMC sample from $\pi$ then $\Psi(x_1),\ldots,\Psi(x_T)$ is a sample from $\Psi_*(\pi)$ , the pushforward measure. This is also why the average $$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T h(\theta^{(t)})$$ is a converging estimator of $\mathbb E[h(\theta)]$ which is both the expectation of the random variable $\alpha=h(\theta)$ and the expectation of the transform by $h$ of the random variable $\theta$ .
