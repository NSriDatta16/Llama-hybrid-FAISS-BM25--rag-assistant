The package stsm is now available on CRAN. The package offers some utilities to fit the basic structural time series model. The packages mentioned in other answers provide flexible interfaces to cast a broad range of time series models in state-space form and give sound implementations of the Kalman filter. However, in my view, little attention is given to the procedure that optimizes the likelihood function. A general purpose algorithm --the L-BFGS-B algorithm-- is typically used. The stsm package enhances the standard procedure and provides specific algorithms to fit the basic structural model. Further details are given in the the document provided with the package. For a quick example you can also see this post .
