Language Modelling using Neural Networks

I plan to make a Language Model in Python using Neural Networks. I've read that Neural Networks need vectors as input. One common vector representation in NLP is the Bag of Words model. Given a corpus with thousands of sentences, I could make a Bag of Words model out of it. However, I don't know what to do next or how to make the network output probabilities for a given sequences of words.
