Your example code is nonsense, it tries to print a variable which is nothing like the one that I think you intended. If you wanted to print it, you would either need to print ${'Air nike'} or just reuse what you already have: $$name As the comments to the question have mentioned, from your description this does not seem like something you should really be using in your script. As for a good time to use these 'variable variables', arguably never. It is probably best to ignore them until such a time, if it ever comes, where you see a clear and pragmatic need (not use ) for them.
