You can take a look at these articles that deal with multiple regression when the dependent variable is circular, or spherical. The approach is based on the projected normal distribution. Hernandez-Stumpfhauser, Daniel, F. Jay Breidt, and Mark J. van der Woerd. "The general projected normal distribution of arbitrary dimension: modeling and Bayesian inference." Bayesian Analysis 12.1 (2017): 113-133. Wang, Fangpo, and Alan E. Gelfand. "Directional data analysis under the general projected normal distribution." Statistical methodology 10.1 (2013): 113-127 Nuñez-Antonio, Gabriel, Eduardo Gutiérrez-Peña, and Gabriel Escarela. "A Bayesian regression model for circular data based on the projected normal distribution." Statistical Modelling 11.3 (2011): 185-201. Presnell, Brett, Scott P. Morrison, and Ramon C. Littell. "Projected multivariate linear models for directional data." Journal of the American Statistical Association 93.443 (1998): 1068-1077. This last one was the first one to come out using this projected normal approach
