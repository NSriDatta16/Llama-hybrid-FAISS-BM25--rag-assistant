I'd suggest that Abstraction is about paying attention to the details that are relevant and ignoring the rest. Say you want to hire a chef. You do want to pay attention to Training What kinds of food can s/he cook How good is the presentation of the food How will s/he interact with the rest of the team How well is the food cooked But, you don't need to pay attention to Hair color Tattoos How well he can paint Nasal hair His/Her girlfriend's piercings And so on.
