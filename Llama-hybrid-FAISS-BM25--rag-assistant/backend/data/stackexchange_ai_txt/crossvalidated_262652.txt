First you need to know the size of the population (n) that you are considering: are you one person in one hundred, one thousand, one million? I guess you will assume that when a crime happens, every person is as likely to be the victim? Then you need to sum over all the possible outcomes of number of crimes times their probability and multiply by $\frac{1}{n}$: $$P(X|\mu,n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^\infty i*f_{Poisson}(i|\mu) = \frac{\mu}{n}$$ with X the event of you falling victim to a crime and $f_{Poisson}$ the density function of the Poisson disribution. As you see from the last equality this is just the average number of criminal events per month $\mu$ divided by the size of your population n. Keep in mind that the assumption of equal probability of being a victim is most probably wrong. You are merely calculating the average probability of a randomly drawn individual from your population .
