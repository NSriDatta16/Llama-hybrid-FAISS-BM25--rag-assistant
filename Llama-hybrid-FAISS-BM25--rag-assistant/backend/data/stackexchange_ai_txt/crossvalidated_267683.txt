What is actually being maximized in the fitting of a logistic regression?

When a logistic regression is being fit to a set of data, what is the actual value that is being maximized? What I mean is, as the coefficients are being determined, what criterion is being used to determine the "best fitting model"? Is it: the number of cases that are correctly classified based on the calculated Y value for each case? Thanks!
