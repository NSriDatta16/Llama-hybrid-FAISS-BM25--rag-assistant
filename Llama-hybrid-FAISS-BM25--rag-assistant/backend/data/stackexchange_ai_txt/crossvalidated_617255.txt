FRW bootstrap in R

I am working on a logistic regression problem with 2 classes (let's say 0 and 1) where the positive class (1) is rare. In this case, I have found that Fractional-Random-Weight Bootstrap (FRW) is a good procedure for logistic regression. I was wondering if I get clarification of: i) FRW bootstrap concepts for logistic regression ii) example code of FRW bootstrap in R
