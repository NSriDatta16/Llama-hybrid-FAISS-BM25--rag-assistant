R AUC never less than 0.5?

I'm doing some work with random forests in R using the randomForest package, and I've run into something that seems odd to me. Even when the data is completely random, the AUC is never less than 0.5. For example, when I run the following: library(randomForest) df.sanity No matter how many times I run it, the AUC is never less than 0.5. It's often a bit over (up to 0.54 from what I've seen), but never less. The only other AUC implementation I've used is Weka's, and I've seen AUCs randomForest package automatically flip the predictions to the reverse if the AUC is ever less than 0.5, or is there something else I'm misunderstanding here?
