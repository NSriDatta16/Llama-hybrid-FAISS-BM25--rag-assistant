First of all, a comment on the question: Points in the sample $S$ won't be at $\sqrt{d}$ distance away from the center. Distance squared will follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom and therefore with $d$ mean and $2d$ variance. Then, distance will be distributed around $\sqrt{d}$ but there is not a concentration of points in the $\sqrt{d}$ radius shell. And for the question itself, I don't see how you observe that $||c-\text{mean}(T)|| If $T$ is much smaller than $S$: $T$ (the $t$ points closer to $p$) are likely to be very close to $p$ and therefore distribution of $\text{mean}(T)$ will be very close to the distribution of $p$, and $||c-\text{mean}(T)||^2$ will approximately follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom and therefore with $d$ mean and $2d$ variance, just like distance of $c$ to $p$. If $T$ is nearly as large than $S$: Then $T$ is approximately a random sample from the d-dimensional spherical (unit variance) Gaussian distribution. When finding $\text{mean}(T)$, for each dimension we are averaging $t$ points from a normal distribution, and in the whole we get a d-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution with $1/t$ variance, and $tÂ·||c-\text{mean}(T)||^2$ will follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom. Mean of $||c-\text{mean}(T)||^2$ will be $d/t$ and variance $2d/t$. Then $||c-\text{mean}(T)||$ will be distributed around $\sqrt{d/t}$, and for larger $t$ it will be much smaller than $\sqrt{d}$.
