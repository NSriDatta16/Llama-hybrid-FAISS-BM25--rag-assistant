I don't know the answer to this offhand, but I've seen it done by Just Great Software. They make customized installers for RegexBuddy and every time I've downloaded mine it's got its signature. I'm curious though - why don't you want to persist the file to disk? You don't need to leave it there - persist it, sign it, load it back into memory and delete it. Or, persist it, and have an agent or cron job delete it after a couple days.
