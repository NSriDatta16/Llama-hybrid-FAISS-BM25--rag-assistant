Machine learning detect changes in components

I am a student who will finish my studies next year and I want to analyze the job market in advance. I have found an interesting job where it says: The department of assemblies and systems of the X deals with the simulation, testing and evaluation of components, assemblies and complete systems mainly from the automotive sector. In the future, machine learning methods will be used to detect changes in components or test benches at an early stage I find the last sentence very interesting, but I don't quite understand it. If you expect a change to a component (e.g. the component starts to break), you can hard code it to detect this change. Could somebody explain to me with a simple example how machine learning can be helpful in this area?
