The comments on blind source separation and independent components analysis are good. However, from what you have said, there might be an easier way. You said you have a sample of the pure noise signal and that the noise in concentrated in a few frequencies. It would seem sensible to then run fft() on the noise signal and look for frequencies that represent most of the power in the noise. Then, you could run an FFT on your signal+noise, filter out those frequencies ( i.e. set them to 0), and push that through an inverse FFT ( fft(inverse=TRUE) ) to get back your signal without noise. The process is a bit manual and I would not call it elegant, but it is simple. One caveat: to the extent that your signal has components in those noise frequencies, you would lose that part of your signal. you might be able to get around that, however, by ascertaining the fraction of signal+noise which is noise and then only partially subtracting out noise frequencies.
