Its interesting to note that Windows was changed awhile back so you can't remote desktop in to another machine if the account you're using has a blank password. Any default password is a bad password, blank or no. The admin needs to change it. Detecting that an account has the default password and limiting its access in a few ways is one way to encourage users to change their password, or otherwise partially secure their system for them.
