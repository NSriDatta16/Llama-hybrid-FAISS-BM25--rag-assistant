I think there is a bigger psychological barrier than technological. Most hardware is capable of paginating large quantities of text very quickly. However, people are unlikely to read a very ling article all the way through. It is generally good practice to break large amounts of text into smaller pieces for the user's convenience - and offer full text as a download. Also, the length of the line and spacing is important to capture the audience. I would recommend 1.5em line spacing and about 15 words per line max. Unlike with printed media - people are not likely to get to the end - and to find out who-dunnit, they will just bail if they don't enjoy a couple of paragraphs. Just imagine the reader with their finger poised on the left button, and another on the scroll wheel - rather like you probably are doing right now - just itching to get off this page and read something else.
