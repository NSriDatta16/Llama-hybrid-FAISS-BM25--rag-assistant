How to test statistical significance of differences between before and after nominal data

I'm wondering what the best statistical test to run on my dissertation survey would be. I'm investigating letting agents attitudes towards the recently introduced tenant fee ban in the UK. A survey conducted before the ban came into force (with a sample size of 1,008) found that 87% of agents believed the ban would lead to an increase in rents; my survey conducted after the ban came into force (with a sample size of 31) found that 91% of agents believe it will lead to an increase in rents. The question was worded ' How will the tenant fee ban impact on rents in the long-term? ', and the available answers were 'increase', 'decrease', 'stay the same' and 'don't know' (which I believe is nominal data?) I'm investigating whether or not there has been a change in agent's attitudes since the ban came into force, so I guess the null hypothesis is 'there has been no change in attitudes since the ban came into force'. Is it possible to run a test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between attitudes before the ban came into force and attitudes after? Thanks!
