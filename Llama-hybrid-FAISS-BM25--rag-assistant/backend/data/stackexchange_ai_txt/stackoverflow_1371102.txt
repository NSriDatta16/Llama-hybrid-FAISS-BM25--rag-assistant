All strings in C# are Unicode. The English (Latin), Japanese and Chinese code points are just located in different code point ranges. I think you have two options: Find a Unicode font that contains characters for all code points in all three language. Try to guess the language and choose a font that contains the characters for the code points in that language. For option 2 you can look at the Unicode charts to find out where the different code points are and expand your algorithm to guess the language. Example for Hiragana : bool IsHiragana(char ch) { return (ch >= '\u3040') && (ch 0; }
