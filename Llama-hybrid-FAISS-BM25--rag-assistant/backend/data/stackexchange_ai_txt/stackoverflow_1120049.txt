Gotta run off to a funeral in a sec, but if you break your polygons down into convex subpolies, there are some optimizations you can do. You can do a binary searches on each poly to find the closest vertex, and then I believe the closest point should either be that vertex, or an adjacent edge. This means you should be able to do it in log(log m * n) where m is the average number of vertices on a poly, and n is the number of polies. This is kind of hastey, so it could be wrong. Will give more details later if wanted.
