monte carlo linear regression in r. Why is the slope lower than expected?

Say I have two vectors with associated errors and I want to determine the uncertainty of slope of a linear regression using a simple monte carlo approach. I'm using the following code (suggestions for improvement welcome). x This is probably a trivial question, but I expect the average slope to be very close to 10 (with a small random deviation), but consistently get a value
