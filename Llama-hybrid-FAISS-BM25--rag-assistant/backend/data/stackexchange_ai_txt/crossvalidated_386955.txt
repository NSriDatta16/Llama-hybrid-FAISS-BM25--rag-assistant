Hottest news on 'why does Deep Learning work so well'

At the beginning of last year I was trying to study some papers which were tackling the question "Why does deep learning work so well", but I had to stop due to overwhelming work problems. I'd love to start again now, but I'm noticing that there are thousand of new papers out there, so I have no idea where to start. That's why I'm looking for suggestions from you, which means, what are the most interesting papers you have read about deep learning theory recently? I'm looking both for theoretical papers (such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08225.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf ). Furthermore, I have a solid theoretical background, especially in mathematics, so don't be afraid to suggest highly theoretical papers. The topic I'm most interested in is pattern recognition Why are deep network so good in pattern recognition? which features do they learn better? But everything else is fine, as long as it tackles deep learning theory. Thank you!
