COMET (server push to client) on iPhone

I'm looking to establish some kind of socket/COMET type functionality from my server(s) to my iPhone application. Essentially, anytime a user manages to set an arbitrary object 'dirty' on the server, by say, updating their Address.. the feedback should be pushed from the server to any clients keeping a live poll to the server. The buzzword for this is COMET I suppose. I know there is DWR out there for web browser applications, so I'm thinking, maybe it's best to set a hidden UIWebView in each of my controllers just so I can get out of the box COMET from their javascript framework? Is there a more elegant approach?
