If your data are balanced, the sum contrasts (see contr.sum under ?contrasts ) are explicitly the differences you're asking about, so you may want to look at testing those. More generally, one problem is that "the mean of all races" includes the present race you're comparing it to, so you lose independence, which can make things more complex. However, note that if the present race has the same mean as the average of all the races apart from itself it has the same mean as all the races including itself. One way to achieve that would be to look at the last helmert contrast with the race you want to compare to the others set as the last category (see contr.helmert ); that would require reordering the factor each time you wanted to test a race though. You might also find the discussion of deviation coding here relevant.
