TeamBuild, Code Coverage & testrun config files

I have team build script for CI and nightly builds, both of which runs unit tests with code coverage. I have specified the testrun config file and this include paths for the assemblies to instrument. My problem is, the paths for the assemblies is absolute, eg: I would rather these used relative paths or I could specify $(OutDir) in there. Has anyone solved this? Thanks
