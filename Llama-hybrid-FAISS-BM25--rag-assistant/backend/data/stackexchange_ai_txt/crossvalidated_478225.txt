semantic value of a convolution neural network

It seems to be common knowledge in computer vision that in a convolution neural network, layers closer to the image has higher resolution but lower semantic value, and vice visa for layers further to the image. I do not quite understand where this is coming from. Any references or explanations on this will be much appreciated.
