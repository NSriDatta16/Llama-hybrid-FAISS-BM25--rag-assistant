I figured out my problem, but first to clarify proper functionality of multiple touches: If your view's multipleTouchEnabled flag is set to NO, the touchesBegan method of that view should NOT fire if a second touch is applied to a screen. With that, the solution to my problem: My view contains several subviews. The view is responsible for handling touches for itself AND the subviews. When my code was not functioning properly, I had the subview's userInteractionEnabled = YES. This meant that when a subview was touched, it would forward the touch to the superview, REGARDLESS of whether the superview was tracking another touch. In other words, although UIApplication respects the multiTouchEnabled flag of a view, other views in the responder chain do not.
