New asp "showat" attribute required inconsistently in VS2010. Why?

When I generate code using T4 templates in Visual Studio 2010, I get the following error for each of my asp controls when I try to compile: Control "ddState" is missing required attribute "showat". I have never gotten this error in previous versions of .NET. Further, I don't get this error when I manually construct my pages either by dragging/dropping, nor do I get it when I type out the control text myself. When I generate code, I have to manually add showat="client" to my tag for the compiler to be happy. It was my understanding that I never had to explicitly specify this tag. The following: solves the problem. Why do I have to add this to generated code but not other times? (It's a VS-2010 webforms project, using VB, in case that makes a difference.)
