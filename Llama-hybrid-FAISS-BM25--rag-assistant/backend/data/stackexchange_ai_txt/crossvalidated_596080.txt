Your question contains several topics: How to compare strategies subject to stochasticity (stochastic strategy, stochastic environment): Each epoch can be perceived as a random experiment. For two strategies, you can consider standard statistical tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Does the MDP change if grid world changes: yes, MDP is defined on a given set of states. A different grid changes the states, at least. Is Q learning a form of machine learning: yes, the intelligent system learns how to decide in the long term, even sacrificing short-term rewards. On top of that, the learning uses the architectures that are standard for supervised machine learning such as Convolutional Neural Networks.
