Textarea without wysiwyg editor but have nice format

I have a textarea where someone can input text. I do not want a wysiwyg editor. But what would be great: Strip all tags, but make correct and if user input has new lines. Additionally convert all urls, with or without http// or parameter to clickable links. I cannot find a solution. So you could type into the textarea: ........ This is a paragraph This ist still in the paragraph this is a new paragraph www.this-would-be-clickable new paragraphp ` `this will be shown not bold` ` ........ thankfull for every advice
