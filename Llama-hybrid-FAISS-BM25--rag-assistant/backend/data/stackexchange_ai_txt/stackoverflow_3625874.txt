iPhone: How to reenable MKUserLocation 'blue dot'?

Enabling the 'blue dot' which shows current location in my application by mapView.showsUserLocation = YES Disabling/hiding the dot by mapView.showsUserLocation = NO in order to drop a pin. So far so good. Adding an annotation pin at 'userLocation' and dragging it around in the map to a new location. After that I want to show the blue dot again by setting showsUserLocation to YES again - but it simply does not show up! What could be the problem? Is there a way to force it to show again (reset userLocation?) with any other method? Which events are involved? Grateful for any help on this one..
