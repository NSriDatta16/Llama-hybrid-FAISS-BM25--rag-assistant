To begin with, you should first note that if the Roulette wheel actually is fair then (by assumption) the outcomes are independent uniform random variables. In this situation the results of previous trials are irrelevant to prediction of future results. If you are looking for the distribution of the maximum-count statistic in a fair process, then this is the distribution of the following random variable based on a multinomial distribution with uniform probabilities: $$\text{Maxcount}(n,m) \equiv \max (N_1,...,N_m) \quad \quad \quad (N_1,...,N_m) \sim \text{Mu}(n, (\tfrac{1}{m}, ..., \tfrac{1}{m})).$$ You can find an algorithm for this distribution in Bonetti et al (2019) . The probability functions for this distribution are available as the "max count" distribution (see e.g., the function dmaxcount ) in the occupancy package in R . In practice, we might think that a mechanism like this is fair, but it is possible that it might actually have some bias towards particular outcomes. This belief was examined in a series of papers on the "gambler's fallacy" and broader methods of binomial prediction under the Bayesian paradigm (see O'Neill and Puza 2005 ; O'Neill 2012 ; O'Neill 2015 ). These papers consider the case where a mechanism is designed to give "fair" uniformly distributed outcomes but there is a possibility of bias in the mechanism. If you hold the a priori belief that the direction of bias is symmetric then this leads to an optimal prediction method where you predict the outcome that has occurred the most in the observed data (which these papers call the "frequent outcome approach"). If you have a look at the linked papers you will see that this leads to some particular forms for the prediction accuracy, and the accuracy will converge towards "perfect prediction" (assuming a priori knowledge of the bias in the mechanism) over a large number of trials.
