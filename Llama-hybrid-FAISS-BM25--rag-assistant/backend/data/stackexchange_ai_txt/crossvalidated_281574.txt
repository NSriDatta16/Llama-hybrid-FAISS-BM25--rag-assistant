In Bayesian statistics the denominator of the posterior, the "evidence", is an integral that's usually solved by estimation. Bayesian statistics is used to tune the hyper-parameters of neural networks. In reinforcement learning, the expected total reward over time is an integral that's usually solved by estimation. Also this: "ELFI is a statistical software package written in Python for performing inference with generative models. The term "likelihood-free inference" refers to a family of inference methods that replace the use of the likelihood function with a data generating simulator function. This is useful when the likelihood function is not computable or otherwise available but it is possible to make simulations of the process." https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi
