You may wish to do some data aggregation. for each week and for each item unit, aggregate all of its records, such that you could define how many are returned, also you need to expose transactions,in such a way it could infer those numbers of returns, following that formulate the problem as time series, you have time steps defined as weeks, preprocess the data by computing the relative value of return units instead of absolute ones, apply z-score normalization, then auto-encode the data by feeding it to RNN like models to predict the value at timestep t+1 given previous t timesteps.
