How to deal with training and test data that have different imbalances?

I have a dataset made of categorical variables and a binary outcome. Responses about the variables and the outcome were recorded at time 1 and time 2. The data is imbalanced between the two outcomes (10:3) at time 1, and more so at time 2 (40:3). Does it make sense to create a logistic regression model using the time 1 data, where the variables predict the outcome, and then test the accuracy of that model by seeing how accurately it predicts the time 2 outcomes? Is the imbalance something I need to consider? So far when I try this, the accuracy of prediction is better for the test set instead of the training set, which I think means that imbalance is a problem- accuracy is low for the training set because the imbalance means one outcome is being predicted a lot more often than the other.
