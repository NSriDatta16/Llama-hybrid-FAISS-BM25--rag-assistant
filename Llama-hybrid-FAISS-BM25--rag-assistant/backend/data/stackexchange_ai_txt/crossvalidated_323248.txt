Why Loss function has to be bounded from below (statistical decision theory)?

In statistical decision theory the loss function $L(\theta, a)\ge-K > -\infty$ is often chosen for technical convenience (e.g. See [ 1 ] p.3 ). Can anyone explain why the above condition is convenient, and if it is feasible, provide a simple example. [1.] James O. Berger, " Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis "
