I don't know if this is documented anywhere, but I've found that in Interface Builder, if you enable the navigation controller's toolbar, you can drag bar items to your view controller, and they will automagically show up in the navigation controller's toolbar. For example, here's what we can do (using Xcode 3.2 on Snow Leopard): File->New Project.... Choose Navigation-based Application and create the project. Open MainWindow.xib in Interface Builder. Select the Navigation Controller, and in the Attributes inspector, check the "Shows Toolbar" box. This will cause a Toolbar object to appear. Drag a Bar Button Item from the Library to the toolbar. It will appear in the toolbar. If you check the hierarchy in the NIB, you'll see that this new item is a child of the RootViewController . It seems that any Bar Button Items added as children of the navigation item will show up in the navigation bar, and any Bar Button Items added as children of the view controller will show up in the toolbar. (I stumbled on this by accident. If anyone can find documentation for this behavior, or any additional info, I'd like to hear about it.)
