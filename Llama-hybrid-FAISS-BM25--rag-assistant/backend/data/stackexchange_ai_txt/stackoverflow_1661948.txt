Looking for a Delphi Gantt chart component

Does anyone have any experience with using a Gantt chart control in Delphi? I'm looking for a native VCL one but ActiveX would also do. I don't have too many requiremetnts other than it looking half decent and has very basic editing. thanks for any suggestions Edit: I am on Delphi 2009
