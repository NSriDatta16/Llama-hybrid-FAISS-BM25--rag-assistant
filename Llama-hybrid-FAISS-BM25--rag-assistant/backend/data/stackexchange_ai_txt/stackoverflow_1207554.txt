It seems to me that the Customers class may be doing too much and needs to be broken down to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle. The idea is that a class knows how to do one thing well and getting data is a different responsibility to performing business logic with said data. I'm currently going through the learning process of trying to break down my monolithic classes into smaller, more targetted ones so I can't give great advice about how to do this, but there are lots of resources on the web to help: like this Have a bit of a google for SOLID and Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) for extra added goodness.
