Reading Xml into DataSet

This is my XML file: 1 2 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I want to read this data into a DataSet. I want just the responses given by the client, and for 5th question I want the average of its 17 sub-questions. For example, the DataSet should only contain this: 1 2 3 3 4 How to do this in C#?
