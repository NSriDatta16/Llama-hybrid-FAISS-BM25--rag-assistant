I believe what you may be really interested in though is the standard error rather than the standard deviation. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is the standard deviation of the sample-mean's estimate of a population mean, and that will give you a measure how how good your yearly MWh estimate is. It's very easy to compute: if you used $n$ samples to obtain your monthly MWh averages and standard deviations, you would just compute the standard deviation as @IanBoyd suggested and normalize it by the total size of your sample. That is, $$ s = \frac{\sqrt{s_1^2 + s_2^2 + \ldots + s_{12}^2}}{\sqrt{12 \times n}} $$
