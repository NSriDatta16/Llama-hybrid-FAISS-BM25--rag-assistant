Is this a typo/error in this W3C XML specification?

In working through the issues with another question, I've found text files with embedded Ctrl-S characters (decimal 19) in them. When adding their text to an XML document, an exception is thrown (C#/.NET). According to this page, as I read it, they are not in the rages for a " Char " and so are illegal: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets However, a cohort found the an XML specification, and implies that it is equivalent to a carriage return (decimal 13, not hex 0x13), here: http://www.w3.org/1999/07/WD-xml-c14n-19990729#charescaping But then, the paragraph in question is not in the more recent version ( http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n ) which explicitly states: In character data, the carriage-return (#xD) character is represented by "&#xD;". So, two quesitons: Am I missing something, or is there a typo on the W3C page -- an " x " in the token &#x13; where it should be &#13; or &#x0d; ?? When a specification has an error (not just something that changed but an actual error), does the W3C leave the document accessible? Seems like that's a "yes"
