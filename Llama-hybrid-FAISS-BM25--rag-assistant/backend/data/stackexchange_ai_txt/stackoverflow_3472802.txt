How to organize Android source code into folders

I'm working on an Android app and it's up to 17 classes. I want to start organizing the .java class files into a more intuitive layout. Say I want to have a source code directory called "views". When I create that directory using Eclipse, it changes my package name to com.xyz to com.xyz.views. Since this package name (com.xyz.views) is different than the rest of my app (com.xyz) is this going to cause me to do a lot of extra work to link those packages? Will this cause problems with the fact that Android Market looks at the package name and is more or less locked to the package name?
