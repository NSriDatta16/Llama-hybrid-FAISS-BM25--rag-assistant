I haven't had a problem with that, but I did discover another bug in the advanced profile in which the layout is never loaded. I did confirm this with Magento and they are aware of the bug. in app/design/adminhtml/default/default/layout/dataflow.xml You need to add the following otherwise you get a blank admin screen. prototype/prototype.js prototype/validation.js varien/js.js mage/translate.js mage/adminhtml/tools.js As for your errors, I don't think this is a bug, since we haven't had a problem on any of our 1.9 installs. I do see what you are talking about it not being in the parent, but the only thing that calls the method inside the grid class is a deprecated method getRowId, which I don't see anything else calling it besides a grid.phtml file that is used on the dashboard.
