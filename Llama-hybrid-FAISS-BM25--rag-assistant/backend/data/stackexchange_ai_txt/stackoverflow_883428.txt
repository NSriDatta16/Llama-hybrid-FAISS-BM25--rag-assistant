The whole point of hashing is that you store the hashes rather than the plaintext passwords and they can't be recovered (at least only with great difficulty). Hash functions are designed to be one-way, so that retrieval is impossible - this is their very essence. nchar[n] is probably the best option, since common hash algorithms produce results of constant length ( SHA1 outputs a 160-bit hash). Common practice is to convert the hash to Base64 so that it can be stored as ASCII text. A salt is just a method that adds random bits onto a hash in order to complicate the process of cracking. Each extra bit of salt means that a brute-force cracker must take twice as long (and use twice as much memory).
