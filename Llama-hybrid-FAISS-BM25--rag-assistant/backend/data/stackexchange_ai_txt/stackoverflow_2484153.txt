How can I build something like Amazon S3 in Perl?

I am looking to code a file storage application in perl similar to amazon s3. I already have a amazon s3 clone that I found online called parkplace but its in ruby and is old also isn't built for high loads. I am not really sure what modules and programs I should use so id like some help picking them out. My requirements are listed below (yes I know there are lots but I could start simple then add more once I get it going): Easy API implementation for client side apps. (maybe REST (?) Centralized database server for the USERDB (maybe PostgreSQL (?). Logging of all connections, bandwidth used, well pretty much everything to a centralized server (maybe PostgreSQL again (?). Easy server side configuration (config file(s) stored on the servers). Web based control panel for admin(s) and user(s) to show logs. (could work just running queries from the databases) Fast High Uptime Low memory usage Some sort of load distribution/load balancer (maybe a dns based or pound or perlbal or something else (?). Maybe a cache of some sort (memcached or parlbal or something else (?). Thanks in advance
