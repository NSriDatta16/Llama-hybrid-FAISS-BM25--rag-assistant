I almost always arrange my classes backwards from yours: Public interface first, any protected interface second, and private data last. This is so that users of my classes can simply look at the public and protected interfaces at the top and need not look at the private data at all. Using that order then there's no possible redundancy and the question become moot. If you prefer to organize yours in the way you outlined, I believe being explicit far outweighs the gain one of line of code. This way it's completely obvious to code readers what the intention is (for example if you change a struct to a class or the reverse at any point).
