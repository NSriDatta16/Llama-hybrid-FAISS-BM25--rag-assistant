How to insert sessions in the report designer of the MS Business Intelligence Studio for the MS Reporting Service?

I'm trying to migrate our reporting from Crystal report to MS Reporting Service. In the Crystal Report report designer, I can organize sections of the report, including inserting sections, adding suppress conditions. Please kindly advise how can I achieve those in MS Business Intelligence Studio (built in Visual Studio 2008). Thank you! BRs, William Choi
