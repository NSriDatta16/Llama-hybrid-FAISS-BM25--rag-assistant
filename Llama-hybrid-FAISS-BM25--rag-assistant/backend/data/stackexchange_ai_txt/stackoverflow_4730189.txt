The question is not clear enough to provide an objective answer. Since I cannot give you a fish, this answer is more on the lines of " Teach you to fish " :) When faced with design issues like these, where you think " duh..now sure why such a simple thing is so hard " more often than not, you are either designing it just incorrectly, or you are overcomplicating things. If I am empathizing correctly, your design issue seems like a "common requirement" yet the language is not allowing for any elegant solutions. Trace back your design steps/decisions question all the "obvious" and "of course" you are basing your design on (you are using quite a few above) see if things can be simplified ( don't take any of the OO concepts to their logical extreme . Make compromises based on ROI) ...and you will most likely arrive at an acceptable answer. If you still don't, post back the classes and interfaces you think you want (with compile errors since language is not allowing certain things), and maybe we can help you tune your design.
