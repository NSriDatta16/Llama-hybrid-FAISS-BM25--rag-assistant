jQuery dragging (reordering) table rows between multiple tbodies

I'm great with CSS but I largely suck at jQuery. We all have our limitations... OK with that admission out of the way I'll begin. We have a "favourite products" table, which you can sectionalize into categories (eg, Booze, Sheep, Spoons). Each category is a . Each row (excluding the ) is a product. I want to enable a user to drag and drop (reorder) the table rows, even between tbodies. I've looked at Table Drag and Drop (DnD) plugin for jQuery but was disappointed to find that it doesn't really support dragging between tbodies - and hasn't been updated for quite some time. Here is the basic table structure: Favourite Spoons Wooden Spoon Metal Spoon Plastic Spoon Nuclear Bombs US Nukes Soviet Nukes I'm going to need to turn of the "dragability" of certain rows such as the first row in the - this being the section title. Is there a better version of a jquery plugin out there that can do what I need? If you can find a better plugin please share and win my "favourite person of the week" award. Thank you.
