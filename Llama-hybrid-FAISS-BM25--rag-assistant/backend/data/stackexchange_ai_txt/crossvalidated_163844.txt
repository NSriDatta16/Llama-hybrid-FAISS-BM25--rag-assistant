PCA output of Matlab's pca() function doesn't match manual calculation

I try to calculate the PCA in my matrix and I use two ways for this: PCA function [coeff, score, eigenvalues] = pca(M); And for compare and understand the PCA calculus, I try to calculate step by step the PCA without the matlab function pca. %// first I "z-scored" my matrix X = zscore(M); %// second I calculate the covariance matrix %// this matrix is equals to the correlation matrix V = cov(X); %// Third, I calculate the eigenvalues(E) and eigenvectors(U) [U,E] = eig(V); The pca function's eigenvalues are not equal to E and I think the columns of U are principal components and rows of U are variables and it's not equal to coeff . So, I think that I don't understand how calculate the PCA of a matrix?
