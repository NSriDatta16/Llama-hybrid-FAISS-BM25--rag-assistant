PCA reduction resulted in an elliptical form

I have a dataset with 19 features (columns). I normalized them using sklearn.preprocessing.normalize then I used PCA to reduce them to 2 components for plotting purposes following the steps in this link: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_digits.html What I saw is that my data points form a perfect ellipse shape as in the following picture: I want to know if this has any special meaning for my data.
