Valid signing identity matching this profile could not found in key chain

I have downloaded a provisioning profile from my id, but when I drag into Xcode, and then in the provisioning profile section it says a valid signing identity matching this profile could not found in key chain I am trying to download the existing profile and drag into Xcode, but this gives me the problem that how could I deploy my application to the device?
