GMail uses SSL for connection. To validate SSL certificate properly certain time is needed. Exact time depends on complexity of the certificate chain and use and accessibility of CRLs and OCSP checking. It's very likely that Java checks OCSPs for the certificate(s) presented, and this can be slow. Try running your application on different system (preferably in other subnet) to exclude influence of firewalls. Maybe some part of communication (either SMTP itself, or CRL retrieval or OCSP checking) is slowed down by the firewall.
