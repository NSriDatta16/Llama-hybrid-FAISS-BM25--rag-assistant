Resampling is generally a good idea when dealing with heavily imbalanced datasets. I would recommend using smote which can either resample or undersample depending on your task (if your dataset is small I would say to use resampling). Another thing you could try is using class weights when training. Models like lightgbm and neural nets can use weighted training losses to force models to pay attention to underpopulated classes. I have personally dealt with such cases and these methods definitely work.
