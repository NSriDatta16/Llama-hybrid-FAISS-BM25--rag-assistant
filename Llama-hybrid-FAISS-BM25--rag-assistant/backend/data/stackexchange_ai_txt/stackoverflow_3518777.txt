c# .NET Serial Driver performance

My application needs to communicate with a embedded device which is about 1MHz clock speed, through serial communication. In the mid of that process, we found that we were missing some data from the device. So, I began testing the performance of the serial driver that I used. The device keeps on sending raw data with counter increased for each packet at a Baud Rate of 115200 bits/sec . When connected to hyper terminal and ran whole night we found that it is not missing any data. But when I used the c# serial driver with DataReceived handler and a parser written to find whether packets missed or not, we encountered situations like 1) Missing of packet 2) Buffer over run error. I am not able to come to a conclusion. I want all of your views on the data available. Is it a test which stretches the boundaries of any Serial Device drivers ? Or the way .NET serial driver written is not up to the mark? The way I have implemented is very simple. I have just used a DataReceived handler and updating the data to a List, which inturn is used by a parser running in a different thread with highest priority. The functionality done with in DataReceived hanlder is nothing but adding the received data to the list. Thanks in Advance
