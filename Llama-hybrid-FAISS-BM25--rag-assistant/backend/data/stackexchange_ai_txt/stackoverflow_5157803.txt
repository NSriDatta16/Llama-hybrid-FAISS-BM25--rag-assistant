What does this expression mean?

I'm writing a small application about image retrieval, but I can't understand what this mathematical expression means d^2 = || x - p ||^2 where x and p are two-element vectors. Can somebody tell me what means this ||, and how can I raise a vector to power ?? EDIT Thanks to espertus answer I know that || x - p ||^2 is a euclidean distance. However I also came across this expression ||p||^2 . What would that mean ? I think that it can't be euclidean distance. What else could it be ?
