Autoscaling TLF Text in AS3

I'm needing an actionscript solution that will allow dynamic text to drop into a text box with pre-determined dimensions (x, y, width, height), and then will scale the text up or down so that it is as large as it can be within those dimensions without scrolling. Wordwrap would be automatic, and there would not be any paragraph breaks. I have a working model using Flash's Classic text, but I would like to be able to utilize the in-line styling that TLF provides. I just don't quite have my mind wrapped around all the TLF features yet. Does anyone know if there is an already existing solution to this situation - or could perhaps steer me in the right direction?
