If the transition probability matrix varies over time then your stochastic process is not a Markov chain (i.e., it does not obey the Markov property). In order to estimate transition probabilities at each time you would need to make some structural assumptions about how these transition probabilities can change (e.g., how rapidly they can change, etc.). Without any structural assumptions, the MLE for the transition probability matrix at each time period will estimate a probability of one for the transition that actually occurred and a probability of zero for all other transitions, which is not very helpful. If you have a look at the documentation for the seqtrate function , you will see that it references Gabadinho et al (2011) . This paper gives further information on the analysis of state-sequence objects using the TraMineR package. It includes discussion of the transition rates and the "turbulence" of transitions in the sequence. The paper contains references to relevant mathematical and statistical literature that discusses this type of analysis, so you might need to do a bit of a deep-dive to learn the relevant models and methods for this type of analysis.
