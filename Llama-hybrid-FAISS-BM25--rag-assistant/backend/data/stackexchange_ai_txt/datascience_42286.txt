Voting classifier using grid search for Time Series

I have three models: Arima Auto ARIMA Double Exponential Smoothing I would like to apply an ensemble method - a voting method and allow the classifier to learn weights for these three models. I have checked the votingclassifier present in scikit learn. It requires: fit(x,y) to run. Time series object that is present in series object don't have y . How do you apply a voting classifier and learn weights through grid search?
