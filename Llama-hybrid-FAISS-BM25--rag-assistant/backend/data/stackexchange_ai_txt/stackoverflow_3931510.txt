LinkedList queue implementation

I have LinkedList Queue, and I'm trying to read a file with numbers of people in queue waiting to be helped and the number of agents available to help at the time. I do not know to check if they are busy or how to add the people waiting in the queue in the first place. Can anyone help me? This is the code I have so far. public class WaitingQueue { public int [] windows = 0; // every time we add some one check if location occupied public int time = 0; public int waitTime = 0; public static void main(String args[]) { Queue newQueue = new Queue(); try{ FileInputStream fn = new FileInputStream(args[0]); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fn)); String line; while((line = br.readLine()) != null) { time++; // happens every time window i busy waitTime++ // increment waiTime if ( time for people to arrive) { add people to the queue // have to have a queue for people waiting. //use enque to add people. } if(window is open) { // move people from queue to window // use dequeue } if(time = x;) { // add some people to list } } //Close the input stream outFile.close(); fn.close(); } }catch (Exception e) {/*Catches exception*/ System.err.println("An error has occured : " + e.getMessage()); } }
