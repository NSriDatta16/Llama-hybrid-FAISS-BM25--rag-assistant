Regression with constrained output variable

I want to predict the labels of images using a neural network. The labels all lie in the range [-1,1] (Ratio scaled). Values with an absolute value greater than one are meaningless and do not occur in the data. How do I design the final layer? What loss function should I use? My approach is a "tanh" activation, to squeeze the output into [-1,1] and 'MSE' as the loss function. Does that make sense?
