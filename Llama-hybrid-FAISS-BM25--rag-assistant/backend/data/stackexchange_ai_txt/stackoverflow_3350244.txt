Most CMSes use a database backend to store the actual text and markup for their stories; large sites such as the New York Times and the Washington Post use databases to store their stories, so that they can be searched and cross-referenced as necessary. While it is possible to do all of that as files in a filesystem, modern databases are optimized for these sorts of operations. One thing you'll need to do is to choose the type of table and datatype to use for storing your data. MySQL provides several storage engines for creating tables ( InnoDB and MyISAM are the most popular). As for data types , CHAR and VARCHAR are good for relatively small amounts of text, with TEXT being suitable for large amounts of text. (If you're storing raw binary data, like images, instead of text, then you'll be more interested in BINARY, VARBINARY , and BLOB ). Each storage engine and datatype will provide different trade-offs for performance and functionality, but for relatively small and simple applications, MyISAM and either VARCHAR or TEXT will be a good choice for your needs.
