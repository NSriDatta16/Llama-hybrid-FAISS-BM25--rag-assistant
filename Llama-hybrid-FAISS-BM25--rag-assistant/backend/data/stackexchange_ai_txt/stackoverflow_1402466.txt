When you look at a successful software it looks so simple, at least in theory. GUI code can be extremely underestimated in its complexity, and is sometimes overlooked in the design phase because it's considered trivial. I'm not sure if you're asking about WinForms tutorials or specifically how to organize and structure the code in a way that keeps you sane, but either way Jeremy Miller has a good collection of tips on how to design the GUI code structure . (Note: This is about the GUI code structure, not WinForms or usability design). My take on GUI code has usually been this process: Create a rough and fugly GUI with the Designer in VS. Coming from web design you can consider this MS Frontpage in WYSIWYG mode - no styling or specific structure. Just the rough visual structure of the app, menubar, toolbar, statusbar etc. No custom controls. View the code and organize it into a couple of classes Go back to Designer and add controls to the organized classes View the code and organize it. Rinse, lather, repeat. When my code structure is kind of finished I go into extreme detail mode, where I handcode values to get pixel-perfect in contrast to the GUI. Anyway, I wasn't quite sure what your question was but I hope this helps. Let me know if I misunderstood you.
