The asynchronous message passing is done by embedding a hidden iframe in the page, then using the goog.net.CrossPageChannel classes from the Google Closure javascript library to send messages from the iframe to the host page. The Closure CrosspageChannel code is documented here: http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/4/trunk/closure/goog/docs/class_goog_net_xpc_CrossPageChannel.html You can easily reverse-engineer the messages that'll be passed up from the iframe to the host page. These probably won't change (though there's no absolute guarantee of that right now). I'm hoping to open-source the client library for the Channel API this quarter, but the above should get you started.
