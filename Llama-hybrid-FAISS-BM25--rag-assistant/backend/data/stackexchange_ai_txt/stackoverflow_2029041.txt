How does a BackupAgent work?

I'm looking at AndroidManifest files and I see entries for android:backupAgent and according to the Documentation android:backupAgent is The name of the class implementing BackupAgent to manage backup and restore of the application's settings to external storage. But I can't find a BackupAgent interface or any other documentation. Can someone point me in the right direction?
