REST methods not accessible when hosting wcf service in IIS

I have a WCF REST service that exposes a method in class GreetService: [ServiceContract] public class GreetService { [WebGet(UriTemplate = "greet/{name}")] public String GreetName(string name) { return "Hello " + name; } } Also, I registered a route in Global.asax: RouteTable.Routes.Add(new ServiceRoute("GreetService", new WebServiceHostFactory(), typeof(GreetService))); Now when i run this directly from visual studio, I am able to leverage the UriTemplate and invoke this method using a GET call to http://localhost:5432/GreetService/greet/JohnDoe However, after deploying this to IIS7 by creating a Greet.svc file for it, I am observing the following behavior: I can call http://localhost:5432/Greet.svc and it says that a service has been created I can point wcftestclient to http://localhost:5432/Greet.svc?wsdl to generate a test client which can call GreetName() directly However, I can't call http://localhost:5432/Greet.svc/GreetService/greet/JohnDoe nor http://localhost:5432/Greet.svc/greet/JohnDoe although I expected to be able to since I specified an empty relative endpoint address in the corresponding web.config file prior to hosting it in IIS7. Any ideas why the WebGetAttribute is not working in IIS? Or is there something else I am doing wrong? EDIT: This is the ServiceModel part of my web.config file which resides in the directory that IIS uses: --> element below --> EDIT 2: For completeness' sake here is my full web.config file: --> element below -->
