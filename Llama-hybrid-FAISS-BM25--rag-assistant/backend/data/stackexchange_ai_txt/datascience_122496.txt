We got it working by simply clipping the gradients on the D network. The code has been pushed into our GAN FHIR gut repo that shows how to do this. The model now learns FHIR and the losses on G and D both decrease together on 200k records. # Clip discriminator's gradients for p in discriminator.parameters(): p.data.clamp_(-0.01, 0.01)
