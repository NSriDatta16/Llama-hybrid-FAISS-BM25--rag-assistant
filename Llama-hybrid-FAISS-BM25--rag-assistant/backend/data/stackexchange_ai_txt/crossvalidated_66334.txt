Why such a poor result from sparse PCA R package?

I'm preparing to use R to perform sparse analysis on my data. I tried to get started with an ad hoc example, but the reconstruction result turned out really poor. I'm wondering if I was making any mistake in the code, or was I encountering any intrinsic drawbacks of the method? The data is ad hoc: > prod [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 1 1 1 1 2 [2,] 1 2 1 2 3 [3,] 0 1 0 1 1 [4,] 0 0 1 1 1 [5,] 0 1 0 1 1 and I use this rst = nsprcomp(prod, retx=T, nneg=T) to perform non-negtive sparse PCA. I reconstruct the data like this: recon = rst$x %*% t(rst$rotation) + matrix(1,5,1) %*% rst$center The final result turned out to be really poor: > abs(prod - recon) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 0.386523767 0.2432819 0.1186152 0.3535836 0.3770144 [2,] 0.184944985 1.1214659 0.6230812 1.2173770 1.8819417 [3,] 0.096185913 0.4301642 0.2249522 0.4825192 0.6942987 [4,] 0.009206957 0.5044193 0.2917920 0.6059221 0.8703587 [5,] 0.096185913 0.4301642 0.2249522 0.4825192 0.6942987 Any idea or comment is appreciated. Edit The package is called nsprcomp
