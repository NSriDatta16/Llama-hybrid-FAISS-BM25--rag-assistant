Significant predictors in multiple linear regression became non-significant in multiple logistic regression

I have several continuous predictor variables (A, B, C) and a continuous outcome variable X. Some of the X values include NAs, because they were below the instrument detection limit. So I figured that I could either 1) treat the outcome variable as a continuous variable, treating the NAs as zeros (since they're below the detection level), or 2) treat the outcome variable as a binary variable, treating the NAs as zeros and non-NA values as ones (if I place more importance on whether X is above or below the detection limit rather than the exact values of X). So following option 1, I did a multiple linear regression between the predictor and outcome variables, and found a significant positive correlation between X and A, but not between X and B/C. Then following option 2, I did a multiple logistic regression, and I found no significant correlation between X and A but between X and B/C. I'm struggling to understand why the significance of predictors change so dramatically. Am I somehow weakening the positive correlation between outcome X and predictor A by ignoring the exact values of X and treating them as either 0 or 1?
