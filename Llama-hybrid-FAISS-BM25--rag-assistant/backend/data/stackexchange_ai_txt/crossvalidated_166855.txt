The mathematical tool that you're using is called a filter , it does convolution of sorts. In your case it's probably the simplest form of filtering: summation or equal weight moving average (the same thing). These filters have certain frequency characteristics, e.g. your filter cuts out high frequencies, i.e. it's a low pass filter. You're looking for optimal window size. What is optimal depends on what you're looking for. The name low pass implies that you probably don't want high frequencies, at the same time you don't want to lose too much information (you cal it slow ). You should start with defining what is your criterion for your filter, then finding the right window size is the next step. I assumed here that by sliding you meant a moving average filter, i.e. something like this: $y_h(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{h-1} y(t-i)$, where $h$ is window size and $t=0,1,2,...\infty$. Notice, this is not the same as down sampling, where $t=0,h,2h,...\infty$. In case of down sampling your sampling frequency shrinks and as well as the sample size. However, it does not shift the phase, unlike the moving average filter. The phase shift means that you'll notice changes in the series later with wide window, compared to narrow window for your simple filter.
