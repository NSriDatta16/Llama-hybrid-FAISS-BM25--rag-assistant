I've found a formula that works with the cpp command: try cpp -xc++ (note the lack of spaces between -x and c++ ). $ printf '/* block comment */\n// line comment\nnot a comment\n' | cpp -xc++ # 1 " " # 1 " " # 1 " " # 1 " " not a comment contrast: $ printf '/* block comment */\n// line comment\nnot a comment\n' | cpp -x c++ i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: c: No such file or directory i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: c++: No such file or directory i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: warning: '-x -x' after last input file has no effect i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: no input files Now ' -x c++ ' is SUPPOSED to work, and DOES work on my Linux box (with gcc 4.4, but I recall it working as long ago as gcc 2.95) so it seems that Apple broke it. I really must reemphasize the importance of providing a complete, precise test case for questions like these. It did not occur to me yesterday to look for Apple having introduced a bug, because I know that wilx's answer should have worked, and in the absence of a precise description of what the OP's user tried, it was far more likely that they had something else on their actual command line that was negating it. If the command line and error messages I show above were provided in the original question, that would have targeted everyone's attention much more effectively.
