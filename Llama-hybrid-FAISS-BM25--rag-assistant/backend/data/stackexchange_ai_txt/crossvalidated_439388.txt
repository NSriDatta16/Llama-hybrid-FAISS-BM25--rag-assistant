This could have to do with missing data, or it could have to do with GENLIN using the full likelihood function by default, where LOGISTIC REGRESSION always uses the kernel of the likelihood (or both). If there are cases missing on any of the predictors or the dependent, then they won't be used as long as the predictor(s) on which they're missing are specified to the procedure. If you specify them on the Predictors tab, then listwise deletion of cases with missing data will be done using all of them, even if they're not used as predictors in a particular analysis. If you only specify one predictor on that tab and in the model, then listwise deletion is done only on that one predictor and the dependent variable, so more cases might remain for analysis. You'd want the same set of cases to be used for all these analyses, so specifying them all on the Predictors tab is the way to go (though if you have a lot of missing data you might want to consider something like multiple imputation to help deal with that). The other possible issue is that LOGISTIC REGRESSION always gives -2 LL values based on the kernel of the binomial likelihood function, ignoring the binomial constant that doesn't affect the parameter estimation process. This is the most common way things are reported. GENLIN by default reports -2 LL values based on the full likelihood. You can change this on the Statistics tab under Log-Likelihood Function (change it from Full to Kernel).
