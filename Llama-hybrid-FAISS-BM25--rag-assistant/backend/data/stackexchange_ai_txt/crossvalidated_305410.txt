Are neural network used for predicting dense vectors of values (multiple linear regression)

So, I was wondering about the following question: Is there any neural network architecture that it is good for predicting a dense vector of values between 0 and 1 (multiple linear regression)? And if so, is there any tutorial or paper that describes it? I've seen neural networks been used in classification problems where the output of the network is usually 1 for one neuron and 0 for the others. I have also seen some examples where the network tries to predict (regression) one output value (e.g given features about a house, estimate how mush it is worth it). However, if I want to, given an input, predict a vector with values between 0 and 1...is that possible? Or networks are just bad at it?
