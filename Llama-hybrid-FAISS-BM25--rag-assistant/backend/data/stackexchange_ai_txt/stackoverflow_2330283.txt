Why does this jQuery resizable handle disappear when the div is updated?

I'm using jQuery UI's resizable function to resize a div containing an image. On initial page load, the div contains someimage.png and the resizing works fine with the code below. The handle appears on the bottom right corner and I can click and drag it to resize the div. jQuery("#imgdiv").resizable(); Then I submit a form and a new image is fetched from a rails server using ajax: page.replace_html 'imgdiv', " " This updates the div with the new image but the resizable handle disappears and I can no longer resize the div. Do you know why this might be? Thanks.
