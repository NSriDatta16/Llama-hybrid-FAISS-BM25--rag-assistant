What is the best way to average a data set that mostly lies in extremes

I apologise that the question in the title is a little ambiguous but it is hard to word in a single sentence. Say I have a set of data, but it is found that a data point is either quite low or quite high, and less likely to be in the middle, imagine the opposite of a normal distribution. Ie, say I wanted to take a students average grade, but they either were A+, or F. Taking a simple average would give them the same overall score as a straight C student. What would be the best method for representing some overall score which perhaps could differentiate between those with very split grade profiles, and those with a more consistent one.
