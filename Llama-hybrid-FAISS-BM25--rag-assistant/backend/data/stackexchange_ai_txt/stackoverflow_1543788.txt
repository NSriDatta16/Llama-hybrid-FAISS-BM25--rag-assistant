Fetch Single Item Using DataContext

I'm doing the following: public MyItem FetchSingleItem(int id) { string query = "SELECT Something FROM Somewhere WHERE MyField = {0}"; IEnumerable collection = this.ExecuteQuery (query, id); List list = collection.ToList (); return list.Last (); } It's not very elegant really and I was hoping there's something a little better to get a single item out using DataContext . I'm extending from DataContext in my repository. There's a valid reason why before you ask, but that's not the point in this question ;) So, any better ways of doing this? Cheers
