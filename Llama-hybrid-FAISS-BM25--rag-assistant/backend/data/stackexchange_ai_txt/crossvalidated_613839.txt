You didn't find anything specific on this topic because any regression model would suffice for dealing with binary features. You can use ordinary least squares regression, regularized regression, random forest, $k$ NN regression, or any other model. There's no single best one , if there was, we wouldn't have multiple possible models. Different models would work for different datasets. So yes, to pick the model you can either do this empirically, based on their performance, or other properties (e.g. ease of interoperability, etc).
