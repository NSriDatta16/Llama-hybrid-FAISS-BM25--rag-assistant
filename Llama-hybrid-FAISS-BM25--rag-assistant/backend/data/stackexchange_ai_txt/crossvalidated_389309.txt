I'm not sure where you got three states. There are two states that each $X_n$ can be in: coin $1$ or coin $2$ . This suggests using the state space $S = \{1, 2\}$ . The process $(X_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is a Markov chain because the coin being used on a particular flip only depends on the result of the previous coin flip, not on the entire history of coin tosses up to that point. To compute the transition probabilities, we can first think intuitively in terms of the problem description. Suppose the coin in the $n$ th round is coin $1$ . The only way that the coin in the next round is coin $1$ is if the current coin shows heads. Since the current coin is coin $1$ , this happens with probability $0.4$ . To formalize this slightly, we just showed that $$ \begin{aligned} P(X_{n+1} = 1 \mid X_n = 1) &= P(\text{The $(n+1)$th coin is coin $1$} \mid \text{The $n$th coin is coin $1$}) \\ &= P(\text{The $n$th coin shows heads} \mid \text{The $n$th coin is coin $1$}) \\ &= P(\text{Coin $1$ shows heads}) \\ &= 0.4. \end{aligned} $$ This is one of the four transition probabilities needed for the transition matrix. You can similarly compute the remaining three transition probabilities to get the transition matrix. And like you said, once you have the transition matrix, the remaining parts are straightforward matrix computations (Note that $p^{(0)} = (1/2, 1/2)$ since you are told that the initial coin has an equal chance of being coin $1$ or coin $2$ ).
