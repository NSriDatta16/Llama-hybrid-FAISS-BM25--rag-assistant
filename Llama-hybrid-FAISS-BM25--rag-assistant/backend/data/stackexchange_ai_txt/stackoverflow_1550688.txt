Rails: How do I create a default value for attributes in Rails activerecord's model?

I want to create a default value for an attribute by defining it in ActiveRecord. By default everytime the record is created, I want to have a default value for attribute :status . I tried to do this: class Task But upon creation I still retrieve this error from the database: ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql::Error: Column 'status' cannot be null Therefore I presume the value was not applied to the attribute. What would be the elegant way to do this in Rails? Many thanks.
