Can this be considered as a trend?

I have this time series with a trend line plotted in R using the lowess function, f=0.2 (I couldn't use stl or decompose function because this data is measured annually). Although this seems to fit the data in some way, I'm hesitant to conclude this as a "trend" because trend is defined as a "long run increase/decrease over time"; but this here has fluctuations.
