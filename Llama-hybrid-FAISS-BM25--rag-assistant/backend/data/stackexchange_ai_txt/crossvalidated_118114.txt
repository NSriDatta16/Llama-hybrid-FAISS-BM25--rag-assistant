Simple Time Series Analysis

Suppose we have collected a set of data points $\{a_{t}\}$ at time $t = 1, 2, ..., t', ..., n$. Each data point consists of the following attributes: Average Citizen Income , GDP , Education Expense . At time $t'$, the government introduces certain policies, and I am interested in testing whether these policies has effect on Average Citizen Income . Ideally, I want to introduce an extra dummy attribute Policy for these data points, in which the data points collected before time $t'$ will take Policy = 0 , and the remaining data points will take Policy = 1 . Then I will regress Average Citizen Income on GDP , Education Expense , and Policy , and test whether the coefficient of Policy is 0. However, in this case the data points have time dependence, so I don't think I can directly adapt this approach. I wonder whether there are similar approaches (or alternative approaches) for testing whether the introduction of the government policies has effect on the average citizen income .
