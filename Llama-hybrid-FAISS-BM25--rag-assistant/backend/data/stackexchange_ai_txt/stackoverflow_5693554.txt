Detect Corners of Triangle in Image on iPhone

Hey guys, I'm having a slight problem when finalizing my app; indeed, up until now, at some point, the user had to select the three vertices of a triangle with some draggable objects. Now, even though this isn't a problem, I thought it could be interesting to have close to zero user-interaction, and have my app pick out the vertices of the triangle in an image, and automatically place the markers on the correct spots. After doing some research, and thinking about stuff lile OpenCV, ImageMagick, etc, I'm not really certain as to how one would recognize and find the location of the vertices of a triangle in an image. Any ideas? Thanks in advance! EDIT: If someone has a solution that doesn't involve amy external libraries, I'd still be quite glad to hear it!
