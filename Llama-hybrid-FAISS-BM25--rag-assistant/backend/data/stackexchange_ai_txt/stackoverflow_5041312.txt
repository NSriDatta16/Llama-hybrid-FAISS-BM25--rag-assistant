For Metatags a database storage will be better. You could use the ASP.NET cache object to improve performance so you don't have to get the info from DB on every request. You could use a time based expiration for the data or even sql based expiration trigger. The web.config file is not accessed every time an item is read. It's stored on memory so there is no performance hit on using it.
