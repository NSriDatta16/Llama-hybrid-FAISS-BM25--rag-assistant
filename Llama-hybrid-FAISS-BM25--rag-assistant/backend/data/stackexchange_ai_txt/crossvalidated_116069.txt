When you say the variables are dependent, I think you mean to say that the observations are dependent. Since your contingency table shows the same response levels for row and column variables, I am guessing that you have paired polytomous data. Examples of this would be self-assessment of socio-economic status in husband-wife dyads, or presence/absence of a congenital disease in heterozygous twin-pairs. With paired binary data, there are two types of hypotheses that one can test: rater agreement versus standard row/column dependence. With agreement, the outcome of interest can be conceived of as a binary indicator of Yes (agree) or No (disagree), so the frequencies of the diagonal of the matrix are of interest. Testing for significance of agreement can be based on percentage agreement or Cohen's Kappa (which accounts for events that are not 50/50 on average). For polytomous responses, Cohen's Kappa has a weighted analogue that can borrow information from adjacent cells. With dependence and binary outcomes, McNemar's paired odds ratio can be used to infer a difference in the frequency of paired responses by conditioning on the first response and measuring the second response. This has the effect of discarding concordant pairs, since they tell us nothing about the differences. With ordinal paired-outcomes, there have been several methods developed, and none of them have been received favorably. It turns out that the paired t-test has very good power to detect a difference in "mean ordinal responses" for paired ordinal outcomes. In your case of low / intermediate / high, the ordinal coding of these values would be 0 / 1 / 2.
