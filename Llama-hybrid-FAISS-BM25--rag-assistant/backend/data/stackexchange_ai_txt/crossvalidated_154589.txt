A very simple time series to validate the correctness of your code is the one caused by the function sin(x). It's periodic nature makes it a good test function imo. Just print out (or plot) the output activations of your network and compare it with the desired values to see the performance. Alternatively you can just test XOR like Elman did in his original paper : 101 000 011 110 101 ...
