I'm the author of Hector https://github.com/rantav/hector , the leading java client for cassandra so I would encourage you to have a look at what it has to offer. While I personally have not been using hector with spring, we did get a few contributions which added spring support. See for example https://github.com/rantav/hector/blob/master/core/src/test/resources/cassandra-context-test-v2.xml and https://github.com/rantav/hector/blob/master/core/src/test/resources/cassandra-context-test-v2-new.xml
