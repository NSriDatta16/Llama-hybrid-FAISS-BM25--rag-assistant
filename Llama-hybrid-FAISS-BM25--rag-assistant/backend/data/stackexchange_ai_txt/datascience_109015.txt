What are the exact differences between Word Embedding and Word Vectorization?

I am learning NLP. I have tried to figure out the exact difference between Word Embedding and Word Vectorization. However, seems like some articles use these words interchangeably. But I think there must be some sort of differences. In Vectorization, I came across these vectorizers: CountVectorizer, HashingVectorizer, TFIDFVectorizer Moreover, while I was trying to understand the word embedding. I found these tools. Bag of words, Word2Vec Would you please briefly summarize the differences and the algorithms of between Word Embeddings and Word Vectorization? Thanks a lot.
