Magento ORM Documentation

Outside of the source code, is there any extensive documentation on the Magento ORM? I get the basics, and can usually dig through the Mage code base, litter it with Mage::Log calls and figure out something that works, but my efficiency would go way up if I had a high level overview of how the models are intended to be used. How do the aggregate methods work, what's the best way to join, when should you extend the models, when's the best time to use the eav models vs. the non-eav ones, etc. Something like the Django Model Documentation , but for Magento.
