Rather than passing authentication tokens, Carmen could use OpenID to authenticate Alice through Bob. This wouldn't involve Alice giving Carmen any credentials. It could involve another user interaction, but user-agent assistance (signed cookies or client certs) should reduce this (I generally have to interact with my OpenID provider the first time I authenticate for a consumer). This assumes that Bob and Carmen can communicate each time authentication is needed.
