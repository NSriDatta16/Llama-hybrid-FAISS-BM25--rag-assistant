This panel keeps getting position: absolute applied. How can I stop it?

I'm using an AbsolutePanel to do some drag-and-drop kind of stuff. I add child Widgets to the AbsolutePanel, and then use absolutePanel.setWidgetPosition to set their position. But I keep getting this error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.AbsolutePanel is missing CSS 'position:{relative,absolute,fixed}' the stack trace points right to the setWidgetPosition call. BUT! Not only have I already called absolutePanel.getElement.getStyle().setPosition(Position.RELATIVE), I have also applied a style name with a position: relative attribute. When I inspect the element with FireBug, it has a style attribute with "position: absolute" right in it, presumably overriding everything else. How can I get rid of this warning? The actual behavior seems to be working fine, but maybe I'm missing something.
