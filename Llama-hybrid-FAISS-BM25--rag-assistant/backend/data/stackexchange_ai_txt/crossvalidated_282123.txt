What does phi mean in arima simulation

I'm learning time series and following this tutorial When it comes to simulation, there are 2 types AR: AR1: x1 = arima.sim(list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=.9), n=100) AR2: x = arima.sim(list(order=c(2,0,0), ar=c(1,-.9)), n=100) The value in ar is called phi. But I don't know what is it? In AR2, there are 2 values in ar , do you know why?
