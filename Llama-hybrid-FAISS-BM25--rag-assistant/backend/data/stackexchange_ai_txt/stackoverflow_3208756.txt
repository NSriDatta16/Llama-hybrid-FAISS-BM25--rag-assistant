Others have done quite a bit of work on your behalf, so I'd suggest just using something like the OpenCalais API . There's a python wrapper to the API at http://code.google.com/p/python-calais/ . "Who is Lady Gaga?" seems to be too short a piece of text for them to give a decent response. However, if you took the trouble to do a two step process and grab the first paragraph from wikipedia for Lady Gaga, and then supply that to the OpenCalais API you get very good results. You can check it out quickly by just cut and pasting the first paragraph from wikipedia into the OpenCalais viewer . The result is a classification into the topic "Entertainment Culture" with a 100% confidence estimate. Similarly, the baseball example returns "sports" as the topic with further social tags of "recreation", "baseball" etc. Edit Here's another thought prompted by Calais' use of social tags: sending the wikipedia url for Lady Gaga to the delicious API with curl -k https://user:password@api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/suggest?url=http://en .wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_gaga returns music wikipedia wiki people bio cool facts music gaga ladygaga wikipedia lady etc. Should be easy enough to ignore the wikipedia/wiki type entries.
