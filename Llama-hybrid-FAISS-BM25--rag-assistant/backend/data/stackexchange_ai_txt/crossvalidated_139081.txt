yes you can easily duplicate any of the formulas in Excel. RMSE is simple enough. Make another column that is the difference between observed and predicted values. Then do something like =SQRT(SUMSQ(C2:C100)/COUNT(C2:C100)) which is the formula for RMSE. (assuming C is your list of differentials between predicted and observed). Something like MAPE is even easier - that can be calculated on a row by row basis. abs(actual - observed)/actual Then average that column. Yeah, you can pretty much look-up and copy any formula into Excel. I've replicated a lot of R code in Excel (like ETS models) simply because it's easier to pass along.
