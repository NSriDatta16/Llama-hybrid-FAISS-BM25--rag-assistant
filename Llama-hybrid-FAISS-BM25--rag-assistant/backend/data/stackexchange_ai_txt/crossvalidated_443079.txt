I think what you describe as $k$ -fold cross-validation is fine. I would urge you to use freely available and established references in your work instead of websites; websites might be excellent at times but it can be hard to convince people of their quality and/or detect "mistakes" when starting in ML. For example, on the matter of cross-validation: Hastie et al. (2009) Elements of Statistical Learning , Sect. 7.10 Cross-Validation , Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David (2014) Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms , Sect. 11.2.4 $k$ -Fold Cross Validation and Bishop (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , Sect. 1.3. Model Selection can all serve as authoritative, well-established and widely used references that will withstand academic scrutiny. For that matter, probably most of the areas covered in an undergraduate ML course will be included in one of these books. On a purely interpersonal level: Your lecturer might have a particular application in mind. Politely ask him/her to point you to some relevant material.
