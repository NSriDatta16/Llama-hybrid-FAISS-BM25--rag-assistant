I would recommend you the Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models book by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill. It covers a broad variety of topics in regression analysis, including hierarchical and Bayesian models. It is very readable and has many code examples. It doesn't go in-depth into theory, rather focuses on practical applications while helping you to understand the methods, but rather focuses on building intuition, than on formal proofs. Just as an aside, this book has been effectively split into two editions now: Regression and Other Stories , which is already available and covers a broad range of topics (see link here ), and Advanced Regression and Multilevel Models , which is estimated to come out at the end of 2024 , though this has been pushed back multiple times so it may be later.
