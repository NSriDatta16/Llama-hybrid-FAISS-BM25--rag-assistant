Why IGARCH and GARCH (out of six models) with t distribution or GED distribution are optimal when modeling six FX time series?

I recently performed conditional variance model specification on six different time series ( USDGBP , USDJPY , USDCAD , USDRUB , USDAUD , USDEUR ). The correct form ARMA have been specified for each of the six series before taking conditional variance tests. The results shown below are results for USDJPY and USDCAD USDJPY [ There are different models I have tried and each of model has been used with normal, $t$, and GED distribution. What puzzles me a lot is that the information criterion consistently shows that IGARCH(1,1) with $t$ distribution and GARCH(1,1) with t distribution have the lowest BIC for three different series ( USDGBP , USDJPY , USDCAD ); And IGARCH(1,1) with GED distribution and GARCH(1,1) with GED distribution have the lowest BIC for two other different series ( USDEUR , USDRUB ); The last series has GJR with $t$ distribution as the lowest BIC. (as attached files). And the results are verified by other classmates. So the results show that IGARCH and GARCH dominate the whole set of possible models with only $t$ distribution and GED distribution that matters. But why is that? Is this because GARCH(1,1) is simple enough to explain the conditional variance of the time series so that it has lowest BIC? And IGARCH(1,1) has $\alpha + \beta = 1$, which well approximate GARCH(1,1) ? And why only $t$ distribution and GED distribution matters here?
