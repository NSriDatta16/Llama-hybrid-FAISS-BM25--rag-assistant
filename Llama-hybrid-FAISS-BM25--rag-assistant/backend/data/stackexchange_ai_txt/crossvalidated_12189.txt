Canonical correlation analysis on a MICE data set

I am looking to do a canonical correlations analysis (CCA) in R, using the CCA package, on a multiply imputed dataset (obtained from the mice package). I know that the mice package allows you to pool the complete data sets and do linear models and general linear models using formulas, e.g.: mice.data but I don't think it has the ability to do that for CCA. The reason is that the pool function requires a variance-covariance matrix, which CCA does not compute. Question: What is the best way to pool my data sets/results? Is it valid to do a CCA on each complete data set separately, then average the canonical variables for each imputation to obtain a final set of canonical variables? Or is there some way to do this all at once with a long-format complete() dataset that contains separate .id and .imp variables? E.g. for Question 1: Vars 2-5 are the predictor set, and vars 6-15 are the criterion set; the merged data that includes both are imputed together to produce mice.data. mice.data So I end up with a list of canonical correlations on each complete imputed dataset, which I then have to figure out how to average/pool together. Alternatively, for Question 2, I'd have a single data frame with a separate .imp variable specifying the number of imputation for that dataset, but I'd still have to figure out how to pool those results together, potentially with a clever aggregation? Perhaps this isn't possible, actually.
