Betadisper with distance matrix or principle coordinates for ecological data?

When reading through the vegan::betadisper() function help document, I noticed that it is suggested that: "However, better measures of distance than the Euclidean distance are available for ecological data. These can be accommodated by reducing the distances produced using any dissimilarity coefficient to principal coordinates, which embeds them within a Euclidean space. The analysis then proceeds by calculating the Euclidean distances between group members and the group centroid on the basis of the principal coordinate axes rather than the original distances." I used to run betadisper directly on my distance matrix created using measurement such as bray-curtis or unifrac. Given this notice, I wonder if it is better for me to use the pcoa coordinates generated by cmdscale , generate a Euclidian distance matrix based on the coordinates, and then run the betadisper based on the new distance matrix. If so, how many PCs should I use? Or probably it won't make a big difference? Thanks!
