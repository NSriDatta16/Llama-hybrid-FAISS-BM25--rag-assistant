In time series the data is ordered. It makes a big difference. For instance, is OLS you have a typical model: $$y_i=c+\phi x_i+e_i$$ Here, there is no particular order in the index $i$. You might be measuring the output (GDP) of countries indexed by $i$, and it doesn't matter in each order you add them to the data set. In time series instead of some random sample $i$ you get the ordered time intervals $t$. Now if you look at the US GDP time series, the observations come in a very particular order. Also, stationarity is a time series version of the exogeneity. It's a weakened version of exogneity requirement from OLS. So, it's not like OLS doesn't care at all about these issues. It does, but time series due to its time ordering complicates the things, so econometricians came up with a weaker version of exogeneity. It allows to do something. Note how in time series a well known Gauss-markov conditions are losened up a bit. In dynamic model such as you mentioned with lagged dependent variable as a regressor, some benign (in OLS) problems become serious issues, e.g. autocorrelation in residuals.
