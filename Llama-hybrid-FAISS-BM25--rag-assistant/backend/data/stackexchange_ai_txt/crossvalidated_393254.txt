Help with PCA Question

The conventional model for probabilistic principal component analysis has a standard normal latent $\vec{y}$ and a loading matrix $\Lambda$ : $P(\vec{y}) \sim N(\vec{0}, I)$ , $P(\vec{x}|\vec{y}) \sim N(\Lambda \vec{y}, \psi I)$ An alternative would be to draw $\vec{y}$ from a normal with diagonal covariance (say $\Sigma$ , and then restrict $\Lambda$ to have orthonormal columns: $P(\vec{y}) \sim N(\vec{0}, \Gamma), P(\vec{x}|\vec{y}) \sim N(\Lambda \vec{y}, \psi I)$ with $\Gamma_{ij}=0$ for $i \neq j$ and $\Lambda^T \Lambda = I$ where $\Gamma_{ij} =\Gamma_{ji} =0$ and $\Lambda^T \Lambda=0$ . Question: Show that this alternative model is equivalent to the standard one in the sense that it can model exactly the same set of possible marginal distributions. I really have no idea what I am being asked to do here. I know that there is some equivalence of PCA models under rotation and scaling - should I be working in that direction, or am I supposed to integrate out the latent variable and show I get the same distribution? Or something else entirely? Help please. lead to exactly the same marginal distributions.
