It's a regression model. AR in GARCH means auto regressive. It's special in that the AR (auto regressive) means it regress on itself or in time series case it regress on it's past values. The other answer is flat out wrong. Just because it doesn't use other predictors/covariates doesn't mean it's not regression. Nor the fact that it regress on itself means it loses it regression status. GARCH, at least where I've learned it, falls under time series analysis. More specifically it is accounting for risk/volatility or in general statistic domain variance/std deviation. Within the framework of econometric, GARCH is modeling variance/std dev and is often use in tandem with AR/ARIMA/ARMA which model the mean/expectation. The reason why we care about modeling variance/std dev is because it is something econometric cares about, risk and volatility.
