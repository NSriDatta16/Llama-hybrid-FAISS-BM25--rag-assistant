How do I programmatically remove a certificate in Trusted Root Certification Authorities?

I need to be able to remove a specific certificate from each PC in my organization. Yes, I could go seat-to-seat, but I have until Thursday to pull it off, and I don't have the manpower to go seat-to-seat. Is there a programmatic way of doing this using C#?
