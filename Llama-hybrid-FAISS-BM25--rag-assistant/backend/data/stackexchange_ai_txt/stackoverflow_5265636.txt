@James is right. To build on his answer, since you can call the base version from the overridden one, you could send some kind of a flag into the method to tell it whether to execute its own implementation or the overridden one. Something like this: public override void Foo(bool useBaseImplementation) { if(useBaseImplementation) { base.Foo(useBaseImplementation); } else { //other stuff here } } In order for it to work, you'd have to have the flag as a parameter for the base one as well, but you could just ignore it there. Not elegant, maybe downright ugly, but does what you're looking for.
