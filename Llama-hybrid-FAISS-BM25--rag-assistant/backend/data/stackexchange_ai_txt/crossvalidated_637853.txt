Such type of error plots may suggest the following occurred: the order of the training objects was changed during sweeps, causing the learned connection weights to lose their predictive accuracy of the target values. Neural network learning commonly becomes biased toward the order of training objects. new (never seen before) training objects were introduced (like another fold for CV - see plot below) the connection weights were wiped out or modified. Batch vs. online learning won't affect MSE throughout training/validation/testing nearly as much as the above-listed issues will. Below is a similar example showing what happens when new objects are introduced in each CV fold:
