You may want to check out these lectures ( i attended them myself (at CTU in Prague) and must say that they were really good): Parallel algorithms by prof. Ing. Pavel Tvrdik Csc. The idea how algorithms work is always presented in a very good (ilustrated) manner and mathematical background is of course included, if you are interested. The author is a highly valued proffesional in this subject and concentrates more on practical implementations than on pure theory.
