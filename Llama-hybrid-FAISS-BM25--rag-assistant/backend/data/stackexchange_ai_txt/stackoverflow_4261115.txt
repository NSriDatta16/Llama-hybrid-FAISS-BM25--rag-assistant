Data binding or foreach for displaying files from isolated storage

I'm trying to learn how to write apps for Windows Phone 7. I would like to know which method for displaying the contents of an isolated storage file is best. I am currently using the foreach method where foreach string in storage, it will create and add a listboxitem and its contents to a listbox. I am wondering whether as I currently do not have a Windows Phone device to test, if data binding would be less CPU intensive and therefore faster. Thanks!
