Is there a way to set custom collapsable code regions in Xcode

Is there a way to create custom collapsable code regions in Xcode similar to how Visual Studio can fold around #region/#endregion blocks? It would be nice to throw all autogenerated content into a region that I can fold away until I need to look at it. #pragma mark doesn't seem to do the trick.
