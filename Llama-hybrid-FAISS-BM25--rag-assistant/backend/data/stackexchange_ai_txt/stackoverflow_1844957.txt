Take care not to confuse disk seek times and disk read rates. It takes millions of CPU cycles (5–10 milliseconds or 5–10 million nanoseconds) to seek to the right track on a hard drive (HDD). Once you're there, you can read tens of megabytes of data per second, assuming low fragmentation. For solid-state drives (SSD), seek times are lower (35,000–100,000ns) than HDDs. Whether or not the data is compressed on the disk, you still have to seek. The question becomes, is (disk read time for compressed data + the decompression time) Measure with a reasonable workload.
