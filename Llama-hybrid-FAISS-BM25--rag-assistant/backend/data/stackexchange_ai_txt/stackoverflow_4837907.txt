A form timer in php

I want a form to be submitted atleast 15 seconds after the page has loaded (because thats how long it takes on average for the form to be filled in). I know I can do something like $time_page_loaded = time() at the top; if (time() Is this correct? Also when you re-factor this into a function how would you make it?
