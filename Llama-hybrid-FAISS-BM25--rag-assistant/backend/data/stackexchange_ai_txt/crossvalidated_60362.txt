Choice between Type-I, Type-II, or Type-III ANOVA

We have a dataset with three variables (dV: self-reported measure on scale 1-5, assumed to be metric; iV1: factor with 4 levels; iV2: factor with 8 levels). We are interested whether the dV differs in regard to both iVs and whether there is an interaction between the iVs. Idea: Calculating an ANOVA with both main effects and the interaction between both iVs using R. The question: What Type of Sum of Squares should be used for this research question? Using aov() in R calculates Type-I Sum of Squares as standard. SPSS and SAS, on the other hand, calculate Type-III Sum of Squares by default. However, using Anova() {car} in combination with options(contrasts=c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")) in R gives the same Type-III ANOVA tables as calculated in SPSS. I have already read the following discussions: http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/sscc/gangc/SS.html http://myowelt.blogspot.de/2008/05/obtaining-same-anova-results-in-r-as-in.html However, I am still confused which Type of Sums of Squares is the most adequate for our question. The results (F and p values) differ considerably.
