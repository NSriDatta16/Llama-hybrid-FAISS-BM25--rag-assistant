How to create a complex doxygen alias?

I have a situation where I need to nest aliases like this: /* \activate{ * \no, * \no, * \no, * \yes * \changes * - E-mail * - Is main * - Home phone * - Cell phone * - Relation * - First Name * - Last Name, * \no * } */ See the changes command? It can have inifinite parameters. How do I work around this issue? This currently looks ugly but less ugly then embedding HTML in my comments.
