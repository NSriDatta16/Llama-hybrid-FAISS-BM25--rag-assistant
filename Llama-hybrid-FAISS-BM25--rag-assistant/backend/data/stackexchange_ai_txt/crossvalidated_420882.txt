Why do we make convolutional neural networks longer and thinner between each layer?

For example, I'm wondering about in this image Why is it that after each convolutional layer, it is preferred that we increase the number of channel (make the blocks longer)? What is the benefit of having multiple output channels rather than just outputting to a single channel?
