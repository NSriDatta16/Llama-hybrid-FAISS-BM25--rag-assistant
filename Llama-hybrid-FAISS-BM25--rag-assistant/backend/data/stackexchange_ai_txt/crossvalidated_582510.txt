time series with multiple respondents of same variables

I have some time series data consisting of several people with certain indexes according to time. It looked like this: person 1 time index1 index2 9:05 3.2 40 9:25 5.0 30 9:55 4.1 50 ... person 2 time index1 index2 9:10 4.5 20 9:30 3.8 60 9:50 4.2 40 ... The time interval is same however the start time, duration time and the end time is different. The goal is to estimate index2 based on time and index1. I believe there is certain pattern behind the data in total, say there should be similar cycles and trends but got stuck since what I often confronted was simply one person situation with exact start time and end time. What should I do to deal with this kind of time series problem or any guidance I could refer to? Any help will be appreciated.
