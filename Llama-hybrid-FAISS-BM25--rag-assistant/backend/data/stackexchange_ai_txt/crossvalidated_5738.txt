I am not quite sure about the $c = 0.212$, but the following article provides a much more detailed description of these data: Efron, B., & Morris, C. (1975). Data analysis using Stein's estimator and its generalizations. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 70(350), 311-319 (link to pdf) or more detailed Efron, B., & Morris, C. (1974). Data analysis using Stein's estimator and its generalizations. R-1394-OEO, The RAND Corporation, March 1974 (link to pdf) . On page 312, you will see that Efron & Morris use an arc-sin transformation of these data, so that the variance of the batting averages is approximately unity: > dat yi k yi c c [1] 0.2091971 Then they use c=.209 for the computation of the $z$ values, which we can easily back-transform: > zi round((sin(zi/sqrt(45)) + 1)/2,3) ### back-transformation [1] 0.290 0.286 0.282 0.277 0.273 0.273 0.268 0.264 0.259 [10] 0.259 0.254 0.254 0.254 0.254 0.254 0.249 0.244 0.239 So these are the values of the Stein estimator. For Clemente, we get .290, which is quite close to the .294 from the 1977 article.
