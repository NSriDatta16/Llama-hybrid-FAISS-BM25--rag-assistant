First try.. Here is an algorithm with an improved reduced average complexity than brute force. Essentially you create strings with increasing lengths in each iteration. This may not be the best solution but we will wait for the best one to come by... :) Start with list 1. All entries in that list are valid solutions of length 2 (#=5) Next, when you introduce list 2. keep a record of all valid solutions of length 4, which end up being {1425, 2314, 2315, 2415} (#=4). When you add the third list to the mix, repeat the process. You will end up with {142536, 241536} (#=2). The complexity reduction comes in place because you are throwing away bad strings in each iteration. The worst case scenario happens to be still the same -- in the case that all pairs are distinct.
