Neural networks can only really give point estimates, not distributions. Bayesian neural networks can output distributions, so you can take a look into those but are harder to work with. MCMC and deep learning are pretty disparate fields. MCMC uses random sampling to approximate a distribution, whereas deep learning approximates a function through minimizing a cost function. You wouldn't use MCMC to train a neural net, if that's what you're asking.
