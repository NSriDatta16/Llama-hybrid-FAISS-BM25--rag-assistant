asp.net development server + FF issue. IE OK

Guys, I've came across this problem I can't resolve myselg, I'm pretty sure I miss something pretty obvious, but that's usually how it is. I'm developing my asp.net webapp in VS2008, XP SP3. When I want to debug, the asp.net starts the development server and the default browser associated with the vs2008 opens up and loads the page. In IE7 it loads the application, in FF3 I get : connection failed (111) connection refused This problem has just popped out this morning, after the restart of the computer (usually I just put it into a sleep mode) and until now it was working ok for both IE or FF. I can't think of anything that could have had changed since, there were no windows updates, just the antivirus, also I put the solution to SVN (but didn't do update on my end). Any ideas? Thanks heaps! UPDATE: from FF console: Request headers Host: localhost:3691 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en,sk;q=0.8,cs;q=0.5,en-us;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Proxy-Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost:3691/CLIENT/Default.aspx Cookie: tmTOCSaveStateCookie=undefined%2CRESOURCE_1; pmTOCSaveStateCookie=undefined Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache Response headers: Server: squid/2.6.STABLE16 Date: Thu, 02 Jul 2009 08:32:21 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 993 Expires: Thu, 02 Jul 2009 08:32:21 GMT X-Squid-Error: ERR_CONNECT_FAIL 111 X-Cache: MISS from proxy.xyz.xyz Via: 1.0 proxy.xyz.xyz:8080 (squid/2.6.STABLE16) Proxy-Connection: close I've tried to turn off firewall, antivirus but no luck. Has it got something to do with authentication?
