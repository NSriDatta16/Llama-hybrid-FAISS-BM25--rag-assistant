Bulk insert efficiency in NoSQL databases

I am developing a service that needs to perform bulk insert of tens of thousands of rows/items/objects at a time, about 20 times per second. (The NoSQL storage can be sharded, so inserts can work in parallel. The sharding strategy, and sharding in general, do not matter for this discussion.) The question is: which NoSQL products in your opinion exhibit the best performance under such circumstances? The answer should include all costs, including serialization and overhead of chatty/laconic protocols. There is no requirement for the storage to be persistent. Thank you!
