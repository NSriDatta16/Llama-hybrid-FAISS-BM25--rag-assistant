Making Latex typeset given text on two facing pages

How do I encourage/make Latex typeset some portion of text so that it will all appear on a consecutive even-page, odd-page pair of pages? With trial and error, \nopagebreak can be coaxed into doing this, but is there a strategy that Just Works? Something like a samepage environment would be ideal, but one that: Will force a pagebreak on odd pages if that is needed to get all the text on facing pages; Allows up to one page break anywhere in the environment body, and fails noisily if that can't be ensured.
