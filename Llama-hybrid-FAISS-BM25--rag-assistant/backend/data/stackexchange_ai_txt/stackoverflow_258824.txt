WPF - Binding IsMouseOver to Visibility

I have a window which overrides a RadioButton 's ControlTemplate to show a custom control inside of it. Inside the custom control, I have a button's visibility tied to IsMouseOver , which works correctly in showing the button only when the mouse is hovering over the control. However, when I click on the RadioButton , the Button disappears. After some debugging and reading, it seems that the RadioButton is capturing the mouse on click, and this makes IsMouseOver for the UserControl false. I tried binding the Button 's visibility to FindAncestor {x:Type RadioButton} and it works, but it seems a bit fragile to me to have the UserControl depend on who is containing it. The code for the window and the user control is below. Any suggestions?
