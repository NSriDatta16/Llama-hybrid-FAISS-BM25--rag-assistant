If you are looking for a simple performance boost for in your application through multi-threading OpenMP is a simple library that will allow your program to scale across multiple cores, requiring only #pragma placement in your code to parallelize blocks of code or loops, with additional options to weak specific performance. This doesn't easily allow for coarse parallelism like a GUI/processing/IO division in the application, but does allow for easily visible multi-threading performance boosts on multi-core machines in heavy number-crunching.
