How I know this is not possible in jqGrid. Is it supported by sortable feature of jQuery UI (see http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ ) which are bais for the corresponding feature in jqGrid? Moreover both "Sortable Rows" amd "Drag and Drop Rows" features of jqGrid are currently not supported if multiselect is set to true .
