R caret - how to combine principal components and non-principal-component predictors?

Consider the following example. Suppose I want to model x in DF2 using everything else. While it makes sense to do pca pre-processing on variable 1 to 10, I want to keep z the factor variable as is and simply center and scale y and v . My first question is whether this approach makes sense at all. DF = data.frame(x=rep(c("a","b","c"),each=3), y=c(1,3,6), v=1:9, z=rep(c('m','n','l'),3)) DF i If it does make sense, how can I do it efficiently? I think one approach is to use preProcess on variable 1 to 10 and recreate the data frame using the resulting principal components and y , v , and z . But that doesn't seem very efficient. At the same time, It is often advised such as in this post that pre-processing is done during resampling in the train function. But I haven't figured out how to specify the different pre-processing methods for different predictors. Thanks in advance for any insight.
