One big problem with DVCS for scientific programming is binary data. It is often the case that scientific programming requires input/output of gigantic files, and that kills performances very quickly on every DVCS I know of (bzr, hg, git). That's one area where svn is much better currently. I think DVCS can be quite useful for papers as well, but that means that your collaborator knows the DVCS as well.
