In most runtime environments memory allocated to an application from the operating system remains in the application, and is seldom returned back to the operating system. Freeing a memory block allows you to reuse the block from within the application, but does not free it to the operating system to make it available to other applications. Microsoft's C runtime library tries to return memory back to the operating system by having _heapmin_region call _heap_free_region or _free_partial_region which call VirtualFree to release data to the operating system. However, if whole pages in the corresponding region are not empty, then they will not be freed. A common cause of this is the bookkeeping information and storage caching of C++ containers.
