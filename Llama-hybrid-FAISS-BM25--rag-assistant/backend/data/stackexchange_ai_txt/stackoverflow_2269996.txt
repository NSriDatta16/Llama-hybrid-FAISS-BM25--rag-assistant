SVN: What does the status "switched relative to its parent" mean?

I'm trying to update our live site from the SVN repository. As far as I know, there's nothing in the repos. itself that should conflict with anything in the working copy dir. But when I try to "svn up" on the public root directory, I get the following error: svn: REPORT request failed on '/svn/oursite/!svn/vcc/default' svn: Working copy path 'app' does not exist in repository When I run "svn status" on the docroot, I see the following: docroot$ svn st -N +S app +S downloads +S index.php (etc.) According to the docs, the S flag indicates whether the item is switched relative to its parent . What does that even mean , and what can I do to fix this? EDIT: I should mention that I'm the only one who has worked with the SVN repository. I've been working with it all day, trying to defeat one corruption issue after another as I move things around. (SVN is great, but it sure is fragile... Seems to break if you just glance at it wrong!)
