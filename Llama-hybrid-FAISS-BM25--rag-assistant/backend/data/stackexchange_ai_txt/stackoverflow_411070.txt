I disagree with the above comments that an exception is inefficient in this instance, especially since it's being used in an I/O bound operation. Here's a more realistic example using Django with an in-memory sqlite database. Each of a 100 different queries was run, then averaged for each of a 100 runs. Although I doubt if it would matter, I also changed the order of execution. With ObjectDoesNotExist... 0.102783939838 Without exception ........ 0.105322141647 With ObjectDoesNotExist... 0.102762134075 Without exception ........ 0.101523952484 With ObjectDoesNotExist... 0.100004930496 Without exception ........ 0.107946784496 You can instrument this in your own Django environment, but I doubt if your time is well spent avoiding this exception.
