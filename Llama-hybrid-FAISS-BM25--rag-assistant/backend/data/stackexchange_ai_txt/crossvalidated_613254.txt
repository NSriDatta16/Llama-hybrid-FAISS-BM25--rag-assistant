How should I visualize errors that can be on either size of mean

I'm building an app to help players improve the accuracy of their shots in pool (pocket billiards). Someone might miss shots to either side of the centerline (overcut or undercut), and that's shown on a scatterplot as positive or negative degrees. I want to overlay the scatterplot with a line of moving average error to show progression. Naively plotting a moving average won't produce good results because a player who misses wildly on either side will have an average close to zero even though they are very inaccurate. Ideally, I'd want the visualization to show some sort of moving average of the magnitude of error as well as the side the player tends to miss on.
