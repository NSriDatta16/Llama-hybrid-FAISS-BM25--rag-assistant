Scikitlearn grid search random forest using oob as metric?

Have looked at data on oob but would like to use it as a metric in a grid search on a Random Forest classifier (multiclass) but doesn't seem to be a recognised scorer for the scoring parameter. I do have OoB set to True in the classifier. Currently using scoring ='accuracy' but would like to change to oob score. Ideas or comments welcome
