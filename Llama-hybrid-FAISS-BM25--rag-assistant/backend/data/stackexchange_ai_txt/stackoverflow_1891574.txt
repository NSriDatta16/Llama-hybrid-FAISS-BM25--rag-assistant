I think you are on the right track. It really is going to depend on the security requirements of your application. You can think of $_SESSION very similar to $_COOKIE: as a mechanism to provide state between page refreshes. In this context, the identity of your user. Your database should provide further authentication mechanisms. Things that may uniquely identify your user. A typical assumption is the IP address, but what happens if someones IP changes? User agent is another possibility but these arent very unique. I would suggest taking a look at: http://php.net/manual/en/session.security.php
