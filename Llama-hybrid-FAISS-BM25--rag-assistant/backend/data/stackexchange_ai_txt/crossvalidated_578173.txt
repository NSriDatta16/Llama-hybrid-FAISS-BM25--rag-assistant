Is there a way to tell when a time-series can no longer be predicted by the same model?

I am modeling a time series using a multiple (dynamic) linear regression model. I suspect that at some point, the model no longer accurately predicts the true series. Is there a way to find the point where the true series and the model diverge? Ideally I'm looking for an already implemented R-package.
