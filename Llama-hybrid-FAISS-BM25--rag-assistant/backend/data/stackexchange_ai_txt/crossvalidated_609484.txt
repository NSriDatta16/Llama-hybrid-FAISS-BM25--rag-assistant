Understanding ACF and PACF plots for model selection for AR(1) vs AR(2)

Good afternoon all, I've got a model that models a time series and I am trying to decide which how the residuals are correlated. The first model, called $m1$ is models $AR(1)$ residuals and the second model models $AR(2)$ residuals called $m2$ . I'm looking at the residual plots, ACF/PACF plots and also the AIC/BIC values of the two models to decide if $m1$ or $m2$ would a better model for the residuals. However upon closer inspection I cannot determine which one would be best as they are both very similar in the analysis and I lean more towards the AR(1) model since it is simpler. Are my assessments correct on this and am I understanding the ACF/PACF plots correctly? ACF/PACF of $m1$ and $m2$ Analysis: There appears to be slightly less variability in the ACF/PACF for the $m1$ model. I'm also having some issues fully understanding these ACF/PACF plots. Plots of the residuals of $m1$ and $m2$ Analysis: No apparent difference in the residuals between the $m1$ and $m2$ as they are almost identical. AIC/BIC values m1: -286.812/-274.2221 m2: -287.7302/-271.9928 Analysis: AIC slightly favors $m2$ and BIC slightly favors $m1$ . Thank you for the time.
