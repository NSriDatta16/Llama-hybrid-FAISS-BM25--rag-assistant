Is there a Boost (or other common lib) type for matrices with string keys?

I have a dense matrix where the indices correspond to genes. While gene identifiers are often integers, they are not contiguous integers. They could be strings instead, too. I suppose I could use a boost sparse matrix of some sort with integer keys, and it wouldn't matter if they're contiguous. Or would this still occupy a great deal of space, particularly if some genes have identifiers that are nine digits? Further, I am concerned that sparse storage is not appropriate, since this is an all-by-all matrix (there will be a distance in each and every cell, provided the gene exists). I'm unlikely to need to perform any matrix operations (e.g., matrix multiplication). I will need to pull vectors out of the matrix (slices). It seems like the best type of matrix would be keyed by a Boost unordered_map (a hash map), or perhaps even simply an STL map. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Do I really need to roll my own? I thought I saw such a class somewhere before. Thanks!
