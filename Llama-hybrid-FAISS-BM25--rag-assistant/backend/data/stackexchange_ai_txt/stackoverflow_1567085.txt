Well, I suppose it depends on your server platform, but in my experience it's the server that determines session timeout. The reload that your client-side code triggers will, unless you somehow override the normal behavior of the server, refresh the session and start the timer over again. Now, what you could do is update the page client-side and not talk to the server at all. To do that, you'd effectively load the code to the "almost timed out" page at the same time you load the original page. Then, when your timeout fires, you just show the desired page and hide whatever's there. I would encourage you to consider the usability issues with this overall scheme.
