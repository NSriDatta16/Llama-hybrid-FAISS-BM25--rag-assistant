I would recommend "utf16" if you are storing a lot of Chinese characters. This will store all the characters you are likely to encounter in two bytes (including boring old ASCII chars!). This is better than utf8 for this type of data as common ideograms consume three or four bytes of storage and often require a complex conversion to utf16/32 before they can be used within a program.
