Should I convert from MooTools to jQuery?

I have a fairly large codebase that depends on MooTools v1.11 and am about to convert to version 1.2. Since this is a pretty major overhaul, I've toyed with the idea of converting to jQuery. Anyone have advice on whether to update to jQuery or just stick with MooTools? I mostly use MooTools for Ajax, drag and drop, and some minor effects.
