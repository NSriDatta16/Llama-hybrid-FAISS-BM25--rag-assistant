Is there a supervised/semi supervised version of pca for dimensionality reduction?

PCA can give me the proper result if "Large variances have important dynamics" holds true for the data. In other words if I want to know along which components the variance of my data is maximized, pca can provide me just that. So according to pca, the very first component is the one where most of variance of data is reflected From this link, I got a table where correlation of first 3 principle components with original 9 dimensions is showed. Variable Principal Component 1 2 3 Climate 0.190 0.017 0.207 Housing *0.544* 0.020 0.204 Health *0.782* *-0.605* 0.144 Crime 0.365 0.294 *0.585* Transportation *0.585* 0.085 0.234 Education 0.394 -0.273 0.027 Arts *0.985* 0.126 -0.111 Recreation *0.520* 0.402 *0.519* Economy 0.142 0.150 0.239 Here as we can see, The first principal component increases with increasing Arts, Health, Transportation, Housing and Recreation scores. And this is the component where most of the variance of data is observed. My question is if I want to find out such a component which will give me most of the variance of some dimensions of data but not as whole, how can I do that? More specifically, using this example I want to find such a component which has strong correlation with Housing Health Crime & Transportation (instead of Arts, Health, Transportation, Housing and Recreation), and other components give the best possible variance after fulfilling first condition, how can I do that? For example my priority can be: treat Health, Transportation, Housing and Crime as a label and get as much as variance of these in the first component and get the 2nd best on second one and so on. This may look like : Variable Principal Component 1 2 3 Climate 0.290 0.017 0.207 Housing *0.444* 0.020 0.204 Health *0.482* -*0.405* 0.144 Crime *0.465* 0.394 0.435 Transportation *0.485* 0.085 0.234 Education 0.394 -0.273 0.027 Arts *0.685* 0.426 -0.111 Recreation 0.350 0.402 *0.419* Economy 0.242 0.150 0.239
