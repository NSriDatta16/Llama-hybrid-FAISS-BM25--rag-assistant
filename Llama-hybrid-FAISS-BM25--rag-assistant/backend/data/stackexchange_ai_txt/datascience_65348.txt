You should use a sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel instance: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html You can specify the threshold that you want when you want to select features. You can add this transformer in a scikit-learn pipeline as well.
