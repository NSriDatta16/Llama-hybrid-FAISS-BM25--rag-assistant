I've found a workaround. The needed associative array was for a HTML Select tag. So I just used {html_options} with value and output attributes instead of options. I assigned one array just for values and another just for output. I had this: {html_options options=$paymentTypes} But I didn't want to show all of the values from paymentTypes array, but I had to have them in the array. So what I did was this: {assign var='paymentTypesOutput' value=','|explode:"$paymentTypes[50], $paymentTypes[51],$paymentTypes[11],$paymentTypes[10],$paymentTypes[12], $paymentTypes[99],$paymentTypes[100]"} {assign var='paymentTypesValues' value=','|explode:"50,51,11,10,12,99,100"} {html_options values=$paymentTypesValues output=$paymentTypesOutput} It's not the most elegant solution - but it works.
