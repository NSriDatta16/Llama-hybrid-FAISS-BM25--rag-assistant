The HtmlDoc document fragment feature of jsTestDriver helps when unit testing DOM-dependent JavaScript code. You probably want a little HTML chunk to apply those functions to, as you go along. When you've proven that they work, you'll see ways of making the functions more testable. This is one of the hidden gems of unit testing: emergent software design. Since you want to be able to test your code in isolation, you'll have an incentive to reduce coupling.
