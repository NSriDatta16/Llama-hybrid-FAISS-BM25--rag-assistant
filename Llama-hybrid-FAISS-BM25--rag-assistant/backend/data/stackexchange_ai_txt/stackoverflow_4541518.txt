Best practice to develop widget using asp.net on the Server side

Hi I have a hosted web application written in asp.net and would like to publish widgets for use in remote websites. For that purpose I believe I want to use embedded widgets over IFrame. I therefore need some client side code to retrieve the widget's HTML from the server. I'd appreciate assistance in the Client\ Server communication. If you have sample code to call a .NET webservice (or any other way) so that I can start by embedding this code within the widget's client UI. I would also appreciate recommendations for the client UI library (JQuery, ...) Thanks a lot !
