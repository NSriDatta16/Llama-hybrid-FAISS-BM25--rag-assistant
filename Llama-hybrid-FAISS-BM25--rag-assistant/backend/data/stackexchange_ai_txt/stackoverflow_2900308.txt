"Introduction to Computer Science and Programming" for a beginner

Im new here and also new to developing software and programming, and with new I mean 0 experience or schooling for it. As Im currently studying medicine via internet and I use a computer on an average of about 8-9 hours a day, this has lead me to get very interested in programming. I got a link from a fellow Redditor and I got some questions before I dive into this project. http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-00Fall-2008/CourseHome/index.htm Is this too much/hard for a beginner? Is Pythonâ„¢ programming language the way to go or would I be better off learning some other kind of language to begin with? What other ways of learning basic programming by myself is there? Are there any better ways for a complete beginner to start off? Thank you for your time!
