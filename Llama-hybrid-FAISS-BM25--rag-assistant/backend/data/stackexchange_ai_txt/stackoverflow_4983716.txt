Is there anything like a restrict keyword for C++ to indicate that _iterators_ are not aliased

g++ does implement __restrict__ for pointers, but I could not find anything about iterators. My overall intent is to encourage the compiler to vectorize stl loops. Edit: Even if the compiler is unable to vectorize, the __restrict__ keyword should be able to tell the compiler that no unnecessary reloads are necessary inside a loop.
