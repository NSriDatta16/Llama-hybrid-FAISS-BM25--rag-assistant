From what I'm understanding, you already have the data, and you want to analyze it. You could use logistic regression for this. You have a binary response variable (recovered or not), and logistic regression provides you with a probability based on the values of the predictor variables. The details of the model will tell you which predictors (treatments) have the most impact in given situations. It's easy to install R and R-Studio, and there are web pages on doing logistic regression with R. You will also need to read a tutorial on getting your data into R-Studio. It's easy if you have an XL or .csv file.
