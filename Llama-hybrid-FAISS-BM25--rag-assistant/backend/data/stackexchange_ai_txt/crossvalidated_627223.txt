Coins don't have probabilities. The mathematical model of a coin flip has probabilities. It depends on what "if they don't know that it has two heads" is supposed to mean in the context of the mathematical model. Does the model permit a coin with two heads? If so, what are the probabilities of the knowledge or non-knowledge? What are the probabilities of two-head coins (or other non-fair coins) in the context of coins available for flipping in that particular experiment? If the equipment for a statistical experiment does not match the model proposed for the experiment, that is not a problem of Bayesian or other statistics, like it isn't a problem of a runner's training state when they don't manage to run 100m in the time they would expect because the distance or the clock are rigged or the track is a mud fest.
