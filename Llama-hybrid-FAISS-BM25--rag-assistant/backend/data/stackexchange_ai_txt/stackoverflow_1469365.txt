How to prevent someone from hacking API feed?

I have started developing a webpage and recently hired someone to write code to display a customized feed (powered by API) in the middle panel on http://farmball.com/ . Note that this is not the RSS feed tied to the site blog . The feed ties to my account on another site. There is no RSS link for an average user to subscribe to the feed. I've taken the site out of maintenance mode to ask anyone here with scraping/hacking experience how someone would most easily go about 'taking' the feed and displaying it on their own site. More importantly, what can I do to prevent it? ^Updated for re-wording
