Do all forms of exponential smoothing (simple, double and triple) assume that the underlying data are seasonal? No. Only triple exponential smoothing does. what happens when those techniques are used on non-seasonal data? Ideally, since triple exponential smoothing decomposes the series into 3 parts, level, trend and seasonality, it should simply choose parameters for the seasonal component such that the model is equivalent to a non-seasonal model. In practice, this will depend on the optimization method and software package being used. How strong a pattern of seasonality is required? Again depends on the optimizer and software being used. In the most basic versions of triple exponential smoothing, you need to specify beforehand what the seasonality is (12 months? 52 weeks? 7 days? etc...) and then it will try to fit the best seasonal model it can find for the specified seasonality. If the seasonal pattern is not strong, then ideally the seasonal component in the model will have a smaller contribution to the overall model. However, this also depends on the software and the optimization method used. Several applications (such as Tableau) seem to use exponential smoothing by default when forecasting time series data. I don't know specifically about Tableau, but most automated forecasting tools will try multiple models, both seasonal and non-seasonal, and then return the model which best fits the data. So it is not that seasonality is not a requirement of the technique, but more that the process of choosing seasonal or non-seasonal has been automated.
