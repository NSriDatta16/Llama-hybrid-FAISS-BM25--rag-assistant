Preventing a DataGridView from selecting the first item

I have a WinForm DataGridView that when I populate it with data the first item is selected by default. I don't want this to occur as to when an item is selected an event fires and some code is executed. Solutions I have for this is to unhook-bind-rehook the event or have a flag that is changed the first time the event fires after a new databind. However I was wondering if there is something a little more elegant.
