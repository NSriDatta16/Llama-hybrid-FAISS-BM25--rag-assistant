In my experience you only get so far with traditional time series models. Given the complexity you describe I'd try a non-linear machine learning algorithm like random forests. Have a play with the R package 'rf'. There's a nice blog post with example code from a Kaggle competition here: http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/05/01/chucking-everything-into-a-random-forest-ben-hamner-on-winning-the-air-quality-prediction-hackathon/ If machine learning is unfamiliar to you, then this is the reference: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ See also Andrew Ng's Stanford lectures or Coursera course.
