The Best Approach for the Classification of the imbalanced classes

I have data that I am going to classify to 3 classes, but one class has a few samples less than 5% of the total samples. What is the best approach to classify these imbalanced classes? I mean is there a machine learning technique that fits this case or is there any other procedures to improve the classification?
