Convolutional neural networks do not output classifications. Common software tools have emphasized categorical predictions, but those are based on neural network outputs that exist on a continuum. You can do whatever you want with those predictions. If it makes sense to classify everything with a $90\%$ chance of being a particular class as being in that class, while reporting “unknown” otherwise, then go for it! How you choose that threshold (or multiple thresholds) will depend on your problem and the costs of mistakes. The threshold also does not have to be the same for every input. You might have certain inputs where you are more or less willing to classify in the “unknown” category. Related : Proper scoring rule when there is a decision to make (e.g. spam vs ham email)
