Preserve whitespace and formatting for text returned from $.get jquery call

I have a jquery $.get() call in my app that requests an entire web page. In the callback function, I access a div in the returned page, get its data and show it on my page. The problem is that the text I get from the div does not preserve the source formatting. If the div in the requested page had say an ordered list, then when i get that text and display on my page, it shows up as a paragraph with items inline instead of being shown as a list. I do not know whether the problem is how $.get() is getting the data or in my displaying of the data. //get the page $.get($(this).attr('href'), function(data){ callbackFunc(data,myLink); }, "html"); function callbackFunc(responseText, customData){ //response has bg color of #DFDFDF var td = $("td[bgcolor='#DFDFDF']", responseText); //text to show is in div of that td var forumText = $('div', td).text(); //append new row with request data below the current row in my table var currentRow = $(customData).parent('td').parent('tr'); var toAppend = " " + forumText + " "; $(currentRow).after(toAppend); } The response data shows up like ABC in the new row I add to my div while the source page div had A B C I should add that this script is part of an extension for Google Chrome so that is my only browser that I have tested on
