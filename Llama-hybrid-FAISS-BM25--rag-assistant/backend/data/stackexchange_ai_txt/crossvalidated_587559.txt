I did try some other interpretations. E.g. consider that the points i, j have a distance |i - j| between them and therefore calculate the probability of transition between the respective quantiles for the points in that number of steps (i.e. on the main diagonal there will be just 1s as the distance is zero). Needless to say, so far I have had more success with the original definition (where the probability is always that one quantile changes into another in a single step) when the resulting field is employed into a simple machine learning model.
