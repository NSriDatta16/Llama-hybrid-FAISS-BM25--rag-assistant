If you already have the flow, then compute the residual graph. Then do a depth first search from the source (or breadth first search, I don't think it matters), to compute the vertices in one half of the cut (S). The remaining vertices are in the other half of your cut, T. This gives you your cut (S, T). If you specifically want the edges between S and T, you could iterate through all the edges, selecting the ones which connect S and T. (Though there may a be a more eleegant way to do this last part.)
