It depends what kind of application it is. Something like a database may either lose data (if it does not write all its data to a persistent transaction log at once), or take longer to start up next time, or both. Although Crash-only is a good principle, few application currently conform to it. For example, the mysql database is not "crash only" and killing it with a kill -9 will result in either significantly longer startup time (than a clean shutdown), data loss, or both, depending on the settings (and to some extent, luck). On the other hand, Cassandra actually encourages the use of kill -9 as a shutdown mechanism; it supports nothing else.
