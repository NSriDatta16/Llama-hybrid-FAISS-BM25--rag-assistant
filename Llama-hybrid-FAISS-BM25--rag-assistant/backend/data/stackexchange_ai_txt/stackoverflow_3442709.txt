If the delegate method is fired for the Left Split view controller but not for the Right split view controller , then most likely you haven't set the delegate for the Right Split View Controller . If you create the right split from an Xcode template, then it will be created in Interface builder from a nib file. Open Interface builder , then right-click drag and connect the delegate property to the object that you want to be the delegate. If the Right split view controller object isn't created in a nib, then you will need to connect this up in code.
