There are papers Patterns of Aspect-Oriented Design (PDF) and Aspect-Oriented Design Principles: Lessons from Object-Oriented Design (PDF) which describe some patterns for AOP/bytecode manipulation. Personally I have used bytecode manipulation with ASM in one framework to generate some boilerplate code for classes which use that framework. The framework requires custom equals() and hashCode() methods for client code, so I generate those by hooking in a Java Agent which modifies the bytecode as the ClassLoader loads the classes. I have also many times used CGLIB to produce dynamic proxies (if that counts as AOP).
