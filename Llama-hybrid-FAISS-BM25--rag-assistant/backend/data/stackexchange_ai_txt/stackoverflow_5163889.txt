Add UDID to Application Level

I can add UDID to my Developer Account but Can I add UDID on Application Level ? What is the significance of UDID in Dev Account ? EDIT : I got the answer. At the time of Ad-hoc distribution we can add 100 UDIDs of devices on which we want to test our application. "Only Team Agents are authorized to prepare and submit applications for distribution."
