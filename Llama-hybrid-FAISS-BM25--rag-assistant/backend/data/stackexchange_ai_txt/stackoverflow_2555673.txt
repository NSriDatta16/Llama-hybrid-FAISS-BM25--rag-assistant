I think we'd need to see reproducible code, but I can see 4 scenarios: you are talking to a different MyClass instance in the two cases - my bet is here you have a variable called eventInfo in one of the methods (try using this.eventInfo when you mean the field if there is any ambiguity) the write or read is cached (try marking the field volatile ; again unlikely) a thread-specific field (thread-local storage) - very unlikely The first two are much more likely.
