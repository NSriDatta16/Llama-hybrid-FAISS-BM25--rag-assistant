DAGs are non-parametric. If we assume that all variables in your problem are dichotomous (or categorical) and all assumptions required for valid causal inference are met, you can unbiasedly estimate the causal effect with a saturated model for the outcome adjusting for the 7 variables (alternatively, using inverse probability weighting, or both). Otherwise, and in common applications with limited data, you usually have to make some parametric assumptions to specify a parsimonious model, which can lead to bias due to model misspecification. Fit on observed data is not typically used to guide specification of structural models, although parsimonious models are often preferred for interpretability and reducing model variance. When using machine learning methods for causal estimation, both regularization and overfitting can result in bias. Naive application of ML methods (i.e. that used for prediction) to estimate causal effects is generally invalid; they can not model individual-level causal effects out of the box. However, there are methods for semi-parametric estimation of causal effects where machine learning methods can be used to model high-dimensional confounders while still modelling the treatment effects parametrically for interpretability.
