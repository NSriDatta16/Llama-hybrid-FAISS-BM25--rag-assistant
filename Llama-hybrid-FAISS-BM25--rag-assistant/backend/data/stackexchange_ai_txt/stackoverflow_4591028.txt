Replace "\/" with "/" in an array in php

I have the following array that contains lots of "\/", since the array is generated from a screen scrape of the javascript of a page "\/" is meant to be just "/". Here's the array: Array ( [0] => 1 Jet Black [1] => 1B\/350T Black With Copper Tips [2] => 1B\/BGT Black With Burgandy Tips [3] => 1b Natural Black [4] => 2 Darkest Brown [5] => 4 Chocolate Brown [6] => 27 Strawberry Blonde ) The best I can think of would be to: $a = array("1B\/BGT Black With Burgandy Tips", "1B\/350T Black With Copper Tips"); foreach ($a as $key => $itsvalue) { $a[$key] = strreplace("\\\/","\/",$itsvalue) }
