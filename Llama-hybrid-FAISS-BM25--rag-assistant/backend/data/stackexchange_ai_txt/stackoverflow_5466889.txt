Reading, and understanding, a book on design patterns can be very helpful. The goal of design patterns is to provide you a reference point for how to handle common programming tasks. Is it absolutely necessary? Nope. Would it be necessary if you want a career in software development? Nope. However, it can be very helpful to know what the common problems are and how others have solved them. Generally speaking software developers find themselves solving the exact same problem over and over again. Along the way they will tweak the solutions until they've found something close to optimal that is easily replicated. The Gang of Four and other patterns are simply those solutions that have been written in a generic format. Quite frankly there are far more "patterns" out there than names for them. A point of interest is that large numbers of programmers apply the common patterns without consciously knowing it.
