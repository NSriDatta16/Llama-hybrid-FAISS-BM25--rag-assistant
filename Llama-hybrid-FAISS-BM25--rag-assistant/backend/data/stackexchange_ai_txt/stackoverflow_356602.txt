It all depends the read/write pattern your application is generating, and the level of accuracy you want to get. For exemple, if you don't really care having all the last inserted rows immediately available, consider using INSERT LOW PRIORITY can help SELECTs. If the text size is relatively small, you may use a fixed CHAR type which will help indexing a lot and reduce time of SELECTs If your application generates a lot of updates, you'll prefer InnoDB storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating (vs all the table on myISAM). On the other hand, its more CPU intensive, so if you don't use transactions and that your update pattern is relatively small, consider using myISAM
