I`ve found it out... Some android OS kill the snapshot calling Activity to avoid memory related exception. So, I have to save all the states via method onSaveInstanceState, and retrieve them when the calling activity was constructed again. Further more, I also found out that, all the information stored in the memory is prone to be erased, like those Singleton objects. Thus I have to do saving by some persistent storage approaches, and restore them later.
