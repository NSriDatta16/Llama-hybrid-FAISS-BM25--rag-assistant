Here is a thought experiment. It only looks like a rant Try not maintaining your unit tests instead. Then tell some engineer from a different discipline that you've let your test plans fall by the wayside. That your changes are now only tested when the whole thing gets put together. (By the way this test regimen has a name: "Big bang integration" : when you try it in Electronics it's literally a bang as all the equipment catches fire.) Explain how much work it was to maintain, and that not doing it saved time. Watch the look on their face. For best effect, pick someone who is a licensed PE (Professional Engineer) in your locality. Repeat this, but substitute the person from your ISO 9000 auditor, where you show them the revised development procedure that has no testing till integration. Repeat, again, substitute a CMMI assessor. This last one will be funny. CMMI SCAMPI assessors love explanations like "it was too much effort" Now, you're probably thinking that you don't work somewhere with ISO9000 or CMMI, and never work with other disipline engineers. At which point, the problem is that an average software shop probably does not unit test at all. So accept average-ness, and use established industry worst-practices. Then offshoring to cannot have any quality impact either (there's no process worse). So, really, your boss should off-shore the work now and save money. There's something wrong with this reasoning somewhere.
