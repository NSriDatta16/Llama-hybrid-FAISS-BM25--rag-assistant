jQuery drag an drop sort list parent/child

does anyone know about a jquery plugin that is able to sort a parent/child tree? for ex: - Cat 1 child 1 child 2 child 3 - Cat2 child 2-1 child 2-2 i have to sort the child items inside the SAME Cat and save the order to DB with AJAX. Also, i need to sort Cat aswell. In that case, all the child items should follow it's parent Cat. Does anyone know a plugin that does this? Thank you
