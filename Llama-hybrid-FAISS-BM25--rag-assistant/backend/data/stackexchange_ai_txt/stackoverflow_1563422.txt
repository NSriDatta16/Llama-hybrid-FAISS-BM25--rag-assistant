Your vertices only have one normal - that being the average of the normals of all the triangles that share that vertex. To get flat shading each vertex has to be treated as though it has [n] normals - where [n] is the number of triangles that share the vertex and each normal has to be the same as the normal of the triangle. Some systems required that the vertex does have [n] normals, but it isn't strictly necessary if you know that you are flat shading across all triangles you can inherit the normal from the triangle. If (as Warren Young mentions) some parts are flat shaded and others are smooth shaded then you will need to assign extra normals at those vertices where flat shaded triangles meet. Without details of the modelling system you are using, (and perhaps not even then!) I can't suggest how you might achieve this.
