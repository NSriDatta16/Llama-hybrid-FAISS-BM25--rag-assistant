The difference between your two examples is that you want to understand/predict a variable that is income in your second example. So in the first example you said 'I know something' and in the second you wanted to infer a variable (with a regression for example) => you end up there because you asked a very different question : knowing a set of variables age, time etc, can I infer the income ? If you had added the variable income to infer given only gender like in example 1, it would have become an inferential problem like example 2. You said there is no random sample. Well in both cases there is. You should consider thinking as a Bayesian :) .
