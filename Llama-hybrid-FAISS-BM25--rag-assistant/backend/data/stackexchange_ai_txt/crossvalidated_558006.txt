t-distributed/robust likelihood

In this paper , the authors claim to be using a robust likelihood function: The code for this paper is on github and is referred to as t_likelihood . Isn't this just a log Gaussian likelihood? What's robust about this function? If you want to trace through the code: The model described in this paper is here The paper describes modelling the mean and variance of a distribution using two neural networks and is trained at approximately here
