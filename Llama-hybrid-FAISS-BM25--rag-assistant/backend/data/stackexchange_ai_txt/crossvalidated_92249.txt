Cross correlation in Stata

I have a cross sectional dataset of investment figures (in $) and a set of dependent variables. The data relates to various years (2000-2013). More than one investment is included in the dataset for any one year (in total there are around 700 investments for the period under consideration) I am aware that there may be issues of cross correlation in the residuals related to having data related to different years in the same dataset. I'm not sure how I should go about to test for these or correct this problem? Running regressions for each year and averaging could be an option? (PS I use Stata)
