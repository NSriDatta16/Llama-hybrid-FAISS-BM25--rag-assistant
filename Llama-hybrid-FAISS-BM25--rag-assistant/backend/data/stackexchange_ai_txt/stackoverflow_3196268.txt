Architecture-Specific Eclipse Plug-in Fragments

I need to target both win32.x86 and win32.x86_64 architectures when building an RCP plug-in that uses OS.getRegOpenKey(...). The types of the arguments for the method are different for the two architectures. I understand now that there is no straightforward way to have an x86 or x86_64 fragment (depending upon the build) override a method in my host plug-in. However, from this post it sounds like a fragment can, for example, add a class that extends a class in the host. And the host plugin can then explicitly use the ClassLoader to find and instantiate the correct subclass from the fragment included in that architecture's build. What would this look like?
