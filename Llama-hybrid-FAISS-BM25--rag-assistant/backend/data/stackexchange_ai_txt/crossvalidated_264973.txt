For the first question, I agree with you. Rank correlation is what I'd do. For the second question, first, if at all possible, I would try to the actual number of weeks or days of the pregnancy. Dividing it into two categories is a really bad idea. Similarly, I'd try to get a better measure of care needed that "extra vs. not". But, whether or not you can get that, this is a regression type problem. If your DV has two categories (extra care, no extra care) then logistic regression is a good choice.
