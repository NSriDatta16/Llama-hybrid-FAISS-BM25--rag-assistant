I was confronted to the same kind of situation: I am writing an app which has to access - locally – a database containing mainly text and weighing more than 20MB (7MB zip compressed). The best solution in my opinion for this kind of problem is to download the zipped compiled database on first execution of the app. The advantages of this solution: The APK stays light. This is a good because: very large APKs may discourage some potential users testing is faster, as uploading a 7MB+ APK to an AVD (as I did initially) is pretty SLOW. There is no duplicate of your data (if you take care of deleting the ZIP archive after extracting it You don’t fill up your users phones internal memory. Indeed, your app should download the database directly to the SD CARD. Including big files in res/raw folders would cause much trouble to all users who run Android One last thing: I don’t recommend including a CSV or XML and populate the database from it on first run. The reason being this would be very SLOW, and this kind of processing is not supposed to be done by every client.
