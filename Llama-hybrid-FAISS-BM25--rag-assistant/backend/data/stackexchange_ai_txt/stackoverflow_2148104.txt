What I do (and the easiest way to do this) is to not attempt to manage two methods of source control at once. I use git for my own personal version control. A few times a week, when i'm ready to commit to the central repository, I check out the master branch in git and commit it to TFS. Changes from the server are checked out into my dev branch and merged back into my code. It isn't elegant, by any means, but since I'm only checkout/checkin from the central repo a few times a week, it works perfectly well.
