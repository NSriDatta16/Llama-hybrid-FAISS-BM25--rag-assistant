Something strikes me as odd about your "problem", so here are some thoughts that may clear things up. A dependency property can be both read and set by your code. Why not just use that instead of this internal storage? If you want to use the internal storage value for performance reasons, use the property changed notification that you already said would work. When the property changes, update your internal value. When YOU change the property internally, call the dependency property setter at appropriate intervals to update everyone else (ignoring the property change event you would receive from that). Maybe your situation requires something other than this, but the second option ought to be as complicated as something like this should get.
