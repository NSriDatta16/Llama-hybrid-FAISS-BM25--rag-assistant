No. This is because strlen() and wcslen() are part of C (not C++) and thus handle C-Strings. C++ discourages the use of C-Strings by providing std::string (std::wstring). These are of course templates of (std::basic_string ). Rather than write your own would it not be better to shift to C++ std::string?
