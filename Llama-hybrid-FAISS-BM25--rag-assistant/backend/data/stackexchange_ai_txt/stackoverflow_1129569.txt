Image Upload with Zend_Service_Nirvanix

I can't seem to upload an image using Zend_Service_Nirvanix. Is it even possible? I have a feeling that my problem has something to do with not being able to figure out how to set the UploadHost on the Transfer Service. Any help is greatly appreciated! My deadline is July 16th! Here is my code: $nirvanix = new Zend_Service_Nirvanix(array('appKey' => $key, 'username' => $user, 'password' => pass)); $NSImfs = $nirvanix->getService('IMFS'); $options = array('sizeBytes' => filesize($source)); $storageNode = $NSImfs->getStorageNode($options); $NSTransfer = $nirvanix->getService('Transfer'); $options = array('uploadToken' => $storageNode->getStorageNode->UploadToken, 'path' => $original, 'fileData' => file_get_contents($source)); $result = $NSTransfer->uploadFile($options); Here is the error I keep getting: Zend_Service_Nirvanix_Exception: XML could not be parsed from response: Server Error in '/' Application. The resource cannot be found. Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly. Requested URL: /ws/Transfer/UploadFile.ashx in /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/Zend/Service/Nirvanix/Response.php on line 119
