Well, I wrote C programs for about 11 years and I had to read 5 times your piece of code to understand it ! Kernighan and Ritchie were active in the sixties. At that time, being able to understand a piece of code was not relevant. Being able to write code that fit in 16 Ko was. So I'm not suprised. C is a terrible language when your teatchers are K & R. Just look at realloc : who would know code something like that today ? In the '60ies, it was all the rage, but it is now appalling, at least :o)
