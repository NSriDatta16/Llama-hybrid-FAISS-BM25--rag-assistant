Does class weighting encourage overfitting when the true class distribution is imbalanced?

I am working on a classification problem in which ~90% of samples come from class 1 while ~10% of samples come from class 2. I have been using various techniques to combat the class imbalance while learning the problem, however, I am concerned about potential bias this may introduce because the true class distribution is unknown. Is it bad practice to weight classes during learning if the true distribution (or some reasonable approximation) is unknown?
