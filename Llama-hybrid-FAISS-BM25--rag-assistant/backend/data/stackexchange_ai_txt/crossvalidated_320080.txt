You might consider using either CausalImpact in R to estimate the difference, but CausalImpact wants a secondary dataset (control) to compare the "treated" data - in this case website data in question. CausalImpact requires a secondary dataset to model against the exploratory data, something like an separate but very similar market. You could also provide a regression model as your comparative dataset. A better explanation is here: https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/ You might also consider using ITS, Interrupted Time Series analysis. This would entail building a strong time series model that includes variables x1) change has/has not occurred and x2) day 1,2,3... of the new website changes. My recommendation would be to use ITS if you do not have a parallel dataset or model to plug into CausalImpact. Using ITS would require the following: Build a strong time-series model of the "pre-period", hopefully something that accounts for any and all seasonality and cyclical trends leading into the treatment or post-period. You will want a model that you feel would have accurately predicted the "counter-factual," or what would have happened had no changes to the website been made. This is model 1. Add the two variables I mentioned above to your model to signify the start and trend of the "test". Re-run your model to include the test days and new test variables, and see if your test shows it is statistically significant or not (very low p-values). This is model 2. Plot the resulting prediction points for these two models into Excel - all the way through the test. The difference between the two models during the test days is your result, as long as the two new "test variable" coefficients from the previous step are statistically significant. They will also begin to show your the magnitude of the change if there is one. Of course, you have to know for certain that there wasn't some other event that happened at the exact same time as the new event - correlation is not causation, yada yada.
