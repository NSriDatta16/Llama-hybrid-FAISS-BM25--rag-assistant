If you're using the default System.Windows.Forms.Datagrid then it would be the MappingName or HeaderText property of the DataGridColumnStyle objects held in the GridColumnStyles property of the active DataGridTableStyle in the Datagrid.TableStyles property. If by 'wingrid' you mean the Infagistics WinGrid (Infagistics.Win.UltraWingrid) then the Columns (a ColumnsCollection ) property of the active UltraGridBand in the Bands collection of the active UltraGridLayout in the Layouts collection of the UltraGrid object seems to be what you're after.
