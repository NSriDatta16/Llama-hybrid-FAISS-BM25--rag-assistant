Including Collider Variables in Prediction

When the goal is to estimate a causal association between X and Y in the regression framework, one should not condition on (include as covariates) collider variables (common causes of both X and Y) since doing so may introduce spurious/non-causal associations that bias the coefficient estimate for X (Berkson's paradox). My question: can including collider variables as potential predictors in a classification/machine learning framework also cause problems when accurate, generalizable, and useable prediction of Y is the goal? I.e. does the causal problem also lead to a prediction problem?
