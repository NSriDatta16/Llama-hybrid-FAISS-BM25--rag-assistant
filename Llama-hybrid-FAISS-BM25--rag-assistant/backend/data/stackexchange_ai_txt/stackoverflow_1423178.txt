I think those controls would violate the MS Office distribution or EULA licensing agreements with Microsoft. Since an ActiveX control that emulates Word, Excel, PowerPoint would potentially give unlimited and anonymous users access to the software without paying for it. There's other Microsoft technologies that allow you to leverage the end-user's MS Offices licenses that allow them to save back to the web server. I think WebDAV used to be used ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc781730%28WS.10%29.aspx ), I don't know what's out there now, but I'm sure there's a solution.
