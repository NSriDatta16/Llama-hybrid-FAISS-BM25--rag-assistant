How can you store state between screens in SketchFlow?

I'm building a prototype using Expression Blend 3 and SketchFlow (a Silverlight SketchFlow application to be specific) and it consists of multiple screens that I want to share state between. Take this example: Screen 1 - 'Login' screen: I want the user to type in a fake user name and password. Screen 2 - 'Home' screen: I want to display that user name so the user sees that their input is reflected. This is just a trivial example and not something that most prototypes need to demonstrate, but the same functionality could be used in an application where the selection on one screen needs to be persisted for the next screen . How can I do this in SketchFlow? I know that I can write Silverlight code to store some data in isolated storage, but I'm trying to go with the 'zero code' approach since this will be a throw-away prototype and would prefer to use some built-in mechanism in SketchFlow if available. Does Sketchflow offer a way to state data between screens?
