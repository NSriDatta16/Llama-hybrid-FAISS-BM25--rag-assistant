The answer to your original question is yes, because the classical theory applies under your sampling scheme. You don’t need any assumptions on the original data matrix. All of the randomness (implicitly behind standard errors and consistency) comes from your scheme for sampling $N$ rows from the data matrix. Think of your entire dataset (100M rows) as being the population. Each estimate (assuming your sample of size $N$ is a simple random sample of the rows) is a consistent estimate of the regression coefficients (say, $\hat{\beta}_*$) computed from the entire data set. Moreover, it is approximately Normal with mean equal to $\hat{\beta}_*$ and some covariance. The usual estimate of the covariance of the estimate is also consistent. If you repeat this $M$ times and average those $M$ estimates, then the resulting estimate (say, $\hat{\beta}_{avg}$) will also be approximately Normal. You can treat those $M$ estimates as being nearly independent (uncorrelated) as long as $N$ and $M$ are small relative to 100M. That’s an important assumption. The idea being that sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement when the sample size is small compared to the population size. That being said, I think that your problem really is one of how to efficiently approximate the regression estimate ($\hat{\beta}_*$) computed from the entire data set. There is a difference between (1) averaging $M$ estimates based on samples of size $N$ and (2) one estimate based on a sample of size $MN$. The MSE of (2) will generally be smaller than the MSE of (1). They would only be equal if the estimate was linear in the data, but that is not the case. I assume you are using least squares. The least squares estimate is linear in the $Y$ (response) vector, but not the $X$ (covariates) matrix. You are randomly sampling $Y$ and $X$. (1) and (2) are both simple schemes, but not necessarily efficient. (Though it may not matter since you only have 30 variables.) There are better ways. Here is one example: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1435
