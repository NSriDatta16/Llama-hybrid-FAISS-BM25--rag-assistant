Virtualized Windows 7 and IE VHDs for website testing on a Mac - what's needed?

I know this will probably be considered a duplicate, but looking through the questions I could find, I didn't quite find answers I develop web sites on a Mac, and I obviously need to test them in all sorts of versions of Internet Explorer. Especially since a lot of my work is purely client-side coding, so services like browsershots.org don't cut it. Besides, I run a web stack locally on my machine, which I need access to. I've so far had a pretty messy setup using multiple virtual machines in VMWare, with different versions of Windows and IE. It works, but it's just not elegant or easily maintainable. Plus, it's just a pain to boot all those virtual boxes. So: I'd like to get Windows 7, just use that, and get rid of the other versions and VPCs. As I understand it, I can then use Microsoft's IE VHD-images to check sites in all the different versions of IE. Is this a good solution? Or should I rather skip Windows altogether and use something like Winebottler? . Or is there a way to just run the time-limited VHDs from a Mac? If it is a good solution, I have another question: Being a Mac-user, I don't know what edition of Windows 7 I need for it. Home Premium? Professional? Ultimate? I don't need anything from Windows except being able to test in IE 6 (unfortunately) and upwards, so I just need the least I can get by with. Also, it's a little unclear what the requirements for the VHDs are. The site says it's XP, Vista or 7, but I imagine that running VHDs is the kind of thing that won't work on every edition. Lastly, I've so far simply edited the hosts-file for each virtual Windows install to get it to reach my Mac's web stack. Will I need to do something similar for each VHD, or are there simpler solutions? Those VHDs are set to expire pretty quickly it seems.
