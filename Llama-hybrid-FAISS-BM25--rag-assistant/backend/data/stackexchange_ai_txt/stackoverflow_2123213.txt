In your jquery.autocomplete.js file, at around line 360 (as of the latest version), add one line to make the section look like this: $.ajax({ type: "post", // This is the new line // try to leverage ajaxQueue plugin to abort previous requests mode: "abort", // limit abortion to this input port: "autocomplete" + input.name, (If you are using a minified version of the autocomplete plugin, just do a search for .ajax and insert the line as appropriate). This change causes the autocomplete script will now send form data by POST, rather then GET. Accessing this from within codeigniter can be done as follows: public function filter() { $filter_by = $this->input->post('q'); } And from this you can generate your list as required. I'm not sure if there is a nicer way to do this (one which doesn't require you to edit the source code), but it works for me.
