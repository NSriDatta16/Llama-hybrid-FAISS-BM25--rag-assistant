This is way beyond the scope of regular expressions. You'll need a Dictionary of names, and possibly an algorithm to check for things which aren't in your dictionary but are names (do some research into Markov Chains for a start). You'll then need some Natural Language Processing algorithms to parse the syntax for valid names. In short: Take a degree in Computer Science, and this might be a potential Dissertation project.
