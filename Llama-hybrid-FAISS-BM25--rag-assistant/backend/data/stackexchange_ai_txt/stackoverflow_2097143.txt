App Store error: The binary you uploaded was invalid

The notorious error haunts me in App Store: "The binary you uploaded was invalid. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate." Steps I've taken: 1) I'm using Monotouch / MonoDevelop. 2) App works on iPhone Simulator and on Device. 3) I've made the distribution build according to the examples in MonoTouch documentation (using Distribution profile). 4) I've checked that the xxxx.app package contains the file "embedded.mobileprovision". 5) I'm zipping (in OS X GUI) the app bundle (only the xxxx.app file). 6) I've checked the integrity of the xxxx.app file with command "codesign -vvvvv xxxx.app" 7) I've cleared all keys and profiles from XCode Organizer and KeyChain, and added keys/profiles again. No luck. Any ideas? /pom
