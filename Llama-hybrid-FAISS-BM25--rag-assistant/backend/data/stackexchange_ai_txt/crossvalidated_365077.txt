Pooling all data after checking that p-value of the "origin of sample"-variable is not significant will eventually lead to unreliable estimates of model's parameters. This is one of the many possible ways of committing pseudo-replication ( Hurlbert, 1984 ). To make full use of all data available, essentially two acceptable methods come to my mind : First, it should be possible to calculate p-value of your model once for each sample, then combine all p-values using methods of meta-analysis (see Wikipedia article about meta-analysis for the complete methodology). Second, if you wish to use most up-to-date statistical methods, treat your "origin of sample" variable as a random variable in a mixed-model. It is essentially the same as the first method but more refined and elegant, so that it can handle almost any type of experimental design, but also missing data as well as varying sample size natively.
