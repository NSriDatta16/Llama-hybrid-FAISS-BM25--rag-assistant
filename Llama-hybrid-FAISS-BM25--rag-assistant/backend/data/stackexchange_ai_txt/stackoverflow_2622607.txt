Windows loader problem - turn on verbose mode

I'm in the process of reorganizing some of the legacy libraries in our application which has unmanaged code calling into libraries of managed code. While I have the code reorganized, it produces the following loader error: ... 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\CsDisp.dll' 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\psapi.dll' 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll' 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\appCode\Debug\daq206_32.dll', Binary was not built with debug information. 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\appCode\Debug\SiUSBXp.dll', Binary was not built with debug information. 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\appCode\Debug\AdlinkDAQ.dll', Symbols loaded. 'app.exe': Loaded 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\P9842.dll', Binary was not built with debug information. LDR: LdrRelocateImageWithBias() failed 0xc0000018 LDR: OldBase : 10000000 LDR: NewBase : 00A80000 LDR: Diff : 0x7c90d6fa0012f6cc LDR: NextOffset : 00000000 LDR: *NextOffset : 0x0 LDR: SizeOfBlock : 0xa80000 Debugger:: An unhandled non-continuable exception was thrown during process load I believe 0xc0000018 error is an overlapping address range. So, I have two questions. First, what linker options may cause this error? I'm currently linking with /DYNAMICBASE:NO and /FIXED:No as this was how some of the previous libraries were set up. Second, is there a way to turn on verbose mode for the loader so I can see what exactly it's trying to load? P9842 is a third party library so I imagine it is getting to one of my libraries after P9842 and failing on that one. Can I narrow it down? Thanks.
