XGBoost: How to obtain scale_pos_weight for multi classes?

I know there is a similar Qn at Unbalanced multiclass data with XGBoost . But I don't understand the reply provided by @Esmailian. What is the actual formula to obtain 1, 0.333 and 0.167? For example, if we have three imbalanced classes with ratios class A = 10% class B = 30% class C = 60% Their weights would be (dividing the smallest class by others) class A = 1.000 class B = 0.333 class C = 0.167 Will I obtain the same values with from sklearn.utils import class_weight classes_weights = class_weight.compute_sample_weight( class_weight='balanced', y=train_df['class'] )
