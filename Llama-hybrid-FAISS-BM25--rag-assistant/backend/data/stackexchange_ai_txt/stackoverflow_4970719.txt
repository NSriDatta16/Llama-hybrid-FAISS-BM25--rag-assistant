WindowsAzure: Blob cache experiments with phpazure

I'm doing some experiments with caching sites into the blob storage. Now I recognize that this is not as fast as I expected. For instance, the following code checks if a cached version of the requested site exists and returns the content: $blobStorageClient = new Microsoft_WindowsAzure_Storage_Blob(); if (!$blobStorageClient->blobExists(self::CONTAINER, $path)) return false; $blobData = $blobStorageClient->getBlobData(self::CONTAINER, $path); $metaData = $blobStorageClient->getBlobMetadata(self::CONTAINER, $path); ... This part takes always between 500ms and 1000ms (somtime 2000ms). I tested it with PHP Azure SDK , Azure Compute Emulator and live storage. Does somebody know why it is so slow, or is it normal, what can I do better, is it at all a good idea to do blob caching?
