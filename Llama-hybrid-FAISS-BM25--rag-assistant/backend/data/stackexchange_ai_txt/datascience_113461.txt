Feature Engineering on transactional dataset clustering

I have a data set with transactions details from different business (roughly 1 thousand business entities). Each row is a transaction. The structure of the dataset is as follows: client_id Sex Age transaction_ammount business_entity 123 M 88 4829 storeA 123 M 88 1049 storeB 255 F 25 1122 storeH My goal is to cluster the clients depending on their consuming habits, age and sex. I am having a hard time on deciding on the best features to feed this dataset into a clustering algorithm (probably K-means as a starter). Some of the things I am planning to do are: One hot encoding on: sex Make each store be a column and each row value be the amount of transactions a certain user did pay to that store (for example, if user1 made two transactions to storeB, there will be a 2 in the user1 row on the storeB column). One of the main things I am struggling with right now is how to sum the transactions data per user. I would need to run an aggregated operation on them, but don't know which one would be better. Some of the ones I have in my mind: Average transaction amount per user Min transaction amount per user Max transaction amount per user The above 3 but for each store per user (which would mean that, if I have 1000 stores, I would have to add 3000 thousand columns). This makes sense since each store have a wide range of product prices and running an operation among all the transactions of a user will be misleading. What feature engineering technique would you recommend me? Is there any additional data wrangling I should do?
