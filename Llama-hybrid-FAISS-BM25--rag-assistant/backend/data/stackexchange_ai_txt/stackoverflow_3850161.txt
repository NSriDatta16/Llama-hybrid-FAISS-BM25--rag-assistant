I do not have experience with OLE connections, but in principle it is: OleDBCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand( qry3 ); if ( cmd.ExecuteNonQuery() > 0 ) { // at least one row updated //everything is ok } else { something went wrong } Use ExecuteNonQuery, it will execute a sql statement that is not a SELECT and will return the rows affected. Also, there is no need for multiple connections, one should be enough, you can execute multiple commands on one connection. Also repsect Hogan's answer! Edit: As per Hogan's suggestion changed the comparision and the remark hth Mario
