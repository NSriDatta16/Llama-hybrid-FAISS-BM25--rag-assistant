StrutsTestCase test and "error" returned from Struts2 action class

I'm trying to use StrutsTestCase for testing my Struts2 actions, but I'm getting always the "error" value back while executing the "execute()" method from the proxy. Here's the example: public void testSpike() throws Exception{ request.addHeader("param1", "param"); ActionProxy proxy = getActionProxy("/action/to/test.action"); assertNotNull(proxy); TestAction action = (TestAction) proxy.getAction(); assertNotNull(action); String output = proxy.execute(); } the output string is always "error". Is there a way to understand what happened there? The logs are not saying anything, and even trying to debug placing a breakpoint on the Action class doesn't help (the code never stops there). Any suggestions? Thanks Roberto
