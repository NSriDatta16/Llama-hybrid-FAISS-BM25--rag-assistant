Database Structure Advice Needed

Im currently working on a site which will contain a products catalog. I am a little new to database design so I'm looking for advice on how best to do this. I am familiar with relational database design so I understand "many to many" or "one to many" etc (took a good db class in college). Here is an example of what an item might be categorized as: Propeller -> aircraft -> wood -> brand -> product. Instead of trying to write what I have so far, just take a quick look at this image I created from the phpmyadmin designer feature. alt text http://www.usfultimate.com/temp/db_design.jpg Now, this all seemed fine and dandy, until I realized that the category "wood" would also be used under propeller -> airboat -> (wood). This would mean, that "wood" would have to be recreated every time I want to use it under a different parent. This isn't the end of the world, but I wanted to know if there is a more optimal way to go about this. Also, I am trying to keep this thing as dynamic as possible so the client can organize his catalog as his needs change. *Edit. Was thinking about just creating a "tags" table. So I could assign the tag "wood" or "metal" or "50inch" to 1 to many items. I would still keep a parenting type thing for the main categories, but this way the categories wouldnt have to go so deep and there wouldnt be the repetition.
