There's a lot here to answer and not everything has a definitive you should do XXX and not XXX. Let me try to break it down. ASP.MVC vs WebForms (standard ASP.NET) You can make a decent data entry application using either platform. Webforms has been around longer and definitely has more coverage through tutorials, but ASP.NET MVC is just as capable. MVC is going to be leaner and meaner, which is good if you are going for pure responsiveness, but it's possible to do that with Webforms too, it just takes more work (turning off ViewState, SessionState, Minimizing postbacks etc) and removes some of the benefits of Webforms. Data Access If you have already decided on using stored procedures as your primary data access method, you aren't going to get much of anything from any ORM (Linq2Sql, Linq2Entities, NHibernate, Subsonic, etc). If you really want to leverage the benefits of ORM you will have to give up stored procedures for your primary data interface. However, Linq2Sql is considered plenty fast. Linq2Entities is a bit slower, but that will probably improve. NHibernate and Subsonic are slower still. It's not very useful to compare any of them to ADO.NET since they do very different things (that happen to revolve around talking to a database). But all of that is pretty meaningless as the slowest part of any system is going to be sending data across the internet back and forth to the user.
