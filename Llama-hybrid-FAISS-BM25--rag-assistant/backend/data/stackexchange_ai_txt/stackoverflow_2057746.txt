Well if you don't want to do a join, then storing the user's name or initials on the friendships table is really your only other viable option. You mention the problem of having to update thousands of records every time a name changes, but is this really a problem? Unless you're talking about a major social networking site like Facebook, or maybe MySpace, does the average user really have enough friends to make this problematic? And then you have to multiply that by the probability that a user will change their name, which I would imagine isn't something that happens very often for each user. If those updates are in fact non-trivial, you could always background or delay that to happen during non-peak times. Sure you would sacrifice up-to-the-second accuracy, but really, would most users even notice? Probably not. Edit: Note, my answer above really only applies if you already have those levels of users. If you are still basically developing your site, just worry about getting it working, and worry about scaling problems when they become real problems.
