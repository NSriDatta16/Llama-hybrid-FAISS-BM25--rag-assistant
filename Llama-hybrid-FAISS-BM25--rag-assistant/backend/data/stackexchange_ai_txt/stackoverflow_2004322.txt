if the stream is fairly predictable, you could do something like: select id, particles, time from log where id in (select min(id) from log group by datediff(second, (select min(time) from log), time) / 5) would get the first reading from every 5 second interval. the first interval covers seconds 1 - 5 in the log. the next interval is seconds 6 - 10 etc. there is no overlap. you can do a similar query to get the average over each interval, but since you expect readings in the same interval to be identical, an avg may blend the data in the case that there are missing or mistimed entries, so just taking the first or last reading is probably better.
