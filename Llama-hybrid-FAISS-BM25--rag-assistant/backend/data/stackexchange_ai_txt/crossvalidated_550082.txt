Writing your code move verbosely: for (i in 1:N) { mu[i] Your model is a Bayesian linear regression , so as standard linear regression, it predicts the mean $E[y_i|x_i] = \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ . If you are interested in the mean $\mu_i$ , sure, take the predictions for the mean. However if you want to look at the samples from the conditional distribution of $y_i|x_i$ itself, then you sample from the posterior predictive distribution. In many cases, saving both the mean and samples from the posterior predictive distribution would be useful.
