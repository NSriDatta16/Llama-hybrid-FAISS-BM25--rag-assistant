Abbreviation Classification using machine learning

I would like to classify abbreviations using machine learning. For example: I have watermel. and I ask for user what is watermel.(my application context is about food). Then He classify as watermelon. In other time, If Other user insert waterme. Is It exist a way to infer that waterme is the same as watermelon using machine learning techniques?
