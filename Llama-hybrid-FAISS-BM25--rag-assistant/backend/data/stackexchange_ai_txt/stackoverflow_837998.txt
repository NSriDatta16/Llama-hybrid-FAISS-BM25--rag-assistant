I can't remember the term for it (stripes? Slices? wedges? argh) but Solaris allocates different page sizes from pools of various sizes. This turns out to be somewhat more efficient than uniform page sizes, because it uses the memory mapping better. One of those sizes is 32K, another 64K, another is 1024K I believe. To get 96K, you got a 64 and a 32, to get 960 you got most of a 1024K. The core resource for this wizardry is the Solaris Internals book. Mine, unfortunately, is in a box in the garage at the momrnt.
