Weighted multinomial logistic regression for proportions in multiple outcome categories

In my data, I have $N$ users, and for each we measure at $t_i, i\in[1,..,N]$ different times whether it belongs to one of k categories (let's say A , B , and C ). The data columns looks like this: user_id frac_in_A frac_in_B frac_in_C total_measurements several_categorical_and_cardinal_predictors The aim is to generate a model that predicts the fractions (in this case, frac_in_A and frac_in_B , because frac_in_C can be derived from the other two). From what I've read, I need to use multinomial weighted logistic regression with this. However, it seems statsmodels doesn't allow weighted multinomial logistic regression, and I am a total beginner in R and there seem to be several modules dealing with multinomial logit. I am hoping to use rpy2 as I am more versed in Python and hope to port it over. Can anyone help? Thank you!
