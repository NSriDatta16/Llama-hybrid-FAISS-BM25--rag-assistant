Windows thumbnail/frame view

What would be the easiest way to make a thumbnail view, where you have a panel with a vertical scroll bar, and a matrix of images describing their associated image? I'd also like it such that if the parent frame resized horizontally, the matrix would shrink to as many columns as necessary to display the thumbnails without a horizontal scroll bar. I'd like to be able to drag and rearrange these thumbnails as well. The toolkit that this is written in doesn't really matter so much. If you know of a good way to do it with MFC, that's cool, Delphi/C++ builder is totally cool too. Just some kind of native app framework. Wow this is sounding a lot like I'm begging for homework help. I swear this is for some software to drive a laser projector.
