This sounds like the onset of severe disease really happens at a different time than the measurement, but the measurement detects it. In that case, this seems like a case of interval censoring: you know the onset of severe disease happened between the previous measurement and the one that detects it. A lot of models can deal with interval censored data (including the Cox model, parametric survival methods, machine learning models with a time-to-event loss function etc. - it depends a bit on what you want to do with the results whether one makes more sense than the others and whether there's some plausible assumptions based on the underlying biology). However, the coarser the measurement process is (i.e. the further apart the measurements are), the less you'll learn about the pattern over time. Things might be more tricky, if the timing of the measurements is determined by how the patients feel/whether they have symptoms/etc., or if there is possibly measurement error/uncertainty around the diagnosis of severe disease onset. In those cases, a bespoke model for the data generating process might be necessary.
