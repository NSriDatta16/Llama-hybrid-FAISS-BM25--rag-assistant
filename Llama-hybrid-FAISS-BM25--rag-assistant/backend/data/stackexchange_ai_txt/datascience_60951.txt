Is it necessary to convert labels in string to integer for scikit_learn and xgboost?

I have a tabular data with labels that are in string. I will feed the data to decision trees in scikit_learn and XGBoost classifier. Is it necessary to convert the labels in string to integers for these algorithms? Will the algorithms work less effectively when the labels are not in numerical format? I am using python v3.7
