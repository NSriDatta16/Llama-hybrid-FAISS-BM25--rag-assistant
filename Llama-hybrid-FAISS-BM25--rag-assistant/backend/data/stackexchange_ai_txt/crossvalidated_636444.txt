First, if your DV is ordinal (that is, has an order, e.g. "small", "medium", "large") then a better starting point is probably ordinal logistic regression. Second, the way SPSS is treating age and the test scores as categorical has nothing to do with nominal logistic regression. You somehow told SPSS that these variables are categorical. You need to tell it that they are numeric, or continuous, or whatever. I don't know SPSS so I don't know how to do this.
