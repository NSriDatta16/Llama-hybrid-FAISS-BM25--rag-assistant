Why does Wget have Host Header in its HTTP request?

The main difference between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 is that HTTP/1.1 has a mandatory Host header in it (source: HTTP Pocket Reference - O'reilly). So, why is that Wget, which uses the HTTP/1.0 protocol, has a host header in it? My output of Wget with netcat : GET / HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: Wget/1.12 (linux-gnu) Accept: */* Host: 127.0.0.1:10101 Connection: Keep-Alive As it is clear that Wget uses the HTTP/1.0 protocol version, how can it have a host header in it? Or am I getting somewhere wrong with my understanding of HTTP protocol? And even if HTTP/1.0 can has Host Header in its HTTP request, what can be the reason behind wget using HTTP/1.0 protocol while HTTP/1.1 can also be used in place of that?
