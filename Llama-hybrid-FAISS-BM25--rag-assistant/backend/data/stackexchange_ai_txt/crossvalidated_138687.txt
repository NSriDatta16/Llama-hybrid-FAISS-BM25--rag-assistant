This isn't nearly as simple as you might hope. In particular, daily data within years are unlikely to be independent of each other. Standard $t$-test routines take no account of that dependence, so the suggestion by @Behacad in a comment appears to be missing a major difficulty. You could do the calculation and your software may not complain, but the $P$-values and significance results could be way off. Whether data are normal is less crucial, for all that elementary texts are often obsessed with it. But depending on the properties of the counts, a Poisson or negative binomial or other discrete distribution may be more appropriate. In essence, you need a stochastic time series model for your data before you can formulate this problem properly, or minimally to use autocorrelations to correct the $t$- or other tests. On the other hand, plotting the data and doing a simple descriptive calculation may tell you as much about the data as you really need. If there is an underlying trend, then a year is an arbitrary time subdivision any way, regardless of it being well defined as a calendar unit. On the other hand, if "number of sightings" is something biological, years may be more natural units, especially if most of the activity is in a Northern Hemisphere summer, but then seasonality is likely to feature in the time series model you would ideally need. In essence, "statistical significance" does not cover all questions of the form "Should I regard this change as notable or big?". It only makes sense when a probability or stochastic model can be postulated for the data allowing the calculation to be carried out validly. Introductory texts or courses only rarely seem to comment on this common problem. Nor would changing the problem to something like Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney be a solution, as independence is an assumption for those tests too. Box, Hunter, Hunter Statistics for experimenters from Wiley (either edition) and Rupert G. Miller Beyond ANOVA Wiley, reprinted by CRC Press are fine texts up-front about the problems caused by dependence. On the other hand, dealing with organism counts (if that is what this is) is surely a standard biological problem. This problem is likely to be covered in a methodological literature which is not very familiar to me.
