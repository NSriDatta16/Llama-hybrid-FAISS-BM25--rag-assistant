you should create another class like GraphComponent for instance, that extends JComponent . You should also look at implementing MouseInputListener . I will not give you the solution, but it'a a good start ;). Anyway, I see you're french so take a look at site-du-zero , it's full of very good tutorials (in french). N.B: You shouldn't name you classes like QUESTION, put Question instead EDIT : here another hints : public class Paint_Dessin extends JComponent implements MouseInputListener{ private List startPoints = new ArrayList (); @Override public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { int x = e.getX(); int y = e.getY(); Point p = new Point(x,y); startPoints.add(p); repaint(); } protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) { g.setColor(getForeground()); Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g; for (Point p : startPoints) p.draw(g2); } public class Point{ private int x,y; public Point(int x, int y){ this.x = x; this.y = y; } void draw(Graphics2D g2) { //do the drawing with the right shape you want } } and see Shape . You should implements others method from the MouseInputListener, like mouseDragged,....
