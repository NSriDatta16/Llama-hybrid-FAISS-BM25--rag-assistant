Remember, if someone wants to pirate your software, they will. Generally, they don't even bother with emulating the license server, they just insert a jmp around all license check code. You can make this more difficult (self modifying code, checks everywhere, code which is not delivered until the license check succeeds, etc), but it becomes a full time job doing license enforcement. You are trying to stop casual pirates, which is fine. Doing a simple HTTP request to a license server, with the license code and MAC ID in a hash is a legitimate method. Have an easy way to "unregister" computers (its reasonable to move the license amongst machines or to install it on someone's laptop IMO), and don't do a hard lockout once something changes. Decent models are iTunes DRM (5 computers, deauthorization, and a global reset) and Windows (fuzz factor based on how different the computers are). If the software is not internet accessible or the organization dislikes it, the general practice is to have a license server on customer network which manages the authorization portion. There is established middleware for this already (FlexLM amongst others). Maintaining a license server is a PITA most IT departments balk at, so if you can piggy back on existing infrastructure, the more acceptable your solution becomes.
