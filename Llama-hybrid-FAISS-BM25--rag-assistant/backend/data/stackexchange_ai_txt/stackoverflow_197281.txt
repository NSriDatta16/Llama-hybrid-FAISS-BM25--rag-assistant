I would like to strongly recommend Textile over Markdown. Textile.NET should do what you want. Why? I like Textile's syntax better, and I think it's easier for users to learn and use. There's no single large reason - just a lot of small things. In Markdown you can do *italics* and **bold** easily, but the syntax seems arbitrary. Compare to the equivalent syntax in Textile for _italics_ and *bold* , which mirrors the conventional way to indicate those modifiers in plain text formats. Or for another example, in Textile you make an ordered list by prefixing each item with an '#'. In Markdown, you prefix it with "n.", where n is any integer. Markdown is trying to imitate the syntax people use in flat text files when writing lists (which is nice), but it means that this Markdown code: 3. Test1 2. Test2 1. Test3 Is rendered as this: Test1 Test2 Test3 Basically, Markdown asks you for a number, which it then ignores. That seems inelegant to me, although I couldn't explain why precisely. Textile also does tables (and wish a nicely compact syntax). Markdown doesn't. There's a few other minor points, but I think that covers most of it. :)
