I don't think that data would ever be held outside the email headers. What you want is some way to find all the unique addresses in the recipent field of all sent mail items. For example in Google mail - you could use this project, the Gmail Agent API , to retrieve all the sent item headers. You would then just need to extract the relevant data from them. I'm sure this technique is possible is for some of the other providers you mention. The Yahoo Api for example looks to provide everything you need to do this.
