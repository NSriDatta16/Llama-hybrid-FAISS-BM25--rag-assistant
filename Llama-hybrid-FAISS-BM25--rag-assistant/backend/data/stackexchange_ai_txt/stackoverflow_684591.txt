If you're just trying to keep track of a user revisits your site, you should be using cookies rather than the MAC address. Getting the MAC address from a server is not possible unless you either install an agent on the client such as an ActiveX control or other browser plugin, or you are on the same physical network, in which case you can do a call to translate their IP address with their mac address.
