You could schedule this using SMO probably, though it may take some work to get up and running. However, a more elegant approach might be to schedule a full backup to a new file (with today's timestamp), and archive it. This way retrieving the scripts is as simple as restoring that version of the database somewhere, and extracting manually. An even better approach: if you store your change scripts in source control, you should always be able to pull any version of the database.
