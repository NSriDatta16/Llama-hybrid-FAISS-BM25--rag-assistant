Testing the hypothesis on clustering

I have a number of samples. For each, there is a time course of multivariate data defined, with $t$ timepoints ($t 100$). We have noted that the time courses of a certain further variable $X$ seem to split this group of samples in two. We would like to use the $n \times t$ variables to test this hypothesis. How would you handle this problem? I'm a bit lost at the moment. I was considering using PCA or MPCA and than an acceptable clustering technique to see whether we can recover the original clustering. However, several alternative clusterings could be possible in the given data set (for example, we can have red and blue circles and triangles). I'm not sure how to test the following statement: There exists a substantial (significant? statistically significant?) set of variables that show the same pattern of clustering as $X$.
