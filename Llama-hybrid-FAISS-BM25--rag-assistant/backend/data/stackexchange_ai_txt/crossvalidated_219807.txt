The focus of the methods is slightly different although they are of course not completely unconnected. The meta-analysis of significance values has as its mull hypothesis that all the $p_i$ are drawn from a uniform distribution on (0, 1). The alternative hypothesis is often not clearly stated but is usually that either (a) at least one of the $p_i$ has some other distribution, or (b) all of them have. People who adjust for multiple comparisons usually have a focus on which test has reached their corrected level of significance (or what the coverage of their adjusted confidence intervals is). To put it another way meta-analysis here answers the question: taking the totality of the dataset together is there any evidence that all the $p_i$ are not uniform? The multiple comparisons approach answers the question: are these specific comparisons beyond the critical value allowing for the number of comparisons made.
