Eclipse updates ruins Android XML layout editing

I recently updated my eclipse installation with which I develop my Android apps. Soon I found my layout files have lost the up and down arrows associated with each VIEW and LAYOUT which helps to organize my layouts. I don't know whatelse the update, if anything, has messed up but I wonder and would appreciate any information on how to fix this issue so I can get my developments back on track, please. Thanks
