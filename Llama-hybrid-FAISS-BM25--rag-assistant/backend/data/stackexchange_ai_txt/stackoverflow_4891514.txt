JavaScript Object/Array newbie (using jQuery)

I have a function which needs to return either an array or object. I'm not sure which is best and I'm not sure how to construct it. Here's what I have so far. Pay close attention to the comments in ALL CAPS. The idea is to loop through a set of td cells that contain a 'data-field' attribute, and use the name of the attribute as the variable name and the text contained within the td as the value. The number of properties or values of the array/object are unknown. Depending on what was clicked to enter into the function, 2-6 values will be needed. function InlineEditMode(rowID, entryType) { // store current row data in case of cancel var original = $('#'+rowID).contents(); // DEFINE SOME ARRAY OR OBJECT HERE // put original values in the newEntry Array with a loop, using the // data-field attributes as the name of the array or object variables // and the text of the td as the value $('#'+rowID+' td[data-field]').each(function() { var field = $(this).attr('data-field'); var value = $(this).text(); // BUILD OUT OBJECT OR ARRAY }); // RETURN ARRAY OR OBJECT }
