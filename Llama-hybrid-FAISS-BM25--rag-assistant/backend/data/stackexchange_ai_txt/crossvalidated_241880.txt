No, there isn't, as pointed out by user Dilip Sarwate. You should also be aware of the "observational equivalence" of $I(0)$ and $I(1)$ processes: see Hamilton's 'Time Series Analysis' (section 15.4 on p. 444 and also p. 515) Roughly this means that one can always find an $I(0)$ process that in finite samples resembles a $I(1)$ process.
