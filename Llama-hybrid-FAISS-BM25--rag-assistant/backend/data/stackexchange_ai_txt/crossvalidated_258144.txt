Bayesian and frequentist ask different questions. Bayesian asks what parameter values are credible, given the observed data. Frequentist asks about the probability of imaginary simulated data if some hypothetical parameter values were true. Frequentist decisions are motivated by controlling errors, Bayesian decisions are motivated by uncertainty in model descriptions. So which should you teach first? Well, if one or the other of those questions is what you want to ask first, that's your answer. But in terms of approachability and pedagogy, I think that Bayesian is much easier to understand and is far more intuitive. The basic idea of Bayesian analysis is re-allocation of credibility across possibilities, just like Sherlock Holmes famously said, and which millions of readers have intuitively understood. But the basic idea of frequentist analysis is very challenging: The space of all possible sets of data that might have happened if a particular hypothesis were true, and the proportion of those imaginary data sets that have a summary statistic as or more extreme than the summary statistic that was actually observed. A free introductory chapter about Bayesian ideas is here . An article that sets frequentist and Bayesian concepts side by side is here . The article explains frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation (and a lot of other stuff). The framework of the article might be especially useful to beginners trying to get a view of the landscape.
