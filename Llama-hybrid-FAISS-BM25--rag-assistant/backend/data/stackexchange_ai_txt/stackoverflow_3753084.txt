It turns out the major industry-standard designs for automated testing are: Data Driven Keyword Driven Model Driven Query Driven Additionally, "hybrid" approaches are used. These are approaches in which more than one of the above designs are used. In a number of places on the web (including wikipedia) "Modularity Driven" test case design is mistakenly referred to as if it were one of the automated test case design strategies listed above. The definition of this mistaken term ("Modularity Driven") appears to have more to do with the organizational aspects of coding than the way in which One drives an automated test. "Modularity Driven" automated testing is a misnomer (or mistaken term altogether). In other words, there is no such thing. The term "modular" describes the programming paradigm being used. The modular aspect of a test is in its organization, storing code in modules as opposed to other programming paradigms like OOP, or Procedural, etc.
