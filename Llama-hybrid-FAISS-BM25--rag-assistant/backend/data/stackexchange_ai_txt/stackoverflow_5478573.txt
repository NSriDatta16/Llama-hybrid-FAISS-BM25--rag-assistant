How to find typos like yaho.com, gnail.com... when having people fill in email addresses

In all projects with online forms where lots of people have to enter their data, a surprisingly large number enters email addresses that pass the regex validation but look like foo@yaho.com, foo@gnail.com or foo@hotmial.com - typos in the domain names of well known email providers. We would love to show a hint like "you wrote foo@yaho.com, but didn't you mean foo@yahoo.com?" . Of course we could create a huge collection of likely spelling errors. Is there a more elegant way? A webservice that does just that? A code snippet? A super cool regex?
