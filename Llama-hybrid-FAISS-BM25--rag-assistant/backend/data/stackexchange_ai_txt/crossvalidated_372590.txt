The issue you have is that the algorithm for finding starting values for the MCMC sampling fails to find parameter values that give a non-zero (in terms of the precision used in the program) posterior (i.e. both prior and likelihood need to be non-zero). Once you have such values, the sampling would likely proceed without further issues. The general solution for this type of problem is to Check you (or in this case perhaps the developer of the package) have not made a mistake in specifying the model. Ask you algorithm to try for a longer time to find starting values with non-zero likelihood. Explicitly provide starting values. E.g. ask for all random subject effect to be zero initially. If the brms package does not allow you to do that, you might have to hand-specify the model in rstan , in which case you can definitely do that.
