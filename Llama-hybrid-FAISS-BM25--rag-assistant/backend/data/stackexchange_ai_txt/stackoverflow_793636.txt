Most common standard to provide a feed of upcoming events via web

What are common methods / official standards for surfacing event or calendar data? My use case is that I want to aggregate event information from several different websites into a single calendar or event listing (this is on an intranet, we have control over all websites). I want to ask the websites to present their data in a certain format so I can consume it. Things that I have looked into: iCalendar hCalendar (microformat) - embedded into webpages, but then is a web-crawler necessary? RSS - no clear standard for embedding time-specific data (event proposal that is still in 'Proposed' status http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/ ) While iCalendar seems to be most commonly used, my hesitation is that it isn't easy for content creators to also present their data in iCalendar format. I suppose that is where hCalendar becomes useful.
