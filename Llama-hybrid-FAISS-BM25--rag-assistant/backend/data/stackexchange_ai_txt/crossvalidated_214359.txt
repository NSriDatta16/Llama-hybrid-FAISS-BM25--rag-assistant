choosing between traditional statistical models and neural networks using RMSE

I am new to neural networks, and am more familiar with classical linear regression type models. I have a basic question about choosing between the two in attempting to develop a predictive model. Is root mean squared error a valid approach to selecting a neural network over a regression model, or vice versa, based on the predictive performance? Or, are there other measures by which they could be compared?
