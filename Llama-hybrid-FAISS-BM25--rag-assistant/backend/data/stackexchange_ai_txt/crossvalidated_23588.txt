An alternative to Rob Hyndman's approach, to make a single data series, is to merge the data. This might be appropriate if your multiple time series represent noisy readings from a set of machines recording the same event. (If each time series is on a different scale you need to normalize the data first.) NOTE: you still only end up with 28 readings, just less noise, so this may not be appropriate for your situation. t1=xts(jitter(sin(1:28/10),amount=0.2),as.Date("2012-01-01")+1:28) t2=xts(jitter(sin(1:28/10),amount=0.2),as.Date("2012-01-01")+1:28) t3=(t1+t2)/2
