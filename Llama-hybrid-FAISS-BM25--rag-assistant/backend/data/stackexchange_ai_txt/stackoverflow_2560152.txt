project organization between x86 and x64

I have a mixed language solution in VS2008. I would like to structure the bin such that I have bin\x86\Release and bin\x64\Release among the other options. I can do something like this if I have all C# or all C++, but as the platform names don't overlap (x86 vs. Win32) between C++ and C#, I can't seem to do this with the macros (and have an easy solution). I've tried to add a new platform and it won't let me. Is there an easy way to do this?
