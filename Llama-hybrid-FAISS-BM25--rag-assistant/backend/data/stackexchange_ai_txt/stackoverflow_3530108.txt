jQuery load() and stylesheet not working?

I'm loading a file into a div with load() function, but after I load the data - the styles for it doesn't want to work. For example: index.html: $("a ").click( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $("#Display").load('file.html'); $("#Display").show(); }); file.html: Item number #1 Lorem ipsum like text... style.css: #title { color: red; } #content { color: green; } After I click "a" link, the content is loaded to #Display div, then it's perfectly displayed, but the title header is not red and content paragraph is not green . I believe that's a default behavior because when site loads at first there are no such elements and I'm loading them dynamically with jQuery. Is there a way to lazy load them and refresh style-sheet in the background somehow? Or any other tricks to help me? Thanks a lot!
