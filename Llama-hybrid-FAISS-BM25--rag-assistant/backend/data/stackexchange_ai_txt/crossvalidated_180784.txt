Hypothesis test for stratified data without a variance estimate for each strata

I am currently working on a project where I am given an incomplete dataset on the prices of two medical procedures, and I would like to run a hypothesis says that roughly says something like " Procedure A costs more than Procedure B " My data table looks something like this: Year | $\text{AvgCost}_{A,t}$ | $\text{AvgCost}_{B,t}$ | $N_{A,t}$ | $N_{B,t}$ 1999 | \$ 300 | $250 | 1000 | 20 2000 | \$ 325 | $271 | 1020 | 40 2001 | \$ 500 | $281 | 1050 | 60 where $\text{AvgCost}_{A,t}$ and $\text{AvgCost}_{B,t}$ are the average costs of procedures $A$ and $B$ in year $t$, and $N_{A,t}$ and $N_{B,t}$ are the number of patients who had procedure $A$ and $B$ in year $t$. The setup is very similar to a stratified random sampling problem with the exception being that I do NOT have a variance estimate for the average cost each year (only the average cost and the sample size). In light of this, I am wondering if someone can suggest a hypothesis test that I can run on this data? Right now, the best option I can think of is a 2-sample t-test where we compare the mean values of $\text{AvgCost}_{A,t}$ and $\text{AvgCost}_{B,t}$ year to year. However, this does not take into account for the facts that: The sample size changes each year The costs for both procedures increase year-to-year and are therefore not independent.
