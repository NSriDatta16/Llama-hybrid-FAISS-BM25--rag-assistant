How to calculate probability for new person from existing logistic regression model?

I need to create a credit scorecard model. Once I ran a logistic regression to find out the probability of default of a customer, how do I calculate scores of new customers? I have variables like age, debt to income ratio, amount of credit card debt, etc.
