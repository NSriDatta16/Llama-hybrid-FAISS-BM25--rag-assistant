I think integrated IDEs with semantic highlighting and **semantically-constrained suggestions* (a la IDEA or Eclipse) are a huge advancement. But that happened 8-10 years ago. Template-based programming feels useful never seems to catch on. Recently I was impressed with a demo of the Meta-programming system , which leverages the interactive nature of the IDE to simplify the task of writing templates and what are (essentially) type-aware macros. Meta-programming might help you define geometry-based macros that would substitute for a number of lines of code. I could imagine something that let you embed a more-readable 'math language' inside Java, and then parses its contents into something machine-readable.
