An intense preoccupation with the latest minutiae and indifference to the social and intellectual forces of tradition and revolutionary change, combine to produce the Mandarinism that some would now say already characterizes academic statistical theory and is most likely to describe its immediate future. The statisticians of the past came into the subject from other fields - astronomy, pure mathematics, genetics, agronomy, economics etc. â€” and created their statistical methodology with a background of training for a specific scientific discipline and a feeling for its current needs. So for the future I recommend we work on interesting problems and avoid dogmatism. -- Herbert Robbins in "Wither Mathematical Statistics?" as quoted by Peter J.
