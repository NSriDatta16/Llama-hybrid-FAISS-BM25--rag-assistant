Blackberry - LabelField Dynamic Update Issues

I am trying to develop a BlackBerry app for a Storm2. I am facing a problem when trying to update a LabelField from a different instance of the app. The program is working fine without updating this LabelField, but when I tried to add the code to update the text, it becomes unresponsive after the "settext" line. Am I missing something? public class AgentTrackerScreen extends MainScreen { public static LabelField _outputText; ... } public class BtService implements Runnable { ... public void run() { AgentTrackerScreen._outputtext.settext( "Something: " + btListener.vecDevices.size()); } ... }
