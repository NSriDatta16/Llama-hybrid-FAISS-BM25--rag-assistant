You're reading it wrong - it never takes 4x the space. Specifically, it says 4* (4 bytes, see footnote), not 4x (multiply by 4). The only case where it's exactly 4x the space is a char(4), which would see savings if the NULLs exist more than 64% of the time. "*The length is equal to the average of the data that is contained in the type, plus 2 or 4 bytes."
