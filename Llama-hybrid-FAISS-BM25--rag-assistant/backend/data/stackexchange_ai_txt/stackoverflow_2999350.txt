Use a "Static Library" target. Add your source to the target, and build. Since Objective-C is compiled to machine code, the resulting library is binary only. That said, Objective-C binaries are not as difficult to dig into as C++, for example. Since Objective-C uses runtime dispatching, many symbol names are retained. Using classdump at the command line, users will still be able to at least learn the classes and selectors in your binary. If this is unacceptable, you will have to consider writing the library in pure C (I discourage you from using C++ since it would require clients to use Objective-C++ just to use your library).
