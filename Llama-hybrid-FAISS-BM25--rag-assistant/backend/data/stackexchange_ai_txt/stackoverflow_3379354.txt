Starting service from other apk - throws NoClassDefFoundError exception

i have two projects in Eclipse: service and UI client. In onCreate in UI client I have: startService(new Intent(this, ExampleService.class)); but this fragment: ExampleService.class throws NoClassDefFoundError exception at runtime. I have installed ExampleService.apk, and ExampleUiClient.apk. Project compiles, and everything looks fine. What I am doing wrong? Is it possible to start service from other apk?
