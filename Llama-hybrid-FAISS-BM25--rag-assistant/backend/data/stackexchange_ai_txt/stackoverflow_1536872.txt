PHP Ajax Caching for IE7 and iE8

I have an application written in PHP/Javascript which uses AJAX extensively. I am concerned that the default caching behaviour for IE7 and IE8 set for our organisation, of 'Automatic' will scupper my application. There are approximately 1500 users and my IT department say that they won't change the caching option in IE for all those users. My question is: How can I absolutely guarantee that if I make a change to my application, that all users will immediately see that change? Also, how can I guarantee that AJAX will always bring back fresh results? Do I really have to resort to making all my URLs unique for every call? There seems to be a fair amount of uncertainty on this topic on the internet. There must be a definitive answer that always works. More Questions Why doesn't just setting the HTTP headers in the AJAX files do the trick? Also, how do I know that these solutions really work? What is the correct procedure for testing caching behaviour?
