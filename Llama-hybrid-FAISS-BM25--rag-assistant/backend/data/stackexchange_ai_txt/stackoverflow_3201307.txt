Fluent nhibernate automapping collection

I am trying to map my collections with FNHib automapping. The problems that I want to solve are: 1) I want all my collections in the project to be mapped via private field. How can I say that globally? 2) Is there any way to automap bidirectional relationship without explicitly overriding each of my entities. class OrganizationEntity example: private ISet<> _collectionWarehouse; public virtual IEnumerable CollectionWarehouse { get{return _collectionWarehouse; } set{_collectionWarehouse = new HashedSet ((ICollection )value)} } Class WarehouseEntity example: public virtual OrganizationEntity Organization{get;set;}
