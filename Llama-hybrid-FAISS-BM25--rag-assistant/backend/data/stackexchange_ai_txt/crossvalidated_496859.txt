If the true relationship between numcron and the log of the expected value of ofc is curvy but you fit a model that implies a linear relation, the estimates of the average value of ofc at each value of numcron will be inaccurate. The model uses the value of ofc for all values of numcron to estimate the slope and intercept, so the intercept will not only reflect the values of ofc when numcorn = 0 but must also accommodate the restriction that the relationship between the log of the expected value of ofc and numcron be linear. In contrast, when treating numcron as a categorical variable, the estimate of the intercept doesn't involve any data points where numcron is not 0, so the intercept will directly correspond to the average of ofc when numcron = 0 . You can check this by removing some data points with nonzero values of numcron ; you will see that the intercept remains identical in the categorical model but will change in the continuous linear model.
