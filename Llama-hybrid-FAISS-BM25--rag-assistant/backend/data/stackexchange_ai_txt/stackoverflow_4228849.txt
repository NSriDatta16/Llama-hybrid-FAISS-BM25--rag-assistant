Receive input in specific time

I'm writing a testing system and i all i want to do is to count how many seconds had user spent on this question. i.e. i print question(standard System.out.println), then wait 5 seconds and if within these 5 seconds user answered(through standard input), i want to keep this value. If user hasn't provided an answer in 5 seconds, it must skip this question and continue. The problem is I'm reading user answers via Scanner object, and something like in.nextInt() is uncontrollable, I suppose. How can I solve this problem? Here is fragment of my code without that functionality, can you give me some hints what to add? public void start() { questions.prepareQuestions(numQuestions); Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in); boolean playerIsRight=false,botIsRight=false; int playerScore=0,botScore=0; for (int i = 0; i playerScore) System.out.println("Machine won! Hail to the almighty transistors!"); else if(playerScore>botScore) System.out.println("Human won! Hail to the power of nature!"); else System.out.println("Tie. No one ever wins. No one finally loses."); }
