You've got a stateful client - one of the interesting things to do is leverage that state. For example: Task centric UI with multiple active tasks. Each task represents a process/workflow that has begun, but not yet completed. Especially useful in scenarios where ther are interrupts. Auto-save drafts to local isolated storage in case the app restarts, browser closes etc. Any partially filled forms can be restored when the app is re-launched. The other thing is context... or preserving context of the task at hand. For example, if you want to do a lookup, you can popup a dialog, rather than navigate away from the current page. Just some quick ideas...
