Greg Hewgill is on the right track. Always enable the strict pragma. Also, always enable warnings--but I recommend against using the -w switch in your code. Instead, take advantage of the use warnings pragma. That way you can selectively disable particular groups of warnings in lexically scoped areas of your code. For example: use strict; use warnings; foo('bar'); foo(); sub foo { no warnings 'uninitialized'; my $foo = shift || 'DEFAULT'; print "Foo is $foo\n"; } Consistent use of the strict and warnings pragmas will save you hours and hours of time.
