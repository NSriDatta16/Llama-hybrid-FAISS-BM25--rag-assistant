Without knowing what framework and whatnot you are using this is a difficult question to answer well. Are you using a database for your storage? Let's say you have a pages table in your database, why not create a pages_versions table for holding old revisions? When saving anything to the pages table first insert a copy, into pages_versions . Retrieving the old versions will then be no more difficult than loading data through any other one to many relationship. You can beautify the data with a colourised diff or whatnot at this point. I believe some frameworks now have support for using a version control system as a storage backend so that may also be worth investigating.
