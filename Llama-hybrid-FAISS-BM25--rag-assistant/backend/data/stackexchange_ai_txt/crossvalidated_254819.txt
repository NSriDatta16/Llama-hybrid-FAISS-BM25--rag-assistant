Pre-processing often works because it does remove features of the data which are not related to the classification problem you are trying solve. Think for instance about classifying sound data from different speakers. Fluctuations in loudness (amplitude) might be irrelevant, whereas the frequency spectrum is the really relevant aspect. So in this case, normalizing amplitude will be really helpful for most ML algorithms, because it removes an aspect of the data that is irrelevant and would cause a neural network to overfit to spurious patterns.
