plot "average" of many similar time value curves

i did an experiment and recorded a value over time. the value always starts at zero and slowly rises over time. once the value reaches a certain threshold the experiment is stopped. i repeated this experiment several times and now have a bunch of measurement series (values over time). if plotted (time on x axis and measured value on y axis) the curves all look quite similar. some curves raise a litte faster. some a little slower. i want to "average" this curve. but not the average of the value at a certain time but instead average of time needed to reach a certain value. or in other words: not the average of the y axis values but the average of the x axis values. i hope that makes sense. here a contrived example to show some actual numbers. the first column is time. the following columns are the measured values of the experiments. in this example the threshold value to stop the experiment is 10. 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 3 3 3 4 6 4 4 6 9 5 6 8 12 6 7 10 7 9 8 10 the typical average function of spreadsheet program will do, for example for time point 2: avg(1,2,3). but what i want is the average of the time required to reach, for example the value 6: avg(5,4,3). and that for all (interpolated) values between 0 and 10. i imagine that this is a common statistics operation. i was expecting spreadsheets programs like excel or libreoffice calc to have a prepared function for this task. i looked over some of the functions related to "average" but none seem to do what i want. i have tried searching for some other functions but they all seem to do something different. here are some of the terms i searched for: average, pivot, normalize, inverse. if answering please have mercy with my lack of skill in statistics. please don't just name drop techniques. please explain in layman terms. also maybe my understanding of an "average curve" is nonsensical. then please explain how i can "average" my many similar curves so that it makes sense.
