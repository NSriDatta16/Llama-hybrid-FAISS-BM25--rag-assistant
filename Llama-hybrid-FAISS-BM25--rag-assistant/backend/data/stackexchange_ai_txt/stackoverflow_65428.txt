There are a few approaches I can think of right off, each with differing levels of complexity and flexibility. I'm assuming your goal is to preserve an order in retrieval, rather than requiring storage as an actual linked list. The simplest method would be to assign an ordinal value to each record in the table (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...). Then, when you retrieve the records, specify an order-by on the ordinal column to get them back in order. This approach also allows you to retrieve the records without regard to membership in a list, but allows for membership in only one list, and may require an additional "list id" column to indicate to which list the record belongs. An slightly more elaborate, but also more flexible approach would be to store information about membership in a list or lists in a separate table. The table would need 3 columns: The list id, the ordinal value, and a foreign key pointer to the data record. Under this approach, the underlying data knows nothing about its membership in lists, and can easily be included in multiple lists.
