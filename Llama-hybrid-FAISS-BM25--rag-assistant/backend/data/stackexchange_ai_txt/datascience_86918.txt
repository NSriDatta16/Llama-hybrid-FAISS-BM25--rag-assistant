You are asking something different than standard machine learning. In standard machine learning, a test set is a dataset with labels that is evaluated a single time. The result of the test set evaluation is never used to change the model. Another way to frame your question is - "I have high quality unlabeled data that I would combine with my labeled data to create a model." The answer to that question is semi-supervised learning .
