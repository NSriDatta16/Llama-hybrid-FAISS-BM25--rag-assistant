There is no easy one line solution for this. You would have to program this yourself. You have to keep track of every object you have drawn. In the onmousedown event you have to find out if the mouse has clicked on or near an object you want to move/delete by comparing coordinates. Then you need to draw some visual guide that the line is 'selected'. Deleting is now quite easy by removing the object from the collection. For drag and drop you have to do something similar by changing the coordinates of the object according to the mouse move.
