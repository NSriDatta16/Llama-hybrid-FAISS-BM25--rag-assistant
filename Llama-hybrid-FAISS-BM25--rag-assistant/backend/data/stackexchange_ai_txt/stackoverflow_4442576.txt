Other objects can access NumberOne, but they can't access numberTwo. So I can do Your_Object.numberOne = 14; but I can't do Your_Object.numberTwo= 14; Now I might be able to access the numberTwo through reflection depending on the permissions set up in the application, but I can't directly. Variables in C# Reflection in C# Accessors in C#
