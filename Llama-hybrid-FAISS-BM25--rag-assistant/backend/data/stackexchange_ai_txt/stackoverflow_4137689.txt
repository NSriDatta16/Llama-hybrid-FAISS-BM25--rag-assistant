Visual Studio Web Deploy to IIS 6

Has anyone successfully used the new Web Deploy feature of VS2010 to deploy a web site to IIS 6 running on Windows Server 2003? When I try I get the following error: Web deployment task failed. Could not complete the request to remote agent URL 'https://myserver:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=mysite'. Unable to connect to the remote server. No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. I can deploy locally (from VS installed on the server to IIS on the server) and the World Wide Web Publishing Service is running. However, there is no process listening on port 8172. Is there supposed to be one?
