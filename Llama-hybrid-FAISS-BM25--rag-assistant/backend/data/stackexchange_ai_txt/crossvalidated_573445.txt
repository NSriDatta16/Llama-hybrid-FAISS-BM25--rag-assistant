What are the advantages of using a Machine Learning (NN) method instead of regression model in survival analysis?

Suppose that I have a sample of survival times $t_1,...,t_n$ , censoring indicators $d_i = I(t_i , and covariates $x_i\in{\mathbb R}^P$ . Suppose that I have a flexible parametric regression model based on splines, including time dependent effects, and all that show. I can train a neural network based on recent developments on the literature. Assuming that the computational cost of both approaches is the same. Question : What advantages learning a Neural Network would bring compared to the flexible parametric regression model?
