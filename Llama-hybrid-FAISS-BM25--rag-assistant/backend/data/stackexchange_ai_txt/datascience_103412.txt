Do the examples of reinforcement learning such as the hide and seek learn to solve anything but the environment they start in?

As pictured here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY OpenAI implements a study for reinforcement learning with multiple learning agents which appear adversarial. "Millions of rounds" they say allowed these players to learn behaviors. The question is, are they really learning ? If once the algorithm they used was finished and the environment changed would the encoded data and decisions the algorithm learns apply and replicate what was 'learned' in any other virtual environment with the same overall rules ?
