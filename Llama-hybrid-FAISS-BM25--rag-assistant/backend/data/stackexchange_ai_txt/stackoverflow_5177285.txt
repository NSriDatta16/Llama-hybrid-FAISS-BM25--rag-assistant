Colossal Caves Adventure - access data source using javascript

I've been playing around with the idea of creating a javascript version of the original Colossal Caves Adventure, as a way to teach myself the language. The original data file for the adventure can be found here - http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/crowther/ I'm hoping an experienced javascripter can suggest to me the best way to store and access the text data file (which is only a few hundred lines long). At the moment I'm thinking of embedding the text in a hidden element in the html page and accessing it that way, but I know that lacks elegance. What are your thoughts?
