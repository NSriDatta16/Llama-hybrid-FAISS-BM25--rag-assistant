I don't have a solution for working with jquery ui but I do have a solution for working with Raphael and by extension other svg objects. First, using chrome or firefox, go drag the dots around in this jsfiddle. Be sure to drag both dots and to use the slider at the bottom to change the scale of the box. The slider has a default scale range of .4 to 1.2. In Chrome the slider is actually a slider but in Firefox it shows up as a textbox. If you are using firefox enter values that are 100 x the scale, i.e. 70 => 0.7. What you should have just experienced is that the black dot tracks with the mouse regardless of the scale and the red dot only tracks when the scale is 1.0. The reason for this is the two dots are using different 'onMove' functions. The black dot moves according to 1/scale while the red dot moves normally. var moveCorrected = function (dx, dy) { // move will be called with dx and dy this.attr({ cx: this.ox + (1/scale)*dx, cy: this.oy + (1/scale)*dy }); } var move = function (dx, dy) { // move will be called with dx and dy this.attr({ cx: this.ox + dx, cy: this.oy + dy }); } So, in answer to my original question. You can't (and shouldn't) be able to change how the mouse moves, that is clearly user defined behavior, but you can change the move function of the object being moved to track with the mouse.
