How to interpret hourly rate data given in one miniute intervals

I have time series data on natural gas flow, which is in units of "tonnes/hour". But the data are given in one minute intervals (each row represents a single minute of time duration). Here is a sample: DateTime Flow_t_h 1: 2018-11-01 08:00:00 100.1 2: 2018-11-01 08:01:00 110.3 3: 2018-11-01 08:02:00 112.4 4: 2018-11-01 08:03:00 109.3 5: 2018-11-01 08:04:00 105.1 6: 2018-11-01 08:05:00 100.0 I'm not sure how to interpret a one minute sample from an hourly rate. Does that make the rate tonnes/minute? Or one-minute's worth of tonnes/hour? If I aggregate the minute data into hours (i.e. sum of each 60 minute period), is it still tonnes/hour? If I aggregate to days (i.e. sum of each 1440 minute period), would it be tonnes/day? Thanks
