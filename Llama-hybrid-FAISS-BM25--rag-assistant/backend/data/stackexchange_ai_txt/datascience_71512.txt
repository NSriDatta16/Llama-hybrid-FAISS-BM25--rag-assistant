NLP - Simple approach to identify commonalities in text comments between people

For something we are working on, we were looking for a simple way to compare from review/feedback data against a question (for which there are multiple responses from multiple people), the following: What are the common things (things defined as phrases/sentences) they are saying (Some way to quantify the commonality too if possible). The point is to identify what seems to be areas of agreement about their review What are things that are not common (basically...what are those on-off sentences/phrases that have been told that are very uncommon) Where is there disagreement (i.e. are there sentences/phrases where there is disagreement potentially between the responses) The goal is to find a simple solution to this and not necessarily model driven (there is paucity of data). Also...it needs to be directional at this time...as the goal is to prove that this can work and can product reasonable results. Any help advise? Thanks much! PS: We would need some 'intelligence' in identifying the commonality or vice-versa (i.e. different words meaning same within a phrase should be considered common).
