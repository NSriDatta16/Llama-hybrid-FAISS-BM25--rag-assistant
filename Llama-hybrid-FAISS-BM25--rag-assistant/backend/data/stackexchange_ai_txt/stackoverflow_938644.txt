If you don't have shell access at the site, you can use wget: #!/bin/bash export BCKDIR=`date -u +"%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ"` wget -m -np -P $BCKDIR http://www.example.com/path/to/dir wget options: -m - Mirror everything, follow links -np - Don't access parent directories (avoids downloading the whole site) -P - Store files below $BCKDIR If you have shell access, you can use rsync. One way to do it, is to have this loop running in a screen(1) session with automatic login using ssh-agent: #!/bin/bash while :; do export BCKDIR=`date -u +"%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ"` rsync -az user@hostname:/path/to/dir $BCKDIR sleep 86400 # Sleep 24 hours done Not sure what OS you're using, but this should run fine under *NIX. And for MS Windows, there's Cygwin.
