Is there an elegant way to exclude the first value of a range?

Let's say I have a range from 0 to 10: range = 0...10 Three dots mean, that the last value (10) is excluded: range.include? 10 => false Now, is there a similar and elegant way to exclude the first value? For the above example, this would mean to include all values that are bigger ( > , not >= ) than 0 and smaller than 10.
