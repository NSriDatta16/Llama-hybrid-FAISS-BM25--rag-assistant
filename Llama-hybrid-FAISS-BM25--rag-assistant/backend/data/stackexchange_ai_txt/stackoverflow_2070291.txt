Using vertical splitter in Java Swing GUI?

I am developing a java desktop application. I have some doubts or problems in designing one thing which is as follows: I want to break the the main frame JFrame mainFrame = new JFrame("Demo"); into two parts (divided vertically) so that user can change their size by dragging the common boundary of both the parts to either left or right so that when the width of one part increases, the width of other part decreases so the size of the mainFrame remains same. I am designing this GUI through Netbeans IDE so it is not necessary to suggest me the code. You can simply suggest me the "item" from the palette window that I can drag and drop to my mainFrame.
