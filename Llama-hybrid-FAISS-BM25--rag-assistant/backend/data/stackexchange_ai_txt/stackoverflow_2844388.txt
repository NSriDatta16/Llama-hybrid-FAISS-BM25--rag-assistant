Because the scope of the local variables is limited to the surrounding block. That's why they cannot be referred to (neither statically, nor non-statically), from other classes or methods. Wikipedia says about static local variables (in C++ for example): Static local variables are declared inside a function, just like automatic local variables. They have the same scope as normal local variables, differing only in "storage duration": whatever values the function puts into static local variables during one call will still be present when the function is called again. That doesn't exist in Java. And in my opinion - for the better.
