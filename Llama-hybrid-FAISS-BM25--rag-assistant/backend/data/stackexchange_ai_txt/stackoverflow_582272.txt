Break it up -- move the xsl execution statements to xsl templates inside the document. By doing this, you'll work down to a more reasonable understanding of the document from the top down. And if it's so incredibly gigantic as to prevent you from understanding it, this sounds like you have a re-factoring decision ahead of you: is this document so important that we need to know what it does (and understand how it works -- thus requiring some re-work), or can we live with it as-is?
