The question you referenced is written in windows forms. You can not drag'n drop elements in your web form as in windows forms. If you want to drag and drop elements in a web application, you should use client side code. The best option in client side is to use a library, and the best one is JQuery UI in my opinion. In the demo I linked user can drag a div element. Here is a simple dragging example with a static image and a server-side ASP.NET control : $(function() { $("#draggable").draggable(); $("# ").draggable(); }); Note : To test this code, all you need to do is to download the JQuery UI with draggable component from here and add it to your script folder.
