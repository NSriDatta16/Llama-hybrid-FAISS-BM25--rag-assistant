How can an undergraduate learn more about deep learning?

I am an undergraduate who needs to submit a thesis for graduation. I am fairly interested in deep learning, and am working on a project that uses deep learning methods extensively (rCNNs to be precise). The caveat here is that I am working alone, with little help from my advisor. There are hardly any experts on deep learning in my university. How do I go about finishing my project. It is specially intimidating to see that most papers in deep learning are published by multiple accomplished scientists with very little involvement of undergraduate level students. PS: I am really interested in this topic, so please try not to advise me to switch to an easier topic.
