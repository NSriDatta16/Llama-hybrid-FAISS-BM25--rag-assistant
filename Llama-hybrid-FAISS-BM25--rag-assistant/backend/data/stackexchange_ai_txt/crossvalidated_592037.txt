Sure you can. Those metrics are older than machine learning. For example, the ROC curves calculated based on TPR and FPR were designed during World War II for judging the accuracy of radars . The metrics calculated based on the confusion matrix are also commonly used in medicine for judging the performance of diagnostic tests. For example, below I posted a table from the report mentioning such results for a rapid COVID test (not advertising it, it was the first such result that I found online), as you can see, it has many of the "machine learning" metrics. There are also used in many other scenarios regarding information retrieval, signal detection, classification, etc.
