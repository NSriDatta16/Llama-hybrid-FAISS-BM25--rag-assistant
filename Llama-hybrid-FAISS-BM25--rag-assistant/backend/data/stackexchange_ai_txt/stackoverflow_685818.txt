Neodynamic Barcode Professional for SSRS

Our application needs to be able to render barcodes to PDF documents that will be accessible over the internet. Our technology stack includes SQL Server Reporting Services so we would like to leverage it and its ability to render to PDF; however, we are not able to get it to embed the FREE3OF9.ttf barcode font in any consistent manner. I have reviewed this question , but would like to know any if any one has used Neodynamic products, particularly their SSRS product and whether or not they were satisfied with it. If anyone has any other solutions besides Neodynamic for rendering barcodes to a PDF via SSRS I would also like to hear those.
