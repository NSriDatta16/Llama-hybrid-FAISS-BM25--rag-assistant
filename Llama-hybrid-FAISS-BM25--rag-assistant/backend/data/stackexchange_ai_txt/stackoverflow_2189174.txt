Network programming with C#

I have a project to do which is packet monitoring. I want to capture each packet receive by specified network interface. I want to know what I should start with to do my project .... should I learn socket programming first or what? should I learn how to use winpcap under C# or just do my own function. please advice me from where I should start!!! I know there are many code in C# out there in the internet for this but I want to learn it by myself but I do not know from where to star!
