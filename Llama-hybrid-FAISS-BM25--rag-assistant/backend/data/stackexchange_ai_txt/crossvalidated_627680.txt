Interpreting slope for a categorical variable , outcome is continious

I like to learn how to interpret the effect estimates from a 4 level categorical predictor variable X , when my outcome Y is a continuous variable. Y = outcome variable X = 1,2,3,4 , categorical variable, where x=1 is my reference level. These are the estimates from the model. Model : Linear Model Intercept : -0.363 X (level2) : 0.406 X (level3) : 0.135 X (level4) : 0.2 Can I say that, changing X from Level 1 (Reference level) to Level 2 will increase Y on an average by 0.406 units changing X from Level 1 (Reference level) to Level 3 will increase Y on an average by 0.135 units What will be the coefficient of my reference level X=1 ? is it 0 or 1. Any help is much appreciated, Thanks.
