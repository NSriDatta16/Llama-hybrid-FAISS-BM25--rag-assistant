How are standard libraries, tools and app server platforms typically selected in large organizations?

I'm looking for a list of criteria for selecting standard development libraries, tools, and application servers (specifically Java EE) that is common across large organizations. If your experience doesn't span across multiple large orgs, answering with how this is conducted within your current org is still helpful. Also - 'standard' doesn't mean mandatory or exclusive, only that alternatives must be technically justified. Who selects or recommends dev tools? Does it come from a low, mid, or high level? (actual developers/subject matter experts, project managers, middle management, upper management, a Gartner/Forrester/etc, ?) Who or what is the final say in resolving the inevitable disputes in selecting a standard? (Ex. say you have X developers or Y group representatives who cannot agree on some standard tool, library, etc) Is there a committee which votes, a management authority figure (at what level?), some set of subject matter experts, etc? Extra points: Are there standard development libraries, tools, and app server software within your organization at all? If so how well are they adhered to? Are there "de facto standards"? Is there no standard or a decentralized way of doing business? Are there primary/secondary or "recommended" standards?
