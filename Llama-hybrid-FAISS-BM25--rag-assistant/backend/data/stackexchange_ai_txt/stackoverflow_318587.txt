The first thing I do with a totally new class file is to write several paragraphs of comments on what the class does, why it exists, what classes it uses and how to use it. It should be enough that someone who randomly opens up a file in a module knows enough from that comment to find the file they are actually looking for. I agree with James - I am very careful not to add functionality to a class that does not need it, most classes do not need a virtual destructor (or a destructor at all). If they do, I question why they don't just use smart pointers and other automatic memory management. Obviously there are many classes (i.e smart scoped locks) that DO need a destructor but it is not just a matter of course to make on.
