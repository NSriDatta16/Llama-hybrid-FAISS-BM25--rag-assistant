Can you recommend an appropriate statistical model for predicting national blood demand?

Can you recommend a statistical model for predicting national blood demand? I am seeking recommendations for a statistical model to predict national blood demand. I am aware that there are several methodologies available for establishing prediction models, including regressions, time-series analysis, and machine learning. The data I have consists of 50 years' worth of national blood usage, measured in 'Packs of RBC,' as well as 50 years' worth of national blood donation data, also described in terms of 'Packs of RBC.' However, I am encountering a difficulty. While I believe that time-series analysis would be the most suitable statistical methodology for my purpose, there is a significant obstacle. National blood usage does not accurately represent the true 'demand' for blood. In other words, when blood donation falls significantly short of blood usage, various measures can be implemented to manage the shortage in hospitals. For instance, blood centers may supply less blood than in the previous period, and the blood management departments of hospitals may enforce stricter regulations on blood usage across all departments. As a result, a surgeon, for example, might be limited to transfusing a maximum of 8 packs of RBC instead of 10. Additionally, transfusions for patients with higher hemoglobin levels may be postponed or canceled. Hence, the 'supply' of blood actively influences national blood usage, making it an inadequate surrogate for true 'demand' for blood. Given this situation, I am wondering if there are any statistical methods available for modeling the true 'demand' considering the interplay between the apparent 'supply' and 'demand' data.
