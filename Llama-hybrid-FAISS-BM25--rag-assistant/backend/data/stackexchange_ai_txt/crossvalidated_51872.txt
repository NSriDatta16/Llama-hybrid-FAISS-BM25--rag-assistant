Seasonal Time Series

Suppose $ X_t = (\alpha + \beta{t})S_{t} + e_{t}$. Define $C_{12} = 1 - B^{12}$ as the backshift operator. Assume $ S_{t}=S_{t-12}$ for all $t$. Assume that $e_{t}$ is white noise. Is $C*X_{t}$ stationary? If not, give a different backshift operator that makes the series stationary. When I solved this I got: $E[CX_{t}] = 12*\beta*S_{t}$ which is a constant. Also I got that $$var(CX_{t})= var((\alpha + \beta{t})S_{t} + e_{t} - (\alpha*S_{t-12} + \beta*t*S_{t} - S_{t}*12*\beta + e_{t-12})) $$ $$ = var(e_t +12 \beta S_t - e_{t-12}) = cov(e_{t},e_{t+12})$$ I use $S_{t}$ since $S_{t} = S_{t-12}$ for all $t$. Apparently this is wrong as the series is nonstationary using this backshift operator. What am I doing wrong? How is this series nonstationary and how do I find the correct backshift operator that makes it stationary?
