R-squared: 0.0508, Adjusted R-Squared -0.027 F-statistic vs. constant model: 0.653, p-value = 0.981 Here you have a good summary of how your model is doing. R-squared should be close to 1 for a model to be "good", in a linear manner (more on that later), so your model is doing pretty terrible. But that doesn't necessarily mean that your X aren'r related with your y, simply linear regression is not a good "fit". p-value this is a value you get from a Statistic test that tests a comparison between your model and a costant model (a really dummy model), if it's a value close to zero (typically below 0.05), your model is performing better than a dummy model (it's like "at least I'm better off with my model than a simple costant"). As you can see that's not the case unfortunately. Just these two values should point out pretty easily how are you doing. Also the red line on your plot shows that we are not fitting quite good the blue points. Probably a linear model is not the case here, so here's your option if you still want to do regression: Logistic Regression . Logistic regression is actually pretty used when you have a responde (y) that takes two values 0 or 1. Luckily a lot of statistical softwares implement it easly, so you'll have no problem finding examples even for Matlab.
