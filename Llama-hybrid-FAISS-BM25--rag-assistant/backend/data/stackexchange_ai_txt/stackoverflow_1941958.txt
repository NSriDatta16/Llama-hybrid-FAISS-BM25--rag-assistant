Since you have parsing technology, you can re-write the expressions to trap all the potential issues with a bunch of CASE statements - divide by zero, overflows, upcasting to different types, etc. But I wouldn't do that, because I don't think putting these into the database as part of the schema is a great idea, unless this tool is a code-generation tool nd users are responsible for reviewing and testing the expressions for edge conditions just as if they were included in the original database design. If you are already parsing the expression, I would compile this at the client side, too, and handle the error on a row-by-row basis. Catching the exception using TRY/CATCH is an all or nothing scenario, not on a row-by-row basis.
