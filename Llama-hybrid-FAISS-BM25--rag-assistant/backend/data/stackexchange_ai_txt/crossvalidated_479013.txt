Can we use average as independent variable in regression to detect outlier?

Suppose we have some data about earnings at different cities and different times, can I build a regression model: $y = a + bx_1 + cx_2$ where $x_1$ is the median earning of the whole state, and $x_2$ is the ten days median in this city. A high-level interpretation is that $b$ and $c$ account for the influence of location and time. Then I plot residuals to check whether data are outliers. Maybe I have other data (like GDP of the states) as x3 so I mix them together: $y = a + bx_1 + cx_2 + dx_3 + ...$ Does my model look good? My main concern is that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are derived from the set of $y$ and I'm not sure whether we can reuse $x_1$ and $x_2$ to predict $y$ .
