R Programming rearranging rows and colums from timeline data

I am new to R programming and data analytics. This is probably a trivial question but I could not find an answer. I'm also limited with my ontology of data science and data manipulation. So, I'm not sure if I conveyed my question right. I have huge irregular time series data close to 1 Million records. They are all in the form of time stamps with different discrete attributes. I want to rearrange the data as shown below. An Example of what I am trying to achieve FROM log entry of every car sold and the nature of the sale. Date Vehicle Sale Type Registration Profit 1-1-2017 Toyota Camry Cash Sale CA 2500 1-1-2017 Toyota Rav4 Lease CA 8500 1-1-2017 Toyota Camry Installment AZ 250 2-1-2017 Toyota Corolla Installment NV 250 4-1-2017 Toyota Etios Cash Sale AZ 2500 4-1-2017 Toyota Camry Lease CA 8500 4-1-2017 Toyota Prius Installment CA 250 13-1-2017 Toyota Prius Installment VA 250 TO with rows having car names and columns containing cash sale, lease, installment Vehicle Type Cash Sale Lease Installment Toyota Camry 1 1 1 Toyota Rav4 1 Toyota Corolla 1 Toyota Etios 1 Toyota Prius 2
