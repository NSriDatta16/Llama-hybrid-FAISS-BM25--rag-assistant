Applying CSS class declarations

Let's say this is my CSS file below. .redText{ color:#FF0000; } p{ font-weight:bold; } My goal is to make all of the paragraphs have bold and red text. Obviously I can just rewrite the color declaration again within the p rule, but in a larger CSS file that becomes a bit of a problem. What I'm after is a syntax that lets me apply the redText class to the p rule right in the same CSS file (that is, I'm not after blah ), rather, something similar to this p{ font-weight:bold; .redText; } Possible?
