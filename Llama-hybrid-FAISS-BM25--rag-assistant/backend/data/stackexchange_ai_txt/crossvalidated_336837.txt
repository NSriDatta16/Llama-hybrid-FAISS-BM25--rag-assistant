Contradictory results about heteroscedasticity (gvlma / Breusch-Pagan test)

Testing for heteroscedasticity (after OLS regression) using two different tools in R I obtain two contractictory results: 1/ Global Validation of Linear Models Assumptions of the gvlma package : gvlma::gvlma(BMall_lm) returns: Call: lm(formula = BM ~ TAM_jun + NBD3 + snow_acc, data = d) Coefficients: (Intercept) TAM_jun NBD3 snow_acc -618.545 -289.143 -11.785 1.186 ASSESSMENT OF THE LINEAR MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USING THE GLOBAL TEST ON 4 DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM: Level of Significance = 0.05 Call: gvlma::gvlma(x = BMall_lm) Value p-value Decision Global Stat 24.7590 5.625e-05 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Skewness 1.5379 2.149e-01 Assumptions acceptable. Kurtosis 0.6797 4.097e-01 Assumptions acceptable. Link Function 22.2932 2.340e-06 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Heteroscedasticity 0.2482 6.183e-01 Assumptions acceptable. The conclusion here is that the homoscedasticity assumption is verified 2/ BUT when I use the Breusch-Pagan test in the lmtest package I get the reverse : lmtest::bptest(BMall_lm) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: BMall_lm BP = 25.137, df = 3, p-value = 1.446e-05 Here, the homoscedasticity assumption is not verified Any help about which one to follow ?
