Why do we treat study standard errors as known in a meta-analysis?

I wonder if anyone knows why it is that we treat study standard errors as known when conducting a meta-analysis? When conducting analysis of trial data, the error is treating as a quantity to be estimated (at least in the Bayesian code I've seen). In a meta-analysis however, we might say: y[i] ~ N(delta,sigma[i]) delta ~ N(u,tau) leaving sigma as data instead of identifying it as a parameter. Is there a reason for this? Would we just never get stable estimates? Are there any consequences to this approach (i.e., underestimating uncertainty?)
