How many duplicates are you expecting? If there are lots of duplicates in your array you might want to consider implementing a string cache (wrapper around a Dictionary ) that caches instances of particular strings, and returns a reference to that instance for each duplicate string you cache in it. You can combine that with checking for interned strings, so you always use the interned version, if you have a lot of strings shared over the whole program. Depending on your data, this might give a much better result than trying to optimize the storage of each individual string.
