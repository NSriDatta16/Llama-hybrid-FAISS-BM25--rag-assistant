Create a primary key on StudentID, SchoolID and a secondary index on SchoolID , or vice versa, depending on what search condition is used more often. If your table is index organized ( ORGANIZATION INDEX in Oracle, CLUSTERED in SQL Server , InnoDB in MySQL ), then the secondary index will have a PRIMARY KEY as a leftmost part and, hence, all information can be fetched out of the index.
