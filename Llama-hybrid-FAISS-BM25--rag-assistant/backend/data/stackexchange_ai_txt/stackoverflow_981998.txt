The only time you should do rearranging, boolean algebra or demorgan's is when the logic is too complex to do it another way. If it is not too complex, keep it readable. There is a case for simplifying the logic. Sometimes when the logic is tricky I need to create a Karnaugh Map to simplify the logic down to something that I can even write down. Often, using K-Maps can help you to come up with more succinct ways of expressing your logic. The result may or may not make sense, but it will be equivalent. And I would also say that DeMorgan's itself really isn't an optimization that will make a difference, If more than half of the terms are negative(NOT), you will at best get the performance of removing a few NOT's, which is a single instruction for a CPU per NOT. At worst, you can add as many NOTs as you take away, and if you shouldn't have use DeMorgan's you will get more NOTs than you had in the first place. If you're going to optimize logic, use some boolean algebra, or my personal favorite K-Maps to reduce the number of terms(if possible). Don't just move the boolean operators around, it's silly.
