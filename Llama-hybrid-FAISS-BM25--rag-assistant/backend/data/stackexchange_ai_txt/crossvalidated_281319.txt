What is an appropriate variance correction to apply here?

I' am giving a toy example here for clarity, but I wish to apply this to a real problem I've encountered. Say for every block in a city I measure the population and the average building height. Now, I notice that with increasing average building height the variance in population also increases. See below for simulation data: n Where, $$ population \sim N(\mu=100, \sigma=buildingHeight) $$ $$ buildingHeight \sim Poisson(\lambda=10) $$ Say that I don't expect variance in population to depend on average building height, and for the purposes of downstream statistical anaylses, I want to correct the bias. So I come up with an ad hoc method to correct the bias: variances 1) { variances 1) { correction The math: Let $p_i$ and $h_i$ be the population and average building height for the $i^{th}$ city block. Let $ph_j=\{p_i | h_i = j\}$ be the set of population values that are from city blocks that have average building height $j$. Then let $sd_j$ be the standard deviation of $ph_j$. Compute $ph_{median}$, which is the median of all the $sd_j$ values, and $p_{median}$ which is the median of all $p_i$ values. Finally, perform the correction: $$ pcorrected_i = \frac{ph_{median}}{sd_j}(p_i-p_{median})+p_{median}, where \hspace{0.1cm} p_i \in ph_j $$ But I wonder if there might be a better method?
