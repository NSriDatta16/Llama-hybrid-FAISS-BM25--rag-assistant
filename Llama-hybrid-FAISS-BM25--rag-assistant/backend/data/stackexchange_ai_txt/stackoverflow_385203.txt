No PHP for large projects? Why not?

I've read a few posts where people have stated (not suggested, not discussed, not offered) that PHP should not be used for large projects. Being a primarily PHP developer, I ask two questions: What defines a "large project"? Why not? What are the pitfalls of using PHP I run a small development team and I know from experience the quality construction, organization, documentation, commenting and encapsulation are our highest priority. We are able to develop great projects using our own framework and approach but still, I don't want to invest further if I'm wasting my time. Thoughts?
