Does that mean that there is never really a way to retrieve a prespecified OR from a single simulated database? Yes, you will not be able to exactly identify the prespecified ORs that were used to simulate the data when you fit a logistic regression model because, as you say, the data is generating process you use includes randomness processes. As the sample size of your simulated data set increases, the fitted ORs (estimates of your prespecified ORs) will become closer to the prespecified ORs. The confidence intervals for or estimated ORs will show you how much uncertainty there is in the estimates.
