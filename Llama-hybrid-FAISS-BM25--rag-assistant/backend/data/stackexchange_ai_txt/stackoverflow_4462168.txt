Split a string based on each time a Deterministic Finite Automata reaches a final state?

I have a problem which has an solution that can be solved by iteration, but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution using regular expressions and split() I have a string (which excel is putting on the clipboard), which is, in essence, comma delimited. The caveat is that when the cell values contain a comma, the whole cell is surrounded with quotation marks (presumably to escape the commas within that string). An example string is as follows: 123,12,"12,345",834,54,"1,111","98,273","1,923,002",23,"1,243" Now, I want to elegantly split this string into individual cells, but the catch is I cannot use a normal split expression with comma as a delimiter, because it will divide cells that contain a comma in their value. Another way of looking at this problem, is that I can ONLY split on a comma if there is an EVEN number of quotation marks preceding the comma. This is easy to solve with a loop, but I'm wondering if there's a regular expression.split function capable of capturing this logic. In an attempt to solve this problem, I constructed the Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for the logic. The question now is reduced to the following: is there a way to split this string such that a new array element (corresponding to /s) is produced each time the final state (state 4 here) is reached in a DFA?
