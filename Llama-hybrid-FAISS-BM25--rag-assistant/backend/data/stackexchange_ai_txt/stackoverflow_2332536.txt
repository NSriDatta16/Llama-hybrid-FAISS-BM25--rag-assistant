Using timestamp type with pg_prepare

Running the following code: $preCallMatch = pg_prepare($dbcp, 'callMatch', "SELECT duration FROM voip_calls WHERE system_id = $1 AND call_start => $2 AND call_start I get the following error: Warning: pg_prepare(): Query failed: ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp without time zone => "unknown" HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument type(s). You may need to add explicit type casts. in /home/www/dinesh/UPSReconcileZeroSecondCalls.php on line 38 I have tried casting $2 in this manner with no luck: $preCallMatch = pg_prepare($dbcp, 'callMatch', "SELECT duration FROM voip_calls WHERE system_id = $1 AND call_start => CAST ( $2 AS TIMESTAMP ) AND call_start timestamp without time zone HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument type(s). You may need to add explicit type casts. in /home/www/dinesh/UPSReconcileZeroSecondCalls.php on line 38 Column types from voip_calls table: call_start | timestamp without time zone | call_end | timestamp without time zone | not null Any tips as to what I'm doing wrong? Note, PDO or MDPD aren't an option right now.
