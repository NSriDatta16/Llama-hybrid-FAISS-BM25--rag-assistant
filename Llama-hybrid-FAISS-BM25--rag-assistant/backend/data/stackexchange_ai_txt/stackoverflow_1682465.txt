If rebooting solved the issue that means your machine basically ran out of temp file storage space, your regular expressions and lot of tools that involve dynamic compilation (aspx etc), creates lot of temp files, and rebooting server or cleaning temp file should solve issue. .NET apps are little bad to run for long time, we had server issues when we were not restarting them for days... then as days pass by, the logs, the memory defragmentation etc goes bigger and bigger and i think that sometimes slows everything down. .NET apps usually dont remove locks on resources they opened, its not developer's fault but .net garbage collection isnt that smart, so your temp files may grow if files werent closed and deleted. Best is to do soft reboot on regular intervals like once a week on sunday night etc will help managing .net apps well.
