SOAP vs. REST: Pragmatic case studies?

I'm not satisfied with the answers given by the SOAP vs REST questions notably here: Performance of SOAP vs. XML-RPC or REST because it's just general philosophical answers and not pragmatic answers with some study cases. Nobody can give precise cases of when soap would be more suitable than rest, especially as for performance point of view ? Update:I think REST is winning the war.
