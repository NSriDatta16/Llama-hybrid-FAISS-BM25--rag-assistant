How to write a JavaScript plugin in the Pro/Ninja Way?

I don't need advice about the JavaScript code but about the files organization. I mean, I could write all my jedi code in a single .js file but I know it won't be the very best way to do it. So, this is a standard way to do this or it's all about free will? By the way, I'll host it in github, in case there's a thing as "the github way for organizing a JavaScript plugin files".
