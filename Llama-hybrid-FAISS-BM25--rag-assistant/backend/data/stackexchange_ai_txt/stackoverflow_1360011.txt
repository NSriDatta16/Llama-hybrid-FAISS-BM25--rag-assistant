Does it degrade performance to use subforms in MS Access?

I am considering the use of a tab control on a parent form for which I would like to have around 20 tabs. Each tab I am considering the use of one or two separate sub forms. Each sub form will have varied complexity in coded logic. By taking this approach will I severally reduce the performance of my application? I am currently using this in MS Access 2003. I will expect an average of 15 users at any given time on the various forms. Thoughts?
