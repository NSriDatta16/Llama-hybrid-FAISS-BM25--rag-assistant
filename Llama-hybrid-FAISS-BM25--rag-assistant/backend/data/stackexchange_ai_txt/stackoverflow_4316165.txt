Backwards-compatible solution for "rails/init.rb is deprecated"?

A Rails plugin I use ( google_analytics ) that was written for Rails 2.3 contains a file called rails/init.rb, which under Rails 3 yields the warning: DEPRECATION WARNING: Use toplevel init.rb; rails/init.rb is deprecated: /home/logankoester/hack/active/myapp/vendor/plugins/google_analytics/rails/init.rb. (called from at /home/logankoester/hack/active/myapp/config/environment.rb:5) Now, I could simply move the file in my fork, but I don't expect this would be backwards-compatible with Rails 2. Is there a solution to this change that would work for both versions, or will I have to maintain separate branches for each major version of Rails?
