Survival in two period game: mean of z|z<v with z=xy, x~U(a,b) and y~U(c,d)

I am looking for the functional form to describe the following: A random shock $x\sim Uniform(a,b)$ is multiplied with a second shock $y\sim Uniform(c,d)$. What is the mean value of all combined shocks $z=xy$ below a certain threshold $v$? Or to put it differently: $\mathbb{E}(z\vert z For concreteness let's assume the following values: $x\sim Uniform(0.5,1.5)$, $y\sim Uniform(0.4,1.6)$, and $v=0.7$. To give you some background why I am asking this, I am trying to model the following: In a two period game, each period a shock arrives and each period there is a cut off point determining who continues the game and who leaves (truncation). Those continuing receive the future shock (multiplication of distributions) and at the end we decide again how many are above and below the threshold. Now we want to know the average value of those who remain in the end (below threshold $v$). This question is closely related to: CDF of Z=XY with X~Uniform(0.5,1.5) and Y~Uniform(0.8,1.5) but for the truncation and the mean part. Any hints are welcome.
