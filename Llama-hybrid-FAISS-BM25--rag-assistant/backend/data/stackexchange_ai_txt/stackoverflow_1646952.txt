Code coverage using mono and nunit tests

I'm trying to test a file (Account.cs) using testfile (AccountTest.cs). I run OSX 10.6 with Mono Framework (and nunit-console). Below is Account.cs namespace bank { using System; public class InsufficientFundsException : ApplicationException { } public class Account { private float balance; public void Deposit(float amount) { balance+=amount; } public void Withdraw(float amount) { balance-=amount; } public void TransferFunds(Account destination, float amount) { destination.Deposit(amount); Withdraw(amount); } public float Balance { get { return balance;} } private float minimumBalance = 10.00F; public float MinimumBalance { get{ return minimumBalance;} } } } And here is AccountTest.cs: namespace bank { using NUnit.Framework; [TestFixture] public class AccountTest { [Test] public void TransferFunds() { Account source = new Account(); source.Deposit(200.00F); Account destination = new Account(); destination.Deposit(150.00F); source.TransferFunds(destination, 100.00F); Assert.AreEqual(250.00F, destination.Balance); Assert.AreEqual(100.00F, source.Balance); } [Test] [ExpectedException(typeof(InsufficientFundsException))] public void TransferWithInsufficientFunds() { Account source = new Account(); source.Deposit(200.00F); Account destination = new Account(); destination.Deposit(150.00F); source.TransferFunds(destination, 300.00F); } } } I compile these two files by: mcs -t:library Account.cs mcs -t:library -r:nunit.framework,Account.dll AccountTest.cs And get Account.dll and AccountTest.dll respectively. To run the test I use: nunit-console AccountTest.dll and it runs as it should, giving me the appropriate failures and passes. However, now I want to use mono's code coverage ability to asses these tests. I'm reading the tutorial http://mono-project.com/Code_Coverage to run the coverage tools. And to use it I would need to compile into *.exe file rather than *.dll file. If someone could help me with the main class of the AccountTest.cs file, I would be able to then compile it in exe and from there use the coverage tool. Thanks a tonne in advance.
