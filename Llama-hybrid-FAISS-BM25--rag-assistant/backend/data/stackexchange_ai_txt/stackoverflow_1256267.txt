This is an educated guess only, but I doubt that you can take the address of a register in C++ because such a think simply doesn't exist. C++ probably doesn't use a register in your particular case. Notice that the storage class qualifier register is only a hint to the compiler (and most if not all modern compilers happily ignore it completely).
