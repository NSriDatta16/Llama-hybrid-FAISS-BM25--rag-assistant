Log-log regression where variables are in terms of growth rate

I would like to estimate elasticity of exchange rate on export. The specification takes the following form: $$Exp=\alpha+\beta_0REER+\beta_1GDP^{p}+\epsilon$$ where, $Exp$ is export growth calculated as $100*r$ ( $r$ is growth rate), $REER$ is real effective exchange rate, $GDP^{p}$ is foreign GDP s growth rate (similar to export growth). In order to estimate elasticity of exchange rate on export is it correct to take log transformation of the export and GDP time series, if they are in terms of growth rate?
