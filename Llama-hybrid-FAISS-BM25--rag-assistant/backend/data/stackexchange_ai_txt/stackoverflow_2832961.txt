Is it possible to hide the dock icon programmatically

Is it possible to hide dock icon programmatically on demand. I know one way by which defining property "Application is agent (UIElement)" in plist we make the cocoa app as user agent. But this result in hiding the dock icon permanently. I am looking for a way where i can control visibility of dock icon. Any idea ?
