Yes, Matérn kernels are universal, for any parameters. First note that $M_{\sigma^2,\nu,\rho}(x, y) = \Psi(x - y)$, i.e. the kernel is translation-invariant . It is also bounded and continuous. The first main result we'll need is from: Sriperumbudur, Fukumizu, and Lanckiret. Universality, Characteristic Kernels and RKHS Embedding of Measures . JMLR 12(Jul):2389−2410, 2011. They show that the notion they call $cc$-universal is equivalent to the universality of Michhelli et al. (Remark 3). They also show that for bounded, continuous, translation-invariant kernels on $\mathbb R^d$, being characteristic implies being $cc$-universal (Figure 1 part 3). It was previously shown that bounded continuous translation-invariant kernels on $\mathbb R^d$ are characteristic if and only if the Fourier transform of $\Psi$, which we know to be a nonnegative measure from Bochner's theorem , has support on all of $\mathbb R^d$: Theorem 7 of Sriperumbudur, Gretton, Fukumizu, Lanckriet, and Schölkopf. Injective Hilbert Space Embeddings of Probability Measures . 21st Annual Conference on Learning Theory, 2008. But the Fourier transform of $\Psi$ for the Matérn kernel, from equation (4.15) of Rasmussen and Williams, Gaussian Processes in Machine Learning ( chapter 4 pdf ), is the density $$ S(s) = \sigma^2 \frac{2^d \pi^{d/2} \Gamma(\nu + d/2) (2 \nu)^\nu}{\Gamma(\nu) \rho^{2 \nu}} \left( \frac{2 \nu}{\rho^2} + 4 \pi^2 \lVert s \rVert^2 \right)^{-\nu + d/2} $$ where $d$ is the dimension. This of course has support on all of $\mathbb R^d$, so the Matérn kernel is characterestic, so it's $cc$-universal.
