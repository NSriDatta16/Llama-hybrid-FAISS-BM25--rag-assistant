This is an open problem in psychology/psychometrics. There are a number of methods commonly used. Two that I have found useful are parallel analysis and the minimum avaerage partial criterion. Both of these are implemented in the psych package for R. Typically, the MAP criterion suggests less factors (say $l$) than does parallel analysis $m$. In that case, I typically use all the solutions between $l$ and $m$ factors. If you were willing to carry out a cross validation process, you could also investigate structural equation modelling, which is implemented in the packages lavaan , sem and OpenMx .
