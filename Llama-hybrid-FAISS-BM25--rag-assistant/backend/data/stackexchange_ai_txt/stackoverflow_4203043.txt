Define a function that will be implemented by the user

I have the following example code var object = { userDefinedFunction : function(){ //no implementation, this will be defined by the user } } What i want to achieve is the user giving his own implementation of it: object.userDefinedFunction = function(){ alert("just testing"); } I tested this and works as i expected, what i want to know is: is this the javascript way of solving this kind of problem? let's say that it's mandatory that userDefinedFunction is implemented, how do i make sure of this? I could rely on something like the following, checking for implemented , but i'm learning javascript so i want to know how to leverage the language: userDefinedFunction : function(){ implemented = false; } Thank you.
