I like: Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data (Klein & Moeschberger) Modeling Survival Data: Extending the Cox Model (Therneau) The first does a good job of straddling theory and model building issues. It's mostly focused on semi-parametric techniques, but there is reasonable coverage of parametric methods. It doesn't really provide any R or other code examples, if that's what you're after. The second is heavy with modeling on the Cox PH side (as the title might indicate). It's by the author of the survival package in R and there are plenty of R examples and mini-case studies. I think both books complement each other, but I'd recommend the first for getting started. A quick way to get started in R is David Diez's guide .
