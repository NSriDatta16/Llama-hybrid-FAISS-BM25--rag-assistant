JavaBeans Classes in Separate JAR Files

Is it possible to build classes for a JavaBean in separate JAR files? Specifically- a JavaBean has the Bean and BeanInfo classes in one JAR file and the Custom Property Editor class inn a different JAR, the JAR file with the Bean and BeanInfo classes has the JAR file with the Custom Property Editor class on the classpath, but during drag and drop of the JavaBean in an IDE, a class not found exception is thrown for the Custom Property Editor class. Are all classes for a given JavaBean required to be built into the same JAR file?
