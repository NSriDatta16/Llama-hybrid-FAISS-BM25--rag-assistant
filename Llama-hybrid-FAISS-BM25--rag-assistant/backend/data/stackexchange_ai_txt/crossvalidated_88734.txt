Seeking a Theoretical Understanding of Firth Logistic Regression

I am trying to understand Firth logistic regression (method of handling perfect/complete or quasi-complete separation in logistic regression) so I can explain it to others in simplified terms. Does anyone have a dummied-down explanation of what modification Firth estimation is making to MLE? I have read, as best I could, Firth (1993) and I understand a correction is being applied to the score function. I am fuzzy on the origin and justification of the correction and what role the score function plays in MLE. Sorry if this is rudimentary knowledge. The literature I've reviewed seems to require a much deeper understanding of MLE than I possess.
