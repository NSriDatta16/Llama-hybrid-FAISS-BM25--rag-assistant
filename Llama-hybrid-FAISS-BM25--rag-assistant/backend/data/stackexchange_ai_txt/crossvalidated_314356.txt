Fundamentally it depends on the design of your survey. Most official surveys are stratified probability samples, where every unit selected in each stratum had a known probability of being selected, and was selected independently of other strata (conditional on the sample design). Under this design-based paradigm, your samples are "representative" (in the sense that the weighted average of the sample is a unbiased estimate of the population mean) on the stratum level, and the national estimate is created by summing the estimates made on the stratum level. If you aren't using a stratified probability design, then it depends on the design you do have whether it makes sense.
