Meaning of Bagged Random Forests?

I'm reading a paper that says that the authors used "bagged random forests". I couldn't understand this because as far as I know a random forest is a kind of bagging on its own. So a random forest is a bag of trees. But a bagged random forest?! Would that mean a bag of random forests with each random forest having 10 or 100 trees?! This is the paper: http://users.cs.fiu.edu/~lzhen001/activities/KDD_USB_key_2010/docs/p243.pdf Also
