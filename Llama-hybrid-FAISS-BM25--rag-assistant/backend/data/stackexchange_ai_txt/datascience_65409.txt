Is it reasonable that a problem "solved" by a traditional ANN can also be solved by a CNN?

There is a data science numerical problem, which me and my team were able to get an ANN model that predicts down to a 1% MAPE error (with roughly 70000+ trainable parameters). Given the nature of the dataset, this data can also be processed as images, which has led me to trying a CNN based approach to solve the same. As of now, I'm able to converge to error figures of 14% with around 2000 parameters. Is it reasonable to assume that I'd be able to bring down the error even further with a CNN based architecture (without a significant increase in the parameters)? EDIT: Basically, what I mean by image is, in the ANN case, the data is being processed as a 1D vector, but as a 2D vector in the CNN case.
