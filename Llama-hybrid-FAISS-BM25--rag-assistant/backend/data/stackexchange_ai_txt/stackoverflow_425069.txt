Keep in mind if you ask for a larger time estimate but make it under time, it looks way better than under estimating and having to ask for an extension. I would try to mock a prototype so that you have a better idea of the time it will take. Be honest with your management so they can budget for unexpected delays in the learning curve. EDIT: You might also see if you can get a more "iterative" deadline. In "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning", Andy Hunt makes a good point that people are project experts closer to the end of the project and least knowledgeable at the very beginning. It doesn't make much sense to do all of your design and time estimation at the very beginning when everyone is the least knowledgeable about the project. If you "iterate" the deadlines and solve the problem in chunks, you will have more success.
