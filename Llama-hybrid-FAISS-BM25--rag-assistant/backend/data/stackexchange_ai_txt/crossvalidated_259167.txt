Zero-inflation with binomial data?

So I have a presence/absence (1/0) dataset and right now I am trying to find out which model to use. My data looks like this: Dependent var: presence/absence (95% zero's) Independent var: month (1:12), hour (0-23), location and individual (random in mixed model). Since the data consists for approx. 95% of zeros, I started to wonder if there is something like 'zero-inflation' in logistic regression?
