How to add javascript to page on login and logout in Drupal 6

I'm working on a module and am trying to add some javascript to the next page a user sees after logging in or out. Calling drupal_add_js() on hook_user (op == login) doesn't seem to work; I'm assuming this is because drupal_goto is called after the login is completed and a fresh page request is initiated. I've considered using hook_user to set session variables which I can then respond to on the next page load but that seems somewhat fragile. Any suggestions?
