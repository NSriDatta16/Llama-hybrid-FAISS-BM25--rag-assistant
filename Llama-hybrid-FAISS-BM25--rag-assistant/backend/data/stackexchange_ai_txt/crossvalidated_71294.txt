This is an interesting question (+1). It's strange that you have gotten no attention. I'm no bootstrapping expert, but I think the answer is to go back to the principles of bootstrapping. What you are supposed to do on each bootstrap replication is 1) draw a bootstrap sample in a way which imitates (in a way which preserves independence) the way you drew the original sample, then 2) do to that bootstrap sample whatever your estimation technique calls for, then 3) record the outcome of the estimation. To answer the question, I think you need to think carefully about how the original sample was collected (so that your bootstrapping properly imitates it). Also, you need to think about what your estimation technique really was/is. Suppose you were collecting your original data. Suppose you came to the end of the data collection. Suppose you notice that you only have two females. What would you have done? If the answer to this question is "I would have thrown away my entire dataset and done the whole data collection process again," then your bootstrapping procedure is exactly right. I doubt that this is what you would have done, however. And this is the answer to your question. This is why what you are doing is wrong. Maybe you would have continued collecting more data until you had eight females. If so, then imitate that in the the bootstrap sampling step (1). Maybe you would have decided that two females is too few females and you would have dropped all females from the analysis. If so, then imitate that in the bootstrap estimation step (2). Another way to say this is that you should think about what question you want the boostrapping procedure to answer. If you want to answer the question "How often would the confidence intervals cover the true parameter value if I did the experiment over and over, mindlessly running the exact same regression each time without any attention to what the sample looked like," then just mindlessly bootstrap like your colleague is telling you to. If you want to answer the question "How often would the confidence intervals cover the true parameter value if I did the experiment over and over, analyzing the data the way Max Gordon would analyze it," then do what I suggested. If you want to get this work published, do the conventional thing: the thing your colleague is suggesting that you do. Well, unless you can find a paper in Biometrika which agrees with what I say above. I don't know the relevant literature, unfortunately, so I can't help you with that.
