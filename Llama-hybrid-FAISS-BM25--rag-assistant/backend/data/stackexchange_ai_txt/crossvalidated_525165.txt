MCMC: sampling or optimization?

I need a conceptual clarification on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). I have read that MCMC is used to sample from a posterior distribution when the shape of the likelihood distribution $p(x | \theta)$ can be roughly estimated. However, the applications I have seen so far are used to find the parameters that better describe this likelihood distribution by an iterative stochastic process. According to this, we iteratively propose parameters that are accepted if a specific requirement is met, e.g. the ratio between the unnormalized posterior distribution given the proposed parameters $p(\theta' | x)$ and the posterior given the current parameter $p(\theta' | x)$ exceeds a certain threshold (this is the Metropolis algorithm). If what I am saying is correct, we are not trying to sample from the posterior, but we are trying to optimize the underlying distribution that could have generated the data. What am I missing?
