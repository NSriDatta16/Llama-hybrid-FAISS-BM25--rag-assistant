I don't see anything particularly wrong with your solution. That being said, the simplest LINQ procedure would seem to be: foreach(var entry in enumerable1.SelectMany( e => enumerable2.Select(e2 => new { First = e, Second = e2 }))) { DoSomething(entry.First, entry.Second); } Given that it's a little...obtuse...I would recommend sticking with the two foreach operations. That's less expensive than all of the shenanigans that the C# compiler is going to go through in order to make that expression work (since we're dealing both with closures and anonymous types).
