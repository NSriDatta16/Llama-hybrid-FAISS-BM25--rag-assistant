Replacing McNemar test with regression?

Would it be possible to replace the McNemar test with regression? What would be the regression formula? What type of regression should be used (logistic?, some survival?)? Let's have a made-up example with one/matched/paired study population. In the example, the pre-intervention male proportion is 50% and that dropped to 40% after the intervention. Thus, there was a drop of 10 percentage points . Woult it be correct to use logistic regression with logit-link for analysis? Y variable would be "Sex-Changed" and intercept-only model will be run? Sex-Changed ~ 1
