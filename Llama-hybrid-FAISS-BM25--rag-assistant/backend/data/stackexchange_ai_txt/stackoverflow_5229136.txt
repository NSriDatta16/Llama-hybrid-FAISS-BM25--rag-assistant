Based on your comments, my recommendation is to do the following: Use a regular integer auto_increment column as the primary key for the row, and then have a column of type varchar or one of the *text types (depending on your mysql server version and data storage requirements) to store your "identifier" that the customer uses. The identifier can be auto-generated using a trigger. If you're going to do lookups based on the identifier (i.e. perhaps the user enters an identifier to "jump to" a record) you will want an index on that column.
