I know this is already answered, but I ran across a similar problem and ended up with something along the lines of: require('child_process').spawn('cp', ['-r', source, destination]) What this does is call the command cp ("copy"). Since we're stepping outside of Node.js, this command needs to be supported by your system. I know it's not the most elegant, but it did what I needed :)
