I want to start studying the field of machine translation

I've studied Japanese language and literature and passed some linguistic courses and now as for my masters, I want to study natural language processing and especially machine translation. so I tried taking some data science courses online and I'm now a little bit familiar with data science but I know literally nothing about machine translation. so, long story short, I need to write a proposal in the machine translation field (university requirements) but I don't know where to start reading about machine translation. I tried to read some essays but the level was too high for me, I didn't understand a single thing. I'd be so thankful if you could guide me through this journey. thank you ^__^
