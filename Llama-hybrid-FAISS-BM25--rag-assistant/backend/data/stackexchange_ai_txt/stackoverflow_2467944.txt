Google's documentation seems to indicate that both 302 and 307 are treated equivalently, and that "Googlebot will continue to crawl and index the original location." But in the face of ambiguity, you might as well dig into the RFCs and try to do the Right Thing, with the naïve hope that the crawlers will do the same. In this case, RFC 2616 § 10.3 contains nearly identical definitions for each response code, with one exception: 302: Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. 307: Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. Which does not strike me as a significant distinction. My reading is that 302 instructs clients that webmasters are untrustworthy, and 307 explicitly tells webmasters that clients will not trust them, so they may freely alter the redirect. I think the more telling point is the note in 302's definition: Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request. However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client. Which, to me, indicates that 302 and 307 are largely equivalent, but that HTTP/1.0 clients failed to implement 302 correctly the first time around.
