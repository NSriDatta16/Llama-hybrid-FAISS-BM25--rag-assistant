Why is the bias neuron in neural network always initialised to 1?

I'm just starting with neural networks wherein this towards data science article mentions that bias neuron is always initialized to 1. My question is why is the bias neuron in Neural networks is always initialized to 1 ? Can we initialize it to other positive and negative values say 2 or 3 or maybe 100 or -200 ? How will the output and training of the neural network get affected if we initialize with other values apart from 1
