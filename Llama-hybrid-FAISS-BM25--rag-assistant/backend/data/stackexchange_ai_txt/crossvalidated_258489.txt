How good are the probabilities produced from Random Forest models?

As far as I know, for classification problems, there's generally a lack of a measure of probabilities in machine learning models, unless a customized probability structure is designed. Random forest, however, has a unique way of estimating probabilities, by counting the number of times a specific class is voted by trees, which I think is a byproduct of the model. Here, my questions are how good these probabilities are and how much I can trust these probabilities, in places like betting, where the probabilities play an important role. Thanks.
