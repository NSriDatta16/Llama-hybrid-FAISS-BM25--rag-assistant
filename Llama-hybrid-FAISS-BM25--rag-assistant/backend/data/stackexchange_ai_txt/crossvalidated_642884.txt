Which models are available to estimate relative life expectancy (in years, not in hazard ratios)?

I have a well-phenotyped survival dataset (i.e. it has a high number of relevant covariates for a study of mortality) for which I estimate how certain conditions influence life expectancy (LE). It would be much more informative to compute this in lost or gained years of life rather than stating a hazard ratio from a Cox model. I wonder what people thoughts or experience are on comparing easily available median life expectancy from Cox model instead of LE fitting parametric survival model within PH assumption (Weibull or Coxâ€“Gompertz model as in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668720300500#fig1 ) and computing LEs using Aalen's additive hazard model Anyone tried any machine learning for that? It seems many deep learning are still with Cox-PH at its heart as FastCPH. And survival random forest is predicting from Kaplan-Meier in the final leaves so again median will be estimated better than anything extrapolated) Some other option? Similar questions were asked before, What is the minimum information required to calculate life expectancy from a cox regression model? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28491796/how-to-predict-survival-time-in-coxs-regression-model-in-r , which are mostly about getting life expectancy from Cox-PH with the advice of taking the 1st or the 2nd option, so I am mostly curious of other non-Cox model options.
