Two datagridviews in one windows form = not possible to save data to the second datagridview

I create a winform I´m adding a datagridview by dragging a table from data sources the result: I´ve got a winform with a datagridview and a bindingnavigator I´m adding a second datagridview to the same winform by dragging another table from data sources the result: same as bullet 3, but now with two datagridviews; a second bindingnavigator is not added though, don´t ask me why! I copy the existing bindingnavigator and a adapts the copy to the second datagridview I look into the .Designer.cs file, and it looks perfect regarding consistency Now to the problem - even though both datagridviews have their own BindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click method, with code pointing out their respective bindingsources... it´s not possible to save changes from the second datagridview to the database! Anyone seen this? Any suggestions what to do?
