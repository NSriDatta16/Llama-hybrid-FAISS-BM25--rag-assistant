Ah I see, the culprit seems to be what you pointed out: "It is because the other div that I am resizing has the property margin:0 auto " Having 0 auto means the left, right margin is automatically adjusted to balance out which will centralise the div element. I do not think you want to resize in that manner as the position of the div moves while you are resizing in order to stay centered. My suggestion, remove the auto setting for your margin. Update: I ran this in firebug at the resizble demo page : $("#resizable").css("margin","0 auto"); to center the box using auto margin Here's a screenshot of what I've got: The resizing cursor moved away from the box's corner the more you drag away from the orginal size. However it still work though the 'experience' feels odd.
