What does this mean "the standard deviation of a proportion is a function of the proportion itself"?

I was studying calculating power and sample sizes and i came across this paragraph: Calculating Power for comparing two proportions has the same idea as with comparing means, except that no standard deviation estimate is necessary (as the standard deviation of a proportion is a function of the proportion itself) what does the sentence between the parenthesis mean?
