As Storey's q-values are estimates of the pFDR, with the Bayesian interpretation of "the probability of the null given the data", my guess is that the estimated alternative distribution has high variance so that almost all values away from the null have similar pFDR. Are your pvalues very spread except for a concentration near 0?
