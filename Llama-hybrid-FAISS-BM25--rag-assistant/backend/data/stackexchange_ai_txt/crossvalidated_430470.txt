You can use a logistic regression with the predictor age represented as a spline function. The simplest way is to use a regression spline, then you fix the amount of smoothing beforehand, most conveniently by specifying an equivalent degrees of freedom (edf). In R something like: library(splines) mod0 If you want to let the data determine the degree of smoothing, you can use a gam (generalized additive model), in R maybe: mod1 Also search this site for similar questions.
