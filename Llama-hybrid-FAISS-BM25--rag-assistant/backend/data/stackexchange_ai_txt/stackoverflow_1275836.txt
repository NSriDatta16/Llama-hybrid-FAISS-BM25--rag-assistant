Different css rendering for span inside td with FF3.5 versus FF3.0

I have a web page that has a table and inside one of the td is span that uses a smaller font, float right to place it to the far right, and a negative margin-top, so it is aligned with larger text in the td. With Firefox 3.0 it works fine, but I just updated to Firefox 3.5 and the margin is moving the text up too far. I have another page, where there are two span entries, again the second with a smaller font and negative margin and shows the same issue. On a third page, with a h3 followed by a span, a smaller font and negative margin, it works fine in Firefox 3.5. I installed Safari today and it acts the same as Firefox 3.5. I don't have an issue with IE, as I have conditional CSS to handle the different IE versions (IE 7 uses a negative margin, but IE 8 uses a small positive margin). Questions (finally :^): Is anyone aware of changes in rendering for span and negative margins for Firefox 3.5? How else could I write the HTML or CSS, to obtain the same result w/o browser specific hacks? For the second case, I changed it from two spans, to an h3 and span, like the third case. The first case really is tabular data, so I'm using the table. Here's a fragment of the issue: August 2009 (go to top) A table row The pertinent (I hope) CSS is: div#content { margin: 0; padding: 0 width:100%; background: white; color: black; font-size: 80%; } #events2 td { padding: 4px; border-bottom: 2px solid #BBB; } #events2 tr.month td { padding: 0.125em 0; font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; border-top: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 2px solid #BBB; } #events2 tr.month td .gotop { float: right; font-size: 0.6em; margin-top: -1.4em; padding-bottom: 0.3em; } Thanks in advance!
