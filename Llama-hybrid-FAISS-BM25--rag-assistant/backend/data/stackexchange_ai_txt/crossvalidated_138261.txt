PCA has more than one use. One reason to use it is to construct measurement scales, and you want those scales to be distinct, and have their own items. Items which load on more than one factor are kind of weird and confusing, so you don't want them. That's why people take them out. Imagine I've developed a test, I'd say "Questions 1 to 9 measure language ability, questions 11 through 20 measure math ability, and question 10 measures both". That seems weird, so I take out Question 10.
