What is the name of this technique to deal with outliers?

I've been exploring techniques to deal with outliers that may apply to my machine learning use case and have stumbled upon this short video from Udacity . In summary: Train your machine learning model. Remove X% of points with largest residual error. Re-train model. It seems as though it could apply to my use case, but of course more research into this technique and its pros, cons, consequences, assumptions, etc. are necessary. As such I tried to search for it, but didn't get far; hence me asking this question here. What is the name of this technique to deal with outliers? The little I know: It's referred to as "Outlier - Rejection" in the video (@0:46): So congratulations, you know about outlier rejection... I found this blog post which appears to be by the same person who narrated in that short video. Here it's instead named "Outlier Detection". Further searches for both of these terms were too general, i.e. providing definitions for outlier/anomaly detection.
