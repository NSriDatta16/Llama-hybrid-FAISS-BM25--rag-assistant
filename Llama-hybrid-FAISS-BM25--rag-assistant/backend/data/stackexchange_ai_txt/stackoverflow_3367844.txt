I would suggest you edit your code as below. This will not make the program run longer, but you will know why it is crashing. Only then can you fix the problem. Is this homework? static boolean start() { Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in); int id; try{ id = cin.nextInt(); doStuff( id ); return true; }catch (Exception e){ //which would trap all recoverable exceptions System.out.println("Something is wrong. Try again."); return false; }catch(Throwable e){ // Add this. System . err . println ( e ) ; // come back to SO with this e . printStackTrace ( ) ; // come back to SO with this System . exit ( 1 ) ; } } public static void main(String ... args){ boolean first = true; while(true) { if(first) showDilbert(); first = start(); } }
