For some of these parameters you can simply reason about what the range should be. For example, since the sparsity parameter is the desired average activation of the hidden units, this will only make sense if it is in $(0, 1)$, assuming you're using a sigmoid activation. However, you can still narrow this down farther as a sparsity $> 0.5$ is somewhat nonsensical. For other parameters your can look for the values people commonly report in the literature, use this as a rough guess, and expand your ranges if you find it necessary. For example I would probably start with $(0, 0.2)$ for the learning rate. Another useful place to look would be Geoff Hinton's practical guide to training restricted Boltzmann machines . I imagine most of this advice would be applicable for autoencoders as well.
