What should the view file/directory structure be in ASP.NET MVC?

I'm confused with how views are organized, and it is important to understand this as ASP.NET MVC uses conventions to get everything working right. Under the views directory, there are subdirectories. Inside these subdirectories are views. I'm assuming that the subdirectories map to controllers, and the controllers act on the views contained within their subdirectories. Is there an emerging expectation of what types of views are contained within these directories? For instance, should the default page for each directory be index.aspx? Should the pages follow a naming convention such as Create[controller].aspx, List[controller].aspx, etc? Or does it not matter?
