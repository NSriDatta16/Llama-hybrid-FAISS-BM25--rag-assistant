Visual Studio cannot consume Web Service containing UsernameToken policy

I am getting errors when trying to add a reference to a Web Service in Visual Studio 2010. The Web Service is implemented in Java using the JAX-WS/Metro/GlassFish stack and contains a UsernameToken policy. Here's an excerpt from the WSDL: When I try to add a service reference to this web service in Visual Studio, I get the following warnings: Custom tool warning: The following Policy Assertions were not Imported: XPath://wsdl:definitions[@targetNamespace='http://archfirst.org/bfoms/tradingservice.wsdl']/wsdl:binding[@name='TradingWebServicePortBinding'] Assertions: .. Custom tool warning: Endpoint 'TradingWebServicePort' at address 'http://localhost:8080/bfoms-javaee/TradingService' is not compatible with Silverlight 4. Skipping... Custom tool warning: No endpoints compatible with Silverlight 4 were found. The generated client class will not be usable unless endpoint information is provided via the constructor. Why is Visual Studio not able to import the assertion? P.S. I was able to import and test the web service using the SoapUI tool.
