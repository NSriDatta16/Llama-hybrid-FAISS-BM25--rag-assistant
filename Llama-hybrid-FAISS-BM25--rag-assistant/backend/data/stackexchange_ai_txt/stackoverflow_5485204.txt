BLUR a div background with opacity (page background seems blurred through div)

My plan is to take the Windows 7 UI, and recreate it using CSS3. I've already done it with the 98 theme, but I want to be able to change stylesheets. The problem arises when I need to blur the background image with low opacity. Is this even possible? Seen below: It's hard to explain, but I'm going to give it some minimal capabilities (draggable, resizeable etc) So I can't do the two background hack. Is this possible with jQuery or something similar? http://jsfiddle.net/BeauAugust/AZRHC/ an example
