Assuming it's for a paragraph (but if not, just change the selector): p { font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; /* as opposed to 'italic' or 'oblique' */ font-weight: bold; /* or 700, or 900 */ font-size: 17px; /* consider using relative sizing, for example with 'em' units */ line-height: 20px; /* or as appropriate */ } As @Joel notes, in the comments, there is a (potentially vast) difference between pt and px . It's worth noting also that pt is more applicable to the print, rather than screen 'digital' medium.
