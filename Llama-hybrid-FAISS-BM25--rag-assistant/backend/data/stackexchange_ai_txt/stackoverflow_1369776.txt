comparion/performance of database field as int vs char(1)

does one perform better over the other in terms of indexing/quering etc ? e.g. declaring a column as active Char(1) with 'Y' / 'N' values vs is_active tinyint with values 1 / 0 Anecdotally speaking most places it seems people prefer to use char(1) whereas my tendency is to declare them as tinyint/int not the least because it's easy to use/type Any real performance comparisons out there ? I recall something like a binary value index in oracle ( bitmapped index or some such ) - is there something similar in sql2005/sql2008/...? UPDATE - in response to some of the comments below, performance would be defined in terms of index query / updates, storage is irrelevant considering it's cheap enough semantics too are not relevant !
