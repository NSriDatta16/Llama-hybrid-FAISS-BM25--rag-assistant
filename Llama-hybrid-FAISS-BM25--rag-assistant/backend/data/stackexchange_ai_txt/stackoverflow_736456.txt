first chance exception: system error 8: not enough storage space to perform the command

how do i debug something like this? i need the debugger to stop and show me where the problem is. don't just show it in the event log & then hang. first chance exception: system error 8: not enough storage space to perform the command i'm using delphi 2009. the problem doesn't happen regulary. i'm not eager to pepper my program with OutputDebugString calls to track this down! thank you for your help!
