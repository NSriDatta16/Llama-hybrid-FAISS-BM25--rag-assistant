Calling a working storage variable, containing a program name, does not make a DYNAMIC call. Yes it does. Call variablename is always DYNAMIC. Call 'literal' is dynamic or static according to the DYNAM/NODYNAM compiler option. Caveat: This applies for IBM mainframe COBOL and I believe it is also part of the standard. It may not apply to other non-standard versions of COBOL.
