Does this pdf (derived from fitted logistic regression line) have a named distribution?

Consider the probability density function: $$ f(x) = \frac{\beta_1*exp(\beta_0+x\beta_1)}{(exp(\beta_0+x\beta_1) + 1)^2} $$ This is a valid pdf for any $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1 > 0$ when x has support on the whole number line. My question is, is this a named distribution (possible reparameterized) who's properties have already been derived? If it helps: $$ E[X] = -\frac{\beta_0}{\beta_1} $$ It's also a symmetric distribution with fat tails (fatter than the normal). My derivation of this distribution was considering a logistic regression of a single variable (e.g. time to death) on survival probability. If $\beta_1$ is positive, than the fitted logistic regression curve has all the properties of a CDF, with the above pdf being the derivative of the fitted line. It seems to me that knowing the properties of this distribution would help us understand the implication of logistic regression better (specifically the 'linear on the logit scale' assumption).
