As already pointed out by the first comment, data science is a very broad field and not sharply defined. But I think since you like to get started with data science and you're looking for resources, I share some of my recommendations with you (in no particular order). Very applied, less academical, with lots of code examples: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron The Deep learning bible, more academical, great overview: Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville A classic for Machine learning, covers a lot of topics, very educational with great explanations: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop If you're more into statistics: An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R by James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy The classic RL reference: Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton & Andrew G. Barto This is only a partial list focusing more on theory and classic data science algorithms. Keep in mind there are many many more books, e.g. I didn't mentioned any resources for Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Mining etc. whatever one would throw into the data science bucket. Further it's possible that this list might be outdated in a few years.
