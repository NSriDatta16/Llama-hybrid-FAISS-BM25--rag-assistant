The statement $\sum_{k=1}^n H(B_k) = 1$ is true because the base distribution $H$ is a probability distribution and so its sum over all realizations must be equal to one. Since this isn't a very satisfying answer, let's look at the definition of the DP from that Wikipedia page. The formal definition is: $(X(B_1),...,X(B_n)) \sim Dir((\alpha H(B_1),...,\alpha H(B_n))$ Now, if we look at another definition of the Dirichlet distribution referenced in the $Dir$ above at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution , we see that the function's argument is a vector of positive values $ \alpha_1,...\alpha_k$. We can sum that up into a scalar concentration parameter $\alpha$ and the vector of probabilities $H$ such that $\alpha\sum_k^K(H_k) = \sum_k^K \alpha_kJ_k$, where $J$ is some other probability distribution which is being modified by those $\alpha$ coefficients Sorry for double dipping on $\alpha$ here; the two wikipedia pages have two slightly different meanings of that symbol (vector versus scalar). One way to understand the Dirichlet process is the 'stick breaking' construction. I encourage you to read about that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_process#The_stick-breaking_process . In this representation, if the sum of $H$ exceeds 1, then the DP would be trying to 'break off' parts of the stick which we didn't have to begin with. In short, it is true because we defined $H$ to be a base probability distribution which is then rescaled using the concentration parameter which can be either a scalar for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution or a vector for a nonsymmetric one.
