This sounds extremely familiar to an issue I chased for a while with Delphi. I asked the question on SO some while back. I tracked it down at least partially to threadvar (thread local storage) memory that is not freed. I believe that C++Builder uses the same VCL components as Delphi, so it could be the same issue. Unfortunately, I did not find any satisfactory solution other than to not unload the DLL if it was ever going to be loaded again in the future.
