Saving In Magento Taking A Very Very Long Time

In Magento I write a number of small command line scripts to do things like set a new attribute on a number of products. I am finding that the time it takes to update 900 products takes about 6 hours to complete. The time it takes to load the individual products goes as fast as I would except, but the act of saving once I have made the change takes a very long time. I am attaching how I am loading the products in case there is something I can do to better optimize the process. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($magento_id); $product->setMadeInUsa(1); try { $product->save(); } catch(Exception $e) { echo "ERROR: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n"; } The code runs without error, but it takes forever.
