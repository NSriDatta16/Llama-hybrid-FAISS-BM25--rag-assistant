Penalization 'Best Practice'

Let's take the case of a logistic regression with $n$ observations and $p$ variables. From what I have understood, penalization (Lasso or Elastic Net) is really good for selecting the variables when done with the optimal parameter(s) which is/are determined with cross validation. My question is: Should I use the model obtained with the optimal penalization (i.e: the model that takes $x$, the $p$ initial variables which maximize $L(x,y)-\lambda_{1}\|x\|_{1}$ ) ? Or should I select first $\tilde x$ the $\tilde p$ variables that have non-null coefficients in the penalized model and run a standard logistic regression on it? The last model will have a better likelihood than the first one, obviously; but is it valid to do it that way?
