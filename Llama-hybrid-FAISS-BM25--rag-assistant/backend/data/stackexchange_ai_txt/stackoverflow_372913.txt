.h and .cpp files often separate declarations from definitions, and there is some kind of order here, and conceptual encapsulation. headers have the 'what', implementation files have the 'how'. I find having everything in one file in java to be disorganized. So, each to their own. C++ conventions and idioms all have well thought out reasoning, just like any other language does for the idioms its community adopts. I think it's best to java (as a verb) when you write Java, and to C++ when you C++! You'll appreciate why with experience of the language. Same as switching to any new language.
