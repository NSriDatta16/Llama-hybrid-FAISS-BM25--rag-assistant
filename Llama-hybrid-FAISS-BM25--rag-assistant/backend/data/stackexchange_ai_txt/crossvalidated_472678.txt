@gunes has a very good answer: degree is for poly, and rbf is controlled by gamma and C. In general, it is not surprising to see the default parameter does not work well. See RBF SVM parameters If you change your code model_2 = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma=1000, C=100) You will see 100% on training but 56% on testing. The reason is As @gunes mentioned the pre-processing changed the data. this also tells us RBF kernel is pretty powerful that can overfit training data pretty well.
