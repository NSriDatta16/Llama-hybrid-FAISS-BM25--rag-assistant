JavaScript integration testing in Ruby on Rails

I've searched a bit for this and tried to implement a self-made solution but so far haven't found to be confident with it. What I need is to write integration tests in Ruby on Rails which interact with JavaScript and get programmatic ways to assert some behaviors. I'm using Test::Unit for the controller/models part but I'm struggling to test some jQuery/JavaScript behaviors used by my app. Mainly it consists in ajax calls and interactions in the UI which updates some sets of information. I haven't found a solution which makes me confident and which integrates nicely with autotest and the whole red-green process, so for now most parts of my client-side code is untested and that's making me nervous (as it should be :P). So, does anyone have suggestions for best practices on this issue? Unit testing JS is a bit tricky, as Crockford points out, because it dependes heavily on the current state of the UI and etc and as AFAIK even he hasn't found a good way to implement decent testing... Shortly: I need to implement tests for some UI behavior which depends on Ajax, integrating with autotest or some other CI tool and haven't found a good and elegant way to do it. Thanks all for the attention, Best Regards
