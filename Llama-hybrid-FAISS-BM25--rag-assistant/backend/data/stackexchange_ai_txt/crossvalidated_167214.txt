One thing is that the data entering into the PCA should typically be standardized (zero mean, unit standard deviation) or else different scaling among variables might greatly influence your results. And you should make sure that your data are reliable, as in any type of analysis. This seems obvious, but is too often overlooked. (It's not unusual to spend as much or more time doing quality control on data as on the analyses per se.) Beyond that, think about what any linear modeling is trying to accomplish: fit a reasonable first-order approximation to the relation of your dependent variable to your independent variables. Any pre-PCA data transformation (or before any linear model) should be done with that in mind. As an example, for necessarily positive data with skew, a log transform prior to analysis often will provide a better model. Such transformations and other pre-processing should be done with that goal in mind, informed by your understanding of the subject matter. For the purposes you have in mind, don't be afraid to try different pre-processing approaches. Ultimately, the test will be whether your prediction/classification models work adequately.
