Differences in font size between resolutions

I developed my app on 240 hdpi WVGA800. The textsize on some of my buttons were much too small, so I had to change them to 50sp. It looks good on what I developed it on but when testing on 120 ldpi QVGA and 160 mdpi HVGA, the text is slightly cut off. Also, when testing on 3.0, the text is much too small. How do you handle this? Edit: It actually only appears to be an issue in 1 layout. The layout has nested linearlayouts, with weight=1 so that every row is equal size and fills the screen. The layout_weight for LinearLayout so it stretches to fit the screen vertically. And for each button so they stretch to fill the screen horizontally.
