Jacob Cohen established thresholds for some standardized effect sizes, to which he attached the adjectives small/medium/large. However, to the best of my knowledge, he never suggested that any of these values should be considered as "sufficient" in general. In fact, in his book about power analysis (1988), he advised to avoid as much as possible using these thresholds, and repeatedly said that context should always take precedence to judge the practical relevance of an effect size. In your case, you may want to present a rationale to the reviewer as to why you consider the effect size as important (or not) in the context of your study. For example, consider a study about an intervention meant to increase people's income. After conducting the study, we observe that the intervention increases people's income by \$50 per month on average, compared to the control group, who experiences no increase. Is this effect size of +50 "sufficiently large"? It depends on the cost of the intervention, on the original income of these people, on whether alternative interventions in other studies lead to a larger or smaller increase, possibly on how this average increase is distributed among people, etc. In short, you have to relate this effect size to the goal of your study, to say if it is "sufficiently large" or not. If you have really no idea if a given effect size is relevant or not because the context of your study does not lend itself to this kind of considerations, I think that using adjectives like "small", "medium", or "large" in a way completely decoupled from context is more confusing, than simply reporting the value of the effect size. However, if the reviewer expect from you to mention Cohen's thresholds, then you could say something along the lines of " This effect size of 0.02 is in line with the definition of 'small' as defined by Cohen (1988) " and add a clear caveat as to the arbitrariness of these thresholds, to incite readers to judge the situation for themselves (you can find some references about that here , including some quotes by Cohen). If you're in the case of planning a future study and struggle with defining an effect size of interest in order to compute a required sample size, note that this paper by Daniel Lakens (2022) provides some useful guidance on how to justify sample size for a variety of situations.
