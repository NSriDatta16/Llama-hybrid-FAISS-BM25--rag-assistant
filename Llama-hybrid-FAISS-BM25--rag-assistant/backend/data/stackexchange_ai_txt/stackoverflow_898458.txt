Default File Layout in C++ Builder (and Delphi)

I've had a major annoyance with the C++ Builder IDE for some time now. When I code I always use a standard layout for the code files. I have a standard header that I use, including, ie. the License of the file, filename, date, etc. But I haven't been able to find anywhere to insert this, so that when I - for instance - create a new unit, get this header inserted automatically. Of course I can just paste it in, every time, but it gets a bit irritating to use time doing this. So my question is - is it possible to create a file template for default C++ files or modify the existing ones so that they always start with my predefined layout. My fear is that just as with most other things in the C++ Builder IDE, this is hardcoded into it. Currently creating a new unit creates a .cpp file with: //--------------------------------------------------------------------------- #pragma hdrstop #include "Unit1.h" //--------------------------------------------------------------------------- #pragma package(smart_init) and a corresponding header file with: //--------------------------------------------------------------------------- #ifndef Unit1H #define Unit1H //--------------------------------------------------------------------------- #endif This is what I wish to alter to my own defined layout. I'm using Codegear C++ Builder 2007.
