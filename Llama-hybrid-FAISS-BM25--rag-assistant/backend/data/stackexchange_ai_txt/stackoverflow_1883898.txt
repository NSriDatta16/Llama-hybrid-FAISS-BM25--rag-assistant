Use: glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_FILTER_CONTROL, GL_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS, bias); More details here: http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glTexEnv.xml and there: http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/texture_lod_bias.txt EDIT: Ok, I see. First GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER can only take two possible values: either GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR So use GL_LINEAR for the best result. Then for GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER , with GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST you are using no texture interpolation, only mipmaping (you take the nearest mipmap that suits the best, but inside this mipmap you take the nearest texel only, without interpolation between this texel and his neighbours). So use GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR for doing this weighted average between the texels. With GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR you can have even more rendering quality since it will use a linear interpolation between the result of the texture fetch for two mipmaps (mipmap N and N+1) instead of just taking the result of the texture fetch for mipmap N, like previously. GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR is also known as trilinear filtering .
