Simple way to inset table?

I'm a LaTeX beginner. Up until now whenever I've created a table (using the tabular environment) LaTeX floats it in its own paragraph, between my lines of text. However, I want a way to embed a small table within a paragraph (to the left or right), having the text flow around it. Is there a simple way to do this without having to exert too much manual control over the formatting?
