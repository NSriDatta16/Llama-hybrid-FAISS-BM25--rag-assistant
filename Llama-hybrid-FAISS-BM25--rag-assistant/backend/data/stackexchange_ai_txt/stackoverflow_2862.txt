I bounce about between Mac, Windows and Ubuntu and while Emacs used to be my editor of choice, I'm finding that in my old age I prefer to something GUI-based (using command-line for the shell is still fine by me). My preferred editor is Komodo Edit , which the advantages of: Being free (as in beer) Available for Mac, Windows and Linux Syntax highlighting for a boatload of languages, including C++ and PHP (I'm using it for Ruby, Python and PHP myself) Code completion, even for classes I defined myself Ability to "remote save" via FTP, SFTP or SCP Support for organizing your files into projects Tabs and other interface niceties I'm not sure how lightweight it is, but it certainly feels snappier than Eclipse!
