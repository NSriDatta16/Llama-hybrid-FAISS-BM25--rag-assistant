Best way to store "small" data

I have a small dataset consisting of around 200 measurements of different light sources. The light is measured with a broadband and an IR diode, and the resulting voltage is sampled it with 4 megasamples/second. All the measurements have a length of 2 seconds, so twice 8e6 values per measurement. At the moment, all the measurements are in my file system on Windows, structured (and labelled) by folder- and file names. Now my first question is, generally, what is the state-of-the-art way to store such data? The data is quite homogeneous, so I assume an SQL Database would fit, but then, do I store the measurement values in the DB as well, or just the paht to them? And if I store just the paths, how do I avoid the problem that they are specific to my machine? By storing the data online? Then my question is, is there a service (preferably free) which fits my needs? I know this question is opinion-based, but maybe someone can give me a quick overview so I know what to look for and where it makes sense to start. EDIT (Thanks Arun Aniyan) ------------------------------------------------------------- My data is stored in HDF5 files, and I'm processing it with Python 3. The ligh I'm measuring comes from welding machines, so the metadata are something like: Brand (e.g. Fronius), Process (TIG, MAG, ...), AC/DC, Amperage (10-300 Amp√®re), Distance to light source, date and time of measurement, info about the ambient light source(sun, LED, Halogen, ...). At the moment, my measurements are specified by really long names ( brand_process_ac/dc_amperage_distance_etc.mat ). When I want to add a new category to the metadata, I have to change all the file names. Also if I want to query and filter my data (if I want for example to only consider fronius machines), I have to parse the file names. I'm not working with big data at the moment, so it works. However, I would prefer to use the right tools from the start, so my dataset is scalable and stays manageable when it grows.
