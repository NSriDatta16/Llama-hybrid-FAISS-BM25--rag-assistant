Dragging an image from a scrollview

This is driving me bonkers, have been on it ages and still can get the thing to do what I want! My view is set out like this: RootViewController contains (UIView)flipView FlipView contains (UiView)firstView FirstView contains a scrollview and a load of imageviews Scrollview contains a series of custom imageViews I can drag the custom imageViews left and right and whichever one I drag it appears above all other custom imageViews in the scrollview because of this line in the custom UIImageViews touchesBegan method: [[self superview] bringSubviewToFront:self]; Great! But..... Although I can drag vertically and the custom imageView leaves the bounds of the scrollview as required I cannot get it to appear above any of the imageviews that are on firstview? I also have found that if I display the point.y value when I first touch the imageview to be dragged it shows 24 as I start to drag up to take it off the scrollview it goes to 26 and then stays at that value even though I can drag it all the way to the top of the screen, behind all the other imageviews? I have obviously missed the bleeding obvious....obviously....help please? Thanks
