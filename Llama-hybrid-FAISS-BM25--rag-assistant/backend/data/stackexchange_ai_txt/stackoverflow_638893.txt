What is the most efficient way in Python to convert a string to all lowercase stripping out all non-ascii alpha characters?

I have a simple task I need to perform in Python, which is to convert a string to all lowercase and strip out all non-ascii non-alpha characters. For example: "This is a Test" -> "thisisatest" "A235th@#$&( er Ra{}|?>ndom" -> "atherrandom" I have a simple function to do this: import string import sys def strip_string_to_lowercase(s): tmpStr = s.lower().strip() retStrList = [] for x in tmpStr: if x in string.ascii_lowercase: retStrList.append(x) return ''.join(retStrList) But I cannot help thinking there is a more efficient, or more elegant, way. Thanks! Edit: Thanks to all those that answered. I learned, and in some cases re-learned, a good deal of python.
