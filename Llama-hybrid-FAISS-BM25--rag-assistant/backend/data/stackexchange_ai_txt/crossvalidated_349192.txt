To answer the second part of your question: Robert Tibshirani (who introduced the Lasso) writes in "introduction to statistical learning" on the subject of tuning parameter selection: Cross-validation provides a simple way to tackle this problem. We choose a grid of λ values, and compute the cross-validation error for each value of λ ... We then select the tuning parameter value for which the cross validation error is smallest. The advised way seems to be to search for the optimal value for your problem with the use of cross-validation.
