Have you tried setting the field in the Database to a BLOB? or Binary? It might be better to treat it almost like a file if it's that long. You may also want to look into Key-Value Storage systems like Voldemort or Amazon's Dynamo at this point if you will have a lot of files like this. Relational-databases don't handle such large chunks of data that well. Yes you did mention that the admin tool handles it well, but will it scale?
