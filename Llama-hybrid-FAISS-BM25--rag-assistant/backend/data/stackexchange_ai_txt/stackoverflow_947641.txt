Check out ELMAH, I haven't implemented it myself but it seems to be getting some attention. http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ELMAHErrorLoggingModulesAndHandlersForASPNETAndMVCToo.aspx Once ELMAH has been dropped into a running web application and configured appropriately, you get the following facilites without changing a single line of your code: Logging of nearly all unhandled exceptions. A web page to remotely view the entire log of recoded exceptions. A web page to remotely view the full details of any one logged exception. In many cases, you can review the original yellow screen of death that ASP.NET generated for a given exception, even with customErrors mode turned off. An e-mail notification of each error at the time it occurs. An RSS feed of the last 15 errors from the log. A number of backing storage implementations for the log, including in-memory, Microsoft SQL Server and several contributed by the community.
