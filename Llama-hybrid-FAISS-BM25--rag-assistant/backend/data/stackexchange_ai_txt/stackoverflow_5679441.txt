Use DescriptionAttribute instead. public enum Type { [Description("Hourly Employee")] Hourly = 1, [Description("Salary Employee")] Salary = 2, [Description("None")] None = 3 }; Then you would just have an public Type EmployeeType {get; set;} property. And if somebody wanted to write it out, they could get the description. I'd also call it Type instead of EmployeeType , because the call myEmployee.EmployeeType sounds redundant. Your other option might be to unroll the property and have two methods public string GetEmployeeType() { //your switch statement } public void SetEmployeeType(EmployeeType type) { _type = type; } Not quite as elegant as a property, but quickly does the job. Also remember that properties in IL are just methods.
