You mentioned regression and PCA in the title, and there is a definite answer for each of those. The asymptotic complexity of linear regression reduces to O(P^2 * N) if N > P, where P is the number of features and N is the number of observations. More detail in Computational complexity of least square regression operation . Vanilla PCA is O(P^2 * N + P ^ 3), as in Fastest PCA algorithm for high-dimensional data . However fast algorithms exist for very large matrices, explained in that answer and Best PCA Algorithm For Huge Number of Features? . However I don't think anyone's compiled a single lit review or reference or book on the subject. Might not be a bad project for my free time...
