Javascript - Dynamically load a fragment of HTML and run script

I'm building a webpage and I want to re-use some HTML I have elsewhere on my website. The page I am building ( index.html ) can dynamically get and insert the HTML I want ( existing.html ) using XMLHttpRequest . However, the HTML I want to get is populated by some Javscript. That Javascript is not being executed when I load it into my new page: index.html: ... //use XMLHttpRequest to load existing.html initExistingHTML(); //this is function which populates loaded HTML, is not executed existing.html: function initExistingHTML() { ... // do some stuff } How can I load existing.html and run the script which populates it?
