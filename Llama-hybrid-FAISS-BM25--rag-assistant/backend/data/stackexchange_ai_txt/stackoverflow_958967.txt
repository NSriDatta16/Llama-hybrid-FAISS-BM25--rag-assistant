Determining “System Load”

Does anyone know an elegant way to determine “System Load” preferably using Windows performance counters? In this case I mean “System Load” in the classical (UNIX) sense of the term and not in the commonly confused “CPU Utilization” percentage. Based on my reading … “System Load” is typically represented as a float, defining the number of processes in a runnable state (i.e. not including the number of processes that are currently blocked for one reason or another) that could be run at a given time. Wikipedia gives a good explanation here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing) . By-the-way I’m working in C# so any examples in that language would be greatly appreciated.
