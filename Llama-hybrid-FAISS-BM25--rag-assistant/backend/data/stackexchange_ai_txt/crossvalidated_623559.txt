Why are reported std devs different from measured std devs for lmer random effects and residuals?

library(foreach) library(dplyr) library(lme4) set.seed(1234) n_groups lag(default =0) a sd() r $g$ `(Intercept)` |> sd() The model equation is $y = a.x + \omega_g + \epsilon$ where $\omega_g$ is the random intercept associated with group $g$ . reported random effect sd: 1.21; measured: 1.05 reported residual sd: 0.92; measured: 0.88 Is there some sort of Bayesian adjustment going on? How do I replicate it?
