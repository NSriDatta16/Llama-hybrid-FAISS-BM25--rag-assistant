Should I use a machine learning model to calculate propensity score?

In my study, running a simple linear model to calculate de propensity score for each example seemed to not be able to model my treatment choosing process correctly. My question is, does it make sense to use a "stronger" model (svm, nn, you name it) to try and obtain a more precise propensity score? Thank you in advance!
