Can glmnet logistic regression directly handle factor (categorical) variables without needing dummy variables?

I'm building a logistic regression in R using LASSO method with the functions cv.glmnet for selecting the lambda and glmnet for the final model. I already know all the disadvantages regarding the automatic model selection but I need to do it anyway. My problem is that I need to include factor (categorical) variables in the model, is there any way to do it without creating a lot of dummy variables? This variables are almost all strings and not numbers.
