Technically, it depends on the assumptions you are willing to make. You could assume that "the rest of the population" behaves exactly like the one participant that you have, and this then allows generalisation. This, however, is an assumption that will be hard to justify, and by definition you cannot check it using data from other participants (as you don't have them). So normally, in a real situation, this should not be accepted. What you can use is all the machinery of time series analysis (also depending on certain assumptions that may or may not be justified) that will allow you to predict future observations for the same individual (involving tests for things such as the absence of a trend or seasonal variation).
