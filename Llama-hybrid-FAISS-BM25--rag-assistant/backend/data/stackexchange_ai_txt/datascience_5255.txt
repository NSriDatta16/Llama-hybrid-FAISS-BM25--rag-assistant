What is an 'old name' of data scientist?

Terms like 'data science' and 'data scientist' are increasingly used these days. Many companies are hiring 'data scientist'. But I don't think it's a completely new job. Data have existed from the past and someone had to deal with data. I guess the term 'data scientist' becomes more popular because it sounds more fancy and 'sexy' How were data scientists called in the past?
