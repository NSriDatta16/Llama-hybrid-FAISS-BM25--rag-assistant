Regex (C#): Replace \n with \r\n

How can I replace lone instances of \n with \r\n (LF alone with CRLF) using a regular expression in C#? I know to do it using plan String.Replace , like: myStr.Replace("\n", "\r\n"); myStr.Replace("\r\r\n", "\r\n"); However, this is inelegant, and would destroy any "\r+\r\n" already in the text (although they are not likely to exist).
