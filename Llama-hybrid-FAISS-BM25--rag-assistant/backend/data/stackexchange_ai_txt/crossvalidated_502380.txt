Below is my own attempt to answer the question. TL;DL There are two versions of the law of large numbers. One for repeated experiments, another for experiments on different members in a population. The law of large numbers can be proved by using Chevyshev's inequality, which is a property of a random variable (note that there is no population, sample, etc. involved to understand Chevyshev's inequality). What law of large numbers says is that, if we repeat an experiment multiple times, the average of their results converges to the expected value of the experiment (note again there is no population, sample, etc. involved in this statement). Now let's interpret that statement in different contexts: In the context of repeating an experiment on a single object (i.e., dice) which generates different results, the average of their results is (X1+X2+...+Xn)/n, where Xi is the nth experiment. In the context of measuring a feature of the members in a sample from a population, the average of the measures is sample mean. So, as far as the law of large numbers is concerned, "the average of repeated experiment results on a single object" and "sample mean" are same thing in different context. And there is no need to introduce population and sample concepts in the former context. That seems quite a reasonable explanation to me :)
