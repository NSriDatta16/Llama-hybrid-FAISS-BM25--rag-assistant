Analysis of the bias resulting from PCA

Suppose that we generate some dataset from $y = X \beta + \epsilon,$ where $\epsilon$ is some independent error, and the rows of $X$ come from some distribution (unspecified for now). Suppose you run a PCA on a dataset $X$ , resulting in $A$ . Can you characterize the bias you get from using $A$ instead of $X$ , maybe in terms of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (empirical or population) of $X$ ? I am familiar with the notion of PCA capturing a "fraction of the original variance," but not sure exactly how that translates to the bias when fitting a linear model. Any references or help would be great.
