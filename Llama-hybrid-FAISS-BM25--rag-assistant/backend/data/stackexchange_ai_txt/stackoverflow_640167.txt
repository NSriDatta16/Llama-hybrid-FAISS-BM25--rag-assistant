How do I make a textarea draggable? (i.e. inhibit text selection, but allow cursor positioning)

I have a textarea that I've set to draggable, but it's not... The browsers I've tested (FireFox 3 and Safari 3 on OS X) think I'm trying to select the text inside the textarea (even when there is none). I would like to allow for clicking inside the textarea to position the cursor for editing, but a dragging movement should be handled by jquery-ui. Example html which is not doing what I want below... $(function(){ $("div").draggable(); $("textarea").draggable(); }); div { position: fixed; top: 100px; left: 100px; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: blue; } textarea { width: 80%; height: 80%; background-color: yellow; resize: none; } Pirates spotted!
