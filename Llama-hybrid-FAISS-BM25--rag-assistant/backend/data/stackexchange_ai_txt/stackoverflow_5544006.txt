ZF Naming Conventions Zend Framework coding convention state that you should use uppercase names. Some of the conventions are as important to follow as the API docs themself. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.naming-conventions.html If a class name is comprised of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be capitalized. Successive capitalized letters are not allowed, e.g. a class "Zend_PDF" is not allowed while "Zend_Pdf" is acceptable. and Class names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Numbers are permitted in class names but are discouraged in most cases. Underscores are only permitted in place of the path separator; the filename "Zend/Db/Table.php" must map to the class name "Zend_Db_Table". As a note, your example provided was wrong. But in any event, keep your model names all uppercase, and the path to the models also uppercase inline with the ZF naming conventions.
