You could do a two-sample t test on the ranks to check the null hypothesis of equal average rank. This is basically the same as a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the original times for the null hypothesis 'no difference between A and B in typical performance'. The analysis will be easier if you split rank and type in two columns (one with the rank and/or time and one with the type).
