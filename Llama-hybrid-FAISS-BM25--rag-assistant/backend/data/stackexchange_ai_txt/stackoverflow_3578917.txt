Your user control may have a property written like this: private int myPropName; // note the lowercase m public int MyPropName { get { return MyPropName; } } // the property is returned // instead of the variable Note that the value returned by get is the property itself. This crashes VStudio 2008 when trying to see the properties of the control, which also happens when adding the control (by drag'n drop or else) to a Form. As pointed out by NickAldwin, this does not generate compiler warning or error.
