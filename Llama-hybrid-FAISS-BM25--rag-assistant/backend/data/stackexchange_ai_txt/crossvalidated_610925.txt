Time series with categorical response variable

I have a question about modelling but I don't even know what kind of model to start looking into. I have panel data with multiple waves. The response variable I'm interested in is categorical variable (let's call it status ). This variable has three categories: willing to be vaccinate , unwilling to be vaccinated and vaccinated . The problem is that the vaccinated group is getting larger with each wave as people get vaccinated over time. I'm not sure how to model this type of data structure. Or if that's even possible. Would very much appreciate some guidance towards papers/textbooks/resources that help with modelling these data. Thank you.
