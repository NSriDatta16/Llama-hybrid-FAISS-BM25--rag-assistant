Django query: Another count question

Hello I seem to be having some problem involving counting in Django. I have a list of items which only displays its latest status. All of these items that has a status "Destroyed" have been removed. This prints nicely. status_items = models.StorageItem.objects.filter(client=client_id, itemstatushistory__isnull=False).distinct() {% for item in status_items %} {{item.itemstatushistory_set.latest|cut:"Destroyed"}} {% endfor %} But I can't count for some reason. status_items = models.StorageItem.objects.filter(client=client_id, itemstatushistory__isnull=False).distinct().count() TypeError while rendering: 'int' object is not iterable
