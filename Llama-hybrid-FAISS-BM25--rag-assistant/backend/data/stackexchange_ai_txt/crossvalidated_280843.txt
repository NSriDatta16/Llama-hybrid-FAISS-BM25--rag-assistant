The best line fit can be found analytically by the least squares method. So can we say that linear regression (least squares) has an optimizer?

The best line fit can be found analytically by the least squares method. So can we say that linear regression (least squares) has an optimizer? For example, for logistic regression I can use an optimizer, gradient descent. But for linear regression, where the best model parameters can be found analytically, does it make sense to say that I use an optimizer? An optimizer in general can be any algorithm that takes as input a model, model parameters, evaluator (function that tells you how good particular parameters are), and produces as output the best model parameters.
