Selecting the best features for random forest training

By trial and error I found that my random forest regressor from sklearn is giving higher RMSE when I add features to training. Also the importance of features is changing in each addition of feature. When does this happen? I expect the model to give same RMSE or improved RMSE with each addition. Is there a way to find which combination of features provide the lowest RMSE?
