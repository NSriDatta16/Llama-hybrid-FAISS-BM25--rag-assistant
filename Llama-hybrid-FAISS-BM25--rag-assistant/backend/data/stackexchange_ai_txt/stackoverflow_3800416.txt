Is there a Property Dialog control that i can use in my WPF App?

I'm building an application using WPF that will be a designer of sorts, meaning, a user can drag and drop custom UI elements into a canvas and be able to configure their behavior via properties. (Think of this like a domain specific PowerPoint. You can add elements to the presentation, configure the elements' properties and then eventually you can run the "slideshow" and those elements will behave according to their properties) So in my app, what is the best way of showing and configuring an element's properties? Is there a Property Dialog control I can use? (similar to the one in Visual Studio for controls)
