So I would like to know if any of the above options will speed up the application if I set them to true? I know some will hate me for this, but nobody here can answer you truthfully . You have to try your program with and without them, and profile each build and see what the results are. Guess-work won't get anybody anywhere. Compilers already do tons(!) of great optimization, with or without your permission. Your best bet is to write your code in a clean and organized matter, and worry about maintainability and extensibility. As I like to say: Code now, optimize later.
