Another very practical perspective on random and fixed effects models comes from econometrics when doing linear regressions on panel data . If you’re estimating the association between an explanatory variable and an outcome variable in a dataset with multiple samples per individual / group, this is the framework you want to use. A good example of panel data is yearly measurements from a set of individuals of: $gender_i$ (gender of the $i$th person) ${\Delta}weight_{it}$ (weight change during year $t$ for person $i$) $exercise_{it}$ (average daily exercise during year $t$ for person $i$) If we’re trying to understand the relationship between exercise and weight change, we’ll set up the following regression: ${\Delta}weight_{it} = \beta_0$$exercise_{it} + \beta_1gender_i + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it}$ $\beta_0$ is the quantity of interest $\beta_1$ is not interesting, we're just controlling for gender with it $\alpha_i$ is the per-individual intercept $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term In a setup like this there is the risk of endogeneity. This can happen when unmeasured variables (such as marital status) are associated with both exercise and weight change. As explained on p.16 in this Princeton lecture , a random effects (AKA mixed effects) model is more efficient than a fixed effects model. However, it will incorrectly attribute some of the effect of the unmeasured variable on weight change to exercise, producing an incorrect $\beta_0$ and potentially a higher statistical significance than is valid. In this case the random effects model is not a consistent estimator of $\beta_0$. A fixed effects model (in its most basic form) controls for any unmeasured variables that are constant over time but vary between individuals by explicitly including a separate intercept term for each individual ($\alpha_i$) in the regression equation. In our example, it will automatically control for confounding effects from gender, as well as any unmeasured confounders (marital status, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, etc…). In fact, gender cannot be included in the regression and $\beta_1$ cannot be estimated by a fixed effects model, since $gender_i$ is collinear with the $\alpha_i$'s. So, the key question is to determine which model is appropriate. The answer is the Hausman Test . To use it we perform both the fixed and random effects regression, and then apply the Hausman Test to see if their coefficient estimates diverge significantly. If they diverge, endogeneity is at play and a fixed effects model is the best choice. Otherwise, we’ll go with random effects.
