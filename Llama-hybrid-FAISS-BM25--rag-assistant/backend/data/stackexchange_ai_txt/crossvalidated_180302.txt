Significance between odd ratios

I´m fairly new to the tools of statistics and I need some help. I´m working in R. I have a list of students, their age, sex, test results(continuous variable) and education (a categorical variable. 0 if student has no education, 1 if student has education). This is stored in the data frame df. I have assigned each student an age group depending on their age. The groups are 5-10,11-15, 16-20, 21-25. So now I have a new categorical variable with 4 levels. I have done logistic regression for each age group. I did the test in R like this: model1 = glm(education ~ test results + sex + age, data = df, family = binomial()) From the logistic regression result I compute the odds ratio (exp(coefficient)) for the test results variable. For each age group I got an odds ratio and confidence interval. There are some differences in the odds ratio between age groups. The odd ratio gets closer to 1 with higher age group. I interpret this in the following way; as the age of students is higher there is less effect from education on test result. My question is how can I test if the difference in odds ratios is significant, i.e. what test can I use in R ? Here is a subset of the data: student sex age testScore education ageGroup 1 1 10 0.12 1 1 2 1 8 0.08 1 1 3 2 16 0.85 0 3 4 2 20 0.12 0 3 5 1 22 1.02 0 4 6 2 18 0.98 1 3 7 1 19 0.46 1 3 8 1 16 0.83 0 3 9 2 12 0.26 1 2 10 2 14 0.46 0 2 I have been searching books and the web without success, can´t seem to find an example that I can relate to. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
