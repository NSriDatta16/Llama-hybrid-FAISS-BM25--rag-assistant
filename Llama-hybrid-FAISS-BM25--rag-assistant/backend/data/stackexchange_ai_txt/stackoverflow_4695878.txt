jQuery get/set html content of resizable/draggable element

I have some divs on my page that are made both resizable and draggable using jQuery UI. When I call html() on those divs, I get not only the content of the div, but also some extra content inserted by jQuery UI when I made them resizable: text() works for retrieving the current text, but when I try to set the content using $("selector").text("new text") , it replaces the jQuery UI code, making the div not resizable anymore. How can I just get/set the text, not the jQuery UI resizable code?
