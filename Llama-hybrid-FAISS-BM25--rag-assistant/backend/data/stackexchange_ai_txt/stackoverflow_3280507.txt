How can I prepare the logs or textfiles to be read by MySQL using Load DATA INFILE INTO?

What is the best way to prepare the log files before inserting their values in the MYSQL database using LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/someFile.txt' INTO TABLE How can I make sure and make the data log file ready to be read by such command ? Someone told me by scripting (using sed,grep,cat,sub ...) .. how can I do that or what are the tools ? I know how to place the file so MySQL can read it, but I want to know how to organize it and prepare its content for that.
