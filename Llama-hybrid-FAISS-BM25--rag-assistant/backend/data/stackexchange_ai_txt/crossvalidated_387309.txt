Speed up Conditional Variable Importance for Random Forests

I have trained a random forest in R and now I'm calculating the variable importance mesaure unsing the party Package. importance My data set consists of 30000 observations with 40 continuous variables and 10 categorical variables. The problem is that variables are correlated, wherfore I have to use the conditional variable importance measure (see this paper) . Training the random forest with 100 trees took ~10 minutes, but calculation of variable importance already takes two days. How can calculating variable importance be speeded up? Or can it be claculated how long the calculation will take?
