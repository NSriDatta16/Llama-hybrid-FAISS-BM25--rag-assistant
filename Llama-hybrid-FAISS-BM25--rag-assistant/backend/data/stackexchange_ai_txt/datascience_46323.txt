I agree the equation might not be clear, but you can decompose it into something like the following: First, the term $\operatorname{argmax}_k p^i (y=k|\mathbf{x})$ tells you which label has the higher probability from model $i$ given the input object $\mathbf{x}$ . Then, this "iterates" over all models in the Committee, computing for each the label that is most likely. Finally finding which label is the most common one (that $\operatorname{argmax}_j$ ) at the end. Also, it helps to think about it in pseudo-code def get_label(CNNs, x): labels = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # each position refers to that last $j$ for pCNNi in CNNs: predictions = pCNNi(x) label_i = predictions.index(max(predictions)) # this is the argmax_k labels[label_i] += 1 return labels.index(max(labels)) # this is the argmax_j
