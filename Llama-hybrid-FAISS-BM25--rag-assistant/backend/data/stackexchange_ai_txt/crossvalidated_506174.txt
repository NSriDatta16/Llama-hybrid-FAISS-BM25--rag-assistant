Series b. This spike is just an outlier. Single outlier does not affect stationarity. Stationarity is about distribution, not about variance constness. An outlier does not affect a distribution of $X_t$ , so it does not affect stationarity. This large value is just a random fluctuation, nothing more. Series g. This series does not have seasonality. It has cycles (you can note, that these spikes have different height). You are right - seasonality implies non-stationarity, but cycles do not, so this time series is stationary. You can check if the series is stationary using some statistical tests, like Dickey-Fuller test, or KPSS test.
