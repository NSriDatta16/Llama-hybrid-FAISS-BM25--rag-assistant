If the DB is Oracle, then you can simply use JDBC with a SQLX query. This will generate your result set directly as XML fragments on the server much faster than if you'd do it on your own on the client side. SQLX has been available since 8.1.7 as project Aurora and since 9i in standard as XMLDB. Here is a simple example. select XMLelement ("Process", XMLelement( "number", p.p_ka_id, '.', p_id ), XMLElement( "name", p.p_name ), XMLElement ( "processGroup", pg.pg_name ) ) from PMP_processes p, PMP_process_groups pg where condition ; In addition to XMLelement, SQLX has XMLattribute, XMLforest, XMLaggregate... which allows you any resulting tree.
