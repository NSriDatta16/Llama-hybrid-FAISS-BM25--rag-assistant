I for one organize everything into 4 files for every project or analysis. (1) 'code' Where I store text files of R functions. (2) 'sql' Where I keep the queries used to gather my data. (3) 'dat' Where I keep copies (usually csv) of my raw and processed data. (4) 'rpt' Where I store the reports I've distributed. ALL of my files are named using very verbose names such as 'analysis_of_network_abc_for_research_on_modified_buffer_19May2011' I also write detailed documentation up front where I organize the hypothesis, any assumptions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and steps I intend to take to reach my deliverable. All of this is invaluable for repeatable research and makes my annual goal setting process easier.
