Q1. which of the above is the canonical form of the 2PL model? (or if it is some other configuration not listed above.) The one-parameter logistic (1PL) model predicts the $i^{th}$ students response to the $j^{th}$ item as a function of student ability $\theta_i$ , the $j^{th}$ item's difficulty $b_j$ , and a common slope $a$ . On a 4 item test (your example) this requires estimation of 5 item parameters - a common slope and 4 difficulty parameters. $P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i) = \frac{exp[a(\theta_i-b_j)]}{1+exp[a(\theta_i-b_j)]}$ The two-parameter logistic (2PL) model differs from the 1PL in that it frees the common slope to vary across the $j$ items. On your 4 item test this requires estimation of 8 item parameters - 4 slopes and 4 difficulty parameters. $P(X_{ij} = 1|\theta_i) = \frac{exp[a_j(\theta_i-b_j)]}{1+exp[a_j(\theta_i-b_j)]}$ Q2. What is a good choice of prior for a? (I've used a normal distribution on interpretation 2 above to unstable results using MCMC methods for Bayesian approach.) Regarding a choice of prior, I have used the lognormal distribution in the past (see Natesan, Nandakumar, Minka, & Rubright, 2016 for more info). However, I am not sure if IRT is the appropriate tool for your problem (regardless of the estimation technique). Even with strong priors (which you appear not to have), your sample is quite small. Even rules of thumb for using IRT typically requires sample sizes > 100 (e.g., Cappelleri, Lundy, & Hays, 2014). References Cappelleri, J. C., Lundy, J. J., & Hays, R. D. (2014).
