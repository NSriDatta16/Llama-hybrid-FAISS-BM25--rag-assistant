How does a quadratic kernel look like?

Based on visualized decision boundaries, we have to decide what kind of classifier has generated it. One example is shown in the image below - this is from a quadratic kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM), i.e. $K(x,y) = (x^T*y+c)^2$. I know what a quadratic function looks like in two dimensions, but want to understand how to determine what kind of functions have led to the boundaries in three dimensions - is this basically a "cut" through for instance a parabola in three dimensions, which leads to this ellipsoid boundary?
