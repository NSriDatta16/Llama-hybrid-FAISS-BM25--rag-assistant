Regressor vs. AR/MA terms

I'm running a regression to model Hong Kong's office rentals series: Source: Private Office - Average Rents by Grade by District (from 1982) Source: All HK Property Market Statistics Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.06999 0.02690 2.602 0.01068 * D4_UNem -12.18370 1.72799 -7.051 2.34e-10 *** GDPr_chg -1.61744 0.52219 -3.097 0.00253 ** Inflation 1.38991 0.28273 4.916 3.47e-06 *** > vif(m3) D4_UNem GDPr_chg Inflation 2.200651 2.191869 1.010960 Simply from regression, these 3 variables are significant; However its ACF and PACF shows significant auto-correlation among the residuals: However, whenever I add any AR/MA ERROR terms, they make these regressors insignificant. (except AR1, but AR1 is not sufficient to remove all the auto-correlations. What would you guys do? Does it mean my regressors really shouldn't be included? Thanks everyone!
