I want to add one more resource, Google Colaboratory . It's a free cloud iPython notebook and gives you free usage of a GPU . I'm not sure of the exact limitations just yet, but it appears you get 12 hours of GPU time per instance and can do this multiple times per month. This looks like a great resource for students and other non-professionals, especially for smaller jobs that you can run in half a day. It essentially saves you up to $10 per training session, which is a pretty significant resource for machine learning research in my opinion. I seriously hope it doesn't get abused.
