Linux Ajax (mootools Request.JSON) Header error

I use the following code to get some json data: var request = new Request.JSON( { 'url': sourceURI, 'onSuccess': onPageData } ); request.get(); Request.JSON is a class from Mootools (a javascript library). But on linux (ubuntu on firefox 3.5 and Chrome) the request always fails. So i tried to display the http request ajax is sending. (I used netcat to display it) The request is like this: OPTIONS /the+url HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Connection: keep-alive User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.0.226.0 Safari/532.3 Referer: http://example.com/ref... Access-Control-Request-Method: GET Origin: http://example.com Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Request, X-Requested-With, Accept Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 The HTTP request (first line) is not how it should be: OPTIONS /the+url HTTP/1.1 It should be: GET /the+url HTTP/1.1 Does anybody know why this problem is and how to fix it? Edit: The ajax request gets the following result from my Apache server: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 23 Apr 2010 08:09:41 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.15 (Debian) Allow: GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS Content-Length: 0 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/plain The content-length should not be zero. But i think, the Request.JSON module whould now see that the GET request is available and can use it?
