I can't see anything in the let s that would through, since node should always be non-null. And outside the let s the only time you use it is in blah.Element(..) - so you have two choices: filter out the ones that won't work (will remove data): .... let mainTradingName = node.Element(ns + "mainTradingName") where mainTradingName != null .... check before using .Element (will default some fields to blank): ... organisationName = mainTradingName == null ? "" : (string)mainTradingName.Element(ns + "organisationName"), ...
