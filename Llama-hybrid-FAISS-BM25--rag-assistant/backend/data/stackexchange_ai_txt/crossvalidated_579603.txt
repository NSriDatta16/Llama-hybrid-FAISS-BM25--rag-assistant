Latent variables for spatio-temporal Extreme Value in R

Latent variables models are often used for spatial extremes modeling see e.g., Davison, Padoan and Ribatet . A typical application use block maxima such as annual maxima of temperature, assumed to have a marginal Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. In relation with climate change, one may be interested in spatio-temporal models involving both a spatial index vector $\mathbf{s}$ (such as the vector formed with longitude and latitude) and a time index $t$ , along with with a vector $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{s},\, t)$ of covariables. In such a model, the GEV location parameter $\mu$ would be $$ \mu(\mathbf{s},\, t) = \boldsymbol{\beta}_\mu^\top \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{s}, \, t) + \zeta_\mu(\mathbf{s},\,t) $$ where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_\mu$ is a vector of unknown coefficients and $\zeta_\mu(\mathbf{s}, \, t)$ is a latent Gaussian Process. Similar formulations could be needed for the GEV scale $\sigma$ and shape $\xi$ . The CRAN package SpatialExtremes covers the spatial case. Also, INLA covers some special cases and further provides an alternative based on the blended GEV distribution for the case of a constant positive shape $\xi >0$ . Using Stan via RStan is an option but there does not yet seem to exist an RStan package devoted to Extreme Value. So: what R packages can be used for the estimation and the Bayesian inference for this kind of models?
