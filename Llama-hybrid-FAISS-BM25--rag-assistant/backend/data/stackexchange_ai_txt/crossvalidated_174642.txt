Visualizing and interpreting principal components

I have performed principal component analysis (PCA) in Matlab via [U,S,V] = svd(X) Now I have to show the principal directions of the considered principal components; either by finding a way to plot them or interpret them in terms of the features. If I have chosen 6 of the 12 PCs, I am still not able to plot them. So how can I interpret them in terms of the features?
