How to apply Content-based image retrieval for scanned images?

Is there a way to differentiate between scanned images(with only text) that are well-lit and with good contrast, from the ones that are not(that have poor quality), making use of Content-based image retrieval? More exactly, is there a feature extraction method that can help to query a database to retrieve the well-lit, good contrast, scanned images? Thank you!
