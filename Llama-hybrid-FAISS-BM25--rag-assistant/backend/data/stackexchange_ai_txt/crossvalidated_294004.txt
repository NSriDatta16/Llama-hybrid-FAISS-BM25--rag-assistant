The general idea of multiple imputation is to fit a quite general Bayesian model with very vague priors and to predict the missing data from that. The problem here is that you have not so many records relative to how much you measure. As a result, you need to put in more information in terms of the model structure (just using a subset of the variables would be an example, because then you would be saying that some of the variables don't matter for predicting the others) or in terms of more informative priors. An alternative (as stated in the comment by Matt Barstead) is to use a model that is valid under a missing at random assumption. If you are willing to specify such a model, you should be willing to specify a more constrained model that would allow you to impute the data (there is to some extent no difference between the two approaches, except that you could impute with a more general model and analyze with a more restrictive model).
