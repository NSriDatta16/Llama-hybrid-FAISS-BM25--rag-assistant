I would suggest it is simply a special case of model uncertainty. From a Bayesian perspective, you simply treat this in exactly the same way you would treat any other kind of uncertainty, by either: Calculating its probability, if it is the object of interest Integrating or averaging it out, if it is not of interest, but may still affect your conclusions This is exactly what people do when testing for "significant effects" by using t-quantiles instead of normal quantiles. Because you have uncertainty about the "true noise level" you take this into account by using a more spread out distribution in testing. So from your perspective the "main effect" is actually a "nuisance parameter" in relation to the question that you are asking. So you simply average out the two cases (or more generally, over the models you are considering). So I would have the (vague) hypothesis: $$\newcommand{\int}{\mathrm{int}}H_{\int}:\text{The interaction between A and B is significant}$$ I would say that although not precisely defined, this is the question you want to answer here. And note that it is not the verbal statements such as above which "define" the hypothesis, but the mathematical equations as well. We have some data $D$, and prior information $I$, then we simply calculate: $$P(H_{\int}|DI)=P(H_{\int}|I)\frac{P(D|H_{\int}I)}{P(D|I)}$$ (small note: no matter how many times I write out this equation, it always helps me understand the problem better. weird). The main quantity to calculate is the likelihood $P(D|H_{int}I)$, this makes no reference to the model, so the model must have been removed using the law of total probability: $$P(D|H_{\int}I)=\sum_{m=1}^{N_{M}}P(DM_{m}|H_{\int}I)=\sum_{m=1}^{N_{M}}P(M_{m}|H_{\int}I)P(D|M_{m}H_{\int}I)$$ Where $M_{m}$ indexes the mth model, and $N_{M}$ is the number of models being considered. The first term is the "model weight" which says how much the data and prior information support the mth model. The second term indicates how much the mth model supports the hypothesis. Plugging this equation back into the original Bayes theorem gives: $$P(H_{\int}|DI)=\frac{P(H_{\int}|I)}{P(D|I)}\sum_{m=1}^{N_{M}}P(M_{m}|H_{\int}I)P(D|M_{m}H_{int}I)$$ $$=\frac{1}{P(D|I)}\sum_{m=1}^{N_{M}}P(DM_{m}|I)\frac{P(M_{m}H_{\int}D|I)}{P(DM_{m}|I)}=\sum_{m=1}^{N_{M}}P(M_{m}|DI)P(H_{\int}|DM_{m}I)$$ And you can see from this that $P(H_{\int}|DM_{m}I)$ is the "conditional conclusion" of the hypothesis under the mth model (this is usually all that is considered, for a chosen "best" model). Note that this standard analysis is justified whenever $P(M_{m}|DI)\approx 1$ - an "obviously best" model - or whenever $P(H_{\int}|DM_{j}I)\approx P(H_{\int}|DM_{k}I)$ - all models give the same/similar conclusions. However if neither are met, then Bayes' Theorem says the best procedure is to average out the results, placing higher weights on the models which are most supported by the data and prior information.
