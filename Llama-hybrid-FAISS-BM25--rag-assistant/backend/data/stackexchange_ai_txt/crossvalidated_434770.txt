Calculate Gini Importance for Boosting Trees

From my understanding, Gini Importance means Mean Decrease in MSE for regression objectives, and Mean Decrease in Impurity for classification objectives. Typical random forest packages like randomForest and ranger export functions to calculate it, but in xgboost , the function xgb.importance calculates "Gain", "Cover", and "Frequency" instead. How can I get Gini Importance from an XGBoost model? A bonus would be explaining why nobody seem to care about it for boosting trees.
