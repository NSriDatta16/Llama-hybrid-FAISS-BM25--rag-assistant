You might get more results if you search for 'UserControl' as you'll likely want to derive your custom/composite controls from that. Typically, I'll place several controls on a UserControl, and expose only the methods and properties I need for the programmer to use it. A good example of such a control I made was a digital clock, where each digit was itself a custom control (which was actually a picturebox, coupled with some controlling logic). Then, I was able to drag n drop this control wherever I needed it. Here's one tutorial you might find handy. As an aside, when I did my google search, I used the following: c# UserControl tutorial -asp which ignored a lot of the ASP tutorials you were mentioning. It does seem that ASP programmers use a lot of these user controls!
