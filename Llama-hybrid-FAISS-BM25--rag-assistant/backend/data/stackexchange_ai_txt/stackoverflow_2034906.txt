Drag & Drop Shapes on Canvas

I used MouseDragElementBehavior to let user drag & drop Shapes on a Canvas: MouseDragElementBehavior dragBehavior = new MouseDragElementBehavior(); dragBehavior.Attach(myShape); Now, I would like to know when myShape was moved and when myShape was dropped. Could you please suggest a code that prints the mouse coordinates when myShape is moved, and prints "Dropped" when myShape is dropped ? Thank you so much !
