What exactly are you trying to do? Assuming that multiple studies have the same underlying distribution for survival (incl. at some fixed timepoint) or that this may vary a bit across studies? As you point out, one distinction is between binary proportions (every patient is 1/0) and time-to-event (everyone has an event time, but we may not always observe it) and survival probabilities (looking at the probability of an event by a fixed time based on an underlying time-to-event analysis). In principle, there's several options to address all of these: 2-step meta-analysis of logit-proportions and their standard errors (using either inverse variance weights or some random effects version) This is trivially easy to implement. Will often be a poor approximation for small proportions/with small sample sizes (i.e. when normal approximation to likelihood is poor). As you say, it ignores the underlying time-to-event process/cannot deal with censoring appropriately. 1-step meta-analysis e.g. using random effects logistic regression Trivially easy to implement. Avoids approximation with normal likelihood. Still ignores that it's really a time-to-event process. 2-step meta-analysis of something like suitably transformed estimates of the survival probability from a time-to-event analysis on each study (or digitizing the Kaplan-Meier curve and then re-analyzing etc.). Slightly more complex, unless analysis already done. Makes normal approximation. Reflects that this is time-to-event. May not have to assume specific time-to-event distribution (can use non-/semi-parametric approach). Admits both random and fixed effects approaches. 1-step parametric time-to-event model such as Weibull with e.g. random study effects on selected parameters. More complex, but avoids normal approx. Reflects that this is TTE. Assumes specific time-to-event distributions and admits both random/fixed effects. There's almost certainly quite a few more reasonable options. There's usually many options to do any one thing. I'd assume that option (1) would be covered in standard meta-analysis packages, and (3) likely, too, if you do the right pre-processing and the right analyses have already been done. The other options may require you to use your own analyses and piece them together appropriately.
