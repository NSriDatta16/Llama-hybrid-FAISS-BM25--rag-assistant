There are many methods for analyzing data with a binary output, but a good default is logistic regression. There is no reason not to use that here. You want to know if "F... affects how strongly treatment affects outcome". In statistical terms, that is asking if there is an interaction between the feature and the treatment. Here is an example, coded in R, for your data: d = read.table(text=" Feature Treatment Trials Successes No No 4169157 1064 No Yes 2892839 794 Yes No 577625 951 Yes Yes 823158 2260", header=T) m = glm(cbind(Successes, Trials-Successes)~Treatment*Feature, d, family=binomial) summary(m) # Call: # glm(formula = cbind(Successes, Trials - Successes) ~ Treatment * # Feature, family = binomial, data = d) # # Deviance Residuals: # [1] 0 0 0 0 # # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) -8.27318 0.03066 -269.828 The test of the interaction, that is, the test of whether the effect of the treatment differs depending on whether the feature is present is displayed in the last row of the coefficients table. You can see that it is highly significant, so the feature does seem to make a difference to the effectiveness of the treatment.
