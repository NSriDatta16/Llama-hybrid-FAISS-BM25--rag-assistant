Generalizing on @Sheridan , identify a model that uses anthropomorphic structures as well as ARIMA structure and use Intervention Detection procedures to identify latent deterministic structure which incluses pulses, level shifts, seasonal pulses and local time trends. Simple method of forecasting number of guests given current and historical data might be helpful as it studies restaurant data. Trends may or not exist. Level shifts may or may not exist. Seasonal factors may change over time . Ourtliers can't be often detected if there is arima structure present. Hourly patterns for weekends are often different from weekdays . For longer time series than yours lead and lag effects of holidays often come into play . Certain days of the month may have special patterns. The particular week of the month may be important .....etc .
