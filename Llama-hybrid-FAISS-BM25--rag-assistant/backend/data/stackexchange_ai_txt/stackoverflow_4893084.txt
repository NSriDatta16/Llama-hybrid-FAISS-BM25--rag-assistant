@Freelancer [Edited to fix errors and provide alternative] You want a [PT] on your RewriteRule statements. Skipping is probably your best bet: RewriteCond "%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}" "!(first-condition-regex)" [NC] RewriteCond "%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}" "!(second-condition-regex)" [NC] RewriteRule "^" "-" [SKIP=2] RewriteRule "^regular.css$" "mobi.css" [PT] RewriteRule "^(view\..*)" "mobile.$1" [PT] If you want to avoid inverting your conditions it gets a bit messier: RewriteCond "%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}" "first-condition-regex" [OR,NC] RewriteCond "%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}" "second-condition-regex" [NC] RewriteRule "^" "-" [E=MOBILE:TRUE] RewriteCond "%{ENV:MOBILE}" "!=TRUE" RewriteRule "^" "-" [SKIP=2] RewriteRule "^regular.css$" "mobi.css" [PT] RewriteRule "^(view\..*)" "mobile.$1" [PT] As pointed out, all these files need to be in the same directory as the .htaccess file.
