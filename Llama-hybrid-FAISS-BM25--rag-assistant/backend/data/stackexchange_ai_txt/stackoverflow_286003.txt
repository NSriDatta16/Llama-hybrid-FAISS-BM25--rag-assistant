Your issue is the "Target" property on the Form. Why is this here? (I also took the liberty of cleaning your HTML up a little) Test JS Post This is in the form. Submit me here: In the code behind of Default.aspx : Private Sub Page_Init(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Init For Each value As String In Request.Form.Keys Debug.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} = ""{1}""", value, Request.Form.Item(value))) Next End Sub
