You're not going to find any contradictions by creating a cyclic graph. It's not that Bayes nets (or as I've heard them called, conditional independence networks since they really don't have anything to do with Bayesianism besides conditional independence rules) "have to be acyclic". We assume them to be acyclic to get certain properties and simplify calculation of probabilities. In fact, if we relax the acyclic restriction as well the directed restriction we get a more general model called a Markov network.
