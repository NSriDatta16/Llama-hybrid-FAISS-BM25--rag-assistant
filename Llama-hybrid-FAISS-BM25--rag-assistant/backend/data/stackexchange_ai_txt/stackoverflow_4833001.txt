It's been a while since I messed around with this, but localStorage is basically just an object, right? Which means that it could be sent as JSON? So you could construct an AJAX call to a PHP page, send the JSON, and then (after the PHP has messed with it and tried to insert it and echo ed the result) alert the user as to what happened, right? (Obviously, you could do this with any server-side language.)
