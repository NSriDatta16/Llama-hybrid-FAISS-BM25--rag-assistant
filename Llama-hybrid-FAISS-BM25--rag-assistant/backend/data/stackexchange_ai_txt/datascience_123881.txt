Hot-encoding warning when using gridsearch

I ran an experiment with the classical holdout method to predict price and hot-encoded categorical data. However, when optimising, I got the warning below even though that I ignored the unknown columns. Any advice is highly regarded UserWarning: Found unknown categories in columns [4] during transform. These unknown categories will be encoded as all zeros grid_transformer = make_column_transformer((OneHotEncoder(drop='if_binary', handle_unknown='ignore', warn), categorical_feat), (RobustScaler(), num_feat), remainder='passthrough') grid_preprocessing = make_pipeline(grid_transformer, SelectPercentile(mutual_info_regression, grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, params_grid, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error', verbose=1, n_jobs=8) percentile=50)) ```
