Yes, one tail testing is better. The null hypothesis is that test driven development has no effect on the number of faults in your system. Your alternative hypothesis is that it decreases the number of faults in your system. Use a one tailed test. If you cannot reject your null hypothesis, in favor of your alternative hypothesis and you see that the average number of faults in your system appears to actually have increased, you can follow up with a two tailed test, with alpha correction and interpretation (explanation).
