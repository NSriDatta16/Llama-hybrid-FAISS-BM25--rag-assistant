Have you tested that the media will play to those "far points" if you just let it play normally and don't try and skip ahead to them? If this fails too it could indicate a corrupt file. How are you requesting the change relative to multiple changes to the slider? If you're making lots of changes to the position in quick succession this may be the problem. Are you checking CanSeek each time before you change the position? Does your slider allow for a single event to trigger a big "jump" or does it try and do lots of little ones? It may also be worth copying the file to IsolatedStorage and trying to play it from there. I have vague recollections of this helping with something similar once before.
