I would start directly with a Stanford course of image recognition with neural networks ( http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html ). They have slides that are fast to read and easy to understand. They have an overview of the methods used in image recognition and also have a detailed description of the latest research (updated every year). They also cover deep learning and gradient descent methods. I would also advise you to get a good book on statistics that explains among others CLT, parameters vs overfitting dilemma and CV. And take part in a Kaggle competition. This will allow you to understand the practical limitations of current methods, get to know current state of the art methods in image recognition and see how people solve real world problems. Here is an image recognition kaggle competition running now: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection . After the Stanford course slides and a Kaggle competition you will probably be able to understand almost all of scientific papers on image recognition and computer vision.
