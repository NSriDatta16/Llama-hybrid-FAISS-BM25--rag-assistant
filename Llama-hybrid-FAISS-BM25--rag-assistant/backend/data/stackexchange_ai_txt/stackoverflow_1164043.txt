Maven: How to include jars, which are not available in reps into a J2EE project?

in my J2EE project I've a couple of dependencies, which are not available in any Maven repository, because they're proprietary libraries. These libraries need to be available at runtime, so that have to be copied to target/.../WEB-INF/lib ... Right now, I'm listing them as system dependency in my POM, but with this method the problem is, that aren't being copied to the target build during compilation. Also this method is not very elegant. So which is the best way to integrate them in Maven? Note: I don't want to create my own Maven repository.
