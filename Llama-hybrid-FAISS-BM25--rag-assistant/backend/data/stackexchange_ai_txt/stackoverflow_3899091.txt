I just want to say that "with SOA we’re building for change, while with Traditional systems engineering, we’re building for stability." The problem with stability, of course, is, it only takes the business so far — if the organization requires business agility, then they’re much better off implementing SOA. So, It solely depends on what you want to achieve, you are the one who should draw the boundary. I read it in article on SOA few days back as I'm too working on SOA. EDIT: Meanwhile I came across this article and thought of sharing with you. The video quite explains the current scenario of SOA and its views by different people.
