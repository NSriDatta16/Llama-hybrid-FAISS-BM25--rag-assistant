Construct a file hierarchy that organizes the files appropriately, zip the whole directory, and use the -u flag on zip to add new files.after you archive them, you can delete the files, but preserve the directory structure for the next batch to be added. If the file names encode the version somehow (dates or whatever) or are otherwise unique it doesn't need to be anything fancier than a signle directory. If not, you need to set up your directories to let you recover versions.
