You have two primary options and either could work well depending on your application. 1) Just put objects into the ViewData collecion. This works well if you have lots of different controllers that pass different data to different views. It also depends on how much boxing/unboxing you want from object as you cast objects to their correct types. This option is more flexible, but less type-safe and possibly more fragile. 2) Create strongly-typed objects that contain other strongly-typed objects useful to a set of views. This works well if you tend to pass the same data to most of your views and you have fewer controllers. You could also consider passing an object that exposes an interface that can acquire different model objects (kind of a locator class), but that probably causes more problems than it does fix them.
