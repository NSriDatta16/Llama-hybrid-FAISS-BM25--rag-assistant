Grouping items from mysql by the day they were posted

So, I'm having a problem building a feed-style list of posts efficiently using PHP and Mysql. I want to output the posts organized and grouped by the day they were posted, showing the date as a header. For example: February 9th ----------- Posts that were posted on Feb 9th Feb 8th ----------------- Posts that were posted on the 8th Hopefully that is clear. I'll try to clear up things if someone is confused.
