Finally I made it, but I had to use an IFRAME, I defined an IFrame in the aspx and didn't set the src property, in the cs file I made generated the pdf file and set the src property of the iFrame as the generated pdf file name, like this; Document pdf = new Document(PageSize.LETTER); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(pdf, new FileStream(Request.PhysicalApplicationPath + "~1.pdf", FileMode.Create)); pdf.Open(); //This action leads directly to printer dialogue PdfAction jAction = PdfAction.JavaScript("this.print(true);\r", writer); writer.AddJavaScript(jAction); pdf.Add(new Paragraph("My first PDF on line")); pdf.Close(); //Open the pdf in the frame frame1.Attributes["src"] = "~1.pdf"; And that made the trick, however, I think that i should implement your solution Stefan, the problem is that I'm new to asp.net and javascript and if I don't have a complete source code I could not code your suggestion but at least is the first step, I was very surprised how much code in html and javascript i need to learn. Thnx.
