Indoor location using WiFi Signals and Machine Learning

I am trying to determine in which zone of a building a person is located based solely on the strength of the WiFi signals her cellphone gets. Currently, we are making measures with an Android App, for each measure we are assigning a "zone" such as "corridor", "room1" or "room2". I intend to build a matrix in which each row represents a measure of various signals and the zone they were measured. There will be a column for each hotspot present in the building (With 0's for all the hotspots which haven't appeared in a measure). The idea is to have the algorithm classify in which zone you probably are based on the power of the signals you get. Any ideas about what machine learning algorithm can achieve a good classification accuracy with that data? I'm currently thinking about Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.
