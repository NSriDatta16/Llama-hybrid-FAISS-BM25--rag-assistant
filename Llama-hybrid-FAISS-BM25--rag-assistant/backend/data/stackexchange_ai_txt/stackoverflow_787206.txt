How often do you need to retrieve the previous posts? How large are they? You can compress the data before inserting into the database but this will increase retrieval time. You could store the diff of the posts but this requires iterating through each post and applying the diff to recreate the history. You should determine the number of articles/edits that you expect so that you can determine how many you can store within your limit. If articles are large and previous versions not commonly accessed then just store the articles as files and store the header information in the database.
