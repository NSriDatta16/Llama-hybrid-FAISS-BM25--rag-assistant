If you are using trees then the algorithm will select the bins for you, regardless of whether the variable is skewed or normal or whatever. There is no need for you to "pre-bin" and such an approach can only make the result worse. If you are using some kind of regression (you mention logistic regression) then you can use a spline of a continuous variable to look for nonlinearity. (There are other methods too). So, when, if ever, should you bin? I can think of two possible reasons: The cutoff of your bin is of substantive interest and perhaps part of a hypothesis. For instance, if you are interested in the behavior of people across the lifespan and have hypothesized that it has one pattern below age 18, another from 18-65 and another at older ages, one method would be to bin age in three categories. (Even here, you might use a hockey stick type model, or a spline model with knots set by you). The model is too "big" to run in a reasonable time. Of course, how big is big depends on your computer and your software and what is "reasonable" is also context specific. if you are making a model that will be run only once, or only once a year, then a running time of many hours might be reasonable. If you need to run it every day, then maybe not. One other possible reason is that binned models are easier to explain than splines. This is true, but I don't regard it as a good reason. One of your jobs, as a data analyst, is to explain things. Finally, you might bin because it is demanded of you by your "pointed haired boss" (from Dilbert) who could be a journal editor, a dissertation advisor, a client, a boss and so on.
