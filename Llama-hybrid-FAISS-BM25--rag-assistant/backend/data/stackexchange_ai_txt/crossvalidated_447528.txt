How to understand the weights and bias?

I am a newbie to deep learning. In my first model on deep learning using the manist data set, there is one thing that confuses me a little bit: weights and bias. When we build a model we will get weight and bias, so is the input data our weights or our model will randomly assign some weights? Also, I think bias is some of the weights, is that correct?
