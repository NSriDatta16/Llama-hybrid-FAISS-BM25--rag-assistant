Promoting Couch-DB to management

I've run a series of somewhat brutal tests against CouchDB 0.10 and it handled itself well (ex. the server's netstack caved in but best I can tell CouchDB was still functioning ). Unfortunately none of that really matters if I can't convince clients and employers to allow me to use it*. Common fears I've heard. "It's only Version .10, thats not even a production release!!!" "But [MySQL|PostGres|Oracle] works fine for [object metadata storage|literal "document" storage|etc]!" "This seems overly complicated ( map reduce based queries, REST api, JSON, etc ) compared to XYZ." "What the hell is an erlang?" *Normally my rule is to tell the client I will solve the problem, but not go into detail. Unfortunately some client's fancy themselves as back seat architects/engineers or are rightfully wanting to be informed. **Pre-emptively arguing this is programming related because sometimes it doesn't matter how much better a tool is if management can't/won't see the benefit over risk of stepping outside what is known.
