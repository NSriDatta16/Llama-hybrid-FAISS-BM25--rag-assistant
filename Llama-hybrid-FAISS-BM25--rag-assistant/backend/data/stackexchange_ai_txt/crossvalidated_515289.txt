Not a perfect answer, but will push you in the right direction. Are you familiar with the PageRank algorithm? It leverages Eigenvector centrality, which is closely related to application of PCA to network analysis. In PageRank, we start with a set of webpages, S and the transition probability matrix, A . Now, if a bot were to start on a given page then repeatedly move according to probabilities in A, we would slowly converge on expected proportional traffic on each webpage. In fact, this proportional vector is, V , the eigenvector of A. What this vector tells us is, if we randomly stopped the bot and asked, "what webpage are you on?" It would give us the webpage probability distribution. And this is the concept of Eigenvector centrality, it defines which points are most/least likely to be visited. (Note, the specific eigenvector returned has an eigenvalue of 1.) ​​ So, to your question- PCA finds the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix. If you limit yourself to just the first component, then it would function similar to PageRank (encoding entities as scalars.) If you include multiple components, you encode entities as vectors/embeddings. Anyway, a covariance matrix is simply one of many possible encodings of vector similarity. You are using 1- overlap_coefficient, so your matrix encodes dissimilarity of vectors. If you were using PCA on overlap_coefficient, then the results would compress/encode the centrality of entities. However, since you are using 1-overlap_coefficient, then PCA would compress/encode the isolation of entities in your set. So if you limit yourself to the first principal component, then you have a raw ranking of the isolation of elements in your set. However, if you add multiple components, then it's less interpretable, however, the compression is of higher fidelity. Edit: It's beyond this Q/A, but eigenvector decomposition behaves in interesting ways when the matrix elements are bounded by [0,1]. This idea and some nuanced requirements are foundational to PCA and Eigenvector centrality.
