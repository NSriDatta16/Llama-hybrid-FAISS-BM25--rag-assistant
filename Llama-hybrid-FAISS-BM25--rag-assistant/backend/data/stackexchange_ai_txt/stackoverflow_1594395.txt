Are there any programs that will shrink the size of a sql script file?

I have a SQL script which is extremely large (about 700 megabytes). I am wondering if there is a good way to reduce the size of the script? I know there are code minimizers for JavaScript and am looking for one to use with SQL scripts. I am not looking to get performance on the SQL script. I am trying to make the file size smaller. Removing excess whitespace. Keeping name-qualification down so that the script file sizes can be smaller. If I attempt to load the file in SQL Server Management Studio I get this error. Not enough storage is available to process this command. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070008) (mscorlib)
