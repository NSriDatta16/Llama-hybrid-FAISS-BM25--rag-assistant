how to logout in windows mobile based application?

I am developing an application for windows mobile in which I have a logout functionality at each form I open. So while pressing the logout button I am able to delete the username password from the memory but I am not able to drag the user to the login screen again while freeing all the memory and closing all the forms. Anybody knowing the answer plz help me out.
