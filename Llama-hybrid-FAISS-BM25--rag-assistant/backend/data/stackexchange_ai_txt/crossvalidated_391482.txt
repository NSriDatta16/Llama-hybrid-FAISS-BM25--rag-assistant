StatsModel Logistic Regression

I am running a fairly simple Logistic Regression model y= (1[Positive Savings] ,0]) X = (1[Treated Group],0) I got a coefficient of Treated -.64 and OR of .52. My question is how to interpret the meaning of the coefficient? Is y base 1 and X base 0 My thoughts are that the treatment X 0 is .47% less likely to show positive savings? Is it always 0 being the base in the binary or categorical? can I get stats model to give 0- 2 or 0-3 as Odds Ratio as well?
