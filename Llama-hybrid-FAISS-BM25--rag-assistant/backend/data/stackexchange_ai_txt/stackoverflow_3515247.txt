How to Autocalculate CSS of an element

I'm not so good at css, so I would like to if this is possible. Let's say I am not happy with the position of an element, I want to move it from left to right; however I want to use drag and drop so the stylesheet automatically updates. I am using Google Chrome, and would like to know if this is possible via Google Chrome Developer tools, or Firefox Web Developer toolbar. Thank you.
