How to connect to arbitary DOM elements using draggable in jQuery?

I've found a article that explains how to connect draggable elements to sortable ones: http://the-stickman.com/files/jquery/draggable-sortable.html But what I need is to connect draggable elements to arbitary DOM elements, I need to do something when I drop it on some element. But how know the element that the draggable is on when I drop it?
