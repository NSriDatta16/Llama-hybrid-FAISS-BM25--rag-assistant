Running JUnit Test in parallel on Suite Level?

I have a bunch of tests that are organized in JUnit test suites. These tests are greatly utilizing selenium to test a web application. So, naturaly for selenium, the runtime of these tests is quite long. Since the test classes in the suites can not run parallel due some overlaps in the test database, i would like to run the suites parallel. The JUnit ParallelComputer can only execute tests on class or method level in parallel, are there any standard ways for JUnit to do that with suites? If i just pass suite classes to the junit runner and configure the computer to parallelize on class level, it picks the test classes itself, not the suites. br Frank
