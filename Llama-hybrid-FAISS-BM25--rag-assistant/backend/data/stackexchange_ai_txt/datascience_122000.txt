Yes, it is appropriate to evaluate each approach using k-fold cross-validation without retraining the model and compare the results to determine the best approach. In your scenario, you have three different approaches for linear regression: 1.Using all features as inputs: This is the baseline approach where you include all available features as inputs for your linear regression model. 2.Manual feature selection: In this approach, you manually select the most correlated feature and use it as the input for your linear regression model. This is a way to investigate if a specific feature has a strong relationship with the target variable. 3.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original features into a set of orthogonal components. In this approach, you would use the principal components as inputs for your linear regression model, reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. To compare these three approaches, you can perform k-fold cross-validation for each approach, where the data is divided into k folds, and the model is trained and evaluated k times using different train-test splits. This helps to estimate the performance of each approach and assess its generalization capabilities. By evaluating each approach using cross-validation, you can obtain performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared, and compare these metrics across the different approaches. You can then select the approach that achieves the best performance on average across the cross-validation folds. Remember to appropriately set the value of k in k-fold cross-validation based on the size of your dataset and the desired trade-off between computation time and estimation accuracy.
