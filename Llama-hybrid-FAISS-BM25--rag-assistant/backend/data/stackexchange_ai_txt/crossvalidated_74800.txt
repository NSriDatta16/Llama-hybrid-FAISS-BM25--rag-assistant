It is less general than your problem, but I think this article may help: Ridge Estimators in Logistic Regression . Basically, instead of maximizing the (log-)likelihood $L$, you maximize $$ L_\lambda(\beta) = L(\beta) - \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2 .$$ This regularization increases all the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, so it is not so far away from what you are doing right now.
