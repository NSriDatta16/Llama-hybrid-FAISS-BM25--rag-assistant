I have always found real-time filtering to be pleasant to work with and narrow down things. This can require your users to be somewhat computer literate though... Furthermore I would consider something with D&D. I would imagine two lists (one with projects and one with modules) where I can multiselect on either list and drag a single item from the other list to that selection. And if it is going to be an interface that's going to be heavily/repeatedly used, consider good keyboard support. Me personally find that repetetive tasks can be done MUCH faster if they can be accessed by hotkeys. Just thinking out loud ...
