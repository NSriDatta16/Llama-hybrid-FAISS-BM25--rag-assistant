Get a single entity from a magento model collection

I'm encountering an issue because I'm sure I'm not doing this correctly with my programming. I have created a custom model in Magento. In the database table of my model there are several entities with the same attributes... I need to pick just one from all these entities with the same attribute that I have. For the moment I did this: $myvariable = Mage::getModel('test/test')->getCollection() ->setOrder('idserialkeys', 'asc') ->addFilter('idproduit', 1) ->addFilter('utilise', 0) ->addFilter('customerid', 0) ->addFilter('numcommande', 0) From this loading I have around a hundred results but I need to update only one of these, so just after I'm doing: ->setPageSize(1); The problem is that I need a foreach after to update my entity foreach($mavaribale as $modifiemoi) { // Update of my entity because of course there is only one } As you can see I'm obliged to do a loop (for each) even if I have a setPagesize ... I would like to avoid this loop to optimize my code.
