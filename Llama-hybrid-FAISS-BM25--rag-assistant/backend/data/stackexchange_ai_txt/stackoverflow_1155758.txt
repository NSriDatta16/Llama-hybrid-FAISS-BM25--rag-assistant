DB non-clustered Index on event log date DESC a bad idea?

We have a SQL table that is populated with events from our website (mostly error logging and the like.) The table has several text fields that contain all of the information about the type of event, and a date/time field that shows when the event was logged. The table is fairly large and grows by around 10-100 records per day. Obviously, when going through this log, we often are looking for the most recent items, so I figured an obvious way to improve our search times would be to add a index to the date field. Me, I figured that while either ASC or DESC would both be great, DESC would be better since that's the way we're searching most of the time. Our DB guy said "no way"...it would be really bad, because the index table would rapidly become fragmented. I could see why you wouldn't want to have a clustered index on date DESC, because you'd constantly be trying to insert at the beginning...but I thought with a non-clustered index it would be okay, since the records wouldn't need to be moved around. But what he's saying also makes sense...still would have to move indexes around. But how much? And how big of a hit would it be? And even if it isn't much of a hit, maybe it's still not worth it because the performance on occasional selects just couldn't improve that much? Thoughts?
