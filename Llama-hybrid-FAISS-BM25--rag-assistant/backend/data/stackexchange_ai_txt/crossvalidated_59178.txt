As a general principle: 0) you keep the sufficient statistics and the current ML estimates 1) when you get new data, update the sufficient statistics and the estimates 2) When you don't have sufficient statistics you'll need to use all of the data. 3) Typically you don't have closed-form solutions; use the previous MLEs as the starting point, use some convenient optimization method to find the new optimum from there. You may need to experiment a bit to find which approaches make the best tradeoffs for your particular kinds of problem instances. If your problem has a special structure, you can probably exploit it.
