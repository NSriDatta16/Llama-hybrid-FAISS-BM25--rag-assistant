Using 2 nodes in the output sigmoid activation function for 2 mutually exclusive classes is somehow giving good results than softmax

I know for two mutually exclusive classes softmax is the best activation function in the output layer. However, somehow (2, softmax) and even (1,sigmoid) are giving average results and (2, sigmoid) as output layer is giving excellent results (in terms of validation and test set accuracy). But, as per my understanding, using (2, sigmoid) in the output layer for mutually exclusive classes is not logically correct. I don't understand why in my case (2,sigmoid) is giving better results than (2, softmax). Have any one encountered similar results? Also, an interesting observation is that my two mutually exclusive classes are very complex. i.e., although they are mutually exclusive but its very difficult to put them in any of the classes in the training data and there will be some instances where it could have been any of the two. Would (2,sigmoid) be justified given the complexity of the classes ?
