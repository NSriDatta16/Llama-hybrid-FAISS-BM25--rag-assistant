Just Don't take this advice blindly: The subjects you have mentioned in mathematics are core to solving problems using machine learning/Deep learning, programming is a tool to implement all this theory that you learn and on that basis you create your hypotheses and then test by implementing it in code for that you do not need coding skills of a coder you should know the data structures of your use especially data frames and tensor manipulation and rest you will learn while implementing. The best part with you is you have the foundational knowledge of mathematics(I am assuming you know probability statistics multivariate calculus, functional analysis and the rest of the subjects you mentioned I won't go into detail since you already are doing a Ph.D.) That is essential in understanding Ml algorithms and how they work when you understand the algorithm to every bits and pieces, after that it is just a matter of one day for you to implement ,So coding part aside I personally would say with your mathematical background I would give deep learning a try because neural networks are very complex systems or a very big composite function with millions of parameters and this is the best place to apply your mathematics knowledge of optimization, topology, functions, multivariate calculus and statistics and probability. I would suggest you go through all the courses from Fast.ai taught by Jeremy Howard(he is literally god of deep learning) his course on practical deep learning for coders is packed with knowledge apart from that for core understanding of the mathematics behind neural networks you can go and read a blog by Michael Nielsen called neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com its actually a book and a great one and you will love the mathematical explanation and for more understanding you can always go and read at Chris olah's blog its just great. So now the thing is you can still get many research internships and go and learn there in an industrial environment but I would rather suggest you, give yourself some time go through these courses get a grip of the matter and with the mathematics behind you, you are ready to do anything. See, data science right now is like everyone wants to be one and just get that 6 digit salary and be done but it is not like that data science is not something you can learn all at once it takes time, data science is a toolkit that provides you with tools so to learn how to use these tools you will have to use them for that you will have to apply them in real-life projects and then you will learn that data science is not coding ut coding is a part to it you will learn it and become better and better as you practice solving more problems and for that you have kaggle its a great community. So, give yourself some time be patient and just keep solving keep reading literature papers on the latest topics that are now made available freely now, so keep going.
