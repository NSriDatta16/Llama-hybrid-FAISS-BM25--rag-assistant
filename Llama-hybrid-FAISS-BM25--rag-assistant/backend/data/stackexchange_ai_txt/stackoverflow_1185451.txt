There are a number of programs you can purchase that will do this (google "convert midi to WAV"), but I've never come across publically-available .Net code that does this (I think some of these programs are written in .Net, but the source code is not available). I have an online friend who is working on a commercial MIDI-to-WAV converter, but it isn't in .Net and it won't be open source. As Robert Harvey mentioned, this is not a simple task at all, as it basically involves writing your own software synthesizer (a task after my own heart).
