Cross validation or EM for selecting strength of the prior?

Often when I'm looking at bayesian analyses, the influence of the prior is chosen via cross validation. For example, suppose $X$ and $Y$ represent some real valued data that I want perform a bayesian linear regression on to estimate $Y$ from $X$ . This can be formulated as: ${\hat a} = argmin_a \ \sum_i \|y_i-ax_i\|^2_2 + \lambda \| a^Ta \|$ The sum of squares loss imposes the model $p(y|x,a) = \mathbb{N}(y|\mu_y + ax, \Sigma_{yy} - a^T\Sigma_{xx}a)$ and regularization an isotropic gaussian on $A$ that $p(a) = \mathbb{N}(a| 0, \lambda^{-1} I)$ . So this is equivalent to the objective $\hat{a} = argmax_{a} \ \log \ p({\bf y}, a|{\bf x}, \lambda)$ $ \ \ = argmax_{a} \ \log \ p(a| \lambda) \Pi_i \ p(y_i|x_i,a) $ In cross validation - you might initialize $\lambda$ to many different parameters to pick the one with the best out-of-sample error. But I thought this just looked like a bit of a dirty hack. Would it be better to maximize the model evidence, i.e. marginalize out $a$ (resulting in a more complex optimization involving expectation-maximization)? This is, for the first step of choosing $\lambda$ $ {\hat \lambda} = argmax_{\lambda} \ \log \ \ p({\bf y}| {\bf x}, \lambda)$ $ \ \ = argmax_{\lambda} \ \log \ \int \ p({\bf y}, a| {\bf x}, \lambda)da$ $ \ \ = argmax_{\lambda} \ \log \ \int p(a| \lambda) \Pi_i \ p(y_i|x_i,a)da$ Once $\lambda$ has been selected via this procedure, choose $a$ by ${\hat a} = argmin_a \ \sum_i \|y_i-ax_i\|^2_2 + {\hat \lambda} \| a^Ta \|$ without the need for a cross-validation step as $\lambda$ has already been chosen. This has the benefit of accounting for the best $\lambda$ over all possible values of $a$ , weighted by what values of $a$ are most probable. Cross validation is elegant in a sense of efficiently using the data but it feels unnecessarily frequentist. My question is: is EM a valid technique for selecting $\lambda$ in this setting or does this suffer from any statistical shortcomings not present with cross validation?
