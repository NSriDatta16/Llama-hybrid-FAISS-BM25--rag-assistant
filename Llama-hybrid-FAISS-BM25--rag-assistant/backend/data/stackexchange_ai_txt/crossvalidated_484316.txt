After thinking about this a bit I would propose the following: 1 - simply plot a histogram to see if fires are occurring closer to forests. Looking at the shape would be a first sniff-test. 2 - if the histogram is suggesting the pattern is present, then I would be asking, “is this coincidence or real?”. My biggest question is from the fact that not all parcels of land are created equally. I would want to also look at other questions like: How much vegetation is on the land; Is there a road on the land where someone could throw a lit cigarette out their car window; and Etc. If you don’t have this info, but you have a picture, you could simply use RGB values as surrogates. Then, I would throw all those variables into a logistic regression. With y being fire/no fire and X’s being the predictor variables including distance the the nearest forest. You might want to look into a GLMM where image could be the random effect. If the coefficient on distance looks reasonably significant, then you’re looking good and you have controlled for some confounding covariates. Now, the probability of fire as a function of distance to a forest may not be linear. But I still think the regression approach would be reasonable. This is just my 2 cents on an approach. Hope this helps with your project!
