Well , When it comes to AI I am an absolute beginner but here is my answer to your question based on my understandings : a perceptron has only one activation function, therefore it can return only the values of true and false (in most cases true=0 and false=1), so because of that, I don't think that you will be able to accomplish your goal using only one perceptron but you can absolutely do it using multiple perceptrons which essentially is a neural networks, of course training the network would be a lot harder than calculating the changes of weights as you do in perceptrons, You are gonna have to take advantage of a training algorithm such as backpropagation and a sigmoid activation function. I hope my answer was helpful.
