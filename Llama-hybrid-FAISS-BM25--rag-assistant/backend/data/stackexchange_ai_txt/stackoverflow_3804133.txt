Pay attention to Marcs warning about it not being supported (and the alternatives provided by Oleg). Since office automation (at least the way it sounds like you are using it) basically invokes the program (you see it in the task mgr) but with visibility set to false it will NOT work on Server Core. You would have to be able to install and run office (which you can't on core). http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd184076.aspx "You also can't use it for running Microsoft Office System applications or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. And you can't (or at least shouldn't) use it to run custom applications you've developed in-house".
