OO or not OO is not a question!! Question is where OO and where NOT OO . All advantages of OO approach (OOD and OOP) can be fully exploited as long as you are in customer name space. However every access to SAP standard functionality creates huge headaches. Transactional integrity, object consistency and synchronisation, DB commits, screens (module pools and selection screens), authority checks, batch-input. These are just some of objects that is difficult (or even impossible) to integrate in OO approach. Integration of SAP standard modules moves this to even higher level of complexity. User-exits, Events: Most of data are provides in interface. Access to customer specific data or customisation can be placed in objects. Reports: Most of data will be read by standard FM. Specific data processing can be placed in objects. Can be easy reused in others reports. SAP enjoy controls can be wrapped with object shell for easy using und reusing. Screens can NOT be palces in objects. :-((( Core processing: Replacing of SAP business object maintenance or SAP processes is not encouraged by SAP. But if this is a case by patient and ready for huge effort. Lets look closer. There are a lot of technichal challanges: singleton pattern, optimisation of DB access, locking, synchronisation, etc. Separation of technical and business functionality should be adressed. Objets are not really suitable for mass procesing (high DB load) therefore mass processing should be adressed.
