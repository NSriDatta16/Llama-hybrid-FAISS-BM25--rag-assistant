The p value for the random forest regression model

So I was asked by a reviewer to provide the "P-value" for my random forest regression model. I tried to do some research on this, and only found methods to produce p values for each split condition (like in 'party' package), and p-values for variable importance (like in 'rfPermute' package). I find it hard to trust the p-values for variable importance since some very important variables have p-values of >0.9. Any input on how to generate the general "p-value" for random forest (if there is one) would be appreciated.
