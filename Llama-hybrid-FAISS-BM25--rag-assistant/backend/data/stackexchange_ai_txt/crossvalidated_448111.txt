Stationarity of Time Series with $\cos(\pi t)$ in it

So I have a time series $Y_t = 1 + \cos(\pi t)X_0$ where $X_t$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$ and I'm trying to determine it's stationarity. But I'm not sure about some of this math here. So far I have: $E[Y_t]= E[1]+E[\cos(\pi t)X_0]=1+0=1$ and then for the covariance function: $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-k})=E[(1 + \cos(\pi t)X_0)(1 + \cos(\pi (t-k))X_0)\\= 1 + E[\cos(\pi t)X_0] +E[\cos(\pi (t-k))X_0] = 1+0+0=1 $ but I'm not sure if I've done this correctly. If I had to guess though, this time series would be stationary because of the nature of most cyclical functions and $cos(\pi t)$ looks stationary in it's variance
