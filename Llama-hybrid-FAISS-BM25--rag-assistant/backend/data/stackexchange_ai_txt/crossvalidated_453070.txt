Firstly, why are you only using one classifier? See this answer on data mining theorems and problems with using one classifier. You should be using linear regression first, possibly followed by logistic regression, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, etc. You should also be considering use of an ensemble of classifiers based on majority committee voting. You should also consider cross-validation. Take a look at the different ROC-AUC curves from different classifiers here
