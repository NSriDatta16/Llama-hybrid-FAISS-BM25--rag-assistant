I would suggest you to use sonar . Sonar gives you different metrics on your code base. Like * Respect of coding rules violations * Density of documented API * Density of duplicated Code * Level of code coverage by Unit Tests * Density of potential bugs * Complexity distribution I would also suggest you to look at Find Bugs . Sonar and Find Bugs will be a good place to start. If you are looking specifically at performance. Here is a plugin that I found .( I have not used it) We use performance testers for this kind of work, so never thought of incorporating it into the build. Though we do performance testing on developers desktops.
