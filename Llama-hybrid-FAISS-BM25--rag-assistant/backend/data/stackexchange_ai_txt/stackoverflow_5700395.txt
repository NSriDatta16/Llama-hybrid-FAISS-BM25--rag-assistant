How to handle both CLICK and MouseDown events in Flex?

I have a scenario where I am listening to both CLICK and MouseDown events for an object. On MouseDown I do a startDrag() . And on Click, I perform something else. But the problem is that, MouseDown event fires first and it initiates a drag. The click event does not fire. How do I solve this issue?
