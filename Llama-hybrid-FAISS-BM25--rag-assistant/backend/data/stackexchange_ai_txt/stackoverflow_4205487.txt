Rather than have a big file containing all the data can you not break it down into lots of smaller files. (One for each city?) You could have a separate file to keep an index of them all if need be. Alternatively, depending on the naming of the files, you may be able to use IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames to get a list of all files.
