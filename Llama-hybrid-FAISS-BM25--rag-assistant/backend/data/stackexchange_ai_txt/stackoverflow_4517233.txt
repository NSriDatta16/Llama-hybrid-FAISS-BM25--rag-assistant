Some grid implementations, like DevExpress XtraGrid, allow you to have unbound columns and easily provide values for them. The same thing would involve some hacking with a basic DataGridView, so I have an other suggestion. Add a new read-only property to your class: decimal value1 { get; set; } decimal value2 { get { return Math.Round(value1, 2); } } This way you don't even have to bother with the column display format.
