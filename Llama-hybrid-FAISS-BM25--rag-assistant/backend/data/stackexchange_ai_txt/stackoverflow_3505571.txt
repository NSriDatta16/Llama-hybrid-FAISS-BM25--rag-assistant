functionality similar to twitter using codeigniter

I will first tell you my scenario, in my problem there are two users of the system one who is using the system to register people to it, and another person who use the system to check the registered users in the system. this is a hospital scenario, people register at the registration desk and in the registration order doctor checks the patients. so what i want to achieve is a UI for the doctor which displays the patient details system got registered, to keep the UI simple i want to load 10 patient details at a given time but if patients are not in that list of ten i need to give a button to load more patient details, but i want to give the function to the doctor to check the older, missed patients also! i checked some pagination articles but they doesn't match my requirement, any suggestion to read guys? blog post? or help with the coding ? regards, Rangana
