Oh man, IE fun. I'm a mac person, so let's see how much I'll be able to help with this voodoo... Have you tried using a different image format, eg: png? See if you can find another website with an image background and load it in IE to see if it behaves similarly. If not, try stealing the image they use and setting it as your own page background to see if it's the image that is the problem. Also, is there any reason why it has to be so big? I find that if you want a gradient background like that, you can get away with having the image be 600-700 px tall and setting the background-color to whatever the bottom gradient color is. You may also like to set the background to fixed Edit : Now that I look at this, I'm pretty sure this happens across the board when some browsers are loading images. It usually flashes the color of the background, and then displays the image a split second later. There might not be anything you can do about it. Try finding other examples, eg: wikipedia . Often it's less noticeable because the background color and the image color aren't very different. I would encourage you not to worry about it. I don't think your users are going to be stressing about it.
