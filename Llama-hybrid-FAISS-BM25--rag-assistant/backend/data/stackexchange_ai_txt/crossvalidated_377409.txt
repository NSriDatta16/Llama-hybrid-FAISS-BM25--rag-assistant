Time Series Prediction Model for Home Prices

I am building a time series model to predict the zillow home prices for march 2019.I have data for each zip code from the year 1993 - 2018 and i have prices for every month.I was trying to use ARIIMA Model since there is no seasonality in the data.But the problem is there are a lot of missing values for the years 1993-2006,but there are no missing values from 2006.So should i consider only the data from 2006-2018 and use ARIIMA to predict prices for march 2019? If i do this I would be wasting the data which i have from 1993-2006.I guess there should be an alternate way.Please give me suggestions I had a suggestion to use state space implementation to deal with the missing values: How can use this? Can i include that as a parameter in ARIIMA?
