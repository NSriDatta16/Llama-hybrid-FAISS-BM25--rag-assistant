Because of the way the WebBrowser control is built you'll need to track scrolling in Javascript then pass the location to managed code to handle storage of that value. On resuming you'll need to have the managed code pass the scroll position to a Javascript function to reset the scroll position. That's the theory but I haven't looked at the funcitonality around javascript scrolling events in the WebBrowser yet. That's the only place I can see possible problems. Would be good to hear how you get on.
