EDIT : This answer assumes that, as written, this was an example of a data sleuthing exercise. However, comments reveal a much different scenario plays out here. This is an example of Munchausen's Statistical Grid in reverse. The question then becomes: how many subjects do I have to remove before the result is no longer statistically significant ? And the answer is (if I can deliberately remove high influence/high leverage observations) not that many! This is at it should be, an ideal study is powered commensurately with its effect size. For instance, if I want 90% power to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level, I should be plenty pleased with my sample size calculation if after conducting my trial I reject the null only just at that level. Any sample fewer and I fail to reject the null. Any sample in excess and I have spent too much money or time on my study. Removing observations reduces power. This is not interesting. I would respond that deletion diagnostics are useful for identifying high leverage and high influence observations HOWEVER without a preplanned analysis to remove those observations, the results of doing so are meaningless.
