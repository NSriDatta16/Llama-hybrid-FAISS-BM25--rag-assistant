The only optimization that is simple would be reducing object creation, which will make a modest improvement in performance. Instead of using listFiles() , which creates a whole slew of File objects, use list() to get a String array of just the file names, not the paths, and create the URLs directly. String creation and storage will have less object overhead in this case. The string manipulation could obviously be made faster and more proper as well, although it probably won't make a huge difference. Something like: ArrayList urls = new ArrayList (); //or use an array if you prefer. for(String name: f.files()) urls.add(new URL("file://"+f.getPath()+"/"+name));
