Best Password Management Software for Development Group - looking for suggestions

Our development and consulting teams (about 25 people) are looking for software to manage all of the passwords we have for our organization and for our clients. We looked at Keepass but it is not truly a database system nor does it have support for multiple concurrent updates. Needs: -Uses database (versus shared text / XML file) -Ability to segment passwords by project / role / individuals Wants (but not required): -Web based -Mobile support Anybody have a good recommendation? Thanks in advance! -Sig
