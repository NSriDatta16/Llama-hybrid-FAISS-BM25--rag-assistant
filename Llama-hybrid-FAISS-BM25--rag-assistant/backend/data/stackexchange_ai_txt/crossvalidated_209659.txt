Robustness of GLM to link function

When I first learned about GLMs I was taught that the link function wasn't that important so long as the domain and codomain match up. For instance, in a logistic regression we certainly need $g: (0,1) \rightarrow \mathbb R$ but beyond that we don't much care. I also learned that the canonical link makes the math easier but doesn't much matter beyond that. More recently, though, I've encountered cases where the link function is estimated. If my teachers were right in that the results are generally robust to the link function, why would we ever want to go to all the effort of estimating it?
