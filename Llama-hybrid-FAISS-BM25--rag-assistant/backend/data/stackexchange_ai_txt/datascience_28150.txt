Can I analyze Video in AI?

For those who do AI or Machine Learning, is it possible to analyze video? For example, here’s a tidbit from an article I’ve been reading: in basketball, data can help coaches determine if a player executed a jump shot well because he was skilled, the pass was good or the defense was bad. If he is skilled, he can be used to lead key strategies. If the pass is good, it identifies players that work well together and use them for the same. If the defense is bad, coaches can strategize plays that take advantage of this weakness. How would I measure this with AI? I’d like to find the true value of a high school player and how they’d affect their college team.
