Do you have coding standards? Yes, differs from project to project. What does it cover? Code(class, variable, method, constant), SQL naming and formatting convention Is it being followed by everyone? Yes, every new entrant in project could be asked to create a demo project following organization coding convention then it gets reviewed. This exercise makes developer feel at ease before starting real job. And what do you do (if anything) to make sure everybody is following the standard? Use StyleCop and FxCop to ensure they are religiously followed. It would show up as warning/error if code fails to comply with organization coding convention. Visual Studio Team system has nice code anlysis and check-In policies which would prevent developers checking in code that does not comply Hope, it helps Thanks, Maulik Modi
