I have used Bullseye Coverage on Symbian and it is very good. The only problem is that it only runs on emulator and not hardware. Therefore you would not be able to get coverage metrics from a device or devboard. If your app runs on both hardware and emulator, this won't be a big deal (apart from the standard differences between running on emulator vs hardware). Also, as there are plans to replace the emulator with a proper hardware simulator, perhaps bullseye wouldn't be the best choice.
