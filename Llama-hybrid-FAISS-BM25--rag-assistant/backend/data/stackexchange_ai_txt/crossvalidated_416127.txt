Variable disappearing in SPSS

I am new to SPSS, so any help is appreciated. I am performing a binary logistic regression analysis using the categorical variable of ethnicity/race, among other things. There are six examples of race that include test subjects. I have properly recoded them into different variables under the Transition tab. When I include all six of them, they all show up under Box 0 as a variable not included in the equation. However, the last one, regardless of what it is, does not show up as a variable included in the equation under Box 1. Basically, I cannot get all six races to show up at the same time...unless I remove the constant. However, the results are highly highly suspect when I do that. I need help keeping the constant in and having all six races included in the final analysis under Box 1.
