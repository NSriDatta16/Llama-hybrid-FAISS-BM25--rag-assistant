Database design guidance needed

A dairy farmer, who is also a part-time cartoonist, has several herds of cows. He has assigned each cow to a particular herd. In each herd, the farmer has one cow that is his favorite - often that cow is featured in a cartoon. A few malcontents in each herd, mainly those who feel they should have appeared in the cartoon, disagree with the farmer's choice of a favorite cow, whom they disparagingly refer to as the sacred cow. As a result, each herd now has elected a herd leader. This is what I think the tables should look like can you let me know if it can be done better? So far I'm doing a many to many using the favorite table as the intermediate is this the best possible solution also no SQL statements are needed this is just for design purposes. Thank you in advance Table Herd Table Favorite Table Cartoon Table Cow PK herdID Intermediate Table PK cartoonID PK cowID herdname cartoonTitle cowName herdleader cartoonType cartoonDate edited image @ 3:01pmEST is this correct? cowErd http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/1268/capture3h.png added new image @ 8:57am 7/20/2010 can some one critique this ERD please Erd2 http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/5794/capture3fc.png added new image @ 12:47pm 7/20/2010 unless there's any objections this is the final draft per Mark's explanation mark ERD http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/691/capture4b.png
