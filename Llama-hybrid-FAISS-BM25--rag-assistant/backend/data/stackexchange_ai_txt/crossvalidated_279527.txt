The idea is that Neural Networks don't need to be supplied with handcrafted features. If you give someone else your generated data, without telling them the underlying process, they will have direct access to just x1, x2, and y. Feeding x1 and x2 into the network and instructing it to predict y should make the network model the underlying process. However, it might need a lot of examples before it is accurately able to do so.
