Well, one thing that isn't represented in your example above is that you didn't give a name to your App instance, even though it's a required field (grails fields are nullable:false by default unless you explicitly tell it otherwise). I bet if you check app.hasErrors() After your app.save(), that you'll see it does have errors that you can list in the app.errors collection. Otherwise, what you have is fine, and this code worked fine for me with the domain objects you have above: AppCategory appCat = new AppCategory(name: "blah") appCat.save() assert !appCat.hasErrors() App app = new App(name: "testApp") app.addToCategories(appCat) app.save() assert !app.hasErrors()
