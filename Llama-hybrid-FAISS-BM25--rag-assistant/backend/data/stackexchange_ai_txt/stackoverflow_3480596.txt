You need to narrow down your problem: When exactly does this happen? What SQL query is being executed that causes the problem?? Once you have the query - look at what the query does; check those tables - are you possibly converting a VARCHAR field into a numeric value, and some values aren't all numeric? Or are you reading data using a SqlDataReader and you're not paying attention to the fact the data contained in SQL Server might not be what you expect??
