I do not believe you can get IE to render CMYK encoded images. To avoid manually changing them, you could put a filter on the site to automatically convert them but I would assume that the quality would suffer. CMYK encoding is typcally used for print, which as quality requirements that are overkill for the web. With a decent quality photo editing tool, such as photoshop, you should be able to get decent, web quality, versions of these photos using RGB encidong.
