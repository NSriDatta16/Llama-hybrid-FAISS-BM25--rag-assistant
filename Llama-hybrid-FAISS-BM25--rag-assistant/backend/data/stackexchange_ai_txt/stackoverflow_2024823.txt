draggable accuracy in jQuery

Hi: I am running of a problem when I am trying to make a special drag drop in JQuery.In few words. from the link above you can see that when we drag the boxes to the dropping areas (the left red boxes) they ( I mean the droppable boxes) does not seem to be activated unless the dragged box reach the center of the target ( the droppable box) element which is seem to be a problem in the JQuery itself !? Another thing, which is there is no control over the draggables element as they hover upon the droppables, for example, Can I make the draggables ( not the droppable ) become small AS THEY ENTER THE DROPPABLE AREAS ! Any help, ideas, or clues will be highly appreciated. Many thanks in advance.
