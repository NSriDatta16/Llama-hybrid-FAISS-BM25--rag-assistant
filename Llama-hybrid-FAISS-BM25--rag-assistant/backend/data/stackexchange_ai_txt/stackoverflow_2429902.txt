Firefox drags div like it was an image

I'm using this HTML,CSS and Javascript code (in one document together if you want to test it out): #slider_container { width: 200px; height: 30px; background-color: red; display:block; } #slider { width: 20px; height: 30px; background-color: blue; display:block; position:absolute; left:0; } $(document).ready(function() { $("#slider").mousedown(function() { $(document).mousemove(function(evnt) { $("#test").html("sliding"); }).mouseup(function() { $("#test").html("not sliding"); $(document).unbind("mousemove mouseup"); });}); }); a Everything (surprisingly) works fine in IE, but firefox seems to totally clusterf*ck when this javascript is used. The first "slide" is okay, you drag, it says "sliding", you drop, it says "not sliding". On the second "slide" (or mousedown if you will), firefox suddenly thinks the div is an image or link and wants to drag it around. Screenshot of the dragging: Obviously the blue div half-positioned in the red div is the one being dragged. Windows does not capture the cursor when you take a screenshot, but it's a stop sign. Is there someway to prevent this default behaviour?
