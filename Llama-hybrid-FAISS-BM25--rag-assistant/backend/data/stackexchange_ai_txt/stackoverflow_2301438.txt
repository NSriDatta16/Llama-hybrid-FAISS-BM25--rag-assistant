In the spirit of full disclosure, I haven't developed in Delphi since 2005. However, I developed in Delphi exclusively starting with Delphi 1 in 1996, and was certified in Delphi 5 in 2001. That being said, my use of the finalization section was rare. The only time I would use it is if I needed to set up something special in the .dpr. That typically only occurred if I was doing custom component development, AND there were some dependencies that I needed to manage using other custom components I was developing. For typical application development, I stayed away from the initialization/finalization section and just used design patterns like singletons, facades and factories to manage the creation and management of my classes. The built-in garbage collector was good enough for 98.5% of my projects. To answer your question, you need to set up a dependency on TFoo in your UnitA code, and, as Ryan suggested, make sure it's assigned prior to destruction. That being said, I encourage you to make sure that the use of the initialization/finalization section is necessary before you invest too much time with it.
