Use Groups to organise your code into modules. Remember that you can put almost everything into multiple groups so they can be used to provide semantic tagging like the tags in Stack Overflow. For example, you might tag things as specific to a given platform. You can also use groups to match a folder hierarchy within an IDE , as shown in my RB2Doxy sample output . Groups work well when nested - I have a large example for the OOFILE source .
