If you want something easy go for http://anemone.rubyforge.org/ If you want something fast, code something with eventmachine/em-http-request I found redis to be a great multi purpose tool for queue management, caching and so on. You could also use specialized things like beanstalkd/active mq/... but at least in my use case, I didn't really find them to be a big advantage compared to redis. Especially the load on the backend system could be a bottleneck, so chose your database carefully and pay attention to what you save
