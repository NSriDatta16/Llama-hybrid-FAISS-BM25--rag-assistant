When you delete rows from the database, you're not really: Freeing up the disk space Resetting the auto_increment values as you've noticed. As such, it might actually be a better idea to drop the table and re-create it as required. Failing that you can use just either: TRUNCATE ; (Depending on your storage engine, this will actually drop/re-create as mentioned above for you.) ALTER TABLE SET AUTO_INCREMENT = X; Of these, I'd recommend using the truncate approach.
