I am quite sure you you would like to 'fire' an exception in your case. This more of a validation logic issue such AOP code contracts concept. But if you really like to create an event for it you have to at least: 1) create an event storage variable in your label class public event EventHandler MassChanged; 2) in your property (note that you loose the ability to use code gen functions of c# 3 for which 'auto' implement the field to store your Mass property value) public bool Mass { get { return _mass; } set { // check if value is invalid (0 or less) && that event subscribers exist if(value 3) create an event handler of type EventHandler Best to read the msdn article for events: link text Again I am pretty sure you are not handling exceptions properly in the app if you need an event for this. I mean there is nothing wrong but events are usually not used as means of value validations.
