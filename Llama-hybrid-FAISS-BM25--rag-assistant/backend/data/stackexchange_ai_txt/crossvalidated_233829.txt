Basically you are asking how can we check the logistic regression model is "under-fitting" / has high "bias". This is a very reasonable question for logistic regression. This is because it is a linear model that usually has high "bias" and could suffer from "under-fitting". One way to check if the model is "under-fitting" or "over-fitting" is plot "learning curve". Such method is not limited to logistic regression. But in logistic regression, you may want to care more about under-fitting but not over-fitting. Details can be found in my answer here How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance? If two curves are "close to each other" and both of them but have a low score. The model suffer from an under fitting problem (High Bias) If training curve has a much better score but testing curve has a lower score, i.e., there are large gaps between two curves. Then the model suffer from an over fitting problem (High Variance) Here are two examples of under fitting and over fitting. Back to your question, if you plot learning curve and found the model has high bias, i.e, two curves are close and both has "low performance", then it is "lack of fit".
