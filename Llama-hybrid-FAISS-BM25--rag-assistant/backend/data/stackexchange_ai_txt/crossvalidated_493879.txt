Deep learning is largely based on heuristics today. There are no hard answers for broad questions. So a CNN starts with filters with random values but I do not understand how the filters become what they are, I mean how a filter A becomes a detector for straight lines, or how a Filter B becomes a detector for curves. Optimization. When you present data and perform gradient descent, these types of Gabor-like filters tend to appear naturally in the first layers, implicating these forms are useful for natural images (the mammal visual system also use similar forms). There's no guarantee though. The other thing is who is telling me how many filter the CNN should have? Is it just intuition or just testing? Objectively? You. You could, ideally, perform hyper-parameter tuning to decide that, or alternatively architectural search. The point is, never base such a decision on performance in validation/testing sets, that's the greatest sin in machine learning. Whats about the filter size, in many example I saw that the dimensions of the filters 3x3, but why not 5x5 or other dimensions? Again, heuristics. Keep in mind that two 3x3 filters have the same receptive field of a 5x5 filter. People use 3x3 most often, but many architectures employ many filter sizes as well.
