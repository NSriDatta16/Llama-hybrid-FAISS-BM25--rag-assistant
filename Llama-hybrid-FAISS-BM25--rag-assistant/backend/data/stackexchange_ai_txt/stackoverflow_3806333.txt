Pedro: As others have stated, opening and closing the file repeatedly might be the issue. One solution not mentioned is to keep the file open for the duration of the processing. Once complete, the file can be closed. Or, alternatively, collect your text in a StringBuilder or some other in-memory text storage and then dump the text to the file once the loop finishes.
