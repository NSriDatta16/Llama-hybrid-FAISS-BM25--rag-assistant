Rather than "Am I using a prior that is strong or weak?" (in the sense of concentrated or diffuse over the parameter space), it depends on why you are using that particular prior. Do you actually trust your prior, or was it chosen arbitrarily / for convenience? On the one hand, we may have a well-justified prior (because of sincerely held beliefs; or lots of prior data; or a reference prior that is widely agreed to be useful by people in our scientific domain, like @JohnMadden's beta/binomial example in some fields), and we want to update it with new data. Then even with small n, a Bayesian would OK with the prior having a big effect on the posterior. On the other hand, if we don't have a prior that we trust , and we're just plugging a prior into our calculations for convenience , that's when your concern is valid: When n is small, the posterior can be very sensitive to tiny changes in the prior (even a weakly-informative prior). Due to this sensitivity, using an arbitrary prior just adds noise to your results. For large n, the effect of the prior should wash out. But for small n, if you didn't trust the prior before you saw the data, you shouldn't trust the posterior either. With small n and no reliable prior, instead of a Bayesian analysis---or even a Frequentist analysis (which may just confirm that "The sample is too small to estimate these parameters with adequate precision")---I would just report descriptive statistics / graphs and be very transparent about the study's limitations: due to the sample size, our results cannot safely generalize to the population, etc.
