There's quite a lot of confusion here: The word "features" is a bit vague but it usually refers to the structured information provided as input to a ML system. No, features are not a part a ML model. They are the input used to train a model. No, ML is not "all about obtaining features". Obtaining the features is just the stage of obtaining the information in a usable way, so it's as if you said that "learning" is all about "obtaining a book". In this sentence the author means there are (at least) two stages to this ML process: the first step trains a neural network model, then the values of the hidden states of the NN are collected in order to provide them to a second model which uses them as input features.
