In brief, the KS goodness of fit test (as for many GoF tests) is strongly-powered for larger and larger sample sizes...a concept ofter referred to being "over-powered" in domains were null hypothesis tests are—correctly or not—used to make decisions about equality (such as the use of chi-square tests to assess data-model fit in latent variable models). That is to say, as the sample sizes get larger, the test is going to flag even the smallest deviation from the null hypothesis as statistically significant (whether this difference is pragmatically different or not). And, with a sample size of 100k, this is most definitely why you have such a small p-value. In this context, if your goal is to show that the distributions ARE the same, then the use of the null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) framework may not be your best statistical tool of choice. You may want to use other means to evaluate the nature of the distribution (and comparing the empirical cdf to the hypothesized cdf is a reasonable choice).
