GridSearchCV with TimeSeriesSplit

I am tuning the HPs for a time dependant neural network model (heating energy consumption prediction) in a bachelor thesis. Total amount of samples is 145.860, with minutely granularity from January to August. I read GridSearchCV and TimeSeriesSplit would be useful. However, tuning the HPs shouldn't be done with any test data of my model. If I apply a GridSearchCV(cv=tscv), being tscv my TimeSeriesSplit, each combination of parameters will be trained in every split, and assessed in the respective Test part of the split. Am I correct? If yes, the problem is that I would be using test data to tune HPs. How is the best practice recommendation to gridsearch with cross validation for times series data? (In an academic context).
