Perhaps you could use alternates ( alternate object storage ) mechanism; this would allow sharing object database with other local repository, and then not having to pack them. To set up this, use ' git clone ' using either --shared option if cloning from local repository, or --reference if cloning from remote repository but when you have similar repository locally, or just edit .git/objects/info/alternates file .
