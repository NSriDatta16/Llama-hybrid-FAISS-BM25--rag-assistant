What are some major theories on picking the right number for the sample window size in time series analysis?

for example the number of samples to run the moving average, or the number of samples for sequential hypothesis testing. Or if there is a control scheme going on what is the best time window for an affine controller. or when sampling from a distribution for approximation in stochastic control. This question is especially focused on real-time application and time series analysis where there is some computational cost associated with sampling as much as possible.
