Without much analysing your solution to the problem, i suggest you to check out the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyLoad and AppDomain.AssemblyResolve events for running your code when the assembly resolved or loadded. Another and more elegant solution may be using a static type initializers (static constructor) or Module Initializers . Static type intitializers are called the first time the type is referenced and easy to implement. However, Module Initializers in C# is not a trivial task but you can achive your goal by implementing.
