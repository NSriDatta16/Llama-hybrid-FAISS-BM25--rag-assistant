IntelliJ: how to open files in an existing IntelliJ from the command line

I always have an IntelliJ running. Sometimes I want to open a file from outside IntelliJ. I can drag and drop a file to IntelliJ if am in the Finder, but if I am on the command line on OS X, how can I instruct IntelliJ to open a certain file? I am looking for something similar to the mate command provided by TextMate.
