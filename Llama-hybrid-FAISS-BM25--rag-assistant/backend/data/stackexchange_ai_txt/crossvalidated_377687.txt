Build confidence intervals for random effects in intercept only models

I'm building a Poisson model for a rate between an outcome and an offset (to be precise between the observed and predicted values of a phenomenon). I want to get this rate + confidence intervals (CI) for each observation group. This is the model: mod What should I do to get the rate (not exponentiated) for each group? I know about the dotplot() function to plot the conditional means and confidence intervals of the groups, but I can't understand how it works and I would like to have the raw estimates to do my own plots. I tried extracting the mean and standard error for each group using ranef() and than approximate a CI: est = ranef(mod, condVar = TRUE) $group se = attr(ranef(mod, condVar = TRUE)$ group, 'postVar')[,,] upr = est + 1.96 * se lwr = est - 1.96 * se A second approach I used was through empirical Bayes simulation: s $h_code[,g_name,], c(0.025, .0975)) data.frame(group = code, lwr = q[1], upr = q[2], est = ranef(mod)$ group[g_name,]) }) %>% bind_rows The CI of the first method are way shorter than in the second case and both look different than those produced by the dotplot() function. Furthermore, I have not clear whether I should use ranef() estimates as they are or join them somehow with fixef() estimates. NOTE: I know how to solve this problem using full Bayesian estimation eg. using rstanarm. I was wondering if there was a faster approximate solution using the lme4 framework
