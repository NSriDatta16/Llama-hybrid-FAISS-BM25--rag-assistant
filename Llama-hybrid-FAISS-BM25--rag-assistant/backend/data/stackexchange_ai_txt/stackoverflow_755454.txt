I was investigating a solution to this almost a year ago. I started a few threads on the apple mailing lists: http://www.mail-archive.com/cocoa-dev@lists.apple.com/msg08056.html http://www.mail-archive.com/quartzcomposer-dev@lists.apple.com/msg01878.html http://lists.apple.com/archives/mac-opengl/2008/May/msg00099.html I had to revert to a solution which used CGWindowListCreateImage which took a screen grab of the opengl process window and convert it to a bitmap for display in the main process window. This is far from effeicient since pixel data is transfered from video ram to system ram. I also tried a floating window solution. The opengl process window floated above the main process window and respond to mouse movements from the main window. But I had issues with dragging lag and window z order. You would think NSWindowSharingReadWrite would do what you require, but doumentation/examples back then were practically non existent. But maybe things have changed in the last year. Keep me posted if you find anything new ! Good luck JC
