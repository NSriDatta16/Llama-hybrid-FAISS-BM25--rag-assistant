There is not much more useful optimizing you can do with your example. The call / branch to the do_this and do_that may negate any savings you earned by optimizing an if-then-else statement. One of the rules of performance optimizing is to reduce branches. Most processors prefer to execute sequential code. They can take a chunk of sequential code and haul it into their caches. Branching interrupts this pleasantry and may cause a complete reload of the instruction cache (which loses valuable execution time). Before you micro-optimize at this level, review your design to see if you can: Eliminate unnecessary branching. Split up code so it fits into the cache. Organize the data to reduce fetches from memory or hard drive. I'm sure that the above steps will gain you more performance than optimizing your posted loop.
