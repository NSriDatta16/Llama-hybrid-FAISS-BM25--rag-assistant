They wouldn't really be breeding two neural networks together. Presumably they have a variety of genetic algorithm that produces a particular neural network structure given a particular sequence of "genes". They would start with a population of gene sequences, produce their characteristic neural networks, and then expose each of these networks to the same training regimen. Presumably, some of these networks would respond to the training better than some others (i.e. they would be more easily "trainable" to achieve the desired behavior). They would then take the genetic sequences that produced the best "trainees", cross-breed them with each other, produce their characteristic neural networks, which would then be exposed to the same training regimen. Presumably, some of these neural networks in the second generation would be even more trainable than those from the first generation. These would become the parents of the third generation, and so on and so forth.
