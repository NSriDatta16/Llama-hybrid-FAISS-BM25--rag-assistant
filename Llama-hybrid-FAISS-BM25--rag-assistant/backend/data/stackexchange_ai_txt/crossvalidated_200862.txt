Does the theory fit the given data?

We are given that the members of a community are classified by blood type according to the following schema: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline O& A & B & AB & Total \\ \hline 121 & 120 & 79 & 33 & 353\\ \hline \end{array} We are also given that the probabilities of the above blood types depend on gene frequency parameters $r, p, q$ satisfying the following relations: $$ r + p + q = 1 $$ $$ P(\text{O}) = r^2 $$ $$ P(\text{A}) = p^2 + 2pr $$ $$ P(\text{B}) = q^2 + 2qr $$ $$ P(\text{AB}) = 2pq $$ Finally, we are given the MLEs of the $p,q, r$, which are: $$ \hat{r} = 0.580 $$ $$ \hat{p} = 0.246 $$ $$ \hat{q} = 0.173 $$ My question is, what is the approach to testing if the given community fits the theory. Typically the approach is to use a $\chi^2$ test for goodness of fit but I cannot see how it would apply in this scenario. Any suggestions will be deeply appreciated. UPDATE : It was brought to my attention that I am not exactly stating what aspect of the test I am not understanding. Here is that information: I am assuming that $H_0$ in this case will be that the proposed theory fits the data and $H_1$ that it does not. There does not seem to be a preferred level of significance so I goes 5% should be acceptable (if there is motivation to choose a different one, please let me know) The degrees of freedom will be 3(?) For expected frequencies I should have e.g. $0 \times P(\text{0}) = 121 \times 0.580^2 $ and so on. The observed data is given and the test statistic is easy to compute. Is the summary I have provided the way to tackle this or am I missing some aspect of the problem? UPDATE 2 : It was mentioned to me that the degrees of freedom should be less than 3 because of the MLEs. It is not clear to me how this happens exactly. Could someone elaborate on this aspect of the problem?
