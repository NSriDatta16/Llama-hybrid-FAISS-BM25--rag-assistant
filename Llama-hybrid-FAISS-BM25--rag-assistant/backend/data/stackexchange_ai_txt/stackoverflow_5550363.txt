I've been looking at Redmine: http://www.redmine.org/ As of now, I've only been looking at it for my 2 person company, and as it integrages subversion and other version control system directly into projects, I think it's an OK choise. But as mentioned, I haven't used it in production like environemts yet, but it look well tested. There is also a Turnkey version of it, which is ready to be used as a live CD or in a Virtual Machine: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/redmine /Kristoffer
