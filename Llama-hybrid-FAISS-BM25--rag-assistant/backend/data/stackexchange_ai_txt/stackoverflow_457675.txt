I almost always end up defining n-Tuple classes when I code in Java. For instance: public class Tuple2 { private T1 f1; private T2 f2; public Tuple2(T1 f1, T2 f2) { this.f1 = f1; this.f2 = f2; } public T1 getF1() {return f1;} public T2 getF2() {return f2;} } I know it's a bit ugly, but it works, and you just have to define your tuple types once. Tuples are something Java really lacks. EDIT: David Hanak's example is more elegant, as it avoids defining getters and still keeps the object immutable.
