Welcome to the site! A few things: Your variables do not need to be normally distributed - the ANOVA/ANCOVA and other gaussian linear models just assume that the errors are normally distributed. That is, the noises that is left over after you fit the model. However, if you have 40 continuous variables and you intend to perform individual ANOVA tests for each then you will have serious issue with the family wise error rate - corrections are absolutely possible but you would it would probably be diluted to the point of meaninglessness, especially with post-hoc comparisons. You might be better off with some kind of multivariate analouge of an ANOVA (e.g. MANOVA, or PERMANOVA), although this comes with the catch that you will only get one p-value and it won't be clear which variables differ. Instead, what I would probably recommend is some kind of dimensional compression technique (e.g. Principle Components Analysis) - this will let you reduce the number of dimensions in your data, highlight which variables might have interesting interactions, and then you could still perform a PERMANOVA on the PCA space to see how your groups differ. There are also effective ways to visual the information (e.g. biplots) which can show how the groups differ and their interaction with particular variables. I hope this helps, but feel free to ask if you have any questions. Edit: On the r package front you can use stats in R for PCA's - it should be pre-installed as a base package. Also see the vegan package, as it has some nice functions for conducting PERMANOVA (e.g. adonis2 - PERMANOVA and betadisper - multivariate assumption checks). Lastly, a PERMANOVA as opposed to a MANOVA, relaxes the assumptions of multivariate normality, if that is an issue.
