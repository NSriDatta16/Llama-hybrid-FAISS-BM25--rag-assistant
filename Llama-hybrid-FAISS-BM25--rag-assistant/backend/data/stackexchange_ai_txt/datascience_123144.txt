Open source dataset (manufacturing, machine operations)

I am looking for an open source dataset from the manufacturing domain (sensor data, time series) with specific traits. It should stem from a process consisting of a sequence of distinct machine operations (arbitrary example: drilling - injecting - polishing - drilling) and those should be labelled if possible. I was hoping that one of you is aware of such a dataset and could give me a hint. Thank you.
