Documentation says AS2 and AS3 LocalConnections should communicate no problems. Do you need to look into the allowDomain method? Do you need to put a crossdomain.xml file in place? If you do have swfs on two different domains, pay special attention to the send method documentation, because you you have to add additional info to the send method's connection name. Are they both browser based applications? I not, look into AIR
