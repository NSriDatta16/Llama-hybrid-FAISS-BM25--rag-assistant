Neural network are only "inspired" by the neural structure of our brain, but they are not even close to the complexity of the behaviour of a real neuron (to date there is no neuron model that captures the complexity of a SINGLE neuron, don't even think about a neuronal population...) Although "neural", machine "learning" and other "pseudo-bio" (like "genetic algorithms") terms are very "cool", that does not mean that they are actually based on real biological processes. Just that they may very approximatively remind of a biological situation. NB: of course this does not make them useless! They're very very important in many fields!
