What is the name of this plot that has rows with two connected dots?

I've been reading EIA report and this plot captured my attention. I now want to be able to create the same type of plot. It shows the energy productivity evolution between two years (1990-2015) and adds the change value between this two periods. What is the name of this type of plot? How can I create the same plot (with different countries) in excel?
