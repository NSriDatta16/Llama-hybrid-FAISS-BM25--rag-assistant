The reference is to Einstein's foundational work on relativity theory. He refers to a "mollusc" (non-rigid) space in this work . For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used which are as a whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer alterations in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the law of motion is any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the one condition, that the “readings” which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a “reference-mollusk,” is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the “mollusk” a certain comprehensibleness as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unqualified) formal retention of the separate existence of the space co-ordinate. Every point on the mollusk is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusk is considered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity requires that all these mollusks can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusk. The statement concerns transformation groups of continuous parameter(s) to obtain compactness and invariance. It is a topic of consideration in differential geometry. Jaynes is trying to formulate a hybrid between the considerations of a Bayesian statistician accommodating multiple disparate prior constraints (e.g. we have 90% believe $\theta > 0$ or $\theta$ has a unimodal distribution) and the Bayes' / Jeffreys' approach of having a "naive" / uniform possibly improper prior. His hybrid may be envisioned as being "mollusk" like in shape by having a complex space (impact of prior specifications) but a well-defined measurable compact property (preferences of Bayes and Jeffreys).
