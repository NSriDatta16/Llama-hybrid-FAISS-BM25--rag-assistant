Incorporating prior knowledge in machine learning?

What are recommended methods for incorporating prior knowledge in machine learning tasks? By prior knowledge I am referring to information like which features are a priori considered more important or which samples should be weighted higher (e.g. due to higher data quality). I am looking for references that give a good overview of the available methods and also pointers to software implementations.
