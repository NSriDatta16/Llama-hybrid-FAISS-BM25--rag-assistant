Factor analysis is a dimensionality reduction latent variable technique which replaces inter-correlating variables with a smaller number of continuous latent variables called factors. The factors are believed to be responsible for the inter-correlations. [For confirmatory factor analysis, please use the tag 'confirmatory-factor'. Also, the term "factor" of factor analysis should not be confused with "factor" as categorical predictor of a regression/ANOVA.]
