You could in principle do one of two things: Extend the Exponential Smoothing framework to include additional components for your causal variables, which get updated along with the level, trend and seasonal components. Regress your time series on your causal factors, the model residuals using Exponential Smoothing. There is no implementation in R that I know of. Here are Rob Hyndman's thoughts on the topic, along with pointers to papers where he did something along these lines. Alternatively, you could use ARIMAX modeling, i.e., ARIMA with eXternal or eXplanatory variables. Look at the forecast package and the auto.arima() function. You can feed external information into its xreg parameter.
