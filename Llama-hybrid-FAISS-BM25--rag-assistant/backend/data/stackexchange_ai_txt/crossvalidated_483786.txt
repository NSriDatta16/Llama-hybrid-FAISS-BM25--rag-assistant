Can the coefficients of a linear kernel SVM be used to validate the feature importances of a decision tree?

I'm currently using sklearn to fit a decision tree to a small data set (210 rows x 180 cols). Interpretability is key as we'd like to be able to use the DT to make a white box model in order to tune process parameters. My question is pretty simple : is there any reason to expect an SVM fit on the same data to reflect similar feature importances as the decision tree?
