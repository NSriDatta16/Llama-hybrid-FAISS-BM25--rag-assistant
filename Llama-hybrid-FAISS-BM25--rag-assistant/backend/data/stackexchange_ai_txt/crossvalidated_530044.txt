Max Pooling vs Average Pooling for residual/skip connections

I've implemented a CNN with skip connections; some connections skip across residual blocks with no spatial downsampling but some connections skip across blocks that have convolutions with a stride of 2 and therefore the width and height of tensors are halved. Currently I'm using average pooling for this spatial downsampling, but I'm wondering if there would be an advantage to using max pooling to propagate the highest intensity features. I looked at the original ResNet paper and it seemed to only go into detail about feature count dimension changes for connections but not spatial dimension changes, so I wonder if there has been any new work in the area comparing the two pooling techniques for res nets.
