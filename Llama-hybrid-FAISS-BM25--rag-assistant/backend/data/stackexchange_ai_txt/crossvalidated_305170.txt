Sampling with and without replacement

I came across the following question during interview preparation. "Randomly select 10 without replacement from 1000 people, what is the average number of selections it takes to get one person selected? Randomly select 10 with replacement from 1000 people, what is the average number of selections it takes to get one person selected the first time?" In the case with placement, the probability of each selection that someone being selected P(W) = 1 - (999/1000) ^ 10. How do I generate expected value of number of selections from P(W). Is it 1/P(W)? In the case without placement, my idea is that there are 100 possible outcomes. The probability of someone being selected in rth outcome is 10/(1000 - 10*r), given previous selections failed to select this guy. I don't know how to translate it into mathematical formula. Please provide better angle to solve this problem. Reference post math.stackexchange.com/questions/489772/probability-of-sampling-with-and-without-replacement Thanks!
