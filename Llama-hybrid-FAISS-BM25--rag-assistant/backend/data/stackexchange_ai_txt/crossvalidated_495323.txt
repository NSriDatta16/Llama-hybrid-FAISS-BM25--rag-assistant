According to the paper: Markov games as a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning by Michael Littman, 1994, the notion of discount factor is defined in terms of the probability that the game will be allowed to continue. Even thought this paper is talking about Markov games, I believe the abstract can be used to get a more general, intuition about the importance of discount factor. Here it is: "As in MDPâ€™s, the discount factor can be thought of as the probability that the game will be allowed to continue after the current move. It is possible to define a no- tion of undiscounted rewards [Schwartz, 1993], but not all Markov games have optimal strategies in the undiscounted case [Owen, 1982]. This is because, in many games, it is best to postpone risky actions indefinitely. For current pur- poses, the discount factor has the desirable effect of goading the players into trying to win sooner rather than later."
