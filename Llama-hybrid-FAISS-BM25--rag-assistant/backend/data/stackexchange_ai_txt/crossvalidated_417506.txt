I think a Bayesian approach might be beneficial. When predicting for an unobserved category in a Bayesian mixed model, you generate posterior predictions by sampling the $\alpha_j$ from the fitted $N(0, \sigma^2_\alpha)$ (aside from sampling the fixed effects from the fitted posterior). This way, you will see high uncertainty for the new doctor - which is IMHO a good thing. The amount of uncertainty will be related to the fitted $\sigma^2_\alpha$ , so when most doctors are similar, you will get lower uncertainty. After you have more data, you would refit the model and the uncertainty for the (now observed) doctor will gradually shrink.
