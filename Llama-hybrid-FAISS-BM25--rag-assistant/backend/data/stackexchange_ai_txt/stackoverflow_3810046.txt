Magento adds coupon discount amount to the total price with Barclaycard ePDQ payment

I have a Magento shop and we use Barclaycard ePDQ as our payment method. I recently created a new cart rule that gives you 10% off discount when using a coupon code. Everything goes well with Magento - the coupon applies - but after I press Checkout and it takes me to the Barclaycard ePDQ page, I notice that the total amount to pay is actually the regular price + the discount amount, which is really weird because when I look at my order reports it seems that the grand total is with the discount.
