Loading AjaxControlToolkit Scripts from Microsoft's CDN using ScriptManager/ToolkitManager

I know there is another question asking the same thing, but it hasn't gotten any attention for months now: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786088/how-to-force-ajax-control-toolkit-scripts-loading-from-cdn I've upgraded my website to .NET4, and I'm now using the scriptManager's EnableCDN="true" tag. My Ajax scripts are being referenced from the Microsoft CDN just how I expected, but I can't seem to get my AjaxControlToolkit scripts to load from the CDN. Instead they all load locally through ScriptResource.axd. I know where the CDN files are located, and I know that I could reference those files every time I use a control, but I've got a lot of legacy code that loads on its own from the scriptmanager, just pulling ScriptResource.axd files. Any suggestions how to get the control toolkit scripts to load from the CDN? I already have the standard WebForms.js, etc. Let me know if there is anything I can clear up, here is the script manager that I'm using: (I have tried the toolkitscriptmanager)
