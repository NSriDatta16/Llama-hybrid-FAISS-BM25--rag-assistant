JPA: is @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(...) the same as @JoinColumn(..., insertable = ?, updatable = ?)?

Can you derive from the JPA spec, if @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(...) , which doesn't have the insertable and updatable parameters, is the same as @JoinColumn(..., insertable = false, updatable = false) or @JoinColumn(..., insertable = true, updatable = true) when used on regular (non-inheritance) associations? Should they be interchangable? What are the insertable and updatable properties set to? Are they set to anything at all? Note, I'm only targeting the read-only attribute that both (seem to) implement... I'm getting rather inconsistent mapping exception with EclipseLink and Hibernate... Here's the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn JavaEE 5 + 6 Javadoc: PrimaryKeyJoinColumn (JavaEE 5) PrimaryKeyJoinColumn (JavaEE 6) Quote: ... and it may be used in a OneToOne mapping in which the primary key of the referencing entity is used as a foreign key to the referenced entity.
