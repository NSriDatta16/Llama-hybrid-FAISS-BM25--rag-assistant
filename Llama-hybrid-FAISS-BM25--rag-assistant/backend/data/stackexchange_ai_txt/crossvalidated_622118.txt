Power analysis for correlated data points

I want to using simulation to determine the effect size that could be detected with my sample size. What makes the simulation a bit complicated is that my dataset is about species traits. It means data points are not independent of each other. The function I used to get the coefficient in the first place is phylolm from the package phylolm. simple_mod ChatGPT provided a solution like the following: # Assuming your dataframe is named "df_tmp3" sample_size $coefficients["proxy_scaled", "Estimate"] original_p_value coefficients["proxy_scaled", "p.value"] # Create a vector to store the simulated p-values simulated_p_values $proxy_scaled, PL = df_tmp3$ PL) # Fit the phylolm model using simulated data simulated_mod I wonder if it is correct to randomly generate noise (residuals) for the dependent variable (log_GS) while keeping the predictors proxy_scaled and PL constant for my purpose. What I often see is people randomly generate the predictors, not the random noise for the dependent variable. If anyone has any ideas or clues on this, I would greatly appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!
