I think you do it right with the document.createElement(' '); But I'm not sure it is called as the document.createElement('IFRAME') will be ok, even in IE. We are using a dynamic iframe to sandbox cross domain JSONP calls, and it works fine in IE. The code I use is: var ifr = (/MSIE (6|7|8)/).test(navigator.userAgent) ? document.createElement(' '): document.createElement('iframe'); ifr.name = id; You can check a working example here click on the Demo link. If the demo works it means something is wrong in your code, if it doesn't work, something is wrong with your IE configuration.
