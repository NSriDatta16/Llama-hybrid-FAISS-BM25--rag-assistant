TabHost NullPointerException in layout

I been following the Tab example provided by Google. I am trying to use the XML layout provided to setup a tab layout. I use this XML layout @ http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/views/hello-tabwidget.html When ever I switch the Layout tab in the Eclipse layout designer I get a NullPointerException: null error inside my Eclipse. This happens also when I try to drag and drop a TabHost, and then a TabWidget into an empty layout file. What am I doing wrong ? this seems pretty simple.
