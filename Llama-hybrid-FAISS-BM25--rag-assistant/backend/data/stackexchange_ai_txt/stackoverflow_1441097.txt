I've found it useful to use names borrowed from the hCard microformat . Some of these are for people, and some for addresses, and it doesn't line up 1:1 with the hCard specification, however, this subset has been pretty useful so far: honorificPrefix nVarChar(20) givenName nVarChar(50) additionalName nVarChar(50) familyName nVarChar(50) nickName nVarChar(50) honorificSuffix nVarChar(20) fn nVarChar(50) -- # Formatted name email nVarChar(255) title nVarChar(50) role nVarChar(50) organizationName nVarChar(100) organizationUnit nVarChar(100) streetAddress nVarChar(100) extendedAddress1 nVarChar(100) -- # hCard specs support any number of these extendedAddress2 nVarChar(100) -- # I've not seen a need for more than two. locality nVarChar(55) region nVarChar(2) postalCode nVarChar(20) postOfficeBox nVarChar(20) countryName nVarChar(50) phone nVarChar(25) fax nVarChar(25) latitude float longitude float Experience has shown that the data types and sizes listed have have worked well for many varied directories of people and organizations across the US. However, I like some of the comments here that suggest a larger data type for phone numbers. Also, I am not convinced that storing latitude and longitude as a float is the way to go, so your milage may vary. Good luck!
