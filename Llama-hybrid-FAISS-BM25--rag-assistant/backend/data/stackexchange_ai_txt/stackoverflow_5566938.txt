What is the easiest way to send html content in a non-text/html content type for ajax requests?

A CDN I am switching to is charging per text/html content-type request (including AJAX requests), so I am converting as many ajax requests away from this content-type as possible. Many of my ajax requests return HTML. What would be the easiest/best way to still convey this content but without the text/html content-type? Two options I'm aware of, but wary of: text/javascript smdrager's example content becomes var content = ' smdrager\'s example content '; Any single quotes will have to be escaped. Is there any unforseen problems with passing content in a simple variable? application/json smdrager's example content becomes {"content" : " smdrager's example content "} Any double quotes, which are common will have to be escaped. I feel like this would be safer than the variable approach, but I will have to do more work to escape every double quote than single as with the simple variable approach. EDIT: Thought of a third option which is easier than the other two. Anyone have any better? commented javascript I thought of this: smdrager's example content becomes /* smdrager's example content */ This works without any escaping. The only thing to change in the content is to remove any other javascript block comments, which really shouldn't be in ajax'ed content anyway. Is there any approach or content-type which can get me out of having to escape special characters without risking browsers having trouble with the content-type? Thanks
