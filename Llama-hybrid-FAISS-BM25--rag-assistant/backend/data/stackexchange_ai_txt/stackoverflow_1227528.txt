The HTTP Header's "User-Agent" is how a browser 'tells' the web server what type of browser it is. It can contain operating system and version as well. Under most usual conditions, these values are correct indication. We can make use of this information to churn out suitable html/css that suits the browser (i.e. mobile device, IE6 etc) at the server-side. Some frameworks e.g. ASP.NET have some form of browser-capability feature to "adapt" the html output (I'm not convinced though). I cannot think of a better way to do otherwise. For screen size detection, javascript detection should work well, but that doesn't give you much in terms of layout and font-size unless you have some form of implementation that can render the output in an AJAX manner. Couldn be pretty complex. Not much of an answer here, just hope it can facilitate more ideas.
