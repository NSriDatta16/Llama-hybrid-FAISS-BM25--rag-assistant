The sensors cannot record data while the machine is not running, so no data is actually " missing ". We use this term for data that could have been observed but is not available for one reason or another (it wasn't collected in the first place, was lost, requires special permissions to access, etc.) Furthermore, it seems you know in advance when the machine is turned off (Sundays, public holidays) and no-one is going to need anomaly detection during the downtimes. Instead, you have time series data that would require careful pre-preprocessing as it consists of multiple segments on (uninterrupted) machine operation. It might be necessary for example to pay special attention to the time right after the machine is restarted, if the sensor data looks "unusual" during the warm-up even though there are no anomalies.
