The depth and width of network are independent of each other. Depth offers generalization while width offers memorization. Also, one crucial thing is that just increasing no. of layers doesn't make it "deep learning" ! If you are efficiently learning feature representations (like in autoencoders) and not manually handcrafting features (like in old POS tagging techniques), you are still performing deep learning.
