Normalization is a transformation of the data. The parameters of that transformation should be found on the training dataset. Then the same parameters should be applied during prediction. You should not re-find the normalization parameters during prediction. A machine learning model maps feature values to target labels. If you should not change feature values without also changing the mapping. If change just the feature values, you have potential for inconsistent mapping. If you are training on a specific range of features and then during prediction there are out-of-range feature values, there are two choices: Set it to the limits of the range, in the case of 1001 it would be transformed to be 1. Decide if it makes sense to make a prediction for that feature value, some machine learning models should not extrapolate.
