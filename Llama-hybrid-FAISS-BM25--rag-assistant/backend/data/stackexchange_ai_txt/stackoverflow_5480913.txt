.htaccess not redirecting to ?_escaped_fragment_=

I want to redirect the request " index.php?_escaped_fragment_=about " to " snapshots/snap_about.html " but I can't get it to work :( It's an AJAX site; the URL I receive when I try to request example.com/index.php?_escaped_fragment_=about is: example.com/index.php?_escaped_fragment_=about#!about This is my htaccess redirect index.php?_escaped_fragment_=about http://www.example.com/snapshots/snap_about.html redirect /testx.html http://example.com/dummytest/index.html The redirect /testx.html works. Maybe I am making a big big mistake, but I am new at this!
