Basically any classifier can do this. For example a Artificial Neural Network that outputs a softmax layer, which can be seen as probability. You would design a ANN that gets as input a numerical representation of what you described as features and outputs a value $p$. That value basically says "the probability of the input belonging to class 0 (e.g. P) is $p$ and belonging to class 1 is therefore $1 - p$. There are a lot of implementations already ready to go.
