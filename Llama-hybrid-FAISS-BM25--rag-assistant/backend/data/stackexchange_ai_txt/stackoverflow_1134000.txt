The use of generics looks elegant. But in trying to implement it, I don't actually use: IArticleDataAccess dataAccess = new AnalysisArticleDataAccess(); //But instead have a DataAccess property in NewsArticle. Once defined as: IArticleDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; } //If I change to: IArticleDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; } // It can't be implicitly set to type IArticleDataAccess . Do I need to also generic to NewsArticle ? The self-referencing generic looks scary and requires a lot of changes. Better to just have each subclass reimplement the DataAccess property with the right type? Or am I missing something?
