You will need to work with your "IT person" to setup a VPN connection between your premises and the EC2 cloud. In practice you will likely need to: 1) Define a subnet for your EC2 connections (ie. 10.10.10.x). 2) Build a VPN tunnel between your university and Amazon (Virtual Private Cloud). 3) Enable any routing or firewall changes at the university. You know you've got it working when you can 'ping' the EC2 host from within your premises. BTW, I have recently released a new service that specifically runs on Amazon EC2. About 20% of people are now asking for VPC in order to use our service (Virtual Lab Management), and so I can attest that it's a solution that has raised interest in a lot of large organizations.
