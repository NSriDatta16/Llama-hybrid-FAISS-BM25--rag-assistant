Learning multiple output

Can you suggest me an algorithm and probably a real code for multiple output learning, where input of the model is vector of around 10 000 values and output is, for each input vector, an output vector of 1500 dimensions (so, it's kind of a big dataset)? In my opinion neural network can handle this number of values, but what else? Supervised SOM? Multi-class multikernel learning? Any examples of the real world data model with the same type of learning (large multiple output?) Any suggestions and opinions will be very valuable for me. Update: Data example can be found here - http://pastebin.com/Z4E87d3d
