In order to add design-time functionality like additional operations (known as Action Lists and Verbs depending on how they are provided), or dragging of visual elements like headers or split bars, you need to implement a custom designer (usually derived from ControlDesigner ) that allows the Windows Forms designer to understand how to interact with your custom control at design-time. MSDN has a lengthy section on adding design-time support for your controls. It describes everything from type converters to extender providers and designer serialization to designer customization . Additional resources This article on CodeProject contains information on creating designers for custom controls. There are also some useful tips here and in this other StackOverflow question .
