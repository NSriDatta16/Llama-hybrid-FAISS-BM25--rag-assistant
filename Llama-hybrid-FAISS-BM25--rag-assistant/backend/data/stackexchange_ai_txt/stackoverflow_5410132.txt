retrieval of security token upon swipe of CAC card using Java

I am using SCR3310 card reader in Ubuntu, and I have installed the necessary drivers for the smart card reader and it works fine. I have installed pscs_tools to check whether the card/card reader works fine. I have downloaded few public DoD certificates (.cac) online which consists of the Root CA Certificate and other intermediate certificates. I have been reading through X.509 certificates, but not sure how to retrieve the X.509 certificate from the above setup. I would also like to know how to authenticate the person using PKI (in Java) and retrieve the unique identifier/security token from the CAC card using the above setup. Thanks, Ron
