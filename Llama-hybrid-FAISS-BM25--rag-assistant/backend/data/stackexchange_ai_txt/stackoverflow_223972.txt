As has been stated in other posts, listening to music is great for cutting out the noise. Most of the points you raise are common in large departments\projects, the best way to approach them is to attempt to educate and convince those around you of alternatives. You could provide a business case for faster machines (joelonsoftware provides a lot of information about developer productivity). Unclear requirements are unavoidable in a business environment where the stakeholders often don't know what they want upfront and change is frequent, this often overrides many technical issues and so obscures them as well. The best way of addressing this is to adopt an process which acknowledges this and manages it, e.g. Agile. If you have concerns over the tools and processes, I would initially discuss this with the other developers and then take it to the development\project manager. There are often benefits, which may not be clear initially, of the constrictive nature of roles and environments (often not as tight as initially thought). These can include access to deeper knowledge due to specialisation and the ability to delegate some activities to other people in the organisation, however it usually mean things happen more in parallel but slower. You may also get exposure\experience of a wider range of role and activities and meet lots of people. It will take time and lots of effort to educate and convince people regarding these issues, though once this starts to happen the cynicism will likely start to relax and disappear, enacting change on a large team/department is not easy and generally requires momentum by getting more people enthused and involved. Personally I thrive off this, despite it often being frustrating, as it allows me to engage people in debate and mentor people. However I am very focused on the people\process aspects of software development over technologies. If this is not for you then I would consider moving jobs or requesting reassignment back to an in house team. This relies on the people you are working, as this is the most important thing in development, with being approachable and committed to the project\department\organisation, if this is not the case you may want to look for an alternative job.
