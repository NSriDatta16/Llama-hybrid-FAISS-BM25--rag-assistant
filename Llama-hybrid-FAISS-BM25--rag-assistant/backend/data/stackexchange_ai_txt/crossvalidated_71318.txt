It sounds like you are facing a semi-supervised classification problem. Based on your problem statement you have a positive set (second data set) and an unlabeled set (first data set). The first data set is unlabeled because it can contain both users that clicked the ad and users that didn't. This kind of problem is a twist on traditional supervised classification. It poses a bunch of additional challenges, the main one being model selection, since the usual measures like accuracy are not useful. If you look up techniques to learn from positive and unlabeled data (often called PU learning ), you will probably find several useful ideas. The key idea that is common in most PU learning approaches is to weigh positive training instances (significantly) higher than unlabeled ones. If you want to determine which features are relevant, you may consider approaches like semi-supervised logistic regression. I consider Learning ClassiÔ¨Åers from Only Positive and Unlabeled Data by Elkan and Noto to be a very good reference on the subject.
