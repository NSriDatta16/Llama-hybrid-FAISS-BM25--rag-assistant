If I have many positive, insignificant results, can I test "at least $n$ of these results are positive"?

Let's say I have run the same regression for 100 different individuals separately. My coefficients of interest are positive (and quite different from one another) but statistically insignificant in all 100 results (lets say every p-value = 0.11). Is there a way to combine these p-values in order to conclude "at least 80 of these results are positive" with greater significance than p=0.11? My online searches have only showed me how to say "at least 1 of these results is positive" through a Fisher or similar test, but I haven't been able to generalize that result. I want to test "H0 = all 100 effects are the same at 0" against "HA = at least 80 effects are positive." My goal isn't to say there is a positive coefficient on average, and nor is it to specifically measure the coefficient. My goal is to demonstrate, with significance, that at least 80 people individually faced some positive effect regardless of which 80, and regardless of the magnitude of effect felt by each individual.
