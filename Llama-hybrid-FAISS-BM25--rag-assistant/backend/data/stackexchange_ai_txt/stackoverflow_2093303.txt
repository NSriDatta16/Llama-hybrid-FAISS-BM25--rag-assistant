It is true that LINQ to SQL is a layer on top of ADO.NET. But so are other options that allow you to hold the results in memory. If your intent is to act on the data immediately after retrieval you are better off to work with ADO.NET DataReader within a loop for better performance. However, if you need to do further processing on the data you will need to hold in it memory using some sort of variable such as an LINQ to SQL Entity or DataTable. Both of these memory variables are basically generated the same way under the covers. Given this fact, Iâ€™d say that the speed of which each option is available in memory is not as import as how you plan on working with the data.
