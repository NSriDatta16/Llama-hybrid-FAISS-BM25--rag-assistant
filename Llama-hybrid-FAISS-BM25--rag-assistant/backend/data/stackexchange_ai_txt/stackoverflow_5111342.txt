Check this presentation, around slide 70 and the next ones. They explain a bit what can cause reflow and repaint. http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/high-performance-javascript-webdirections-usa-2010 Without the specific code / CSS is hard to answer but I can say something general like, if the fragment DOM that was changed influences other elements in the page :) Also note that in stackoverflow WMD, when you enter a newline it also causes a whole viewport repaint. So maybe it has something to do with your WYSIWYG area not having width and height well defined? I'm guessing that if you give them width and height they won't affect other elements in the page
