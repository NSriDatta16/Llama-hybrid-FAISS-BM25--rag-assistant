Flash game hacking

I usually organise tournaments on my site (flash based) and this time I have added a tournament in which users have to complete a jigsaw puzzle and the one who completes it in the least time wins some prize. As the jigsaw puzzle always produces random location, it is difficult for them to hack. They can't even directly download the game as it can't be downloaded using flash saver etc. But I want to know if they can make a program which completes the jigsaw puzzle automatically. Please tell me. Even time can't be hacked as I use time also tick on my server side so I match the time submitted by the game and the time stored in my server.
