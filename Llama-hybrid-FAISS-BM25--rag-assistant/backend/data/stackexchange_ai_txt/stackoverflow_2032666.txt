Let's get this straight: FastMM4 does not leak memory, your code might. To know for sure, execute this instruction somewhere in your application (where FastMM4 is in the uses clause and $define ManualLeakReportingControl is set, in FastMM4Options.inc for instance): ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown := True; FastMM4 will then report at the end if you forgot to free some memory. If you wish to know a bit more, you can watch this video from CodeRage 2: Fighting Memory Leaks for Dummies
