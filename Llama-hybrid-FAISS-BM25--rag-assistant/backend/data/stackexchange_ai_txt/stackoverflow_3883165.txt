Spring Session User Info retrieval in Dao layer

I have a web-application in java, spring framework, hibernate on tomcat, that has basically almost no security except the login and logout functionality (no spring security) I can access the user information in a controller by: // where request is HttpServletRequest HttpSession session = request.getSession(true); SystemUser user = (SystemUser) session.getAttribute("user"); and do the logic. However, I need to get this information in Dao layer. Where I actually get data from the database to retrieve user specific data. One way is to pass the "user" object to service layer and then service layer to pass it on to the dao layer. But this is quite a huge load of work. I wonder if there is a way in Spring some how to access the session object in Dao layer? or any other way to retrieve user specific data.
