Range to define emotions

We are capturing emotions as survey responses. We need to assign values for the responses(emotions) for analysis purposes. Is there an optimum range that can be assigned to achieve this? (like from -100 to 100). An example of a question and a set of answers are as follow. Question: "How are you feeling today?" Answers: Terrible, Sad, Ok, Good, Great A suitable approach we could think of is to assign values from 1 to 100 with equal distance. Is this statistically valid? What are the things that we should consider when achieving this? In this case, only positive integers are assigned because we need to calculate statistics like weighted average. Can't we assign negative numbers as well?
