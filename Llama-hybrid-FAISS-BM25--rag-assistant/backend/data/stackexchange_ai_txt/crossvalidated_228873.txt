How do you interpret the area under the precision-recall curve?

I recently learned of precision-recall curves as an alternative to ROC curves for testing the performance of a binary classification model. However, I don't know how to interpret the meaning of the area under a precision-recall curve. Is it the "average precision"? What does that mean?
