I would rephrase your question slightly to: does Seaside prevent/discourage you from creating applications that scale? I would say usually no. Seaside doesn't have a default way to store your data (just like php on its doesn't, though Seaside gives you a few extra options) and my impression is interacting with your data tends to be the biggest hurdle when it comes to scaling. If you want to store your data in a monolithic SQL db, like with rails, you can do that. Or you can use an object database. Or you can use a separate object database for each user, or separate db for each project, or a separate db for each user and project. Or you can store everything in a series of flat files or you can just store your data as objects in your VM's memory. And because of continuations you don't need re-fetch your data out of your datastore on every webpage call. As when you are using a desktop application you can pull data out of your datastore when your user begins interacting with it, set the appropriate variables, and then use those variables between webcalls until the user is done with the data at which point you can update the datastore. When you don't share state you have to hit the datastore on every single webcall. Of course this doens't mean scaling is free, it just means you have a larger domain in which to search for scaling solutions. All that said, for many applications rails will scale much easier simply because there exist large hosting solutions for rails (and php for that matter) that will offer you a huge amount of resources without having to rent and setup a custom box. These are just my impressions from reading and talking to people.
