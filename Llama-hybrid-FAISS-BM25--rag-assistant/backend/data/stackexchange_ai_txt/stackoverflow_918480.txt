Do you write your algorithm out in pseudocode before coding?

So I know of a few people that actually write their algorithms out in plain English (pseudocode) before coding. I'd never done this before, but now that I think about it, it kind of makes sense for organizing complicated algorithms. Do you do this? Does it help? If not, what do you do (if anything) to organize your program before you write it?
