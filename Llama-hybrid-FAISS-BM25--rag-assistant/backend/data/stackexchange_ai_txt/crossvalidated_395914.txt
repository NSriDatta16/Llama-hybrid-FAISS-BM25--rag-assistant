You are correct on calculating the distance to the prior k-means centroids and label the data to the the nearest centroids accordingly The reason run a new algorithm (e.g., SVM) will not work is because clustering is different from supervised learning that you have a label for each data point. If we have new data, we still do not have their labels. So, what we can used is just the output from the clustering, i.e., centroid.
