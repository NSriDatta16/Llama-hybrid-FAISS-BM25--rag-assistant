we've figured out the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors that maximize the explanatory power of a mathematically descriptive system, while simultaneously lowering its complexity You might have reduced dimensionality with PCA/PCR, but you probably haven't reduced the complexity in terms of the original predictor variables. Each principal component might include contributions from all of those original predictors. For predictions on new data, it's best to move from the retained principal components back to corresponding regression coefficients expressed in terms of the original predictors. That's done, for example, by the R pls package ; see Section 8 of the vignette . Those coefficients won't be the same as what you would have gotten with ordinary regression, as they only contain predictor contributions included in the retained principal components. Moving back to the predictor space from principal components removes potential problems in mapping between principal components of your original and your new data sets. In terms of the original predictor variables, whether to continue with the first model or update isn't any different for PCA/PCR than it is for other modeling approaches.
