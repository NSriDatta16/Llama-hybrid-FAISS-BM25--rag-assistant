The key problem with simulating neural networks (and human brain is a neural network) is that they function continuously, while digital computers function in cycles. So in a neural network different neurons function independently in parallel while in a computer you only simulate discrete system states. That's why adequately simulating real neural networks is very problematic at the moment and we're very far from it.
