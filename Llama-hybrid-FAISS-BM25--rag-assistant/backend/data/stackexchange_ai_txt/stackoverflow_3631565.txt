GMT does not have daylight savings, so all your stored times should not have daylight savings within them. Before you store, and on retrieval you should also calculate the daylight savings. Only some areas of the world use it. So in answer to your question no DATEADD() isn't good enough. If you're already finding out where they are, have another table or something to look up if that timezone does daylight savings. But even within some zones some areas have daylight savings and others don't.
