What dev environment should I use for data analysis on Mac?

I'm starting to develop an application and I'm not sure what environment (languages, tools, etc.) I should use. Here are some infos: The app analyses a bunch of data that I have in a database. There is a lot of rolling, weighted averages - not too complicated, but probably too tricky to do in SQL. At work, I'd probably end up with an OracleDB and a bunch of stored procedures. However, this is a private project and I've recently switched to a Mac. After the analysis is done, I might want to expose the results on the web. As my hosting package includes a MySQL database, I'd like to work with that as a database engine. I'm not sure how good the support for stored procs on MySQL is and what tools to use for writing and debugging - any equivalent to Toad on the Oracle side? When developing on Windows, I could write the analysis functionality as a C# or VB app - what would be a good equivalent on the Mac side? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I'd especially like to get a better understanding of some "modern" languages (such as Ruby or Python) if this makes sense for what I want to develop.
