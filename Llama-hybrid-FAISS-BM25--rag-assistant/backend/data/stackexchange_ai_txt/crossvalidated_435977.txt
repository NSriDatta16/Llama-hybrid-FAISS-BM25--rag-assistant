You could take this to extreme and ask why wouldn't we use non-parametric model like $k$ -NN regression? Actually, the opposite question Why would anyone use KNN for regression? was asked, and you can check it for more detailed discussion. You can also make the question more broad and ask why wouldn't we use more complicated models instead of simpler ones? For example, why would anyone use logistic, or linear regression, if they could use a neural network? The two main reasons for preferring simple models are: Interpretability. Simple models like linear regression are directly interpretable, while this does not have to be the case of more complicated models. This may be desirable in some disciplines (e.g. medicine), and even obligatory by law in others (finance). Overfitting. More complicated models are more prone to overfitting, especially for small sample sizes. Complicated model may simply memorize the training dataset and not generalize. As noticed in the comments, this seems to be also discussed in the following thread: When to use a GAM vs GLM . As a comment, notice that using model that is linear in parameters is not that a big constraint. You can easily extend a linear model using polynomial components to model complex relationships, and this may even outperform neural networks in some cases (see Cheng et al, 2018 [arXiv:1806.0685] ).
