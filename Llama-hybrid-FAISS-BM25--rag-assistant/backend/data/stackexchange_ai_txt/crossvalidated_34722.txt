A summary test statistic for multidimensional, non-metric (input and output) data is a tough pitch and likely of limited interpretable value. You could run a proportional odds logistic regression model of one variable (input) on the other (target) - if you are willing to do the analysis as comparing the target's probability distribution over the input levels. It would show if the input variable has significantly different dependence over the input levels and target classes. It won't really matter for predictive probabilities which contrast scheme you use, however, for interpretation of the weights, you might like to use orthogonal polynomials. You will need to interpret with examples test cases and their predictive distributions on barplots. This is because along with the logit probability scale that the weights work on, there are cut-offs identified by the regression process - which makes it rather difficult to interpret logit scale quantities. For example with R, your code would be #input data #quality which will save the probability predictions into your current working directory. You may want to be careful about calling your variables confidence and quality if the audience is statistically aware as these words mean something quite specific to the community.
