You are right, if you have different lengths of the texts, then the naive Bayesian does not work. The solution of your situation might be as follows: To find the keywords in your set of documents. The number of keywords is fixed for the entire data set. To construct the feature vectors for all texts based on the keywords. The components say whether a keyword occurred in the document or not. To use the multinomial naive Bayes as you refer. I hope it helped.
