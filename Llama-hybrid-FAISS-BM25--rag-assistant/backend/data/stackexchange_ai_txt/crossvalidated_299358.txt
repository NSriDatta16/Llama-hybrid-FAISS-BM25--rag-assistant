Output prediction when predictors amplify each other

I hope the title is clear as I couldn't explain my problem better. I'm new to Neural networks and trying to create a model to predict the general situation of a specific market (e.g strong market/weak market,...). I think in reality what I'm working on - while similar to it - is not a neural network since I don't want to have the typical structure of a network (input, hidden layer, output) mainly because the input(s) I have in mind are extremely general (like political situation or general economy) and I can't provide the network with a significant training set. Instead I tried to identify and map all the nodes between the stimuli and the final parameter I want to predict. In this way I have a pseudo-NN which I can assign weights to it and whenever I get some data about any node(a value), try to predict its effect on the final parameter. My problem is, unlike a feedforward NN, some of the nodes may amplify each other. For example Increasing A, increases B and Increasing B increases A even more. Could you suggest any model/ Architecture suite for this problem? I afraid using NN was completely wrong to begin with.
