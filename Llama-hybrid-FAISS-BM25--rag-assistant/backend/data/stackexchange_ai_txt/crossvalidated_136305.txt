rWishart: should be $dof>p-1$ or $dof \ge p$?

The degrees of freedom $n$ of a Wishart distribution parametrized like in wikipedia (and like most people do) are restricted to: $$ n>p-1 $$ where $p$ are the dimensions of the data, to ensure that the Gamma function in the normalization factor is applied to a positive number. However, as for R implementations, both rWishart (stats) and rwish (MCMCpack) functions want me to choose $n\ge p$ (as if $n$ was an integer number). Otherwise it complains: > S rWishart(1, 1.5, S) Error in rWishart(1, 1.5, S) : inconsistent degrees of freedom and dimension Note that my $n$ are real numbers, not integers, since I am generating the degrees of freedom $n$ from a Gamma distribution according to: \begin{align} \frac{1}{n-p+1} \sim \mathcal{G}(1, 1/p) \end{align} Shouldn't the R implementations accept $n>p-1$? I could copy the source code and hack it to do so, but this seems very strange to me. It is like the libraries do one thing while the books do the other (all of them with the same parametrization) Who is right? (or what am I missing here?)
