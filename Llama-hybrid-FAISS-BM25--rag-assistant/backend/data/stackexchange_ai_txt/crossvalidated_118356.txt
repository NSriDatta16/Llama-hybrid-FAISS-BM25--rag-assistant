Summarizing and plotting several combined relationships with LMER

I want to see if there is a significant relationship between predictor and value . I've measured these two variables in 6 different conditions (not a full 3 x 3 design because feature1 and feature2 can't be equal). subject feature1 feature2 predictor value 1 shape color -0.06 -0.24 2 shape color -0.32 -0.57 3 shape color -0.45 -0.68 4 shape color -0.89 -1.65 5 shape color 0.14 -0.10 6 shape color -0.56 0.26 7 shape color -0.54 0.49 8 shape color -0.20 0.55 9 shape color 0.10 0.42 10 shape color 0.30 -0.26 1 texture color -0.04 -1.04 2 texture color 0.02 0.77 3 texture color -0.58 -0.63 4 texture color -0.31 -0.06 5 texture color 0.43 -0.39 6 texture color -0.27 -0.48 7 texture color -0.87 -0.16 8 texture color -0.20 0.57 9 texture color 0.34 0.80 10 texture color 0.51 0.20 1 color shape -0.36 -0.23 2 color shape 0.15 -1.19 .... I can model this effect, averaged across conditions lm.output but I don't assume that the subjects will behave similarly in each condition, so averaging by subjects like this isn't the best approach. Within each condition (e.g. for "shape" and "color"), the relationship between predictor and value is more or less strong, but it goes in the same direction across all conditions (kind of akin to saying "there's a small, but positive relationship in all cases", similar to a meta-analysis). This is the pattern of results I hope to convey. How should I best model this? My guess is like this: lmer.output and then take the t-statistic and estimate for predictor to report. Is this valid? If so, is there a good way to plot this to show the relationship between predictor and value ? Here's the dataset: dataset
