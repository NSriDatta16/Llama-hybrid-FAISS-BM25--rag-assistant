I use the new Function() constructor as an in-line JS interpreter in one of the web apps I'm developing: function interpret(s) { //eval(s); As I get stuff streaming over AJAX ( not an iframe), I continuously interpret() it on readyStateChange == 3 . This works surprisingly well. Edit : here's a clear case study that shows that new Function() is categorically faster than eval() . I.e. you should never (rarely?) use eval in lieu of new Function() . http://polyfx.com/stuff/bsort.html http://polyfx.com/stuff/bsort10.html Eval is on average, almost 8 times slower than new Function() .
