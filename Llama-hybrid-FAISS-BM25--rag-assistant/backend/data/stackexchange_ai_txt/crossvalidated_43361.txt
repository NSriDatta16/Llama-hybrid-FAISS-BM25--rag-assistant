Multiple comparisons with the glht function in R gives strange results

As a follow-up to this question , I have the following data: Site Treatment Survival 1 BED DN 1.0 2 BED DN 1.0 3 BED DN 1.0 4 BED MB 1.0 5 BED MB 1.0 6 BED MB 0.9 7 BED Forest 0.4 8 BED Forest 0.5 9 BED Forest 0.4 10 BRO DN 0.9 11 BRO DN 1.0 12 BRO DN 1.0 13 BRO MB 1.0 14 BRO MB 1.0 15 BRO MB 1.0 16 BRO Forest 1.0 17 BRO Forest 1.0 18 BRO Forest 1.0 19 LAP DN 0.8 20 LAP DN 0.4 21 LAP DN 0.6 22 LAP MB 0.5 23 LAP MB 1.0 24 LAP MB 0.7 25 LAP Forest 0.2 26 LAP Forest 0.2 27 LAP Forest 0.4 on which I ran a binomial glm : > glm.out anova(glm.out, test="Chisq") Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: Survival Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev P(>|Chi|) NULL 26 138.254 Site 2 63.098 24 75.155 1.988e-14 *** Treatment 2 42.991 22 32.164 4.620e-10 *** Site:Treatment 4 13.874 18 18.290 0.007707 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 All effects are significant, so now I want to do post-hoc comparisons. I have discovered the glht function in the multcomp package, which seems to do what I want. I read somewhere that with 2 independent variables, you should set interaction_average=TRUE to get a result equivalent to a TukeyHSD for a linear model. > Treat.comp summary(Treat.comp) which gives me these strange results: Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses Multiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts Fit: glm(formula = Survival ~ Site * Treatment, family = "binomial", data = surv.san, weights = rep(10, nrow(surv.san))) Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) DN - MB == 0 -0.202 3316.127 0.000 1 Forest - MB == 0 -1.886 3316.127 -0.001 1 Forest - DN == 0 -1.684 3316.127 -0.001 1 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) Why are my P-values = 1 for all comparisons even though the Treatment effect was highly significant? If I try using glht with interaction_average=FALSE I get more reasonable results but with a warning message: Warning message: In mcp2matrix(model, linfct = linfct) : covariate interactions found -- default contrast might be inappropriate Can someone help me to understand what I am doing wrong? Thank-you!!!
