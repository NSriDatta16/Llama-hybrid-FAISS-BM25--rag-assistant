Hierarchy Visual Design

I have a hierarchy of categories, where a category can have a single parent (and you can have multiple levels of children.) I'm investigating ways to display this information to the user and it seems like a basic vanilla tree layout is the most intuitive way to go. But I'm wondering if anyone can suggest other approaches. The requirements would be, 1) clearly demonstrate to the user the list's parent / child relationships 2) allow the user to easily move items around (whether by drag and drop or some other method) 3) Assuming you had hierarchal data that had multiple parents, how would that change your choice? Thanks everyone! - Kevin
