Ohh boy. So my progression was like this: Java --> (Proc PHP, SQL, & HTML/CSS and atempting to learn but DETESTING JavaScript) --> Lisp --> C++ --> OOP PHP (which was really review) --> about 5 pther languages including perl, ruby, etc. --> Javascript libraries like prototypejs & jquery --> Absolutely LOVING JavaScript Javascript is overwhelming to the novice. I was 2 years out of my CS degree and comfortable with 7 other languages before I began to appreciate the beauty of JS. OOP is very simple, in PHP it's even simpler. Take the time to learn the OOP basics and then move on from there. If you understand basic single inheritance and overriding methods that's all you'll need for PHP OOP. Don't bother with writing ain interface then programming to the interface so you can write multiple implementations and swap them out and blah blah, it's all loosely typed anyways. There about 1 or 2 design patterns you'll learn to use and won't even know you are using. IMHO throw both ideas out and focus your time on learning how to design and effectively manage your back end data storage. It's a very neglected skill these days, but much more important than most people want to admit. If you want though tackle a few JS projects but I highly recommend doing so whithin in the warm safe confines of prototypejs . jquery is probably the most populat right now but there are also 2 or 3 other like dojo , moo tools , or the yahoo API that you can use. I have uses yui, prototypejs, and jquery and I would recommend prorotype to the novice programmer. You also don't really need to know OOP to use these frameworks. You need to understand OOP to BUILD them, but then using them is fairly straightforward with a rudimentary understanding.
