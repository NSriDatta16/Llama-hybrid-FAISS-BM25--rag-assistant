WSS 3.0 Site Provisioning

Is there any way to do WSS 3.0 site provisioning? My client's requirement is attributes as variables that will be defined in XML format: Organization Name, Logo, Address, User and Role information. The client should be able to install this web application to any WSS production server by just defining the attributes in the XML file. Is it possible to to write a utility to parse that well defined XML and provision the site accordingly?
