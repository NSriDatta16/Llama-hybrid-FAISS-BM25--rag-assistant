That's a very interesting topic actually. We always enforce branch per task creation, in fact, each task (not story, but actual tasks as decomposed after the scrum planning meeting) will have at least one associated branch. You can see how it looks like at the following diagram: This makes things like encouraging peer reviews very easy, since the team can checked what was modified on a task (branch), even when developers decided to make many intermediate commits (which is a very good practice!) There's a number of links below that can be helpful: Task per branch detailed Go Agile in 4 steps! And a screencast about it here .
