@Keith I think you nailed it, code coverage is important to look at if you want to see how "done" you are, but I think 100% is a bit unrealistic a goal. Striving for 75-90% will give you pretty good coverage without going overboard... don't test for the pure sake of hitting 100%, because at that point you are just wasting your time.
