What are you using the estimates for? Specifically, why will the developer feel stressed if you normally underestimate? If you're trying to schedule how long something is likely to take, you go for an intermediate value. Probably on the long side, since people normally underestimate. In any case, you shouldn't be using these estimates as firm objectives for developers, and so they shouldn't be overly stressful. If you're using these estimates to set up commitments, you need to err on the side of overestimating. Giving developers insufficient time leads to burnout, unmaintainable buggy code that doesn't do quite what the user wants, and low morale and high turnover. Set the commitments to be reachable, and encourage the developers to finish early.
