Partially answered in comments: Have you thought about trying to represent some of these features graphically? Boxplots, histograms, scatter plots all reveal a great deal. Also, for the variables you wish to use as explanatory in your regression be sure to check the correlation matrix. Multicollinearity is always lurking in the background. – JohnK But note that it is often better to start with a simple regression model, and then plot residuals from that model. You can comment on the location, e.g. mean median and the spread of these variables. Then see if there are outliers, using the boxplots. In the correlation matrix of the predictors, what are the highest correlations in absolute value? Just some ideas. – JohnK Useful discussion of the descriptive statistics is likely to require reference to what the numbers represent: Are negative values of PTBV qualitatively different from positive values, or even possible? Will the model need to extrapolate beyond the limited range of VaR values present in the sample? Could the low average return indicate a selection bias? &c. – Scortchi
