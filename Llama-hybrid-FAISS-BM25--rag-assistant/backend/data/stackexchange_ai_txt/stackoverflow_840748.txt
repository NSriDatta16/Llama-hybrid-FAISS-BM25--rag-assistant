Not to detract from this forum, but you might find more respondents with contextually relevant experience at the Apple iPhone DevForum. Speaking from a purely project management perspective, it sounds like you know how to build what you want to build using SQLite, and so it would make more sense to me for you to start along that route. That being said, CoreData builds on top of SQLite and if you are trying to leverage other parts of the system in conjunction with your data, e.g. using KVC/KVO or bindings, then you may quickly find that this functionality is worth the learning curve. = Mike
