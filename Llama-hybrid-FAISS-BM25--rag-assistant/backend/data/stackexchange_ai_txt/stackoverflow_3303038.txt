You already have you answer :) I'm afraid you'll have to use it that way, since every HTTP request will have to be retrieve from the faces context. You could, of course, simplify some part of this method, like the faces context retrieval, but its definitively the way to go, unless you use some kind of framework that abstracts away those details and let you get to the HttpRequest Object directly. Regards.
