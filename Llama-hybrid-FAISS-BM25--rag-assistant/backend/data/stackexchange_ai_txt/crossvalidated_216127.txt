Determinie how well sales correlate with weather

I work with for a retail company. A recurring problem in our meetings is that our mid-level managers usually blame weather for the sales development. I want to find out if this is right or wrong. My plan is to create a regression analysis and find out the coefficient of determination (R-squared). Input so far: Sales per day mm of rain per day hours of sun per day average temperature per day Questions: Is it better to use the actual numbers or should I code the rain, sun and temperature to something, say 0 or 1? What method would be the best approach to tackle this? We have business all over the world, but I'm first going to try it in a specific city. I plan to use Excel, could also use statistical software.
