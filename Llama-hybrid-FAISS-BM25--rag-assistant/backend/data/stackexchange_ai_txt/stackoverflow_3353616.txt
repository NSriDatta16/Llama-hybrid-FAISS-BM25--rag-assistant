Such a situation seems to be a symptom of bad class/library organization. It seems extremely strange that you would legitimately get into such a situation (Feel free to explain more precisely how you organized your classes if you want to discuss that) If you have full control of the composition of A, B and C, you can do at least the following things: Merge A, B and C into a single library and be done with it. (Not recommended - it will make good modularization nearly impossible) You needed to use a B class in C in order to do a work W. Do that work in library D instead. Move the B class you wanted, 'and' the classes from A from which the B class depends, in C.
