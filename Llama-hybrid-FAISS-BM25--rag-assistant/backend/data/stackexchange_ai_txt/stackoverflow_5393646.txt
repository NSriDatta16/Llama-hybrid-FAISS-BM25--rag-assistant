Current versions of eclipse have a more convenient way of doing this. Go to Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter Click on edit, and on the new opened window, go to the Braces tab. Here you can choose how different types of blocks of code organize their curly braces. Hope this helps any who google this, and find this post. (Like myself) Regards to all!
