The model here is something like $$ SP(\text{agecode}, \text{sexcode} \sim Binomial(N, p(\text{agecode}, \text{sexcode})) $$ The linear predictor in your model looks something like $$ \text{logit} (p) = \text{intercept} + \text{agecode}_i + \text{sexcode}_{j} $$ Where the agecode and sexcode are categorical factors. In these scenario with catageorical variables the coefficient for female and agecode1 will be zero , they are ``baseline'' categories. The coefficient for male is the average difference between a man and woman. The coefficient for agecode2 is the difference between a juvenile and sub adult, agecode3 is the difference between juvenile and an adult. So some concrete examples: A juvenile female will have, $\text{logit}(p) = \text{intercept}$ . A juvenile male will have $\text{logit}(p) = \text{intercept} + \text{sexcode}_1$ . An adult male will have $\text{logit}(p) = \text{intercept} + \text{sexcode}_1 + \text{agecode}_3$ .
