Preprocessing, training and post processing, along with correctly tuning model hyper parameters and benchmarking models via cross validation is a complex and time consuming effort. To facilitate that effort several "meta" machine learning packages were developed in R (most notably mlr3 and tidymodels ) and python ( scikit-learn ). These packages not only implement all the ML pipeline best practices but are also very useful for learning those practices while experimenting with actual data. I would advise picking one of those (doesn't really matter which, they are all great) and some Kaggle datasets and learn while doing actual modeling.
