Have you considered Mercurial ? I have created an account on bitbucket for collaborative development with a couple of my friends. Their free plan gives you: 150MB storage 1 private repository unlimited public repositories issue tracker wiki I also develop on Windows, so I have installed TortoiseHg to provide similar Windows integration to what TortoiseSVN provides for Subversion. As I am using Eclipse for some of my development, so I have also installed this plugin Mercurial Eclipse I can definitely recomend this setup for your situation, as I think distributed SCM is a better fit for this type of development.
