Performing a rolling regression (a regression with a rolling time window) simply means, that you conduct regressions over and over again, with subsamples of your original full sample. For example you could perform the regressions using windows with a size of 50 each, i.e. from 1:50, then from 51:100 etc. Another approach would be to apply overlapping windows with a size of 50 each. So for example using 1:50, then 41:90 etc. (cutting off the last 10 elements in each succeeding subsample regression). As a result you will receive a time series of your regression coefficients, which you can then analyze. Which approach to follow depends a lot on your context and what your research is aiming for.
