It depends on your usage but I discourage storing images in a database. They're better off on the filesystem with (perhaps) the paths to the images being stored in the database. The one case where I can see any gains by having the images stored in the database is if you want one filesystem unit that you can move around that moves everything around. Though with the iPhone this isn't a likely use-case.
