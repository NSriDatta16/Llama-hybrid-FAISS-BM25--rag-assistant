If a time series, which is a sum of some component time series, is spiking, how do I attribute the spike to the components

Let $X_t$ be a time series with $X_t = Y_t + Z_t$ . At time $T$ , $X_T$ "spikes"; that is to say, $X_{T-1}-X_T$ is over some critical threshold. I would like to assign some "contribution" to the spike to both $Y_T$ and $Z_T$ , so that I can say something like "the spike is 90% driven by a corresponding spike in $Y_T$ ". Is there a standard way to do this? What I've considered is using $\frac {Y_T - Y_{T-1}}{X_T - X_{t-1}}$ and $\frac {Z_T - Z_{T-1}}{X_T - X_{t-1}}$ , but these don't seem perfect for a few reasons. It's only in $[0,1]$ if both $Y$ and $Z$ increased, otherwise it might be negative or greater than 1. (1) is compounded when there are more than two terms contributing to $Y$ . I've tried looking for any standard statistical techniques for this kind of "spike attribution", but have come up a bit dry. Are there any standard measures or techniques for this?
