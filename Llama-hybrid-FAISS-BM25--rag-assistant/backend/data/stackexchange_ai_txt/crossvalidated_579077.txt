It is often not possible to obtain causality from your observed data. Your observed data gives you probabilistic dependencies, but since the same dependency can be created by causal dependency in both directions, as well as through hidden confounding , you cannot deduce cause and effect. That is why people often use interventions to obtain causal information. What you can do is compute the set of all possible causal graphs that could have created your data. This is done by algorithms like e.g. pcalg or fci. But they only work under certain conditions and are usually implemented in R. There is, however, the Causal Discovery Toolbox , which is a python library.
