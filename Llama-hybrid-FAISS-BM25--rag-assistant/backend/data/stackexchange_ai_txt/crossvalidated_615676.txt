Let's assume that your model is well-calibrated (see calibration ). If it isn't you can calibrate it , if there are other issues they need to be solved accordingly. This does not need re-sampling of the data. Then, the problem is picking the right threshold for making the predictions. You already seem to have all the pieces for doing it! The costs matrix for your problem is: is good is rotten predicted as good 50 -30 predicted as rotten -4 -1 With this information, you can pick a threshold and make the positive prediction when the predicted probability is greater than the threshold. After doing this, for each prediction assign the appropriate cost from the matrix above, and calculate the average cost. You can do this for different thresholds and just pick the threshold that maximizes the expected cost.
