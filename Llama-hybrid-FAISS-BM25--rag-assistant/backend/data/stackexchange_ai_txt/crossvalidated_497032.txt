Its totally doable due to the connections between Probabilistic PCA and Linear VAEs You can show that the decoder weights $W$ from the Linear VAE can be used to simulate samples from the following normal distribution $$ x \sim N(0, W'W + \sigma I) $$ See reference below for more details on this https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02469
