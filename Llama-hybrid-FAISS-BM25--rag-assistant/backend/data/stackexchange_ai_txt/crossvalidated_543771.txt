If you want more of a softer, practioner approach to the topic, I would encourage looking at the appropriate chapter within a book on DOE. Box, Hunter, Hunter is the classic reference (78 edition best). A shorter, but serviceable book is Barker Quality by Experimental Design. Both of these books have a lot of non-ANOVA. But you might appreciate what's in there also (type I/II errors, survey design, etc.) Also, really there are many decent Youtube videos that give you the basics of the topic if you want something quick. P.s. As for your MESE client (ugh, lost my login, mea culpa), (1) part of growing up is learning how to handle curmudgeons. Turn it into a joke. Or let it slide off. Or tease back a little. But don't get so ruffled so fast. (2) He told me he needed it (proofs) is not a good excuse. Be more astute. Don't accept things at face value. This applies to life/work in general, not just teaching. Bad assumptions are more often the flaw in a model than the formula. Also, "everyone should know continuity" and definitions of limits are not a good use of time for a trainee who needs first to refresh basic manipulations. Prioritize.
