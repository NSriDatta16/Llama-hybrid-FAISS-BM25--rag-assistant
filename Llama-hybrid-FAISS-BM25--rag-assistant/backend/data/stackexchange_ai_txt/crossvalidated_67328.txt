Relations between probabilities of "almost" independent random variables

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables, such that the (average) mutual information is very small: $$ 0 \le I(X;Y) \le \epsilon \ll 1$$ In this case, we say that $X$ and $Y$ are almost independent. Now, can we deduce something like: $$\forall x,y \quad \Pr[X=x,Y=y] \le \Pr[X=x]\cdot\Pr[Y=y] + \delta$$ with $\delta$ being a (possibly negative) function of $\epsilon$? If the general case above cannot be proven, maybe we can use the following special case: Let $X$ and $Y$ be discrete random variables, taking values from a finite set $D$ with $|D|=2^n$. Moreover, let $\epsilon$ be exponentially small in $n$, say $\epsilon = 2^{-n/2}$. Can we now obtain $\delta$ as a function of $\epsilon$?
