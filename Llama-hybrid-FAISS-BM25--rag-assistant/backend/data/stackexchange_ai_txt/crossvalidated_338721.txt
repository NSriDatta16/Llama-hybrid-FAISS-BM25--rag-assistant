There is no best to use because each method relates to specific assumptions about the testing methodology. Evan Miller's calculator calculates sample size for a two-tailed test. In the past Optimizely's calculator was calculating samples for a one-tailed test. Currently, Optimizely uses a Bayesian states engine and their sample size calculator has no input for Power, based on the construction of their stats engine. You can back into the sample size for each variation in the VWO calculator by multiplying the daily traffic * the number of days the test will run / number of variations. The results seem to imply they are also calculating sample size generically, like Evan's calculator, for a two-tailed hypothesis.
