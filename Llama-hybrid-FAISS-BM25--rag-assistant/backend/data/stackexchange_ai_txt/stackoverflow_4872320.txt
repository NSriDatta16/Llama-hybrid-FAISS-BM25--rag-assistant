There's really no good way to do this when rendering the video using the QuickTime plugin. Plugins are optimized for performance and typically render above the rest of the "native" elements within your page. I seem to recall there's a wmode="transparent" attribute or "opaque" that was introduced recently to the plugin similar to what's used with the Flash plugin, but the performance will typically suffer because the plugin renderer will often need to switch to rendering in software as it composites the video with the element you have on top of it, and possibly elements beneath it as well. The easiest thing to do is to simply use a video element to play the media you want on your page. At that point it is an element like any other on the page and interacts seamlessly with the z-index ordering of positioned elements. An example of the usage is here: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-html5-video/ You may need to nest differently encoded videos as video elements in the page so various user agents with support for different codes can play the video. But just adding the video element and pointing it at your current QuickTime video will work as well as a simple object using the QT plugin.
