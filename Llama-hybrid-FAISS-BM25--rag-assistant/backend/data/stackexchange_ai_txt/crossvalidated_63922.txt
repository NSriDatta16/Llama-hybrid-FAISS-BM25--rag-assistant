What exactly is the actual coverage probability?

I am confused about the difference between the nominal and the actual coverage probability . Say we are trying to estimate the fraction of the current population of the US that has been diagnosed with cancer. We get a sample (e.g. 10,000 individuals) and then estimate this fraction ($f$) and a confidence interval around it $[a,b]$ with $\alpha$ (confidence level) $=0.95$. At this point, if I understood things correctly, the nominal coverage probability is $\alpha$, i.e. $0.95$. But what about the actual coverage probability? To me, there is only one true value of $f$, e.g. say $5\%$, and it doesn't make sense to talk about the actual probability that $f$ is within the interval $[a,b]$. It either is or it isn't within $[a,b]$. What's wrong with this reasoning? And how would one obtain the actual coverage probability in practice?
