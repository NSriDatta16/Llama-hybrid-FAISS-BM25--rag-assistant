It is not only possible that different sets of predictors are used in different folds, it very likely in my experience. It is however OK to average the error estimates from each fold. You want the instability of the predictor set to go into the error estimate: You are not estimating the expected error of a specific model, you are estimating the expected error of the entire procedure incuding variable selection.
