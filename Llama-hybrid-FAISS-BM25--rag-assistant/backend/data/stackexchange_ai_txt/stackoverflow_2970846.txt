Firstly, it looks like your routes file has the wrong syntax. If you are trying to establish routes for nested resources, you'd do it like so: map.resources :admin admin.resources :organizations end This would give you paths such as: /admin/ /admin/1 /admin/1/organizations /admin/1/organizations/1 The mapping from route to controller/action is done via a Rails convention, where HTTP verbs are assigned in ways that are useful for the typical CRUD operations. For example: /admin/1/organizations/1 would map to several actions in the OrganizationsController, distinguished by the type of verb: /admin/1/organizations/1 # GET -> :action => :show /admin/1/organizations/1 # PUT -> :action => :update /admin/1/organizations/1 # DELETE -> :action => :destroy "Show" is one of the seven standard resourceful actions that Rails gives you by default. You can exclude "show" with the directive :except => :show , or specify only the resourceful actions you want with :only => :update , for example. I recommend you look at Rails Routing from the Outside In , which is a great introduction to this topic. EDIT I see I ignored the namespacing in my answer, sorry. How about this: map.namespace(:admin) do |admin| admin.resources :homepages, :member => { :org_deals => :get } end This will generate your org_deals action as a GET with an id parameter (for the organization). You also get a show route, along with the six other resourceful routes. rake routes shows this: org_deals_admin_homepage GET /admin/homepages/:id/org_deals(.:format) {:controller=>"admin/homepages", :action=>"org_deals"} Of course your homepages_controller.rb has to live in app/controllers/admin/ EDIT redux Actually, you want organizations in the path, I'll bet, in which case: map.namespace(:admin) do |admin| admin.resources :organizations, :controller => :homepages, :member => { :org_deals => :get } end which gives you: org_deals_admin_organization GET /admin/organizations/:id/org_deals(.:format) {:controller=>"admin/homepages", :action=>"org_deals"}
