Bayesian linear regression marginal likelihood dimension mismatch

Consider a standard Bayesian multi-output regression problem: $X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ $W \sim \mathcal{N}(W; 0, \sigma_{W}^2I)$ (where $W \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ ). $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(Y; WX, \sigma_\epsilon^2I)$ The marginal likelihood of $Y$ given $X$ under this model is $P(Y|X) = \mathcal{N}(Y;0, \sigma_w^2XX^T + \sigma_\epsilon^2I)$ (from e.g. http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/4f13/1920/bayesian%20finite%20regression.pdf ), but as far as I can tell, this gives inconsistent dimensions: the covariance 'matrix' of the marginal is 1x1, but the dimension of $Y$ is $k$ . Are we meant to interpret this as saying that each dimension of $Y$ is independently distributed with this distribution? Thanks Kris
