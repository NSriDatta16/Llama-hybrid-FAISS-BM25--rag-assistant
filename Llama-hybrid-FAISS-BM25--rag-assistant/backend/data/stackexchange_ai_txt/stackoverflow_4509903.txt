Here are some references I like. I'm sure there are better, but there are the ones I have read and can vouch for: Java in a Nutshell is a classic summary of the core language. If you need more, there are books like Java for Programmers for programmers transitioning to Java (I have not read it). Sun's Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages was a good book for Java servlets and JSPs. But consider that a lot of web tech is built on top of this (e.g. Spring), so this may be giving you foundation but not direct knowledge of the specific framework you will be using. Also a lot of web tech these days are client-side/JavaScript/AJAX-based, e.g. jQuery. As for MVC, consider focusing on MVP instead. I been playing around with Google Web Toolkit to leverage my Java background to create client-side apps, but it is also a good way to get some idea of MVP - read Large scale application development and MVP Part I and Part II , and the GWT MVP Development with Activities and Places . However, GWT keeps evolving. My last suggestion is that you narrow your focus - try to figure out what frameworks are popular at work and decide if you want to focus on a tier: front (e.g. HTML/CSS/jQuery), middle (e.g. Spring), or back-end (e.g. Hibernate). Once you figure this out, then post a more specific question(s) (e.g. what are the best resources for learning XYZ).
