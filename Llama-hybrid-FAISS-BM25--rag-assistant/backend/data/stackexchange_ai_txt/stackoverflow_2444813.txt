When compiling/debugging, is VS supposed to delete existing files in the bin\debug area?

Q1 - When doing a compile/debug is VS supposed to delete existing files in the bin\debug area? (for VS2008) if no then can I ask please: Q2 - My winforms checks for existance of a sqlite.db3 file and creates it if it needs to (programmatically). If the behavior I wanted was that each Compile/Debug I do is for the target Debug area to be clear, so that the program would exercise the code that builds the database file, how would I organise this? thanks
