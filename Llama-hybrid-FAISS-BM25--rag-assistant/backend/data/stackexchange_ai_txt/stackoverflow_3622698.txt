Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial is by far the best introduction to Rails I've been able to find online. It's very easy to understand what's going on if you've already got experience in web application development in general. Versions of the tutorial for Rails 2.3.8 and Rails 3 are available. The introduction also discusses learning Ruby first vs learning Rails first. Not only does it teach how to use Rails, it explains common Rails conventions (the Rails Way). I think this, in particular, is what you are looking for. It also encourages the use of good practices such as git source control and test-driven development, which is cool.
