Simple Grouping With TableSorter Plugin

Im playing around with the Tablesorter plug-in for jQuery and was trying to get a very simple grouping functionality added into it. Using the follow html/js works great until you click sort again and reverse the order. The headers get moved to the bottom of the group when this happens. The following is my (admitedly hacky) attempt at it. Does anyone have any ideas? Table Manipulation Test $(document).ready(function() { $("#test_table").tablesorter({ sortForce: [[3,0]] }); $(".group_details").hide(); $(".group_header").click(function(){ var group = $(this).attr("group"); var $expander = $(this).children("td.expanderguy") if ($("." + group + ":visible").length){ $("." + group + "").fadeOut('fast'); $expander.html(" "); } else{ $("." + group + "").fadeIn('fast'); $expander.html(" "); } }); } ); .group_header td{ background-color: #888888; !important } First Name Last Name Email Due Date Amount Due Monday, June 7 Flavian Wenceslas fwencs@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $100 Gordian Ives gives@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $1700 Saladin Tarquin starquin@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $1700 Urban Cyprian ucyprian@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $1500 Sargon Swithun sswithun@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $1100 Pompey Ladislas pladislas@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $300 Attila Hiawatha ahiawatha@gmail.com Monday, June 7 $200 Tuesday, June 8 Bruce Fenton bfenton@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $1700 Wade Sequoia wsequoia@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $1400 Eddie Jerold ejerold@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $1100 Lynn Lucan llucan@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $1200 Taegan Tadg ttadg@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $100 Clyde Reed creed@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $6100 Alaois Art aart@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $2100 Gilbert Patsy gpatsy@gmail.com Tuesday, June 8 $1500 Wednesday, June 9 Clem Eben ceben@gmail.com Wednesday, June 9 $2100 Elijah Julyan ejulyan@gmail.com Wednesday, June 9 $2100 Marvyn Damian mdamian@gmail.com Wednesday, June 9 $1100 Sawyer Ryker sryker@gmail.com Wednesday, June 9 $500
