what am I doing wrong? Using a real . When you use attributes like , the browser may fix up your values to make them valid. So because the characters {} aren't valid in a URL, the browser may encode them to %7B%7D . This is probably browser-specific; Nick's example that he says works fails for me in Firefox. (It also fails in IE due to the missing var on test_template , but that's an unrelated issue.) Remember when you write HTML elements, the HTML source is not maintained. The browser will parse it into a load of DOM nodes. When you call html() ( innerHTML ) what you get is a serialisation of those DOM nodes, which does not exactly preserve the formatting of the original markup. Especially when the original markup isn't really valid HTML but just a placeholder for templating. For this reason I would not use actual in-page elements to template from, and I consider jquery-tmpl's encouragement of this with its $(element).template() method to be a mistake. That's not the only issue I with the plugin. For example if you put data() or an event handler on an element inside the template, that data/handler gets copied accidentally on IE but not other browsers, due to na√Øve innerHTML copying and jQuery's horrid node-identity hack. So if you must use jquery-tmpl , use strings with it, not nodes. Use strings embedded in a if you have to, but don't use actual in-page elements. (As well as this problem, it's also semantically questionable to have content in the document that isn't actual content.)
