Your second histogram is clearly right skew. It's just not as right skew as the components you started with. This is exactly what you should expect. The distributions of sums of random variables will tend to be less skew than the variables that make up the sum. For example, consider samples from two and four identical distributions shaped like the first histogram, and the distribution of their sums: This is fairly typical of the kind of thing you see, though if one component of the sum is much more variable than the others it will tend to "dominate" the shape; nevertheless the sum will still tend to be less skew than the most skew component. When you add an independent random component to another, you get a convolution of their densities, which results a kind of "smearing out" or blurring - peaks become rounder, shapes become more symmetric. If you add a lot of terms, you (slowly) tend to get closer to normally-distributed totals. If we assume independence of the component times and look at the skewness measure based on third moments we can even quantify how much this tends to happen. Specifically if we consider cumulants (which are related to moments) we can use the fact that the cumulants of independent random variables "add" (the $k$th cumulant of the sum is the sum of $k$th cumulants). [The first cumulant is the mean, the second cumulant is the variance, and the third cumulant is the third central moment; the fourth cumulant is not the fourth central moment, but we'll just use the first three for now] If you have variables drawn independently from two distributions, the first with mean $\mu_1$, variance $\sigma^2_1$ and third central moment $\theta_1$, and the second with corresponding values $\mu_2$, $\sigma^2_2$ and $\theta_2$, then the mean, variance and third central moment of the sum will be$\mu_1+\mu_2$, $\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2$ and $\theta_1+\theta_2$ respectively. The skewness coefficients of the components will be $\theta_1/\sigma_1^3$ and $\theta_2/\sigma_2^3$ and the skewness of the sum of components will be $\frac{\theta_1+\theta_2}{(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)^{3/2}}$. Imagine for simplicity that the standard deviations of both distributions is about the same. Then the third-moment-skewness of the sum would be about 70% of the average of those two skewness values. If you added 100 of them (again assuming about equal standard deviations) the skewness would reduce to about 10% of the average skewness.
