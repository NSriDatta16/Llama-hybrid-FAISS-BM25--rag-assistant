Most used fields are by no means index candidates. Good index candidates are those that correctly balance the extra storage requirements with SARGability and query projection coverage, as described in Index Design Basics . You should follow the advice the very engine is giving you, using the Missing Indexes feature: sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats sys.dm_db_missing_index_groups sys.dm_db_missing_index_details sys.dm_db_missing_index_columns A good action plan is to start from the most expensive queries by IO obtained from sys.dm_exec_query_stats and then open the plan of the query with sys.dm_exec_query_plan in Management Studio and at the top of the query plan view will be a proposed index, with the CREATE INDEX just ready to copy and paste into execution. In fact you don't even have to run the queries to find the most expensive query in the plan cache, there are already SSMS reports that can find it for you.
