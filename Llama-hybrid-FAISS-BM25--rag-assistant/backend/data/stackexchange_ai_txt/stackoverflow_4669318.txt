how do you organize your programming work

I'm a newbie in the field, but in the near future I have to develop an application for a friend(I've already did some work of the app and the friend is happy). I assume that I need 3 places to store my work, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach. I need your advice, opinion, link,book, blog about this subject. I plan to have: a place where I develop the application a place where I keep a back-up of the application a place with the application ready for use I'll use git in the development stage, but for the later I don't know what tools to use, or which are the good practices. Can you give me an advice? PS: at this moment I'm using cakephp to build some webapps, but I play with C++ from time to time too.
