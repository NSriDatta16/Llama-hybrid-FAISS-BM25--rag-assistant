Are these placement new macros correct?

I made a couple macros to make using placement new a bit easier. I was just wondering if there were any obvious cases where these would not work. Thanks. #define CONSTRUCT_INPLACE(TYPE,STORAGE,INIT) ::new((TYPE*)STORAGE) TYPE INIT #define DESTRUCT_INPLACE(TYPE,STORAGE) ((TYPE*)STORAGE)->~TYPE()
