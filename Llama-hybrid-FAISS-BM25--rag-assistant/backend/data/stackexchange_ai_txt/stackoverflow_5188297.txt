a) No, the overhead is pretty much the same as if they were a single file. b) Not really, unless you know your usage pattern pretty much exactly. You can use FSCTL_MOVE_FILE in Windows if you need to move your files around, but I don't recommend it because (1) you'd need administrator privileges, and (2) it's really hard to figure out where to put the file, because each disk has different specs, and because you might end up having to basically build your own defragmentation engine. c) Yes, SSDs are the perfect solution to this! :) d) Native Command Queuing within the disk is designed to allow for this on SATA drives (it reorders up to 32 commands by the OS for better performance), and while it's definitely helpful, it's not quite as noticeable of a gain as you might think. The file system's memory cache is a much more influential factor here -- it caches your data in memory so that random writes can become more sequential (and faster).
