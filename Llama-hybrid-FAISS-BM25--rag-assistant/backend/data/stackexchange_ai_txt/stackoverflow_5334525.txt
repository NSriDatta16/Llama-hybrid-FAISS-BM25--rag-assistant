State of the Art for Clojure Documentation Tools

Over the last year or so I've seen various announcements on the Clojure discussion list and other places about tools for documenting Clojure code. These range from full-on literate programming systems like Marginalia, and the tool being used to create the book "Clojure in Small Pieces" (or even emacs org-mode), to more conventional Javadoc-style solutions like Autodoc, and Javadoc itself which reportedly can be used with Clojure. A google search turns up various others, perhaps a few that deserve more attention, and for sure some that are just personal utilities for generating docs. My question is what are the best documentation tools, and what are their comparative strengths and weaknesses based on your experiences using them? I have not used any documentation tools to date, and am interested in experimenting with one or more.
