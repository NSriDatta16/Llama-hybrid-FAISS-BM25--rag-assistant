As far I understand, the VB workaround relies on the uniformity of the various steps; in other words, it repeats the same action until the exit condition is met. Caliburn co-routines, instead, are useful in the opposite scenario: unhomogeneous (and asynchronous) steps interlaced with control code; but this is basically a state machine. Actually, Caliburn leverages C# compiler to obtain a free and automatically generated state machine implementation; so the solution might be to build a simple hand-made state machine just like the one built by C# compiler (see http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/03/23/all-about-iterators.aspx ).
