Nested Portlet Serialization

Does anyone have a link to a good tutorial on nesting portlets and serializing the data? i am trying to create a jQuery drag and drop tool where users can manage fleet -> country -> port data. For example the second fleet consists of X countries and those countries have X ports inside of them. I have the drag and drop functionality working as well as the connect with so you can only drag countries to countries and ports to ports.
