How to find how which inputs correlate to output in XOR way

Let's say this is my function: bit f( bit bits[] ) = bits[0] ^ bits[2] ^ bits[7] ^ ... I have a list of bits[] . I ran the function ( f ) on that list of bits[] . Is there proper (Not O(!n) ) machine learning that can recover that function ( f )? I thought of seeing it as integer addition (e.g. bits[0] + bits[2] + bits[7] + ... ), and then dropping all the integer's bits, except the first one, but I don't know how to recover that integer. (Isn't that impossible, because it lost most of it's entropy retrieved from the transformation of the input?)
