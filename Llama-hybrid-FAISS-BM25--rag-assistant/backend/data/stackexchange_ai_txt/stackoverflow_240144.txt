Store it as binary if you're not doing text storage. Text is hideously inefficient; XML is even worse. The lack of efficiency of the storage format predicates larger file transfers which means more time. If you are having to store text, filter it through a zip library. Your main issue is going to be file locking and concurrency. Everything starts to get groady when you have to write/read/write in a concurrent fashion. At this point, get a DB of some sort installed and BLOB the file up or something, because you'll be writing your own DB at this point....and no one wants to reinvent that wheel(you know, if they aren't doing their own DB company of their own, or are a PhD student, or have a strange hobby...)
