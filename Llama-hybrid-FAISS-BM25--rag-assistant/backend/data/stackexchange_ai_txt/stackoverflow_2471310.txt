There's no hard and fast rule, but in general the way I've approached is: If its for a personal project, by all means. If its on someone else's dollar, then generally you hold off on fixing it until the client wants the benefit of increased maintainability/performance that you'll be delivering or until you need to touch that code to make other alterations anyway. Whatever the case, try to make sure you've got test coverage that insures you won't break any existing functionality.
