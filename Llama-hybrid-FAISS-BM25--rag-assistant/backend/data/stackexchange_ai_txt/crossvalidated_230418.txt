Since $p(1)=p$ and $p(0)=1-p$ are both proportional to a known expression* (the unscaled probabilities, $u(i)=c.p(i)$, with the same unknown constant of proportionality, $c$) and you know the $p(i)$ values must add to $1$, then $u(0)+u(1)=c$. Which is to say $p(i) = \frac{u(i)}{u(0)+u(1)},\: i=0,1$. (This notion is widely used in Bayesian statistics with many kinds of discrete variables.) Note that $u(0)=1$ (always, since the power is $s_i=0$), so $p(0) = 1/(1+u(1))$ and $p(1)=u(1)/(1+u(1))$ *(these $p$'s are $q(s_i|\alpha_0)$ in the paper, for $s_i=0$ and $1$ respectively)
