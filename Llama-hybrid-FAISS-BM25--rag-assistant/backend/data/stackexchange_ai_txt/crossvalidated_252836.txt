Why isn't Hosmer-Lemeshow test used for other models besides Logistic Regression?

I've only seen the Hosmer-Lemeshow test used for Logistic Regression. Why can't it be used for algorithm that produces probabilities for binary classification? All the Hosmer-Lemeshow test requires probabilities and binary labels. So, why hasn't it been used on models such as support vector machines, random forest, and any other binary classification algorithm?
