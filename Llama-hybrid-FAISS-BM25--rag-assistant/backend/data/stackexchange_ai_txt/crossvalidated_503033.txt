The following is taken from my manuscript on confidence distributions - Johnson, Geoffrey S. "Decision Making in Drug Development via Confidence Distributions." arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.04721 (2020). In the Bayesian framework the population-level parameter of interest is considered an unrealized or unobservable realization of a random variable that depends on the observed data. This premise has cause and effect reversed. In order to overcome this the Bayesian approach reinterprets probability as measuring the subjective belief of the experimenter. Another interpretation is that the unknown fixed parameter, say theta, was randomly selected from a known collection or prevalence of theta's (prior distribution) and the observed data is used to subset this collection, forming the posterior. The unknown fixed true theta is now imagined to have instead been randomly selected from the posterior. Every time the prior or posterior is updated the sampling frame from where we obtained our unknown fixed true theta under investigation must be changed. A third interpretation is that all values of theta are true simultaneously. The truth exists in a superposition depending on the evidence observed (think Schrodinger's cat). Ascribing any of these interpretations to the posterior allows one to make philosophical probability statements about hypotheses given the data. While the p-value is typically not interpreted in the same manner, it does show us the plausibility of a hypothesis given the data - the ex-post sampling probability of the observed result or something more extreme if the hypothesis is true. This does not reverse cause and effect. To the Bayesian, probability is axiomatic and measures the experimenter. To the frequentist, probability measures the experiment and must be verifiable. The Bayesian interpretation of probability as a measure of belief is unfalsifiable. Only if there exists a real-life mechanism by which we can sample values of theta can a probability distribution for theta be verified. In such settings probability statements about theta would have a purely frequentist interpretation (see the second interpretation of the posterior above). This may be a reason why frequentist inference is ubiquitous in the scientific literature. The interpretation of frequentist inference is straight forward for non-statisticians by citing confidence levels, e.g. 'We are 15.9% confident that theta is less than or equal to theta_0.' Of course to fully appreciate this statement of confidence one must more fully define the p-value as a frequency probability of the experiment if the hypothesis is true (think of the proof by contradiction structure a prosecutor uses in a court room setting, innocent until proven guilty). A Bayesian approach may make it easy for some to interpret a posterior probability, e.g. 'There is 17.4% Bayesian belief probability that theta is less than or equal to theta_0.' Of course to fully appreciate this statement one must fully define Bayesian belief and make it clear this is not a verifiable statement about the actual parameter, the hypothesis, nor the experiment. If the prior distribution is chosen in such a way that the posterior is dominated by the likelihood or is proportional to the likelihood, Bayesian belief is more objectively viewed as confidence based on frequency probability of the experiment. In short, for those who subscribe to the frequentist interpretation of probability, the confidence distribution summarizes all probability statements about the experiment one can make. It is a matter of correct interpretation given the definition of probability and what constitutes a random variable. The posterior remains an incredibly useful tool and can be interpreted as a valid asymptotic confidence distribution. The frequentist framework can easily incorporate historical data through a fixed-effect meta-analysis.
