I ended up doing as described in the question, training a separate binomial logistic regression model for each category label. The steps were as follows: For category 'A', split labeled (training) data into 'A' and 'not A'. Train the LR model. Find the outcome probability of the model that corresponds to an acceptable threshold on a classification metric (in this case the balanced accuracy). Make predictions for unlabeled data (data that was not in the training set). Based on the result of step (3), assign label 'A', or don't, to the unlabeled data points. This was repeated for all categories. The system is working acceptably. I still feel like there may be a better approach out there, but everyone I've talked to has seemed to think this one is fine!
