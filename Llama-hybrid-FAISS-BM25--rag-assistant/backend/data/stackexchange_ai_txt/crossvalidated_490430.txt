Not too long after you asked this question, there was an interesting research paper entitled Scalable Learning of Non-Decomposable Objectives that I stumbled across from a StackOverflow question that finds ways to build several interesting loss functions: Precision at fixed recall Recall at fixed precision AUCROC maximization There was an implementation for TF 1.x over here . Unfortunately it does not appear to have garnered much attention so it is not being actively maintained ; however, I think this is a quite valuable approach when trying to build real-world binary classifiers.
