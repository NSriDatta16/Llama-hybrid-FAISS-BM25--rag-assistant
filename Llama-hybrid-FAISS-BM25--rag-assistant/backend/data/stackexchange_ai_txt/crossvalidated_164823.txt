What is the difference between Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Fields models in the context of Named Entity Recognition?

Can someone intuitively explain how Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models can perform Named Entity Recognition (NER), and the difference between them conceptually? Also is there a preference of one approach over other depending on what we would like to achieve?
