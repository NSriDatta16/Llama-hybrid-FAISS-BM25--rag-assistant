How to store text as paragraphs in SQLite database in a iPhone app?

In my iPhone app, I have a requirement to store a huge amount of text. I have paragraphs of text to be stored in my database along with the newline characters. What should I do to store the text as paragraphs in SQLite database? For example, I want to store paragraphs like the ones below in: (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read. The Prophet added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Basically I want to save the paragraphs in database in the same format with carriage returns.
