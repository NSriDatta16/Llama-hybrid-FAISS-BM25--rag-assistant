evaluate the prediction power of a signal to predict a stock price

How would you evaluate the predictive power of a Signal time series (supposedly output by an Artificial Intelligence system) in predicting a stock price time series given a sample data set as follows: Date Open High Low Close Adj Close Signal 202106-01 627.80 633.80 620.55 620.55 623.90 85.11 2021-06-02 620.13 623.36 599.14 620.13 605.12 76.59 2021-06-03 601.80 604.55 571.22 571.22 572.84 68.73 2021-06-04 579.71 600.61 577.20 600.61 599.05 78.47 2021-06-07 591.83 610.00 582.88 610.00 605.13 78.63 and so on for some few weeks. No further information is provided. Question : how could one evaluate the predictive power of Signal in predicting the stock price, given only the information above?
