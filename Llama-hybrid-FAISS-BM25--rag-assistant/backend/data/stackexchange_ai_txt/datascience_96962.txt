How do I decide on my X and Y variables for the prediction of a coin toss?

So I'm new to data science and was trying to solve a few problems that my mentor gave to me. I came across this question where there are multiple coin tosses and ten of them are recorded. I am supposed to create a model that can predict the outcome of another coin toss. I have attached an example of what the dataset could look like. [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WsBve.png I was trying to convert all Head to 1 and all Tail to 0 and then apply simple linear regression (as a starting point) but was very confused as to what my X and Y variable would be. Currently, I am not splitting the dataset into training and test sets since the dataset is relatively small. Thanks in advance!
