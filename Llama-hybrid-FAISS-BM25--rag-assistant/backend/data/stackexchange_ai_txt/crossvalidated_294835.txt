From my experience, the number of states and observations does not have to be identical: observations only need to contain sufficient information to update the Kalman prediction of the state attempted to be estimated. "Some form of Bayesian regression" is indeed what I am trying to accomplish, by casting it as a KF prediction-correction step. From the below paper on particle filtering [1], I understand the KF to be an implementation of the same Bayes' rule used in Bayesian interference: [1] 2005 David Salmond and Neil Gordon, An introduction to particle filters (p.3-4) http://docdro.id/rTr7xfN The propagated state is a prior belief PDF, the measurement model is a likelihood (probability of observing a measurement given the prior state), and the actual measurement appears in the normalizing denominator. The Kalman (or Particle Filter) update equation is very similar to Bayes' rule and combines the above into a posterior PDF (in the case of time series filtering, a propagated state at time $t+\delta t$, but this does not seem essential to me). The Bayesian update equation on p.4 of [1] is can apparently be used to derive the KF update equation, if Gaussian and linear assumptions are made. I do agree that my question is unusual, because if KF methods can indeed be used to approximate Bayesian regression problems, it might be mentioned more often. If it can be done it probably is being done, but might go under a different name or formulation. My domain is flight dynamics and not signal processing or stochastic methods, but to my knowledge the inclusion of prior information is not possible with stochastic least-squares fitting such as most likelihood estimators. If for example the KF is a ML estimator, it would not fit my purpose. But I thought the inclusion of prior information made it a Bayesian estimator, as explained in [1].
