Remember that standard deviation is all about average distance from the mean. That the distribution is bell shaped means that moving away from the mean in either direction decreases the likelihood of new observations. With a strong right skew, you could move away from the mean into a higher likelihood region, which would lead to higher average deviations from the mean in typical situations. But I think you could argue (e), especially if you are able to find a concrete counterexample.
