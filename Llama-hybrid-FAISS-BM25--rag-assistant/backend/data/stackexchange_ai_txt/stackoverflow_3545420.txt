inserting links into Magento top nav in a robust, user-friendly manner

There are a couple of options that I've used in the past, and I'm interested to hear thoughts on which is best. manually insert links into top.phtml (urgh...) +easy, quick -users cannot edit -reduces future proofing for upgrades create a category where the Display Settings is set to Static Block Only with a selected CMS block. The CMS block then calls the content using the {{block type='custom/module' template='path/file.phtml'}} syntax. +Users can edit link titles and targets -numerous steps to follow for users -CMS editor inserts unwanted characters and an extra layer of processing/markup create a static block that is inserted into top.phtml using echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('block_name') syntax +users can edit link titles and targets in one location -users may unintentionally remove ul/li classes required for correct nav display Are there other options that I'm not aware of, new functionality in v1.4, etc? Thanks, JD
