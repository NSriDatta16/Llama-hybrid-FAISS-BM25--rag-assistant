Take a look at the MoveMe sample project from Apple (registration may be required). It demonstrates how to have a placard follow a touch as well as transform itself based on different touches. Essentially, the idea is that you override the UIResponder touch methods to analyze what kind of touch the device received, and then either move the object to follow the user's finger or give it a speed in a direction depending on whether it was a slow drag or a swipe. You can then use Core Animation to animate changes to the object's frame.
