recursive has a truly elegant and Pythonic solution. BUT: why do you want to return None ? Python has a way of handling errors, and that is by raising an exception: class AIsTooSmallError( ArgumentError ): pass and then raise AIsTooSmallError( "a must be positive." ) The reason this is better is that returning a value indicates that you have completed processing and are passing back your answer. This is fine if you have done some processing, but it's silly if you are immediately returning None .
