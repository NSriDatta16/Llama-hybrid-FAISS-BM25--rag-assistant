You are describing "intervention analysis" or "interrupted time series". It refers to estimating how much an intervention has changed a time series. (Intervention-analysis is even one of the tags here, so I am proposing an edit to add it to your question.) Among other ways, it can be done using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA should be done on a stationary time series but you can estimate a seasonal component and control for it if necessary. And NickAdams is right that you don't want to use raw numbers but rather use proportion of visitors who sign up.
