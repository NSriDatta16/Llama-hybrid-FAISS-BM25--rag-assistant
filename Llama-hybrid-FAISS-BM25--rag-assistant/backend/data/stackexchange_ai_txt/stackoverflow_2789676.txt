1 req every 10 seconds = 6 req/min = 360 req/hr = 8640 req/day = ~260k req/month 4MB/260k ~= 15 So to stay under your limit, the average post to the server will have to be 15 bytes? Doesn't seem possible. Even if you went down to the socket level (which you probably should anyway), a simple ping sends 84 bytes, so even that would restrict you to once per minute.
