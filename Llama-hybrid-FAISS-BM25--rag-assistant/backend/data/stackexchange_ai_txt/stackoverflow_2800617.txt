getting file path through browse button

i have put a browse button in my html form. with the help of it i just want to get only the file path not the file itself. for ex: if i browse to "D:\Raghu\hgg" all i want is the path itself, not the "hgg" folder. is it possible? any hint is very much appreciated.
