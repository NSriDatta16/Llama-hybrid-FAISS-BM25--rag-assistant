In a random forest the cases are bagged (bootstrap resamples for each tree) but instead of actually including multiple copies of some cases scikit just adjust the weights of those cases which results in about a 30% speed up. It appears the code to count the values uses these weights while the code to count the number of samples does not. You can try growing the rf with bootstrap=False to verify.
