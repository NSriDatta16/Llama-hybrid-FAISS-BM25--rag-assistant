I would do something like this: for each side, make a copy and push it 'inward' the desired width of the bevel. ('inward' being along the normal vector of the side). Once you've done this, find the intersection points between the new copies (and the copies of whichever sides they previously intersected) and use those as the vertices for your inner shape. For the intersections, you'll need consider true lines (rather than segments), since sides in concave regions will need to grow. This will break horribly if you try to use it on a shape with regions less then twice the width of your bevel size, but should be fine otherwise. (I'm sure you could add something to handle those cases, but that's another discussion) Alternately, if you wanted the bevel width to be relative to vertices, you could also just push those 'inward' using the same principle. Estimate the vertice's normal angle by averaging the normals of the side it connects.
