Julie Lerman has a free, online presentation on EF tips and tricks tomorrow . I will be presenting " How to Think Like the Entity Framework (and why you might want to bother doing so in the first place) " at the free, online CodeRage conference in September . The presentation will be available for download shortly thereafter.
