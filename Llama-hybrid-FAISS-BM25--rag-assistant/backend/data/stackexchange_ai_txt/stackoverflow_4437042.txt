Second argument to std::vector

Looking at vector , I realized that I have never used the second argument when creating vectors. std::vector myInts; // this is what I usually do std::vector myOtherInts; // but is there a second argument there? Looking at the link above it says that it is for: Allocator object to be used instead of constructing a new one. or, as for this one : Allocator: Type of the allocator object used to define the storage allocation model. By default, the allocator class template for type T is used, which defines the simplest memory allocation model and is value-independent. I guess it has to do with something with memory management. However, I am not sure how to use that. Any pointers regarding this?
