Validation data is not used to update the weights. If it were used to update the weights, then you would have information leakage because the out-of-sample data is used to fit the model. This defeats the purpose of using a validation set: estimating how well the model does when the model sees new data. This is true generally, not only in the case of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I would describe the process in this way: For each epoch: Batch 1 > Forward pass > Backward pass > Update Weights Batch 2 > Forward pass > Backward pass > Update Weights ... Batch N > Forward pass > Backward pass > Update Weights Validation Set > Predict > Evaluate
