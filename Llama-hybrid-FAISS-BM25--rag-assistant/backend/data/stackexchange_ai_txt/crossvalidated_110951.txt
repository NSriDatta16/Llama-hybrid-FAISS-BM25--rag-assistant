I am going to generalize my response instead of making it SPSS-specific (as that's probably against the forum rules). You need to write a loop that goes through your data set. This loop goes through all the values in your data set and replaces the null with the average of the values that come immediately before(i-1) and immediately after (i+1) the null (i.e. non-response). If your data set is small enough, you can also do the calculation manually instead of writing the loop. The pseudo-code is: for (i=2:n) { if(i=="null") { i = ((i-1)+(i+1))/2 } else { i++ } }
