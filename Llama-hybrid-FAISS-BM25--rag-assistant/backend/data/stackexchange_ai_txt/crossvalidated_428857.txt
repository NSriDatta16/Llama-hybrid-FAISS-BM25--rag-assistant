I don't think either of these is exactly a substitute for Statistical Sleuth (which I also like) but it's a pair of books that will help a lot: Statistics by Freedman, Pisani and Purves. A really good text that will teach you a lot but won't overwhelm you with math. Statistics as Principled Argument by Robert Abelson. An excellent and very informal guide to using statistics sensibly, particularly in the "soft" sciences.
