Coverage rate has to do with the precision of your estimates and their error. Rejection probability has to do with the power of tests. For most tests, inference about the rejection of a hypothesis can be ascertained from whether or not the CI doesn't include 0. So high coverage probabilities tend to indicate undesirably low rejection probability (aka power when the null hypothesis is false): this is called a conservative test. On the other hand, low coverage probabilities tend to indicate either a biased estimator or anticonservative error estimates, which can inflate or attenuate rejection probability. If your pop has a mean 0, then I think you are saying the null hypothesis is true. In that case rejection probability is the false positive error rate. This roughly is also the probability that an experiment produces a CI which does not contain 0. So yes in this case that interpretation is correct.
