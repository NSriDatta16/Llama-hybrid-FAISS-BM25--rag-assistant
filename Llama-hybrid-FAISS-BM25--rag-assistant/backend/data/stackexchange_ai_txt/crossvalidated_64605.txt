Yes: the model is $\operatorname{logit} p_i = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_3 x_{3i}$ . That's true for bog-standard logistic regression anyway - the term is sometimes used where there's an extra parameter for dispersion, or for an estimating equation approach for which the Bernoulli model isn't assumed. Re your comment: $\sum_{i=1}^{m_j} Y_{ij}$ has a binomial distribution $\operatorname{Bin}(m_j,p_j)$ for groups of $m_j$ people (from the original $n$ ) who have the same covariate pattern—the same blood pressure, pulse rate & glucose levels—& therefore the same probability $p_j$ of obesity. If no-one has the same covariate pattern, then there are $n$ groups, each with $m_j=1$ , i.e. $n$ different Bernoulli distributions. To be clear, for each individual person $Y_i\sim\operatorname{Bin}(1,p_i)\equiv\operatorname{Bern}(p_i)$ , & as @Frank says, there's no real need to consider people grouped together by covariate pattern, though it's sometimes useful for diagnostics. To be really clear, if your model says this:– Tom: 90 mmHg, 80 /min, 6 mmol/l => 60% chance of obesity Dick: 90 mmHg, 80 /min, 6 mmol/l => 60% Harry: 60 mmHg, 60 /min, 5 mmol/l => 20% you can write this:– $$Y_{\mathrm{Tom}}+Y_{\mathrm{Dick}}\sim \operatorname{Bin}(2,60\%)$$ $$Y_{\mathrm{Harry}}\sim \operatorname{Bin}(1,20\%)\equiv\operatorname{Bern}(20\%)$$ or this:– $$Y_{\mathrm{Tom}}\sim \operatorname{Bin}(1,60\%)\equiv\operatorname{Bern}(60\%)$$ $$Y_{\mathrm{Dick}}\sim \operatorname{Bin}(1,60\%)\equiv\operatorname{Bern}(60\%)$$ $$Y_{\mathrm{Harry}}\sim \operatorname{Bin}(1,20\%)\equiv\operatorname{Bern}(20\%)$$ Note that $Y_{\mathrm{Tom}}+Y_{\mathrm{Dick}}+Y_{\mathrm{Harry}}$ is not binomially distributed because there's not a common probability for each person.
