RNN Model accuracy with Training and test data

I am using RNN package in R to do regression. First created the model with training dataset and checked the model output using the same training dataset. It was fairly accurate with the predicted output always following the pattern of targeted variable, even if in absolute terms there was error which is acceptable. But when checked with test dataset, the output was nowhere close to pattern I expected. I have tried changing the parameters in ‘predictr’ function, but that hardly helped. Is this because I over-fitted the rnn model? or what else could be reason.
