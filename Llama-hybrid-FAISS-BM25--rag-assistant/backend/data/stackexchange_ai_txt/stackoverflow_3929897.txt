Url fragment and Referer header

Imagine you are on a page whose URL has a fragment (the part after the # ), and click a link to go to another page. Most browsers will send the URL of the original page to the server in the Referer header. What I want to know is whether or not the URL fragment will be included in this or not. I have seen various behaviors in the wild so this might be browser-specific. Does anyone know which browsers do what? And what does the HTTP spec say on this?
