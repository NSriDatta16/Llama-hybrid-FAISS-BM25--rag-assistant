I'm a bit confused as to what you're actually looking for, but I think that what you want is a control that provides a web browser inside your window. WebKitGTK+ is one such control: http://webkitgtk.org/ GtkMozEmbed is another: http://www.mozilla.org/unix/gtk-embedding.html Last time I did this, I had to try a few to find one that worked. The controls have different bugs and support for HTML (and Flash.)
