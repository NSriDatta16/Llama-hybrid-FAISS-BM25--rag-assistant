Matt Andresen has provided good answer, in general case, but there are situations, when you can't do it that way. For example when you are working on validated applications, that must comply with regulations form other parties like FDA, and it goes through very intensive audit, review, sign off, than 2 answer form your example is required. Although I would opt for moving into automation with HP QuickTestPro or IBM RationaRobot in this case. Maybe you should try with some tests repository? There are again tools from HP QualityCenter and IBM products, but this can expensive. You could find some cheaper, that will let you organize them into tree structures, by requirement/feature, assign them priorities, group them into test suits for releases, group them into regression testing suits etc...
