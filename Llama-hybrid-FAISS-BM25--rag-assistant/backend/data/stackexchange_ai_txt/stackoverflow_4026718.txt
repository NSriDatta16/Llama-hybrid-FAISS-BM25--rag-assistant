Form.Show() is "Not Responding..."

I have a little trivial problem in my application. I have a dialog (d1) that inherits from Form. And in Main, if I call d1.ShowDialog ,it works fine. But calling d1.Show() opens a bad form with pale labels and textboxes, and when I try to drag that window form it says "Not Responding." What's going on? I think I need "Show" and not "ShowDialog," because the user should be dealing with several simultaneous forms.
