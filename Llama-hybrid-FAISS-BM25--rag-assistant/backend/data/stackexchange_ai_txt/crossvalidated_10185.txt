Debugging JAGS and BUGS

I'm working on a not-too-fancy Bayesian model in R and JAGS. The goal is to isolate coder errors in a content analysis task. Code and output are given below. The larger question is how to go about debugging JAGS. (I assume that the same advice would hold for BUGS as well.) What am I supposed to make of an error like "Invalid initial values" when there are nearly a dozen different initial values? Here's my R code: library(rjags) library(R2jags) #Load the data toy_data Here's the JAGS model: model { for( n in 1:N ){ #Loop over codings for( k in 1:K ){ #Loop over attributes #d Here's the data: "docid","coderid","Answer.1","Answer.2" 1,1,3,3 1,2,4,1 1,3,7,2 2,1,3,3 2,2,4,4 2,4,3,1 3,1,3,3 3,2,4,3 3,3,3,4 4,4,5,1 4,5,6,2 4,2,4,3 5,2,5,4 5,3,3,1 5,4,7,2 6,1,3,3 6,5,4,1 6,2,5,2 And here's the R output: Compiling model graph Resolving undeclared variables Allocating nodes Graph Size: 352 Error in jags.model(model.file, data = data, inits = inits, n.chains = n.chains, : Invalid initial values
