Reasons besides prediction to build models?

Joshua Epstein wrote a paper titled "Why Model?" available at http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/08-09-040.pdf in which gives 16 reasons: Explain (very distinct from predict) Guide data collection Illuminate core dynamics Suggest dynamical analogies Discover new questions Promote a scientific habit of mind Bound (bracket) outcomes to plausible ranges Illuminate core uncertainties. Offer crisis options in near-real time Demonstrate tradeoffs / suggest efficiencies Challenge the robustness of prevailing theory through perturbations Expose prevailing wisdom as incompatible with available data Train practitioners Discipline the policy dialogue Educate the general public Reveal the apparently simple (complex) to be complex (simple) (Epstein elaborates on many of the reasons in more detail in his paper.) I would like to ask the community: are there are additional reasons that Epstein did not list? is there a more elegant way to conceptualize (a different grouping perhaps) these reasons? are any of Epstein's reasons flawed or incomplete? are their clearer elaborations of these reasons?
