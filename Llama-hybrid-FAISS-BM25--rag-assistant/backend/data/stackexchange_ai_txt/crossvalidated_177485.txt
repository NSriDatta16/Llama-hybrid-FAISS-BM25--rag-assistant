Broadly speaking, factor analysis decomposes the total variance in a data matrix, S , into two new matrices: one containing the common factor structure, W , and a second consisting of the unique errors, U . PCA and CFA differ most importantly in that PCA considers the total variance, CFA only analyses W . In addition, unrotated PCA provides an optimal and mathematically unique solution. Once any factor matrix is rotated, it is no longer either optimal or unique. So, rotated PCA is still PCA but it's no longer an optimal or unique solution.
