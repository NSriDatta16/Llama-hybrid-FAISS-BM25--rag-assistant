How to interpret a meta-regression with a moderator which can vary between fixed values in Metafor

This question is slightly related to another one ( Metaregression on meta-analysis of proportion with metaprop and metafor ), but concerns the particular situation in which one moderator is a variable which can vary between fixed values. For example, I want to meta-analyze the proportion of asymptomatic on the total number of patients, and I have a moderator, which represents the proportion of female patients at the study level (i.e., the proportion of female patients in each study population). I will use two different moderators (moderator is the proportion of females in a scale from 0 to 1; moderator2 is simply rescaled from 0 to 100): moderator Obviously, the moderator can only vary between 0 (no female in the study) and 1 (all females in the study); moderator2 (which represents the percentage) accordingly between 0 and 100. If I fit a meta-regression model like this m3 I do find a significant relationship between the proportion of females enrolled and the prevalence of asymptomatic disease at the study level: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 5; tau^2 estimator: ML) tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0.0573 tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.2394 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 55.0953% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 2.2269 Tests for Residual Heterogeneity: Wld(df = 3) = 11.5307, p-val = 0.0092 LRT(df = 3) = 12.0039, p-val = 0.0074 Test of Moderators (coefficient 2): QM(df = 1) = 6.8837, p-val = 0.0087 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub intrcpt -3.1666 0.4314 -7.3407 Changing the model to include the percentage as the moderator will help in get a more easily interpretable OR: m3 And this is the calculated OR with 95%CI: round(exp(coef(summary(m3))[-1,c("estimate", "ci.lb", "ci.ub")]), 2) estimate ci.lb ci.ub moderator2 1.03 1.01 1.06 So I would assume that, for each unit increase in the percentage of females enrolled in a study, on average, the odds of an asymptomatic disease is 3% higher (95%CI between 1% and 6%). The question is: it is formally correct to fit a meta-regression model with a moderator, like the prevalence of one characteristics, which vary between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100, it depends on what scale you choose)? Is the abovementioned interpreation correct?
