Credible intervals for probability that posteriors lie on opposite sides of zero

Please help me with this classification question. Say I run an experiment where I have a treatment and control group. I then measure some feature, $x$ , of both groups and use MCMC to sample the posterior distribution of each group's mean $x$ . I then classify the posterior draws of each group's $\overline{x}_i$ as belonging to either state A or state B depending on whether they cross some arbitrary fixed decision boundary (e.g., at $x = 0$ ). From this, I want to know the probability that the treatment caused my population to shift from state A to state B or vice-versa. Is the answer as simple as $p(\overline{x}_{control} > 0) \times p(\overline{x}_{treatment} ? E.g., in the example pictured below, I have $p(\overline{x}_{control} > 0) = p(\overline{x}_{treatment} such that the probability that the two distributions lie on opposite sides of zero is $0.75^2 = 0.56$ . Is there anything else I can say about the probability that these two posteriors lie on opposite sides of zero? Some credible interval, perhaps? I'm missing something obvious.
