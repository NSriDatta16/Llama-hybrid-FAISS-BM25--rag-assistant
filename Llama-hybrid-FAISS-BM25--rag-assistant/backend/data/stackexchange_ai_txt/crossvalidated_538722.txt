Yes, this can be done quite simply: Perform PCA , decide on the number of components you want to keep. Save weights. For each observation, calculate component scores (linear combination of weighted sum of variable values - Note, that it is best to first re-scale all variables, preferably before step 1). Perform cluster analysis on the component scores . END. You have done step 1, so now you just need to do step 2 and 3. To answer the other question: multicollinearity is rarely an issue for PCA unless you have correlations like 0.98, 0.99.
