Neural Network for calling Forecast

i want to build a neural network which gives a forecast for a date in the future. I got a lot of Training Datas. At first i tried to get some characteristic. Some lines of the Blank datas: 2005-11-10 05:00:00.000 0 2005-11-10 05:30:00.000 0 2005-11-10 06:00:00.000 1 2005-11-10 06:30:00.000 3 2005-11-10 07:00:00.000 12 2005-11-10 07:30:00.000 36 2005-11-10 08:00:00.000 89 2005-11-10 08:30:00.000 120 2005-11-10 09:00:00.000 209 2005-11-10 09:30:00.000 233 2005-11-10 10:00:00.000 217 2005-11-10 10:30:00.000 199 2005-11-10 11:00:00.000 244 The first variable is the date, the second is the interval. the fourth are the incomming calls. Now what i think might make sense as inputs for the NN are: Week of the Year Day of the week interval( a interval is a number between 1-48, 30min intervals per day (24*2) Output: Incoming Calls I reparsed the Datas. They're looking now like this: 15 5 33 165 15 5 34 122 15 5 35 123 15 5 36 95 15 5 37 51 15 5 38 50 15 5 39 40 15 5 40 37 15 5 41 20 15 5 42 22 15 5 43 16 15 5 44 9 15 5 45 7 15 5 46 2 15 5 47 2 15 5 48 0 15 6 1 1 15 6 2 0 15 6 3 1 15 6 4 0 15 6 5 0 15 6 6 0 15 6 7 1 15 6 8 0 15 6 9 0 15 6 10 0 Are the inputs well selected?
