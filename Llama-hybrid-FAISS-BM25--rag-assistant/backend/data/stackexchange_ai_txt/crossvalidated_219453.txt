Hosmer-Lemeshow test in R

The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is a statistical test for goodness of fit for logistic regression models. According to ?hoslem.test , it deals only with binary logistic regression. However, I wonder if this test can be used to a ordered logit model which has more than 2 levels for the dependent variable. The ordered logit model is also known as the proportional odds model, or a cumulative logit model. And I use the "Ordinal" package. Thanks a lot.
