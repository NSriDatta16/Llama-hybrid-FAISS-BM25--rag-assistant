The formatter is important if you are trying to effect the presentation but if you use if for internal storage, you are defining a string which can defeat the DB-engine's ability to use the value for computation, comparison, sorting, etc. Also, if you are going to have different clients inserting the date value into the DB you would have to write conversion functions everywhere. I used the following and it worked as expected (schema's column defined as DATETIME): dateExpires = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow: sqlite3_column_double(queryStmt, 5)]; I inserted into the SQLITE3 db with the Firefox add-on as "4/12/2010" here in Central time zone. Viewing the value of 'dateExpires' in XCode-debugger displayed as: 2010-04-12 23:19:48 -0500 Sure enough, that is the correct time. Also, to insert into the SQLITE DB you will put the value [NSDate date]
