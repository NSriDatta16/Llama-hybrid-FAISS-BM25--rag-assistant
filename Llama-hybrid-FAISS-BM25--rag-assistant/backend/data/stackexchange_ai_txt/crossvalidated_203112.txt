PPCA was introduced in Tipping & Bishop, 1999, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis . I would say that this paper itself is one of the best references: it is concise and clear. Nevertheless, it might be difficult for a beginner. If so, you can try Bishop's textbook Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , which is excellent and includes a thorough discussion of PPCA in Chapter 12. In order to prepare for this chapter, one would need to have some understanding of basic probability theory (Chapter 1), multivariate Gaussian distribution (Chapter 2), and expectation-maximization algorithm (Chapter 9). The entire book is freely available online in PDF.
