There's nothing wrong with taking the POST data from the previous step and adding hidden input elements. Just take all the POST data from the previous page that you care about and get them into the current page's form. This way, you don't have to worry about using persistent storage in any form, whether it's on the client side or the server side. What are the perceived downsides? That there are a lot of extra elements on the page? Not that the user sees. All you have to do is add an element for each input you ask the user to give (on every page, if you want the user to be able to go back). Besides these elements, which don't give any visual clutter, there's nothing extra. There's also the fact that all the form data will have to be transmitted on every page load. Sure, but this is probably going to be faster than a lookup in a database, and you don't have to worry about getting rid of stale data.
