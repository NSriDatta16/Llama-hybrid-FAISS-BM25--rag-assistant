There are definitely benefits to learning a language built on a different paradigm from the one you are used to (which I note are merely object oriented with strong imperative roots). LISP is the granddaddy of functional languages (one of my favourites, Scheme , is a LISP dialect). Besides widening your horizons, functional languages and constructs are highly likely to grow further in importance as a reasonably straightforward way of using multi-core hardware efficiently. LISP as such might not be my recommendation to start with, since it's enormously fragmented: on the other hand, there's a lot of history, and you can make use of it directly if you plan on moving to Emacs.
