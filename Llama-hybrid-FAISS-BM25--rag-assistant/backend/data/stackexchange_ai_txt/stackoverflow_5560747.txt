Get Sequence Name (Oracle)?

I don't have access to see the database, but I have the ability to create database objects (via an xml file). The xml documentation says that if I set an attribute called "identity" to true then a sequence will be created. Is it possible for me to write logic that would return the name of the sequence so that I can use nextVal when I'm writing INSERT statements? Robert Here's the documentation , do a find on the word "identity"...
