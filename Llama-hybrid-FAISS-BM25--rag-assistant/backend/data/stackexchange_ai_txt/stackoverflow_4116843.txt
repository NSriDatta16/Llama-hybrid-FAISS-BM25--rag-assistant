Drag image within it's parent border?

I have created image viewer control, that provide zoom in/out the image, and when the image zoomed and be larger than it's viewer (you can't see all the image) I provided the ability to drag the image ( like Windows Photo Viewer ) using "TranslateTransform" but I wanna the image to stop dragging when it's border (left or right or left or down) is appeared, I have done some calculations of the width and height of the fourth sides and it's work fine but when you speedy drag the image it stop after it's border pass it's container border , and the distance increased by greater drag speed. For example: open an image in " Windows Photo Viewer " and zoomed it then drag it it's stop exactly when you reach it's border". So I wanna the image to stop exactly when it's border appeared regardless of drag speed? Appreciated your Helps, Best Regards.
