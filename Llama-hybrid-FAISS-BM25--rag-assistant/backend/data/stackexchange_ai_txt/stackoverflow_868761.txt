How to divide an NSIS script among developers?

I'd like to divide tasks for the development of a NSIS installer among a couple of developers. How can I physically organize the code? Do they have to edit and merge the single .nsi script when they check into SVN? Is it possible to divide NSIS scripts into modular, separate files? This would be ideal. Thanks!
