Should you pick the starting size of a CNN filters/kernels depending on the actual size of the objects you intend to detect/analyse?

I was reading about some famous CNN architectures such as AlexNet and I was wondering if the size of kernels was usually related to the size of faces, birds, cars, etc.. on a typical image? When designing a new CNN is there a general rule of thumb for picking the "first guess" size of a kernel? Thanks in advance
