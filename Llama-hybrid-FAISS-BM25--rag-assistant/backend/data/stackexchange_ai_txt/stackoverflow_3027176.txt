Are you sure the query is being called again? Perhaps the web request is being cached by your browser and not even re-requested to the web server? You may need to set the HttpCacheability on the page that the query occurs to ensure caching is not occuring. To test this, you can tell IE to re-download every time via Tools..Internet Options..Browsing History..Settings.."Every time I visit the webpage" in order to quickly see if caching is the issue.
