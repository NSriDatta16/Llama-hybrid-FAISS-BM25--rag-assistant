A nice simple way to do it would be to subclass a UITableView and implement the touch methods (not forgetting to pass them to the super afterwards!). From in there you can inspect a touch in touches began and decide whether it's a touch that's inside the UITextField (using the hitTest: method in UIView). If the hitTest does not return a UITextField you can call a method in your controller to resign the first responder. Hope this points you in the right direction!
