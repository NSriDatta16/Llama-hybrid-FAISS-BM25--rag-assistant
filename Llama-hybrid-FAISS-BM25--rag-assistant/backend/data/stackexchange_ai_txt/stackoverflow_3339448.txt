In your bootstrapper (i.e. UnityBootstrapper derived class) where you initialize your shell, IEventAggragator is registered with the Unity container during the call to the base class ConfigureContainer method. Therefore if you override ConfigureContainer, you can resolve the event aggregator: protected override void ConfigureContainer() { base.ConfigureContainer(); IEventAggregator eventService = Container.Resolve (); } At this point you could set a property on your shell\viewmodel with the event aggregator instance, or use a service locator type pattern for example. That's up to you.
