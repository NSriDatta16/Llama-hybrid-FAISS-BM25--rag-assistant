How do I find .bash_profile and add to my shell's initialization file?

I am trying to upgrade ruby using rvm. On the pragmatic site , it says: The important part is to add the following line to the end of your shell's initialization file (.bash_profile): [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" How do I do this? Where is this initialization file? Please help
