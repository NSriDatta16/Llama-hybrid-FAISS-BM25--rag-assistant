Yes: html5 readiness , some additional information on Wired (albeit it's a preview/review, rather than a technical evaluation): IE9 supports much of HTML5, and there’s a new parser to handle the new markup language. There’s support for native playback of audio and video files, and the Canvas element, with support for animated 2-D polygons and text. HTML5 selection is supported, but not drag-and-drop or Microdata. The Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG, standard is supported, and like other animation and media features in the browser, it can take advantage of hardware acceleration. There’s finally real support for CSS 3 in this release — media queries, borders and backgrounds, selectors, the fonts module and the Web Open Font Format, or WOFF, rich type standard, among other things.
