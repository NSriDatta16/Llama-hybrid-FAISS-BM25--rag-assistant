Do I include the validation set in final training?

For optimizing an unsupervised neural network with 1 hidden layer, I use the training set for training and the validation set for optimizing the number of neurons in the hidden layer (for example by running a grid search of many options and comparing the resulting errors each architecture returns). Having obtained the optimal architecture, how do I approach the final evaluation step? 1) do I train the optimal model on the training set alone, followed by evaluation on the test set 2) do I train the optimal model on the training AND validation set combined, followed by evaluation on the test set
