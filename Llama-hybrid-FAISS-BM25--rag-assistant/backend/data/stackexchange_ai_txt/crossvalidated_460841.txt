Does feature detector(filter) has to be a sqaure matrix?

I am going through a course on Convolutional neural networks, where in the convolution step, the feature detector matrix was square shaped. Is there any mathematical significance that Feature detector has to be square shaped?Can it be a rectangular matrix and yield better results? I know it might be completely irrelevant but I am a beginner ...Please excuse :)
