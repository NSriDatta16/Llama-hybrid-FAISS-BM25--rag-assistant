If you're looking for alternatives for supervised classification, it seems you might find zero-shot learning useful. Zero-shot learning is a family of methods that uses prior information on labels (like features for categories that are defined with words that you mentioned) to learn mapping from input to labels by jointly learning label and input representations. The Zero-Shot Learning - A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly might be a good start. For an example of ZSL method you might find Embarrasingly Simple Zero Shot Learning (yes, it's the actual name). EZSL is a method that learns mapping from features $X$ to labels $S$ by finding an alignment matrix $V$ such that $\|X^TVS \|_F$ is minimized. Note this is similar, and more general, than the situation where you'd have embeddings for input features and labels from the same space and just use cosine similarity - the matrix $V$ makes possible to compare $x_i$ with $s_j$ , and you can define your prediction by $s = \underset{s_j}{argmin} (x_iVs_j) $ .
