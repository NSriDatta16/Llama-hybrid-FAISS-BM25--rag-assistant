How can I explain this chart showing 5-days moving average?

I have plotted the frequency of items sold through time, trying to determine the trends by moving average. I considered a 5-days window. I would like to know if this approach makes sense and how I could interpret the results. It's my first time with time-series and moving average (I have no a scientific background at all). I hope you can help me.
