ADO.NET also has a driver for Excel. So if your data is naturally a database in "shape" then I'd probably use that. You could use the Excel interop if you wanted to do formatting and to leverage Excel's spreadsheet capabilities, but this is probably too "messy" for simple data transfer. Also, as dtb points out, if it was a simple one-table data file, you could use CSV file. Although not native Excel ,it can be readily imported and is usually the easiest way of getting external data into Excel.
