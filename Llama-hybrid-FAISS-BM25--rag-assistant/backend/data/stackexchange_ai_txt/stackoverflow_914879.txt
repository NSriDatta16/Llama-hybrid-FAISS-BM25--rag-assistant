It stands for Integrated Secure Communication Layer Protocols for Secure Medical Image Management Systems . ISCL is a security layer which manages security function between presentation layer and TCP/IP layer. ISCL mechanism depends on basic function of a smart IC card and symmetric secret key mechanism. A symmetry key for each session is made by internal authentication function of a smart IC card with a random number. ISCL has three functions which assure authentication, confidently and integrity. Entity authentication process is done through 3 path 4 way method using functions of internal authentication and external authentication of a smart iC card. Confidentially algorithm and MAC algorithm for integrity are able to be selected. ISCL protocols are communicating through Message Block which consists of Message Header and Message Data. ISCL protocols are evaluating by applying to regional collaboration system for image diagnosis, and On-line Secure Electronic Storage system for medical images. Some more info can be found in ISCL and DICOM Security . From what I can tell, it's basically an SSL protocol alternative that uses smart card instead of CA (certificate authority), invented by Japanese and used in Japan. Not sure how popular it is.
