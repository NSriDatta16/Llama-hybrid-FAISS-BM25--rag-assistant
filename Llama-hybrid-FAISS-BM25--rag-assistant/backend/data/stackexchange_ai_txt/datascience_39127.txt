Linear Discriminant Analysis + bayesian theorem = LDA classifier??

I am new to machine learning and as I learn about Linear Discriminant Analysis, I can't see how it is used as a classifier. I can understand the difference between LDA and PCA and I can see how LDA is used as dimension reduction method. I've read some articles about LDA classification but I'm still not exactly sure how LDA is used as classifier. From what I understand, we consider the features vector x as multivariate gaussian distribution and use the bayesian rule to calculate which category gives the max probability for x , then it belongs to that category. Is this understanding generally correct?
