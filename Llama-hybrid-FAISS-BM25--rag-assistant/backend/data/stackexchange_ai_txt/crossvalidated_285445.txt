It really depends if it is a regression or a classification problem, if your speaking from a strict machine learning perspective. With that in mind, I would, for a classification problem: inspect the confusion matrix between models plot key statistics (recal, F1, precision, accuracy) by bin's of the key variables of the model if it is a regression problem from an ml perspective I would do the same, but inspecting the r-squared, adjusted-r-squared, MSE, MAE and etc. If your using Bayesian methods strictly, I would chill and Bayesian average all models based on their WAIC share.
