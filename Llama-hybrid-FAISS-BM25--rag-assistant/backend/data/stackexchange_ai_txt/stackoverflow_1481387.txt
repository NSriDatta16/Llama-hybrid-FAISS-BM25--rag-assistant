SQL foreign keys with multiple tables

If I have three tables: music_genres ----------- music_type_id genres [other unique fields] minerals -------- mineral_id mineral [other unique fields] verbs ----- verb_id verbs [other unique fields] and these are populated with: rock jazz funk punk rock boulder stone shale rock wobble shake vibrate Now let's say I was displaying a web page for each of these items, each using a separate template, and stored this information in the following table: pages ----- page_id page_url template_url foreign_key_id with data such as: /page/music-genres/rock/ /music-genres-template.html 1 /page/verbs/rock/ /verb-template.html 1 /page/minerals/rock/ /mineral-template.html 1 /page/minerals/rock/images/ /mineral-images-template.html 1 The templates will know that the a foreign key relates to the specific related table, so the mineral template with know to query the minerals table for that table's other fields. However, I don't have any referential integrity. If rock is deleted from the minerals table, I can't use cascading deletes to remove rows from pages, as foreign keys aren't unique. I can think of numerous ways to get around this inelegantly: Emulating cascading deletes with triggers Storing the item type in each row of the music_types, minerals and verbs tables, and using this a an additional foreign key Storing the appropriate table name in the pages table Maintaining the integrity of the database with PHP etc. I'm thinking that there must be a better way of either storing my data or maintaining the integrity of the database. Any thoughts?
