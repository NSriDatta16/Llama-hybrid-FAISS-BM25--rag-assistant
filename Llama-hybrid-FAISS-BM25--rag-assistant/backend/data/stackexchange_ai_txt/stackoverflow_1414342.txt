core data iphone readonly relation

I have situation where I dont want to add records to the relation table. For example : I have "TRIPS" entity and it has attribute for "LOCATION_ID", I am filling it when user creates a new TRIP and select a LOCATION from the LOCATIONS entity In "LOCATIONS" entity I am allowing user to create locations and I am assigning a unique ID to each location.data will not be repeated here. Is there any way to link the LOCATION_ID into LOCATIONS entity ,so when ever I access a trip(NSManagedObject) it automatically get LOCATIONS entity record (Object) ? I mean automatically (Manually I can do that) Thanks, Raghu
