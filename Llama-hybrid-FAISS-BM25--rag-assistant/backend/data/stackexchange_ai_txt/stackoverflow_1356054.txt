Thanks for replying... I am almost done with developing UI of piano. I have used programmatic approach to create black and white keys. CGFloat buttonWhitePosX = 2.0; //white button start position for(int i=0;i Same way for black keys using different coordinates. Also I am able to play sound on key pressed Using AVPlayer.(on selector touch down) So far so good but when user slides across the keys, piano should play respected sound. To achive this is tried with 1) Used UIControl events for UIButton. DragEnter, drag exit, drag inside. But it will not give me which button is pressed exactly, as drag exit location is way outside the drawn button 2) Used touchesBegan, touchesEnded, touchesMoved of main view(in which black and white keys are placed). -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; currentView = [self.view hitTest:touchLocation withEvent:nil]; //get top view if(currentView != self.view){ //check current view is main view, do nothing if(currentView == prevView){ //check current view is prev view, keep highlight image currentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:whiteImageHighlighed]; }else{ //view changed, change image and play sound prevView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:whiteImage]; currentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:whiteImageHighlighed]; [self pressButtonWhiteDown1:currentView.tag]; prevView = currentView; } } } In this approach it gives wrong view when user slides on white keys and comes across X position of black keys (as black key is on top of white key in main view): alt text http://img215.yfrog.com/img215/1720/pianohelp.png Is there any other approach or something I/m doing wrong in it. please guide me. Is it possible to get exact view from touch point? Thanks.
