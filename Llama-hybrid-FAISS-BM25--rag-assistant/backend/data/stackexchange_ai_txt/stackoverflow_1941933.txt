You could disable the copy or even default construction, and operator= etc for a more strict scenario (some cases of embedding values or container use). However, that will move you out of some useful constructs and force you to introduce your own semantics (something more visible in VM impls; lack/induction of similar operator and ambiguous equivalence/equality mechanisms). You will likely see a few compiler warnings too, it won't go all the way, but if its of any consolation it can have a use or two.
