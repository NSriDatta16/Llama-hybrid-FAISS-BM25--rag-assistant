How to rename goals in Maven?

In the Maven document Introduction to the Build Lifecycle , a goal of display:time is described that outputs the current time. The plugin is as follows: ... com.mycompany.example maven-touch-plugin 1.0 process-test-resources timestamp ... I have several questions relating to this plugin: How can I change the name of the goal to, for example, foo:bar ? (Why does neither display nor time appear anywhere in the XML fragment? How can you tell, from looking at the fragment, what goals it defines?) How can I manually run this goal? (For similar constructs, the equivalent of mvn display:time sometimes works, but this doesn't work consistently.) How can I see if this goal exists? (i.e. list available goals; this question suggests this is impossible.)
