How does C++ handle multiple source files?

I'm studying C++ right now, coming from a background in Python, and I'm having some trouble understanding how C++ handles multiple source files. In Python, the import statement first checks the current working directory for the module you're trying to import and then it checks the directories in sys.path. In C++, where would I place a custom made .h file? Where would the compiler even look? For example, I've got a program, foo.exe compiled from a single source file, foo.cpp, both in the same directory. I decide that I want to organize things a little better, so I create a new .h file, bar.h and dump stuff in there. Would I just need to #include to get to the stuff I put there? What if I want to use bar.h with another program (in a completely different directory)?
