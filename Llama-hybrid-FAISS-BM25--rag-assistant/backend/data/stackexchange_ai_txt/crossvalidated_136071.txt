PCA in r using prcomp: should data variable in prcomp function be correlation matrix?

I am hoping someone can check this code to ensure that I have interpreted the various pieces of PCA correctly. I am trying to figure out a way to identify the leading contributors to the performance of multiple securities. For example, one idea I had was to run a multivariate regression using the securities returns as dependent variables and include things like oil, the dollar, the euro, treasury yields, etc. E.g., SBUX + AAPL + MCD + BAC + TWTR = intercept + oil + dollar + euro + steel + gold + e I then thought that PCA would probably be better suited for this type of exercise. Here is my code from R. The csv file consists of a matrix of 900 securities and 30 rows (30 daily returns for 900 securities) FD
