Looks like you've got an issue with the depth buffer. In particular it looks like each polygon is being drawn without regard to depth i.e. each fragment coming from the polygons is passing the depth test. This would mean that the polygons are simply drawn over each other in whatever order they happen to be rendered in. Did you disable writing to the depth buffer with something like glDepthMask( GL_FALSE ) by any chance? If it's not that then did you remember to clear the depth buffer at the beginning of each frame? The Nehe tutorial starts with glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); which clears both the depth and colour buffers. Make sure you haven't got rid of the GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT part of that. HTH
