where failing to correctly predict a default loan comes with high penalty. An astute observation. A good question might be "when is the loan worth risking the high penalty?". You should not be classifying observations as default/not default in this scenario, but rather modelling the risk that the customer will not pay back the loan. With an appropriate risk model, you can then use a utility function to make decisions about if future loans should be awarded, rationally answering the question of when the risk of default is worth the possible reward. Frank Harrell writes more on the forced choice classification puts upon us and how treating problems probabilistically is a better approach. I suggest you read this post prior to continuing. Additionally, I find that you really shouldn't be selecting features, you should be engineering new ones . If all you're doing is looking at linear effects, you're likely missing out on additional model performance. Non-linear models like random forests may be able to learn non-linear effects, however you still need to make sure the resulting fit is well calibrated before using it. All in all, I think your approach needs to be revisited. It sounds like you're modelling loan defaults, which is very well studied and is best approached as a risk modelling problem and not a classification problem.
