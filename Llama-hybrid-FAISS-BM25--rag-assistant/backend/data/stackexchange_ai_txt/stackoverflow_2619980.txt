Innodb setting in xampp doesn't seem locate my.cnf file

I created a new mysql database and i want to use foreign keys with it... I googled and found out this... InnoDB is one of MySQL storage engines, it supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign-keys. However, by default, InnoDB is not enabled by XAMPP. To enable it, locate the my.cnf configuration file (normally in C:/xampp/mysql/bin directory) and search for the following lines: # Comment the following if you are using InnoDB tables But the path C:/xampp/mysql/bin directory in my system doesn't seem to have such a file... Look at this image http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/524/mysqln.jpg Where is my.cnf file? Any suggestion...
