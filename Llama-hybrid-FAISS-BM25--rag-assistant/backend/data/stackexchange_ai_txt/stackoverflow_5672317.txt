You need to either create WCF SOAP based webservices or WCF REST based services. You then need to publish these on a web server so it can be accessed by the agents. You need to document all the API methods and parameters so it is easy for the agents to use your services. You also need to have an authentication/authorization system in place to ensure your services are used only by the authorized agents.
