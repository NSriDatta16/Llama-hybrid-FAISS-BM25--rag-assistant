According to the XGBClassifier parameters ( link ) some operations will be happens on top of randomness, like subsample feature_selector etc. If we didn't set seed for random value everything different value will be chosen and different result we will get. (Not abrupt change is expected). So to reproduce the same result, it is a best practice to set the seed parameter in XGBoost Classifiers. Most of the SkLearn classes will have random_state parameter for similar purposes.
