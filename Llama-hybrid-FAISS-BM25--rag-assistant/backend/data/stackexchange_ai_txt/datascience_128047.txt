How can I use two different datasets to train an ML model?

I am trying to create a machine learning model that takes in two different pandas data-frames from a basketball stats website and given multiple variables, will output a prediction of how many points a player will score in a future game. The issue I am having is that I have a data-frame of the player's historical stats for a season and a data-frame of their splits (stats for home vs. away, opponent, etc.) which has the different variables that I want the model to use in it's prediction. My goal is to use the player's past stats DF combined with their splits DF along with some given variables (ex. who their future opponent is), to predict how many points this player will score in a future game. Should I try to combine these two different data-frames into one, and then train the model on this dataset, or is it possible to do it with two separate data-frames? Here is what the stats (game by game) data-frame looks like: Game Date Opp 3P% PTS 1 2023-10-24 PHO .286 27 2 2023-10-27 SAC .700 41 3 2023-10-29 HOU .429 24 4 2023-10-30 NOP .538 42 Here is what the splits data-frame looks like (have to look at by X and Y axis to find values): Value G GS MP FG FGA 3P 3PA FT PTS Total 53 53 1769 480 1046 262 633 246 1468 Home 29 29 972 268 584 144 344 145 825 Away 24 24 797 212 462 118 289 101 643
