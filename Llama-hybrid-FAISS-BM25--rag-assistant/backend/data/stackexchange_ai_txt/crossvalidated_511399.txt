GLMER, GHAQ and marginaled coefficients

I am confused about the GLMM procedures and their reporting. I have tried to follow @Ben Bolker on mixed effect model . However, I am confused after the GLMAdaptive approach . I will lay out my problem. The experiment involved breeding organisms in three "Treatment" (Gregarious, Intermediate and Sparse). The response variable is "morphs" (red/ blue). However, the treatment was carried in similar sized boxes. During the breeding, organisms died at different time-points (even though they were staged before the experiment began). I have included "Box" as a random effect (random intercept). I have two other numeric predictors. require(lme4) e1 I use GHAquadarature with 25 points. Random intercept model. The aim is to study population parameters and not random effects. Checked for overdispersion. overdisp_fun(e1) chisq ratio rdf p 245.2838191 0.7836544 313.0000000 0.9981553 I then standardized the global model with the "arms" package (this will centre and scale the numeric variables). require(arm) e2 |z|) (Intercept) -1.1288 0.3521 -3.206 0.00134 ** Treatmentintermediate -1.5315 0.5933 -2.581 0.00985 ** Treatmentsparse -1.9510 0.7181 -2.717 0.00659 ** z.growth -1.1441 0.4570 -2.503 0.01230 * z.weight 0.3748 0.3784 0.991 0.32191 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) Trtmntn Trtmnts z.grwt Trtmntntrmd -0.512 Tretmntsprs -0.478 0.311 z.growth 0.272 0.058 -0.172 z.weight 0.062 -0.123 -0.091 0.139 display(e2) coef.est coef.se (Intercept) -1.13 0.35 Treatmentintermediate -1.53 0.59 Treatmentsparse -1.95 0.72 z.growth -1.14 0.46 z.weight 0.37 0.38 Error terms: Groups Name Std.Dev. Box (Intercept) 0.96 Residual 1.00 --- number of obs: 319, groups: Box, 46 AIC = 270.7, DIC = 186.8 deviance = 222.7 After this, I derive a series of candidate models from the e2 global model. I compare them with AICc. I set the threshold of 2 AICc units for the most competitive models while the best model is with the least AICc. Interpreting random effect: Does the std. deviation of 0.96 indicates any mild/ strong variation among the boxes? Or there is no effect of "boxes" on the response variable? Should I talk anything about the random effect in the results/ discussion? Marginal AIC: Does the AICc in the summary correspond to marginal AIC? Since I am not interested in random effects, I have not used the (conditional AIC)cAIC. Should we report estimates and CI of the best model (least AICc) or the global model? I then compute the confidence intervals of the global model. 2.5 % 97.5 % sd_(Intercept)|Box 0.5000825 1.6123814 (Intercept) -1.8995190 -0.4334229 Treatmentintermediate -2.8496460 -0.4161077 Treatmentsparse -3.5398772 -0.6348531 z.growth -2.1021283 -0.2879385 z.weight -0.3676294 1.1247416 Can I report the estimates from the summary table and the CI'S? Here the CI's indicate that weight does not relatively influence morphs compared to other predictors. Do we need to report the marginalised coefficients , as I read that GLMM gives estimates conditional on the random effects? . Can we get marginalised coefficients for the glmer() too? Hence I used another package GLMMAdative for that. When I used the GLMMAdaptive, I had to manually centre and scale the numeric variables. require(GLMMadaptive) p1 $growth, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) p2 weight, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) p3 $growth + e$ weight, random = ~1 | Box, data = e, family = "binomial", na.action = "na.fail") Data Descriptives: Number of Observations: 319 Number of Groups: 46 Model: family: binomial link: logit Fit statistics: log.Lik AIC BIC -133.7745 279.549 290.5209 Random effects covariance matrix: StdDev (Intercept) 0.9834821 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.Err z-value p-value (Intercept) 0.0093 3.2641 0.0029 0.99771599 Treatmentintermediate -1.5078 0.6005 -2.5108 0.01204580 Treatmentsparse -2.4181 0.7187 -3.3647 0.00076634 e $growth -0.2491 0.4727 -0.5270 0.59816003 e$ weight 0.5773 4.3958 0.1313 0.89551131 Integration: method: adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule quadrature points: 11 Optimization: method: EM converged: TRUE Calculating the CI for log odds ratio: exp(confint(p3)) 2.5 % Estimate 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.19982585 0.39358842 0.7752342 Treatmentintermediate 0.06823391 0.22139601 0.7183553 Treatmentsparse 0.02178281 0.08909298 0.3643956 p1 0.63238218 0.90745182 1.3021695 p2 0.74471295 1.02139536 1.4008733 So what do we infer from the CI (obtained by this method, compared to earlier CI), here that all parameters are likely influential for the dependent variable? (since no term includes zero?) Or am I missing something major here? In the sense of interpreting CI's? Can we report the estimates and CI based on glmer() function or are they/are they not conditional on the random effects? How do I explain the random effect in my case?
