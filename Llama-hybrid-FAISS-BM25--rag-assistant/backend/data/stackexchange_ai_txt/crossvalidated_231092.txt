I’d like to learn about probability theory, measure theory and finally machine learning. Where do I start?

I’d like to learn about probability theory, measure theory and finally machine learning. My ultimate goal is to use machine learning in a piece of software. I studied calculus and very basic probability in college but that’s pretty much it. Do you know some online courses or books that I could use to learn about these subjects. I’ve found many resources on the web but they all seem targeted to an expert audience. I know it’s going to take some time but where do I start if I’d like to learn from the beginning?
