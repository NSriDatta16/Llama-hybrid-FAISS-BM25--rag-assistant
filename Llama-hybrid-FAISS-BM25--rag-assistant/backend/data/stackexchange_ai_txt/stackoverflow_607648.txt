Studying standard library sources

How does one study open-source libraries code, particularly standard libraries? The code base is often vast and hard to navigate. How to find some function or class definition? Do I search through downloaded source files? Do I need cvs/svn for that? Maybe web-search? Should I just know the structure of the standard library? Is there any reference on it? Or do some IDEs have such features? Or some other tools? How to do it effectively without one? What are the best practices of doing this in any open-source libraries? Is there any convention of how are sources manipulated on Linux/Unix systems? What are the differences for specific programming languages? Broad presentation of the subject is highly encouraged. I mark this 'community wiki' so everyone can rephrase and expand my awkward formulations! Update : Probably didn't express the problem clear enough. What I want to, is to view just the source code of some specific library class or function. And the problem is mostly about work organization and usability - how do I navigate in the huge pile of sources to find the thing, maybe there are specific tools or approaches? It feels like there should've long existed some solution(s) for that.
