conditional three-level model and repeated measures using glmer in R

I have been trying to find out the most adequate formula for my data but I found no example that reflects the structure of my data, as pictured in figure above. My data is dichotomous [correct/incorrect (0,1)] for vocabulary tests: So here is what we have: Subjects Response as DV Time :Pretest,Posttest Group : Control, View, NoView Word : 20 items tested 7 additional fixed effects I want to test the significance of change over the 2 time points. Problem : I want to make sure that comparison analysis for groups is based on individual score change on each 20 item rather than taking individual or group average. Potential Model mod1 Question How far is my formula correct and reflects my aims? Is it true that Rasch Model should be more useful for my data?
