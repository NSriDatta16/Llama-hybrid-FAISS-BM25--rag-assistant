Akeem Philbert has a post and some files you can use to extend the OpenID implementation in ZF to support at least using OpenID with Google. http://ak33m.com/?p=71 There is also a blog post about getting ZF to work with Facebook and Twitter at http://shortrecipes.blogspot.com/2011/02/example-of-openid-facebook-and-twitter.html As @takeshin has pointed out, sadly, ZF doesn't not yet fully support OpenID 2.0.
