It would surprise me if it's possible. In my experience, as soon as you try to use the VS install project to do anything that can't be drag'ndropped in the designer, you're asking for trouble. In other words, it sucks, but I don't know whether the grass is greener on the other side (e.g. InstallShield), because I've never used that.
