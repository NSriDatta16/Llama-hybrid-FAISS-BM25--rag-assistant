Your issue was the primary intent for creating NArrange (beta). It allows configurable reformatting of C# code and you can use one common configuration file to be shared by the entire team. Since its focus is primarily on reordering members in classes and controlling regions, it is still lacking many necessary formatting options (especially formatting within member code lines). The normal usage scenario is for each developer to run the tool prior to check-in. I'm not aware of any one running it is part of their build process, but there is no reason why you couldn't, since it is a command-line tool. One idea that I've contemplated is running NArrange on files as part of a pre-commit step. If the original file contents being checked in don't match the NArrange formatted output on the source repository server, then the developer didn't reformat to the rules and a check-in error can be raised. For more information, see my CodeProject article on Using NArrange to Organize C# Code . Update 2023-02-25: NArrange appears to have moved to Github . The NArrange site (referenced above) is no longer available although there are copies in web.archive.org
