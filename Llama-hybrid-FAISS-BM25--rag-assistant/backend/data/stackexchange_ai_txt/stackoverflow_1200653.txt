Do I need to escape a semicolon in a Perl regular expression literal?

Someone is telling me I need to escape a semicolon in a Perl regular expression literal. That is, to match a line containing a semicolon, I should use /\;/ and not /;/ . From what I've read, the semicolon has no special meaning in a regular expression literal, so escaping it seems unnecessary. I've done some experiments and /;/ seems to work fine. With warnings turned on and the use strict; pragma in effect, perl doesn't complain. Is there some reason why /\;/ is better than /;/ ? Is this version-dependent?
