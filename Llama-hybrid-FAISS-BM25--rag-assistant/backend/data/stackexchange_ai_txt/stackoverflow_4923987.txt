A makefile is a plain text file that specifies how to make 'targets' given a set of 'dependencies' via a bunch of actions. The targets are the things on the left with ":" after them, the dependencies are on the rest of that line. Subsequent indented lines are the actions that should make the target. So for example in your LaTeX case, the .pdf file is your final target, and that depends on your .tex file. So there's a an action that runs pdflatex. The .tex itself is created from the .Rnw file, so there's another rule to make foo.tex from foo.Rnw by running Sweave. The beauty of make is that it checks the timestamps on dependencies. It was originally meant for compiling large C programs, divided up into lots of files. When compiling the final program there's no point recompiling all the .C that you've not changed, so your Makefile would just compile the changed .C files and link all the .o files into an executable. Make has been leveraged way beyond that original scheme, to the point that newer automated build solutions are available, so you may see mentions of cmake, ant, maven, and a bunch of other things. I don't know what half of them are.
