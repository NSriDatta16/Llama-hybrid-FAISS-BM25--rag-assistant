One approach would be to use TemplateColumns instead of BoundColumns Another would be to do this in code-behind after the DataBind() is called. ... myGridView.DataBind(); myGridview.Columns[0].Visible = false; myGridView.Columns[1].HeaderText = "First Name"; Personally, I like the TemplateColumn approach. I almost never us what the drag and drop designer gives me without at least some modifications. Edit - added I missed the part of the question where the columns are adding automatically. As others have answered, this can be fixed by setting AutoGenerateColumns = false on the GridView.
