UIScrollView with UIButton doesn't scroll when touch down on button

I've got a UIScrollView in my UIView . I've added some UIButtons to the scroll view. If I touch down not on a button and drag, the scroll view drags fine. If I touch down on a button and drag then the scroll view doesn't move. I want the scroll view to always scroll around if dragged and the buttons only get selected on the Touch Up Inside event. I don't want to check "Delay Content Touches" because I don't want to have to wait for the delay. Does anyone know what I need to do to get this to work? Regards, Rich
