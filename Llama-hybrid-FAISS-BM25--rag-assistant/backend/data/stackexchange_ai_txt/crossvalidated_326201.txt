Help with equivalence stated in average reward setting RL in Sutton's book

In page 202 of the latest draft of Richard S. Sutton's RL book , the average-reward setting for RL is introduced, and there the author states the equivalence: $$\lim_{h\to \infty} \frac{1}{h} \sum_{t=1}^h \mathbb E[R_t | A_{0:t-1}\sim \pi] = \lim_{t\to\infty} \mathbb E[R_t| A_{0:t-1}\sim \pi]~. $$ Why is this true? How can I prove this?
