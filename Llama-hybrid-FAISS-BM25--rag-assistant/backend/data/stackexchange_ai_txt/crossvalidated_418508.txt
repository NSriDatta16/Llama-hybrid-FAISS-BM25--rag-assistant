Machine learning can be used in the branch and bound algorithm to Select a branching variable (Khalil, Elias Boutros, et al. "Learning to branch in mixed integer programming." Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2016.) Decide whether or not to run a primal heuristic at a node (Khalil, Elias B., et al. "Learning to Run Heuristics in Tree Search." IJCAI. 2017.) Reinforcement learning can be used to Learn a better criterion for greedy solution construction over a graph distribution (Khalil, Elias, et al. "Learning combinatorial optimization algorithms over graphs." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.) Check Bistra Dilkina's (who seems to pioneered this approach) talk at USC ISI AI seminar .
