Using Timer Control in C# to display call duration in HH:MM:SS format

I have a program which shows the call duration of the call in this format HH:MM:SS, the user may take up another call keeping the current call on hold. Now, do I have to trigger another timer to start from the beginning. I want to use timer control for this to happen, how can I implement this.? Any other best methods for this.? Finally I managed to do with the following code.. May be it wil be usefull for others using System.Diagnostics; private void MainGUI_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { sw.Start(); timerDuration.Start(); } Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch(); private void timerDuration_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { TimeSpan elapsed = sw.Elapsed; this.agentView.Rows[0].Cells[4].Value = String.Format("{00:00}:{1:00}:{2:00}", Math.Floor(elapsed.TotalHours), elapsed.Minutes, elapsed.Seconds); }
