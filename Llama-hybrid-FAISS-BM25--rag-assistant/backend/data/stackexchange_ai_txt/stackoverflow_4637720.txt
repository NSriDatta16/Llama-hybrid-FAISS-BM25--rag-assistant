I have done X.509 certificate creation and storing into the windows keystore. Other than makecert there is very little good documentation available and makecert is not a viable option under most circumstances. I found the pluralsight APIs very helpful as they support certificate generation as well as storage of the certificate into the windows key store. There is virtually no documentation (of course) but if you search for it you will find some blogs that show how to use it. Here are some links. http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/keith/archive/2009/01/22/create-self-signed-x-509-certificates-in-a-flash-with-self-cert.aspx http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2010/02/creating-x509-certificates-with.html
