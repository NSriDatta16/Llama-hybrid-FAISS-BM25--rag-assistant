On Windows, the size of the executable has no impact on load times because the exe is just mapped into memory and then paged in as needed. I can't imagine why that would not be true for *nix as well. So, if the scripts don't need to change separately from your .exe, you could imbed them into the .exe, that would make them difficult for users to change even if they could find them. I wrote a little tool once that turned data files into .obj files that made it really easy to imbed data into my exe - it turned out to be pretty easy to write an object file that contains only data. Of course, if you really care about protecting this data than full encryption in your only choice, but if you are just trying to discourage casual hacking, making the files hard to get at might be good enough.
