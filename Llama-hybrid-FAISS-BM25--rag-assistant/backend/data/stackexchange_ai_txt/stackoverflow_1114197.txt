Download on iPhone Caching?

I felt like I'm having the same issues as addressed here . But everything I try doesn't seem to work. The program goes as follows: I'm asking for user credentials (username/password) Then I do some calls to the server downloading information. When its finished, I display a set of users, the user clicks on one, then is asked for the password for that account I then make another request to the server and check to see if I get the right information back (therefore verifying the username/password just given is correct) The problem is, the last call is similar (same url, different credentials) to one that I do in the initial download. Regardless of what the user puts in for the second credentials the "correct" information comes back. I think this is because it is caching the response, but I can't figure out how to stop it from doing that. I'm have a class that makes the connection and returns the downloaded data. And I make a new class for every connection. So I'm not really sure why its saving data. I have a NSMutableURLRequest in which I do the following: [theRequest setCachePolicy:NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData]; (I have also tried, NSURLRequestReloadRevalidatingCacheData and NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData ) I've also implemnted the functions: - (NSCachedURLResponse *)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection willCacheResponse:(NSCachedURLResponse *)cachedResponse { return nil; } - (BOOL)connectionShouldUseCredentialStorage:(NSURLConnection *)connection { return NO; } With the last one I don't fully understand it. So I tired YES and NO. And I've tried various NSURLRequest cache policies. Any help on what my issue might be would be very helpful. Thank you.
