jQuery focus without scroll

How can I focus to a HTML element (ex. "a") and do not change the current scroll settings. For ex. if I use: $('#link').focus(); and this link is not visible in the screen (ex. is bellow the visible area) the browser scrolls down to show the element. How can I set the focus without scrollbar movement? I need to stay the scrollbar in the original place. I have tried this, but it produces some screen flickering, and it is a hack, not an elegant solution: var st=$(document).scrollTop(); $('#link').focus(); $(document).scrollTop(st); Can somebody help me, please?
