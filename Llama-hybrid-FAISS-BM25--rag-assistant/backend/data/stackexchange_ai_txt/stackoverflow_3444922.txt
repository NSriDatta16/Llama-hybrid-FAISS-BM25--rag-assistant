Mongrel CACHE log entries, specifically CACHE entries for SQL statements

In the process of looking at my logs from Mongrel, I found some SQL statements that I wanted to optimize. While looking into these, I noticed that these entries sometimes have CACHE in front of them, e.g.: CACHE (0.0ms) SELECT * FROM `customers` WHERE (`customers`.`id` = 35) Given the execution time, I'm assuming Mongrel really is caching this data. My question is how is this configured? I haven't been able to find much online about caching of model data; most of what I've read has to do with caching static pages or page fragments. I haven't done anything explicitly to enable this caching, so I'm really just looking for a pointer on how it's configured and how it works. Thanks in advance!
