Is it possible to access "Data Science" on Stack Exchange using an API?

I am a programmer with C and Python knowledge. I am trying to "educate" or train my Chatbot with name "Stella" in "Science and Technology History" and related areas, helped by ChatGPT 3.5. I am already using contents provided by Wikipedia, but some a question and answer format about specific topics could be of great help.
