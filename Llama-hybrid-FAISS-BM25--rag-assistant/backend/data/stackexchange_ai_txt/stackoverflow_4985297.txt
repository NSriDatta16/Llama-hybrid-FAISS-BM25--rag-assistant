Bind a "mouseover" event handler to the element. In that handler, check the "target" property of each event it catches and see whether its "tagName" property is "A". If so, call the handler. The "live" feature leverages event "bubbling", which is the name for the browsers process of checking for handlers from the target element to the root of the DOM, one parent at a time. Since each in your document can ultimately be traced back up to the , that root node will get all the "mouseover" events that aren't shunted off by lower-level handlers that cancel bubbling (via the "stopPropagation()" method on the event object, or some weird browser-specific way I guess). Not all events bubble, however. I'm looking around for a good reference ... ok here, the MDC page seems pretty good though a little old maybe.
