There exist multi-class SVMs. LibSVM has an implementation, as does Weka . Usually it's better to experiment with several classifiers to find out which one works best on your data. The choice of classifier type and training algorithm is far less important than your choice of feature set. You could try na√Øve Bayes, multi-class SVM, MaxEnt, voted perceptrons, or whatever your library offers.
