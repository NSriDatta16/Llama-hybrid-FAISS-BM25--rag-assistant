C# timer for database cyclic polling

I'm not very familiar with C# so far, at least not enough to feel confident when choosing ways of doing something when it comes for the first time. What could be the best way to organize SQL Server database timer based polling from my WPF application for controls updating? Could you please share some thoughts on this issue or, maybe, code examples how it could be implemented? To what extent short is it possible (or reasonable) to make period of such polling? What can be dangerous to do? Maybe there is one standard and correct way to do this?
