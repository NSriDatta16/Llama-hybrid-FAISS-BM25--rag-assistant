Attacking websites without leaving an audit trail

Recently Aetna suffered a breach where it lost 65,000 SSNs. They never were able to find an audit trail of what happened which probably hints that the attack leveraged XSS or similar technique. Are there specific known attacks that the bad guys are repeatedly leveraging for this type of attack?
