If you are inside of a movieclip and you can use "this.something" it reffers to the movieclip you are working in...ie: "circle_mc", but if you go to the root timeline and create an actions layer you can't use "this" anymore, you have to reference the movieclip name. So, if you created a new layer on the root timeline called actions, you could paste this code in and it will still work (delete your old code, inside the mc too): var stoppedOn = 2; circle_mc.onPress = function() { circle_mc.startDrag(); } circle_mc.onRelease = function() { circle_mc.stopDrag(); } circle_mc.onRollOver = function() { circle_mc.gotoAndPlay(stoppedOn); } circle_mc.onRollOut = function() { circle_mc.stop(); stoppedOn = circle_mc._currentframe; } I personally think your code stays more maintainable if you put all of your code on the root timeline. It will also prep you for working with Classes down the line. I would also reccomend learning AS3 in your spare time as it's really the way to go.
