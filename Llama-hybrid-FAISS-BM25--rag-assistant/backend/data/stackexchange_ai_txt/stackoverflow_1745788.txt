Different UI for Dojo DND than when item is displayed

I have a set of items that can be dragged / dropped using Dojo DND, that part has already been implemented and all is working well. The specific question I have is that I'd like to display very different data both in terms of content and visually while the item is being dragged than the initial view of the item, which is what is presently being displayed when the item is being dragged, how do i do this?
