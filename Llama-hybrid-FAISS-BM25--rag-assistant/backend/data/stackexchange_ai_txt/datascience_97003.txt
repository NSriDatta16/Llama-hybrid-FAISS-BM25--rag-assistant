One way (I know no other way, btw) is to create a model with the (best) selected features and measure the accuracy of that model. This accuracy will be parametrised by the model you used. For example, using a different model might alter the accuracy, so using a handful of models and getting the average will give you a hint of the accuracy of the features selected. This procedure is exactly similar to the procedure followed by sklearn.feature_selection.RFE where a model (an estimator) is passed as parameter.
