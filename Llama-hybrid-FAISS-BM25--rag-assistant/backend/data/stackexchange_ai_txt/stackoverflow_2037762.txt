CSS letter-spacing parts of a word

I want to do something like this in HTML: "T i t l e" The W3C recommends using the CSS property letter-spacing rather than inserting spaces. So, I can do the following: &quot; Title &quot; which gives the following result: "T i t l e" (sometimes IE), "T i t l e " (all other browsers) The alternative, using &quot; Titl e&quot; , results in "T i t le" (sometimes IE), "T i t l e" (all other browsers) Is there some easy and elegant way to get the desired result in all common browsers (IE6-8, FF, Opera, Safari)? I know that I can use something like Titl e and conditional comments that assign the right CSS based on browser selection, but I want to avoid cluttering my HTML and CSS with browser-specific workarounds. EDIT: About the "sometimes IE": I have two machines, both with Windows 7 and IE8 (8.0.7600.16385). One of them gives the left-hand result, one of them the right-hand result (for exactly the same HTML file). Unfortunatley, the customer's IE7 produces the left-hand result...
