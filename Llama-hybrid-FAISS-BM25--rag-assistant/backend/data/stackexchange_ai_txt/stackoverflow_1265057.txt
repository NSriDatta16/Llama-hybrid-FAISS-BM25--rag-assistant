This link provides some insights: Avoiding Processor Wake-Ups Saves Power A fragment from the above link, In order to take best advantage of the low power states offered by the latest processors, the operating system has to allow the processor to stay in those states as much as possible. A long-standing feature of the Linux* operating system has been a timer tick that supports services like helping the operating system keep internal time and monitor CPU usage by various applications and processes. While that timer tick is useful, it also has the unfortunate side effect of waking the processor when it is in a low power state as many as 1,000 times per second. In fact, under some circumstances, the tick can prevent the processor from entering the deep power-saving states at all. Clearly, this effect can have a dramatic negative impact on power usage by the system.
