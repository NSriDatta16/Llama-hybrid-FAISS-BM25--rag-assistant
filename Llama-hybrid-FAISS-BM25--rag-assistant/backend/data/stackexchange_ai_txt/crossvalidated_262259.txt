Dependent variable is continuous and categorical - how to regress?

My research is about password safety. As dependent variable I have the number of attempts a software needed to crack the respective passwords. This results in values in a range from approx. 1e+5 to 1e+12. Unfortunately a substantial part of the passwords couldn't be cracked by the software but I would like to integrate these in my analysis. An obvious solution to this would be to conduct a logistic regression. However, I don't want to lose the information of the distribution of the cracked passwords. My idea was, to build something like a pseudo-continuous scale from 1 to 14. 1e+0 Is this possible and what would be the limitations of this procedure?
