Are there any open source image resize and uploader for a web application?

I would like look for an open source image resize and uploader for a web application. Preferably leveraging on W3C speficication and try avoid need client to install any application. Target uploading images are limited to 1 ~ 3 and resizing in terms of width & height only. Hopefully works well with Java technology.
