You guys are all right, but I post because I think there is a very elegant and useful function I came up with when learning to help with the read ing and show ing of text. as :: (Read a, Show a) => (a -> a) -> String -> String as f = show . f . read Prelude> as (+1) "7" "8" Prelude> as (+(1/2)) "5" "5.5" Useful, eh? =P. Also xs !! n gets xs's n'th element. Look at others answers for easy ways to print.
