Tools to assist managing the application promotion process in an enterprise environment

I am curious on how others manage code promotion from DEV to TEST to PROD within an enterprise. What tools or processes do you use to manage the "red tape", entry/exit criteria side of things? My current organisation is half stuck between some custom online forms type functionality and paper based dependencies to submit documents, gather approvals and reviews. All this is left in the project managers hands to track what has been submitted, passed review, approved and advise management if there are any roadblocks that may need approval to be "overlooked" before an application can be promoted to the next environment. A browser based application would be ideal... so whats out there? please show me that you googlefu is better than mine.
