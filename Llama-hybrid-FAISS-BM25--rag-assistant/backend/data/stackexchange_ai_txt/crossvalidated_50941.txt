Time series prediction - what is Autoregressive Tree model ? (Python)

Our problem: model evolution of values of a continuous variable over time. I came through a paper presenting an approach for predicting the next values for a time series. Whereas ARIMA model is more accurate for long term prediction, ARTXP model is preferred to infer the next values. Microsoft library for Data Mining algorithms implements ARTXP, a variation of Autoregressive Tree model. How does algorithm works? What is a Python implementation for this model ?
