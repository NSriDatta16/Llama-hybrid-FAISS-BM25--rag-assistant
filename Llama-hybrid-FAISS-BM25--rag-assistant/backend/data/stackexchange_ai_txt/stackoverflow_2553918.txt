I took the liberty of adding the question_id column that will be used to join each answer with a question. Question with the following columns : id, question, nranswers Answers with the following columns: question_id, userid, answer Here's your query: SELECT answer, COUNT(*) AS answer_count FROM Answers GROUP BY answer WHERE question_id = 22 ORDER by answer However, if nranswers is 3, but nobody picked 3 as their answer, it won't show. This query only shows the answers that were chosen. Edit: To get a count of all available answers, not just the selected ones, the simplest way (query wise) would be to get rid of the Question.nranswers column and add the table QuestionAnswers: QuestionAnswers with the following columns: question_id, answer The data in QuestionAnswers would like this: quesiton_id answer ------------------- 22 1 22 2 22 3 So, you'd have all the possible answers listed for each question. The query would then be this: SELECT qa.answer, COUNT(a.question_id) AS answer_count FROM QuestionAnswers qa LEFT OUTER JOIN Answers a ON qa.question_id = a.question_id AND a.answer = qa.answer GROUP BY qa.answer WHERE qa.question_id = 22 ORDER by qa.answer
