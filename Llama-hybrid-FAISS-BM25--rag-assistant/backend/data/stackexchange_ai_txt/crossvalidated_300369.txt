The problem with this kind of definition is that it is ambiguous and can be understood differently by different people and in different contexts. Wikipedia says that, heuristic, is any approach to problem-solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. How do you know that the solution is optimal or perfect? When you are dealing with random phenomena, then you cannot get "perfect" results (i.e., always correct). What machine learning algorithms give you, is the "best you can get" results, given certain conditions are met. Moreover, each of the algorithms that are commonly used gives you some guarantees for optimality in certain scenarios (if they didn't, we wouldn't use them). Heuristics have very similar, though more precise, meaning in computer science , tl;dr : they are algorithms that seek an approximate, opinionated solution rather than the exact one. In machine learning, there is usually no exact solutions, so it is not achievable by any algorithm.
