Univariate time-series data with 30 minutes interval - Which algorithm to use for forecasting?

I am working on a case study to predict # of calls for next 30 days. The data is at 30 minutes interval and start from 7 am to 23:30 PM (So 34 observations in a day). I have two questions: What would be the frequency ? Which Machine Learning algorithm would be the best to predict next 30 days? I tried LSTM, however it takes much longer just to complete 25 epochs.
