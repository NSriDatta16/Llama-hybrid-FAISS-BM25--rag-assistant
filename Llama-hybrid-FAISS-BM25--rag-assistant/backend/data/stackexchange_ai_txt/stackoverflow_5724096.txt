Since you want to use your google voice phone number maybe you just want to send the SMS though google voice. One way to connect w/ google voice is to use the Asterisk software. You would use Asterisk to talk to google voice over the SIP protocal - documented here: http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/how-to-use-google-voice-for-free-outgoing-calls-on-an-asteriskfreepbx-system-the-easy-way/ and http://eggie5.com/10-installing-asterisk-on-osx For example I did this and then I interface asterisk from ruby code and can make calls, sms, etc.
