An absorbing state has a preriod of 1 , yes. Because there is a loop on himself. It's true only if it's not in an absorbing class. But states 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 are in the same class of communication ( you can go to an other state of the class and come back if you want ) so they have the same period. which is 3 . If you gave us the source maybe there is some explanation. Is this Markov chain irreducible? You can read that, it can be helpful.
