Take a look at your InstallUISequence table: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369543(VS.85).aspx Notice the special dialogs with a sequence of -1, -2 and -3. Notice that you can also put a condition on the dialogs. With a little creatavity you can use a property as a flag to determine whether your install ever really began and prevent or show the dialog in question.
