In Router, in a method, in an included file is the controller code. In the model and in the view, I need access to the Controller's properties and methods. In Router, in an other method, I want to return a controller object to the model and the view. What now?? If I understand the question properly, you're a bit confused about MVC. Router class is a cake internal class and should never never ever never never absolutely never ever be changed. And those " never ever " are not even copy-pasted, they are really typed. Second, model classes don't even know anything called controller. Controller uses models, not the other way around. If your model needs something from a controller, pass it on as a parameter. Anything beyond that is just bad design. Also, calling controller actions from a view is possible, but strongly discouraged. Controller is the one to prepare all the data for a view, therefore view has no need to access the controller (there are exceptions to this, out of scope of this question). I recommend you read a bit about MVC , cake's typical request , and at least go through the basic blog tutorial .
