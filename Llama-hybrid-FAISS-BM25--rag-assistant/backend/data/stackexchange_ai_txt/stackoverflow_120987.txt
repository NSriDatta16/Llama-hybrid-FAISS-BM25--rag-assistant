It's possible to do this with mnesia's table fragmentation, if one makes use of the mnesia_frag_hash callback behaviour. This allows you to control the distribution of keys, and it would be possible to construct the keys such that the callback is able to determine which node pair (and thus, which fragment) should be used. Whether or not this works in your particular case depends on your access patterns and data set. Chances are that it's a pretty convoluted approach, and that you'd be better served by simply using different table names instead.
