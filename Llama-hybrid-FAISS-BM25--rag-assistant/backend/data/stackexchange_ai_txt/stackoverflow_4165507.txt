MTU is a property of a link, not socket. They belong to different layers of the stack. That said TCP performs Path MTU discovery during the three-way handshake and tries very hard to avoid fragmentation. You'll have hard time making TCP send fragments. With UDP the easiest is to force some smallish MTU on an interface with ifconfig(8) and then send packets larger then that value.
