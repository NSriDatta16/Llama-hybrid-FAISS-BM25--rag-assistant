Which test (or regression) to run with a categorical DV and a mix of continuous and categorical covariates?

I am looking into which test I should run for a question regarding the likelihood that something would happen [to the participant]. They answered based on likelihood (not likely at all, somewhat not likely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely). Thus, my DV has 5 levels. I have 5 IVs: 1 grouping factor (3 subgroups) and a mix of continuous (ie. age) and categorical (ie. religion) covariates. I was looking into the various types of analyses but do not see which would be most appropriate. For the purpose of the covariates, I initially looked into an ANCOVA but read the covariates need to be continuous (which I have a few categorical covariates as well). I had then looked into a regression, in which the two options seem to be either an ordinal logistic regression or a multinomial regression. Initially, it seems the multinomial regression would make the most sense as I do not assign some arbitrary range between likely and not likely, rather whichever response the participant answers is simply their opinion and not right/wrong. However, I read for a multinomial regression you must have a baseline group to compare, in which I have three groups but one is not designated as a control so to speak. Does anyone have any advice as to these options and what is statistically appropriate?
