By "fitting a regression model to each of the segments" , I suppose you mean trying to do something like a Piecewise Linear Representation of a long time-series, as described in this paper: Segmenting Time Series: A Survey and Novel Approach . As quoted straight from the paper: ...this representation makes the storage, transmission and computation of the data more efficient. Specifically, in the context of data mining, the piecewise linear representation has been used to: Support fast exact similarly search [13]. Support novel distance measures for time series, including “fuzzy queries” [27, 28], weighted queries [15], multiresolution queries [31, 18], dynamic time warping [22] and relevance feedback [14]. Support concurrent mining of text and time series [17]. Support novel clustering and classification algorithms [15]. Support change point detection [29, 8]. In summary, it can be seen as a type of data preprocessing so you can train some kind of machine learning algorithm more easily/accurately (such as your regression model) or if you prefer, as a type of feature extraction.
