I don't think this approach is right. I think you want some form of regression. What sort of regression would depend on how "environmental impact" is measured - it might be OLS regression or ordinal logistic regression or possibly something else. You could then easily create a formula that would create a score from the 10 parameters and the formula could be easily put into Excel or almost any program so that all the architect would have to do is enter the variables and get a score. Doing the regression would be a relatively involved task. I would not use Excel for this - use R or SAS or some other statistical program.
