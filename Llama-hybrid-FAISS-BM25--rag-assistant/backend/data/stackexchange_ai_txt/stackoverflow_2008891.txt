Any ideas on optimizing this script? (Python)

I'm working on a little script to help me learn the Japanese Kana (Hiragana/Katakana). In total, there are probably 100+ (+||-). Basically, all it would do is take in the english version and convert it to the character. ie. a = '„ÅÇ' which is 12354 in decimal What I have so far is this: hiraDict = { "a" : 12354, "i" : 12356 ...} if __name__ == "__main__": if hiraDict.has_key(sys.argv[1]): print(unichr(hiraDict[sys.argv[1]])) With 100+ characters, would this work OK or is there a better way to approach this?
