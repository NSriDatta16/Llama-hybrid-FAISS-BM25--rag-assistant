The Ridge regressor has a classifier variant: RidgeClassifier. This classifier first converts binary targets to {-1, 1} and then treats the problem as a regression task, optimizing the same objective as above. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#classification So it's a linear model that has closed-form solution . Logistic regression is linear in parameters, but this is followed by logistic transformation, so we need an optimization algorithm to fit it . So it is faster for the same reason linear regression is faster than logistic regression.
