You are looking for the "svn:externals" property. See this section of svnbook: Under the project that you want to use the shared project in, and then set a property on that directory named "svn:externals". This property contains the name of the directory which contains the external respository, and can have some other options so that you always get the same revision. Example (from svnbook, which is an EXCELLENT reference for svn questions): $ svn propget svn:externals calc third-party/sounds http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/skins -r148 http://svn.example.com/skinproj third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.example.com/skin-maker in this example, third-party/sounds would be checked out from http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds . The -rNNN pins the checkout to a revision so that if you're doing more development on that, you can make sure your other projects don't randomly break. Generally instead of doing this revision thing, I external to a tag which holds a stable version.
