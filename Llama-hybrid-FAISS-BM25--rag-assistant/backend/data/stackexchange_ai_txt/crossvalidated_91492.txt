Suppose you observe several nests at different mean daily temperatures $t$. How does the probability $\pi(t)$ of nest success depend on the temperature $t$? (If nests are independent, the number of nests with success at temperature $t$ is then binomially distributed with $n$ equal to the number of nests observed and success probability $\pi(t)$.) Logistic regression is one approach (using the logistic function) of specifying the success probability as a function of temperature via stretching and shifting the logistic curve, with the amount of stretching and shifting required to be estimated from the data.
