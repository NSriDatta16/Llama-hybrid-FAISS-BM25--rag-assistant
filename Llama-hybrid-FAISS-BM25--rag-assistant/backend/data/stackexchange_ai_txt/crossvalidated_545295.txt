How to distribute weights in weighted average in order to obtain a known value

I'd like to know if there is a way to calculate the weights in a weighted average, in order to obtain a fixed, known value. In other words, given the weighted average formula: $$Z = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n s_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$$ where $Z$ is the final weighted average, $s_1...s_n$ are the values, and $w_1...w_n$ are the weights and $Z$ and $s_1...s_n$ are known and positive. Is there a way to calculate $w_1...w_n$ ? Note that $w_i>0$ for all $i > 0$
