javascript - google map like image scrolling

I want to build an image scroller that works like google map. When the website first loads, there will be a viewing box in the middle of the page that contains part of an image. A user can click and drag the image, that is scrolling, to inspect other areas of the image. If the user happens to scroll beyond the perimeter of the image, the box will load an adjacent image. I also want to overlay these images with markers that the user can click on to zoom in for more details. Is there a library that does what I want already? Or something close to what I want so that I can start to customize it? Or if I have to build from scratch, any suggestions on the general approach to take? I like using jquery library, so anything built with jquery would be awesome.
