What would be considered average or high load for a website using mysql on the backend?

I'm roughly 10% into my website project and I'm trying to figure out what sort of load I'm putting on the database. When a user is logged in, I have many functions that trigger every minute, and every time someone visits the page, a number of elements, such as area code lists, states and countries are pulled to build a registration page. I'm sure I can move some of that to PHP so the database isn't involved. In 6 days, 14 hours, 57 minutes and 58 seconds, I show 120,998,563 queries, averaging 12.69 k per minute and 211.43 per second. I'm listing maximum concurrent connections of 79. These last two don't make sense. Received averages 133 MiB per hour and Sent averages 1,997 MiB per minute.
