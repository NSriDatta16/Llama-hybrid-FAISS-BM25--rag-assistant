Although I did not find this explicitly stated in the paper, it seems that $f$ is actually intended to be a multiple output Gaussian process (possibly with independent components) - so that a realization is a function from $\mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ and thus $\mathbb{f}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$. Note that: In the first author's PhD thesis [1], Section 3.1, similar notation is used to define a Gaussian process state-space model, and on p. 27 the following remark appears: Note that the covariance function $\kappa(\cdot, \cdot)$ returns a matrix of the same size as the state in an analogous manner to multi-output Gaussian processes (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). In an earlier paper considering Gaussian process state-space models, Turner et al. [2] (reference [2] of the case paper), "independent GPs are used for each target dimension of $f$" (p. 869, last paragraph of the left-hand-side column). Which is a special case of a multiple-output GP. References [1] Roger Frigola-Alcalde (2015) Bayesian Time Series Learning with Gaussian Processes.
