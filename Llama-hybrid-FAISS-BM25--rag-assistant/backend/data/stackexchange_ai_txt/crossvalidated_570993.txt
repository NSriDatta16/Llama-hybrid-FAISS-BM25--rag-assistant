There are many methods proposed to detect communities in attributed networks. The three main approaches are: 1) combining structure- and attribute-based information in a single representation (e.g. by adding to the graph some vertices representing attributes), then detecting communities based on this representation; 2) detecting communities by considering simultaneously structure and attributes (e.g. by jointly optimizing two criteria); and 3) detecting communities separately using structure and attributes, then combining the resulting partitions (akin to consensus-based clustering methods). To get a more precise overview of the existing methods, you should look for recent surveys such as ( Chunaev'20 ). I did not find any implementation of these methods integrated in any of the major network libraries such as igraph or networkx . However, some authors have published their source code online, so you can look for a suitable method in the above review and check whether its source code is available in the original publication. For instance, I-Louvain, an attribute-based variant of Louvain described in ( Combe'15 ), is available online: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j4aqitujiaifgq4/AAAAH0L3uIPYNWKoLpcAh0TPa .
