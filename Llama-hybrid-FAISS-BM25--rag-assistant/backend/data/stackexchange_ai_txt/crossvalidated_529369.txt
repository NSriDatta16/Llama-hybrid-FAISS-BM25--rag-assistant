I think that there is a fundamental problem in the way the question is posed. DoE does not per se model a system, the scope of DoE is to efficiently excite the system to gain maximum amount of information with a limited set of resources (time and experiments). Machine Learning(ML) supervised or unsupervised on the other and is a modelling technique that aims at finding relations within huge amount of observational data already collected. Much like simple regression is the step after you collected the data. There might be some similarities between DoE and Re-inforced Learning methods, were the ML itself is able to move paramters in the system in order to find an optimal fit or minimize a predifined objective function. In that context the ML model is performin some kind of DoE to gain more information and improve itself.
