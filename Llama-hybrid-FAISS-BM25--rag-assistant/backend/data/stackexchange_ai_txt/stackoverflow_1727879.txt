Weak linking with Interface Builder

The application uses a 3.x SDK feature, but it needs to run in 2.x devices. The solution seems to be using "weak linking", which I did, but the app still fails to compile for iPhone 2.2.1: "Framework not found MapKit". Compile for target "Device 3.0 - Debug" is OK, even installs on my iPod Touch running 2.2.1! It runs OK as long as I don't activate view using MapKit and crashes if I do. I created a view using Interface Builder (IB), dragged a MkMapView object on it. As far as I can tell, this is the only reference to MapKit, so the question is: when I use weak linking, can I use related UI elements in IB at all? Should I do all of this in Xcode only? Guess yes, but being able to install and run "3.0" app on "2.2.1" device confuses me...
