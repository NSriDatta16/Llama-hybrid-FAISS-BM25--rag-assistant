How are you building the Visual Studio projects? Are you just running the ide (devenv) with the project and /build or do you have a makefile similar to what I assume you are using for gcc. I'm assuming that both builds use a similar makefile but I thought it worth checking. Are you using precompiled headers for either compiler? If you're NOT using precompiled headers for VS then you might like to switch to using them. Personally I'd recommend using the #pragma hdrstop approach rather than a single all inclusive header file but if you're currently NOT using precompiled headers and want to try it out a single all inclusive header file that is force included (using the /FI compiler command line switch) can be tested quickly without any code changes. I wrote about both /FI and #pragma hdrstop here: http://www.lenholgate.com/blog/2004/07/fi-stlport-precompiled-headers-warning-level-4-and-pragma-hdrstop.html
