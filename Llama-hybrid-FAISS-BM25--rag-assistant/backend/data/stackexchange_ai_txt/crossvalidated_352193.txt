Omega equals 1, this could imply that no Box-Cox transformation is necessary (see De Livera et al. 2010, S. 25-27 in footnote *). An additional note: Also consider the source code of the TBATS function by typing 'tbats' to the R console and hitting enter. Since I can't reproduce your problem, I just can guess, that your data set may contain negative values which Box-Cox transformation can't handle. Then the use.box.cox argument will be set to FALSE (see line 58-61). Both interval limits for the Box-Cox parameter will only by used, if any transformation will be executed. See my examples: set.seed(123) numbers *De Livera, Hyndman, Snyder (2010): Forecasting time series with complex seasonal patterns using exponential smoothing.
