Why should I be Bayesian when my dataset is large?

From " Why should I be Bayesian when my model is wrong? ", one of the key benefits of Bayesian inference to be able to inject exogenous domain knowledge into the model, in the form of a prior. This is especially useful when you don't have enough observed data to make good predictions. However, the prior's influence diminishes (to zero?) as the dataset grows larger. So if you have enough data, the prior provides very little value. What's the benefit of using Bayesian analysis in this case? Maybe that we still get a posterior distribution over parameter values? (But for large enough data, wouldn't the posterior just collapse to the MLE?)
