Call fragment events from activity

So, I got the event in my fragment to pass to the activity, so how do I make it so the activity in turns, notifies fragment B to do something. I want to fragment B to populate a custom list when fragment A has a list item clicked on. So, it sends the event to the activity, now how do I get the activity to call events in fragment B?
