Inserting a string of form "GUID1, GUID2, GUID3 ..." into an IN statement in TSQL

I've got a stored procedure in my database, that looks like this ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetCountingAnalysisResults] @RespondentFilters varchar AS BEGIN @RespondentFilters = '''8ec94bed-fed6-4627-8d45-21619331d82a, 114c61f2-8935-4755-b4e9-4a598a51cc7f''' DECLARE @SQL nvarchar(600) SET @SQL = 'SELECT * FROM Answer WHERE Answer.RespondentId IN ('+@RespondentFilters+''')) GROUP BY ChosenOptionId' exec sp_executesql @SQL END It compiles and executes, but somehow it doesn't give me good results, just like the IN statement wasn't working. Please, if anybody know the solution to this problem, help me.
