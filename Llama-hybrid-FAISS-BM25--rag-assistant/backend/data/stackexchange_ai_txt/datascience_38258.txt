What are the differences between logistic and linear regression?

I know that linear regression does "regression" and logistic regression does "classification". When we implement these two methods, the only difference I could notice is the loss function : linear regression uses a loss function like mean square error and logistic uses cross-entropy. Is there any other difference that I am not aware of?
