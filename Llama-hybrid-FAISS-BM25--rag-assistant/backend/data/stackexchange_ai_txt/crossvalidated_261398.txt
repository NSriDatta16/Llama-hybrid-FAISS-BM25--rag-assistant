How many neighbor-swaps does it take to undo a random shuffle of N items?

Suppose you have an ordered deck of $N$ items, $e_1, e_2, ... e_N$ and you randomly shuffle them. On average, how many neighbor-swaps does it take to get back to the ordered deck? For example: $N=3$. $D = [1, 2, 3, 4]$. Random Shuffle: $[1,3,4,2]$ Swaps to get back: 2 (permute 2 and 4, then 2 and 3).
