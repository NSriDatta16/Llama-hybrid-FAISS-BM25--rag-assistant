Rotational invariance of PPCA

From here (slide 23) and here (page 5, 4th slide) I understand that it is said that PPCA (probabilistic PCA) is rotational invariant. It can be written as follows: $$\text{PPCA}(X) = [\mu, W, \sigma^2]$$ $$\text{PPCA}(XQ) = [Q\mu, QW, \sigma^2]$$ where $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix and $X$ is the dataset. According to Wikipedia , a function $f$ is called rotational invariant if $f(Qx)=f(x),\forall x$. So, if we want PPCA to be rotational invariant, didn't we have to impose that $\text{PPCA}(XQ) = [\mu, W, \sigma^2]$ (i.e. $Q$ to disappear from the returned vector of parameters)? Or is there some other definition of rotational invariance?
