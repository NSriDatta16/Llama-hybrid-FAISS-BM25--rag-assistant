Jquery UI - Getting one element out of a display:hidden element when dragging

I have a group of elements sitting on a 'conveyor' element within another element that is set overflow:hidden using css. How do I, when dragging, get the element 'out' of the holder element that has overflow set to hidden? When I drag the "item" classed image, it only drags within the holder, when I try to move it "outside" the holder, it hides, and won't move outside the old holder element. $('.item').draggable(); I've also tried to append the newly moved element to a parent element, but then the item won't revert back to my holder.... please help! tried to append item: $('.item').draggable( helper:'clone'; revert:'invalid', start:function(){ $(this).parent().parent().append(this); } )
