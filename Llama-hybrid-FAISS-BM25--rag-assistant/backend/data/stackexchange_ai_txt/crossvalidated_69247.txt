The problem with what you intend to quantify, is that you would need to record hashtags in pre-defined and recurring time-points, otherwise you will not be able to draw valid inferences. For example, if the second #goodMood was recorded at September 3, 2013 11 :00 AM, but no record of any hashtag was made at September 3, 2013 9 :00 AM, then you would not be able to say, "hmm, not much clumpiness here" (the scientifically recognizable word is "clustering") - because you could not say whether #goodMood has already set in at 9:00 AM, or not... ...except if there is some (actually observed) rule that says that "I record a hashtag the moment I feel it sets in". In such a case, you could easily create a data sample with time intervals (#goodmod set in 2 hours after exercise, 3 hours after exercise, 1 hour after exercise etc)- and then go on and calculate their mean, variance, and other statistics of interest. This would give you for example the average time interval between exercise and #goodMood -an absolute figure, which could then be compared to other central tendency statistics from other pairs, and create a ranking.
