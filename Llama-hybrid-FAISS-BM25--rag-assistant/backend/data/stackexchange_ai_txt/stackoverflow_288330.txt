Speed will always be relative to what you are doing once it is parsed. A lexical parser by far is the fastest method of converting to tokens from a text stream regardless of size. TParser in the classes unit is a great place to start. Personally its been a while since I needed to write a parser, but another more dated yet tried and true method would be to use LEX/YACC to build a grammar then have it convert the grammar into code you can use to perform your processing. DYacc is a Delphi version...not sure if it still compiles or not, but worth a look if you want to do things old school. The dragon book here would be of big help, if you can find a copy.
