1) When Predictor and Response Variables are Categorical in nature, you must apply logistic regression or some Naive Bayes technique. With Linear Regression, your output is non-interpretable - Co-Efficients, Residuals, Intercept, Standard Error >> Nothing will be useful. 2) For the highly correlated variables, you have a few choices: Approach (a) Do a Principal Component Analysis and group some of the predictors into a category (For E.g.: All Questions Related to After Sales Service could become one category). Use the Factor Loadings from the PCA multiplied by the actual survey rating to create a factor score for each respondent on each category of questions. Approach (b) Apply transformations to one of the predictors like log or quadratic transformation or third degree polynomials. But Beware! Applying complex transformations can result in over-fitting and the T-Value of variable is usually too high.
