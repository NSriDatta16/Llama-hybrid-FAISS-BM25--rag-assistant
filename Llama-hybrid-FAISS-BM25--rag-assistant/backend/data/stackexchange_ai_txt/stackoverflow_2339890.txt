Somewhere you are creating objects and retaining reachable references to them. You are probably adding objects to a collection and never removing them... so the collection just grows until you run out of memory. As you get close to the maximum heap size the garbage collector is over-taxed to find free memory to reorganize things and the program get exponentially slower the closer you get to the limit. Also, it's possible you are forgetting to close some object(s) each time through, such as your workbook.
