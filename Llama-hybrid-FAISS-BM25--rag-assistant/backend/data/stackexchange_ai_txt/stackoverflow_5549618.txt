I am sending data over HTTPS but the server side says it is not receiving it

I create an application that sends some data to a secured network. At the server side they need the data as JSON object. For that am creating the data as JSON object and writing that data in the OutputStream of the connection. But the response from the server side telling it is not getting the data that I am passing. The code snippet that am using is something like given below: HttpsConnection _connection = (HttpsConnection)Connector.open("https://gmail.com/",Connector.READ_WRITE, true); _connection.setRequestMethod(HttpsConnection.POST); _connection.setRequestProperty("If-Modified-Since", "29 Oct 1999 19:43:31 GMT"); _connection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent","Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.0"); _connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Language", "en-US"); _connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"); byte[] postData = jsonObject.toString().getBytes("UTF-8"); _connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", Integer.toString(postData.length)); _connection.setRequestProperty("jsondata",jsonObject.toString()); OutputStream os = _connection.openOutputStream(); os.write(postData); os.flush(); Please help me to solve the issue.
