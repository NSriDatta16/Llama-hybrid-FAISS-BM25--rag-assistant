Queue M/M/2, proportion of unserved customers

In my work, I managed to arrive at the following scenario: Consider that I have a queue with two servers whose arrival rate is a poisson process $\lambda = 2 $ customers per hour and the service time is exponential with an average of $E(T) = 1$ hour . In this queue, if a customer arrives and no one is waiting, the customer waits, otherwise the customer leaves. My interest is to know the proportion of customers that will not be served. In a stable queuing system it is necessary that $\lambda > \mu$ , but as my interest is in knowing the proportion of unserved customers, I believe that this restriction is not a problem, but as for this case, $\rho$ (occupancy rate) is equal to $1$ , I'm kind of lost. Does anyone have any suggestions.
