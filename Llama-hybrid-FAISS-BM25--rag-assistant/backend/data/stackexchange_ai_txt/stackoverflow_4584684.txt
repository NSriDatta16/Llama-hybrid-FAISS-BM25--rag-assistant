Java CFG parser that supports ambiguities

I'm looking for a CFG parser implemented with Java. The thing is I'm trying to parse a natural language. And I need all possible parse trees (ambiguity) not only one of them. I already researched many NLP parsers such as Stanford parser. But they mostly require statistical data (a treebank which I don't have) and it is rather difficult and poorly documented to adapt them in to a new language. I found some parser generators such as ANTRL or JFlex but I'm not sure that they can handle ambiguities. So which parser generator or java library is best for me? Thanks in advance
