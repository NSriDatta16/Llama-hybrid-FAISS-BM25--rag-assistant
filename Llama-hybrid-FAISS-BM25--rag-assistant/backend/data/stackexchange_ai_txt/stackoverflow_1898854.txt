More efficient access to an multi-dim array

I'm trying to nicely output a data array (with Kohana v2.3.4), and am thinking there has to be a more efficient and elegant way to do this. My array looks like this: array('category_id' => value, 'category_title' => value, 'posts' => array( 'id' => value, 'title' => value, ... )) And here's how I'm outputting it in my view (some array values are omitted from this example for the sake of simplicity): foreach($data as $d) { echo ' '.$d['category_title'].' '; foreach($d['posts'][0] as $p) { echo ' '.$p['title'].$p['id'].' '; } } Is there a better way to go about this with the array I have?
