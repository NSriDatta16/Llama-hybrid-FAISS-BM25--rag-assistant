I've written a threadpool, how do I notify methods using it that the task has been completed?

So let's say I have a method such as ThreadPool.QueueTask(Delegate d). Some of these delegates need to return values, but as they cannot do this (being passed as delegates) they will need to take a value by reference as a parameter. Once the task is completed this value will have been altered, so the calling method needs to know this. Essentially, the method passing the task to the threadpool should be waiting until it has completed. What is the best way to do this? Should I just do Threadpool.QueueTask(Delegate d, EventWaitHandle e), or is there a more elegant way which would be obvious to people unfamiliar with that kind of thing? Kind regards, Fugu
