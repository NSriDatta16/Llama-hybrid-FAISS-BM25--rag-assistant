As ponkin mentioned, 9-patches are your best bet. Combined with resource directory qualifiers ( drawable-hdpi , drawable-mdpi , etc.) you can make assets that look good at any density and size. An example of 9-patches and resource directory qualifiers can be found in the Multiple Resolutions Android SDK sample. The semi-transparent, black, rounded-corner background is implemented as a 9-patch with different PNGs for ldpi, mdpi, and hdpi.
