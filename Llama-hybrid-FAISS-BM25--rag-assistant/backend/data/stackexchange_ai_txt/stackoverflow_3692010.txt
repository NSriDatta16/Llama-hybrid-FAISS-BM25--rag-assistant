Avoid ItemRenders Caching in a Spark List in Flex 4

I have two Spark Lists with custom Item Renderers. I'm working on an application that enables users to drag these Item Renderers from one List to the other. When one of these IRs is dropped in a new position or in another List, I'm updating the dataproviders: I remove the object from one list's dataprovider and add it to the other's dataprovider. This is working ok. The problem is that sometimes the IR is cached and it doesn't show the correct information, based on its data. How can I force the Lists to never cache IRs, so that every time I modify the dataprovider all Item Renders re-create all IRs. Performance won't be an issue since I have few items on each list.
