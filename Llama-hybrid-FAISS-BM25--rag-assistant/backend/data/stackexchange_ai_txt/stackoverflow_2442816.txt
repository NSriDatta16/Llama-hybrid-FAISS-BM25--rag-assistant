I have been using scrumworks for more than a year. I really like it, the scrum board is pretty and intuitive with drag and drop, support mutiple teams etc. Not very expensive too. I tried using Microsoft project for many years but given up because if wasn't flexible enough and I now use a mix of scrumworks, excel sheets and a bug database.
