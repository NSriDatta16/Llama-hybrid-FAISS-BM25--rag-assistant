Correctness is a funny concept in most of "soft computing." The best I can tell you is: "a neural network is correct when it consistently satisfies the parameters of it's design." You do this by training it with data, and then verifying with other data, and having a feedback loop in the middle which lets you know if the neural network is functioning appropriately. This is of-course the case only for neural networks that are large enough where a direct proof of correctness is not possible. It is possible to prove that a neural network is correct through analysis if you are attempting to build a neural network that learns XOR or something similar, but for that class of problem an aNN is seldom necessary.
