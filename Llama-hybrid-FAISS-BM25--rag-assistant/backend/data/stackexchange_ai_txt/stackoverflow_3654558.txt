Well, may be ,there are few threading issues which seem to crop in between, its very difficult to repro. It basically crashes VS 2010 when you even try to put a breakpoint in attached process. It did happen few times for me not only on just one machine but later dissappeared for unknown reason. As the detour happens debugging is a dance between your code and detour which might be difficult to cope up with initially and if there is exception during such then its just difficult to break on the exception. The auto generated tests and PUTs- its diificult to grasp what message they are trying to convey i.e. should the coding pattern be changed or something else as although it tries to generate parameterised test based on interface but depending on the class under test, auuto gen PUTs might not be the best way leverage parameterised tests. Overall, there is a learning curve plus the framework will also take some time to mature. Positive side, concept is good and maintaince cost ( if implemented correctly ) and the response time from the team supporting PEX is really positive, sometimes you get helpful answer within 2 hrs on the PEX forum.
