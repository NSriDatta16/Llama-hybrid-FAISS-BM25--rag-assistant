PCA - variables over 10 years for multiple assets

I have 19 technical trading indicator variables over 10 years, for 25 different assets. I am attempting to reduce dimensionality to 2 components. I want to plot all assets on a 2D graph against PC1 and PC2. My questions are: How do I achieve this, considering I have daily time series data? Surely, I must have only one observation per indicator per asset. Should I take the average of the daily data? The indicators are a mix of prices and volumes. Many different ranges. Is it ok to normalise the entire dataset?
