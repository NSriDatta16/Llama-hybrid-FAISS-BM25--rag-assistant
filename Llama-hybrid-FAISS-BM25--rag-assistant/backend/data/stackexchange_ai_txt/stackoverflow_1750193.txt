For storing monetary amounts floating point values are not the way to go. From your description I would probably handle amounts as long integers with as value the monetary amount multiplied by 10^5 as database storage format. You need to be able to handle calculations with amounts that do not loose precision, so here again floating point is not the way to go. If the total sums between debit and credit are off by 1 cent in a ledger, the ledger fails in the eyes of financial people, so make sure your software operates in their problem domain, not yours. If you can not use existing classes for monetary amounts, you need to build your own class that works with amount * 10^5 and formats according to the precision wanted only for input and output purposes.
