It's a bit hard to tell what you need to do. If it's to set one variable based on an XML attribute then the one line approach Hanselman alluded to is the most elegant. MyEnum wt = (MyEnum)Enum.Parse(typeof(MyEnum), xmlNode.Attributes["a"].Value, true); From the brief example you provided it looks like you may need to set the variable based on different XML attributes and if that's the case you may not be able to get around the need for a big if/else block. If you do have a semblance of structure in the XML you are processing it can sometimes be easier to process an XML node as a DataRow. If your XML is all over the place then this approach isn't much good. DataSet xmlDerivedSet = new DataSet(); xmlDerivedSet.ReadXml(xmlFilename); foreach (DataRow row in xmlDerivedSet.Tables[0].Rows) { MyClass xmlDerivedClass = new MyClass(row); }
