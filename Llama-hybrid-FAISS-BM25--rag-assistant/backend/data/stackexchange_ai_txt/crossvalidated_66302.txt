Adding proportions as features to logistic regression

I'm setting up a logistic regression that models a probability $\mathbb{P}_t$ of certain events. The probability is changing over time and I want to add proportions of past observations that estimate this probability. Suppose I have a proportion $q = \frac{\text{#positives}}{\text{#total}}=\frac{b}{c}$ that estimates $\mathbb{P}_t$ if times are relatively close. How do I add it as a feature in a logistic regression model? My guess Because the logistic regression model is $$ \log \frac{p}{1-p} = x \cdot \beta,$$ 1) my intuition says add $\log q$ and $\log(1-q)$. Then our logistic regression model would clearly encompass the baseline model of $p=q$. In the case where the coefficient of $\log q$ is $+1$ and the coefficient of $\log(1-q)$ is $-1$ and other coefficients in $\beta$ are $0$. 2) Another option, remembering that $q=\frac{b}{c}$, is to express \begin{align} \log{q}&= \log{b}-\log{c}\\ \log{1-q}&=\log \frac{c-b}{c}=\log{(c-b)} - \log{c}. \end{align} Here I would be tempted to add $\log{(b + 1)}, \log{(c + 1)}, \log{(c - b + 1)}.$ as features.
