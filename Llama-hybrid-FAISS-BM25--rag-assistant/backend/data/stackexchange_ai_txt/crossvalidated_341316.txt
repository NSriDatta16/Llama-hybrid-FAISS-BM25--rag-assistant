How to Interpret, at the individual level, changes in probability from a logit model run over two periods

I'm trying to understand how to interpret changes in the predicted probability of an individual being classified (by logistic regression). This feels like either something that is fundamentally obvious, or so entirely nuanced I'm naive in thinking it has a general answer. Let's say my first model produces a range of probabilities that individuals are classified A vs not A. Some time later, I run a similar model against the same individuals, but with updated dependent variables/outcomes, and, accordingly, the probabilities change. A particular segment 'S1' might have a probability of say 0.7 in the first model, and it in fact goes to 0.8 in the second. I understand that this can mean that of 100 of these, the net outcome will be 10 more being classified as A; and this is borne out by the underlying data. In segment S2, the probability goes from 0.45 to 0.55 - again of 100, 10 more will be classified as A. So far so simple, I thought, but I get stuck at trying to interpret what happens at the individual level. There is a strong intuition that S2 are more likely to have changed from ~A to A, arising from the probability changing from 0.45 (~A dominant) to 0.55 (A dominant). But in both segments, 10% have changed. Which rejects the intuition... Can anyone help get me out of my confusion? I think I need to look at underlying distributions, but not quite sure.
