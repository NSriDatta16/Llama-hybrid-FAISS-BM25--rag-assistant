The graph is pretty explicit. It is a time series over a 12 month period (X-Axis) that plots the number of weather related crashes that can range from 0 to 4500 in anyone month (Y-Axis). And, it shows that the number of visibility-related crashes are very low ranging from 0 to close to 1,000 (in the 5 month). Meanwhile, the precipitation-related crashes are a lot more numerous ranging from a minimum of 2,000 in the 3d month to 4,500 in the 12 month. What is interesting is that the two trends over time seem to be pretty correlated. You could also construct a scatter plot with one type of accident on one axis and the other on the other axis. And, I am pretty sure you would see a very strong linear relationship between the two.
