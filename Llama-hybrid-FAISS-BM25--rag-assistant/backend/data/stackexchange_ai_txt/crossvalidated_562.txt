When to use multiple models for prediction?

This is a fairly general question: I have typically found that using multiple different models outperforms one model when trying to predict a time series out of sample. Are there any good papers that demonstrate that the combination of models will outperform a single model? Are there any best-practices around combining multiple models? Some references: Hui Zoua, Yuhong Yang "Combining time series models for forecasting" International Journal of Forecasting 20 (2004) 69â€“ 84
