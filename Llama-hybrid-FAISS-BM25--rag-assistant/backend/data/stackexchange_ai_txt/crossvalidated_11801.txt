I would be tempted to use a resampling approach, were in each iteration the presentation of each observation is chosen randomly. That way the data for each model is still i.i.d. and the uncertainty due to the presentation of the observations is taken into account by the averaging over the resampled datasest. You can then look at the distribution of parameter values to get an idea of the importance of the explanatory variables.
