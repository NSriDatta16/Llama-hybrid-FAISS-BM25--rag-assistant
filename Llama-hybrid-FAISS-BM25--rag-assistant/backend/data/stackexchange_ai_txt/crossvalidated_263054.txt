This might deserve to be a comment: One of the reasons I don't understand your question, or in particular your second sentence, is that I'm not sure unimodal is equivalent with non-mixture. I guess it would be nice to think of those as equivalent if the observed random variables were continuous and in particular Gaussian, but also even in that case, I bet if the locations of each of those Gaussians are close enough, or if the weights are in such a configuration, that one of the conditional distributions of the observations could be unimodal, still. Are we talking about the predictive distribution, or some other conditional distribution? And it IS very different because the proportions are changing (this might be more of the answer you're looking for). Assuming a HMM is assuming a model for how the mixing proportions change (the probabilities, the locations, the scales, etc.). You're assuming they are a Markov Chain. A mixture model is a static mixture. A HMM is a dynamic mixture.
