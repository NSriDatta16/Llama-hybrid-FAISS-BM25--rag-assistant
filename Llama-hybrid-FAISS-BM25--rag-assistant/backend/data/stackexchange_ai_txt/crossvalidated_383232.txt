Is it possible to learn which function to fit a regression with?

I need help with modeling data that sometimes has non-linear relationships. I am building a software system that involves modeling cpu responses to application load. ie learn the function $\text{load} = f(\text{cpu})$ . Analyzing the data, I have found that CPU responses vary widely in their underlying relationship to application load across different applications. I have observed the following relationships: CPU is linear and can be modeled with a polynomial (most common case) CPU is logorithmic in relationship to load CPU has a root relationship with load (similar to the above) CPU is exponential, naturally or otherwise Note: Its important to note these are always consistent per application, but may change if the underlying code changes. I am currently using linear regression and I am able to learn the best degree of the polynomial for the model through optimization. But I am stuck on what to do for the non-linear cases (besides simply trying them and taking RMSE). Is there a simple way to determine which functional form is best for the regression? For context, I have the following constraints: The model must be able to extrapolate accurately. This is key as the system involves load projections. This is what makes the functional form important. I am using Golang, so I prefer simplest implementations possible due to immature code ecosystem. (Ie. I am aware I could approach this with a bayesian optimization solution over various models, implementing that would be too time consuming due to the limits Golang scientific ecosystem). I am learning a new model for each application every few minutes, so i'd like performant options if possible. Thanks for your help!
