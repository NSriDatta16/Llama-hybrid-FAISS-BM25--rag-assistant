As noticed by others, accuracy is not the best metric for judging quality of the model. Logistic regression predicts probabilities , so to calculate accuracy you must have used some threshold for making hard classifications. If you used the "default" $p>0.5$ , it is not necessarily an optimal choice . There are many methods for picking the threshold. This is something you could tune. As about the parameters of the model, you already found the optimal parameters given the data, model, and the hyperparameters, so there is nothing to improve further. If the results are not satisfactory, you can tune the hyperparameters, or try different model (either using another model type altogether, such as random-forest , or attempting further refinement of logistic regression, perhaps using a richer set of features).
