Usually you declare a function in yourlibrary.h like extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int __cdecl factorial(int); then create that function in yourlibrary.c: extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int __cdecl factorial(int x) { if(x == 0) return 1; else return x * factorial(x - 1); } After compiling your DLL you get your .dll and .lib files. The latter is used when you want to import your functions to the project. You put #include "yourlibrary.h" and #pragma comment(lib, "yourlibrary.lib") in your project, after this you can use int factorial(int) in you application.
