How to label sentiment using NLP?

I am trying to find the sentiment of tweets using a NLP package. Here is an example of a tweet: @SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk. Here, NLP labels sentiment based on sentence. So, this tweet has three sentences with full-stops. Hence NLP gives me three different sentiment labels for each sentence of tweet. Now, how can I label entire tweet has positive, negative or neutral? Neutral @SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Negative Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Negative Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
