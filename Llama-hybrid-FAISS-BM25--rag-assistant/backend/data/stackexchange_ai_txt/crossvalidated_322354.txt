Comparison statistics for ordered categorical variables

I'm a looking for a counterpart to the Mannâ€“Whitney U statistic for the case where the two samples ( $\hat{F}$ and $\hat{G}$ ) are drawn from discrete ordered distributions (the data can only take one of three values, $\{a, b, c\}:a ). I want to know if $\hat{F}$ is significantly to the left of $\hat{G}$ . I considered ordered logistic regression (on a dummy indicating sample membership) but the data set is huge and this is proving too slow (I used the R package ordinal ). Edit: The distributions from which $\hat{F}$ is drawn is symmetric. That of $\hat{G}$ is right skewed. Edit: In an alternative formulation of the problem, we could obtain two samples ( $\hat{F}$ and $\hat{G}$ ) drawn from discrete distributions taking values in $\{-\infty,\infty\}$ but with typically 90%+ of the pmf at exactly 0. Initially, I am considering using the sign of these measures (which yields the problem above) but any ideas on how to approach the initial problem is welcomed. Edit2 (ttnphns comments): A little of context is necessary. I have to test 331 groups (each against its own baseline, so I have 331 non-paired two samples $\{X_i,Y_i\}_{i=1}^{331}$ where $X_i=\{x_{ij}\}_{j=1}^{n_i}\forall i$ and $Y_i=\{y_{ij}\}_{j=1}^{m_i}\forall i$ ). The proportion of ties and number of observations varies hugely between the 331 groups. The good behavior of the MW test in the presence of zero inflated data has been discussed on this site before . Just to be sure, I ran a permutation test. To do this I just permute (re-sample without replacement) the labels $(i,j)$ among the observations (so that $x_{ij}\rightarrow x_{lk}$ ). Here too, I find that the bootstrapped $z$ scores behaved rather well. However when I plot the 331 $z$ scores from the actual data (not the bootstrapped ones), here is the distribution I obtain: The variance of these scores is much larger than the bootstrapping led me to expect. I am wondering if my bootstrap strategy is the correct one.
