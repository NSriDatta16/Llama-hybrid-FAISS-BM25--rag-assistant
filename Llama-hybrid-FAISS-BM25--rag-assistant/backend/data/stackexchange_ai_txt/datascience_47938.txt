How do I approach learning Data Science/ML the 'rightest' way?

First of all, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this so please do let me know if it isn't and tell me where it should be. I really just don't know where to go with this question. Some backstory: I am going through my 2nd semester of my 2nd year of Software Engineering. I love math, I love computers, I love data and I love image processing so the most logical place for me to be is Data Science because I seem to be gravitating towards ML/CV a lot. Thing is, I want to start learning Data Science/ML but I don't know where to start. Everyone keeps recommending online courses such as Andrew's coursera course but I have become somewhat skeptical of most online courses because they seem to love simplifying info too much that I feel like it just passes the threshold of it being useful info. My assumption is: learning Data Science/ML/CV requires a very strong and rigorous foundation. I shouldn't start learning it with high level tools and little understanding of what makes it what it is. This is my problem. I don't know where to begin learning that way. I searched for books and the two books I found people talking about were: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, by Christopher M. Bishop. This book seemed to be very rigorous with a strong focus on the mathematics and intuition of things (looking at its index). Not much skepticism towards this one. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit & TensorFlow, by Aurelien Geron. This one seems to be extremely popular and almost unanimously praised/liked/recommended by people but just looking at its name I felt a bit skeptical that it might have less focus on building strong foundation/intuition and more focus on using high-level tools. I am open for other suggestions if you think some 3rd book/resource is more adequate for my need. I'd also greatly appreciate it if you briefly explain why you think it is more adequate. Also it's worth noting that I have no problem with high-level tools and I know that I will eventually have to use them. I just feel like I'd be significantly better at what I want to do and valuable if I start from there.
