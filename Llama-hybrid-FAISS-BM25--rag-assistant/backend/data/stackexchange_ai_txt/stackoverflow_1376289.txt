Dumping "real-world" scenarios out for unit testing

I'm currently debugging some fairly complex persistence code, and trying to increase test coverage whilst I'm at it. Some of the bugs I'm finding against the production code require large, and very specific object graphs to reproduce. While technically I could sit and write out buckets of instantiation code in my tests to reproduce the specific scenarios, I'm wondering if there are tools that can do this for me? I guess specifically I'd like to be able to dump out an object as it is in my debugger frame (probably to xml), then use something to load in the XML and create the object graph for unit testing (eg, xStream etc). Can anyone recommend tools or techniques which are useful in this scenario?
