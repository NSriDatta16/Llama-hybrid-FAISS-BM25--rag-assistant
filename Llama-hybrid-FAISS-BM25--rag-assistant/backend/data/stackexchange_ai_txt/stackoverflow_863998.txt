Simple JavaScript drag and drop witout the help of a library

I am simply looking for a way of using drag and drop without jquery or any other library. If a dragged object is dropped on another element the later element should start an event (in FF - better would be browser independent). I know that drag and drop for JavaScript was discussed sometimes before but the previous postings didn't help me. Although I found some examples it is not clear to me if there is a "drop" or "dragdrop" events exist but these things don't work: Text Text How could this be done? Many thanks in advance.
