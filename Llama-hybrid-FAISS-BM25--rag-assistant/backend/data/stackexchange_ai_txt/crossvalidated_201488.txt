Approach to find similarity between two different types of matrices

I'm using the movielens dataset to give recommendations to a user based on genre of the movies. I have two matrices, one contains the genre the user likes. We are considering user3 for now I also have a Matrix where every movie is represented as a row and the columns are the genres. Here, movie 1 belongs to Adventure, 5 belongs to Action and a movie can belong to one or more genres (This is a small subset of all the movies and genres available) Now based on the user's genre preference we want to recommend movies to him/her. How do I go about doing that? I'm new to machine learning and this is a learning exercise. Do I need to compute similarity? The approach I was thinking of was to bind both these matrices and then compute the Jaccard similarity but the results are not so accurate in that case. Something like this, sim_mat I'm using R but I just need a general overview of what kind of approach, I can code it myself. Any insight would be helpful.
