Best I could do. Notice the fleqn option and the minipage environment. If you need this all the time, you'll have to redefine the align environment accordingly. \usepackage{amsmath} \begin{document} Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. \begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth} \begin{align} & R=\frac{P^2}{P+S'} \label{eqn:SCS}\\ &\mbox {where} \quad \mbox R = \mbox {Watershed Runoff} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox P = \mbox{Rainfall} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox S' = \mbox{Storage in the watershed $=\frac{1000}{CN}-10$ }\notag \end{align} \end{minipage} Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. \end{document} EDIT A more elegant and symmetric version: \documentclass[fleqn]{article} \usepackage{amsmath} \makeatletter \setlength\@mathmargin{0pt} \makeatother \begin{document} \noindent Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. The margins of the quotation environment are indented on the left and the right. The text is justified at both margins and there is paragraph indentation. Leaving a blank line between text produces a new paragraph. \begin{quotation} \begin{align} & R=\frac{P^2}{P+S'} \label{eqn:SCS}\\ &\mbox {where} \quad \mbox R = \mbox {Watershed Runoff} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox P = \mbox{Rainfall} \notag\\ &\hspace{0.63in} \mbox S' = \mbox{Storage in the watershed $=\frac{1000}{CN}-10$ }\notag \end{align} \end{quotation} Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
