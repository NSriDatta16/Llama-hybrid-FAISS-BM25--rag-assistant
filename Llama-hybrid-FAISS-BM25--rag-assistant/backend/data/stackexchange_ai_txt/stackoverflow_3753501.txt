Visualize/Edit Business Object's Properties in WPF

I am new in WPF and wondering about business properties visualization approach in WPF. I explain myself: I am a city architect and draw a city plan. My city is a canvas with rectangles, representing houses. I can drag rectangles on the canvas. Now, I need to edit house's properties when I select a house. Is there a WPF way to do it? I mean something like PropertyGrid in Winforms, or sommething similar maybe a "PropertiesPopup" or "propertybar" ) ? I mean, I select an UI element HouseUserControl, but want to display(edit) the associated Business Object House object properties . Any articles or ideas are welcome. Thanks.
