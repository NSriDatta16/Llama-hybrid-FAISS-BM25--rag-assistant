It is impossible to prevent someone to store an image (or other resources) on their computer as others already have mentioned. But another trick to make it harder (impossible for inexperienced people I guess) is to use CSS and background images: The image is now on the background of the block and cannot be dragged or right clicked in order to save it. Using some coding knowledge it is possible to ind out the myimage.gif part, which can be added after the base URL in order download the image and save it. For example if the HTML page is at http://www.example.com/mypage.html the image could be found at http://www.example.com/myimage.gif As I mentioned it is still possible to save the image, but for inexperienced people it is a lot harder. Note : In this example the image is just put in the HTML tag, but with proper use of a CSS file, it is even harder to find for inexperienced people.
