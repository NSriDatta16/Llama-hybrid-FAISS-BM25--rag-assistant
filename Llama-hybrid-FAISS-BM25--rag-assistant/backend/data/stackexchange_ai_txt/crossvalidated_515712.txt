I just noticed that, and edited the explanation on wikipedia you quoted, to reflect the three-variable definition used in the rest of the article. Though, looking around online, many people seem to be using "coskewness" to refer to a property of two random variables. Here's the relationship between the three-variable and two-variable definitions of coskewness: The three-variable definition is the one given on wikipedia: $S(X,Y,Z) = \frac{1}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y\sigma_Z}E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)(Z-\mu_Z)]$ , where $\mu_X$ and $\sigma_X$ refer to the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of $X$ . The two-variable definition is just the same formula, but using the same variable for two of the inputs (i.e. $S(X,X,Y)$ ). I have no idea why anyone would want to restrict attention to this two-variable case, but it seems that it is popular to do so. Note that the three-variable definition of coskewness is symmetric between the three variables, but the two-variable definition of coskewness is not symmetric between its two variables, since $S(X,X,Y)\neq S(X,Y,Y)$ . So any explanation of the two-variable notion of skewness that treats the two variables interchangably, including the one you quoted from wikipedia, is incorrect.
