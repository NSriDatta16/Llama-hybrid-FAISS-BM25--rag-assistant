This is related to this question about TEXT in PostgreSQL , or at least the answer is similar. PostgreSQL stores large columns away from the main table storage: Very long values are also stored in background tables so that they do not interfere with rapid access to shorter column values. So you can expect a TEXT (or BYTEA or large VARCHAR ) column to always be stored away from the main table and something like SELECT id, myval FROM test WHERE id = 12345 will take two seeks to pull both columns off the disk (and more seeks to resolve their locations). If your UPDATEs really are causing your SELECTs to slow down then perhaps you need to review your vacuuming strategy.
