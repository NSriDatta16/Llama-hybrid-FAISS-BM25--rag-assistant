What are the assumptions for applying a quantile regression model?

The question has been asked (one time) on CV before, but the answer is really imprecise and does not really answer the question in my opinion. So: What are the assumptions for estimating a linear regression model via quantile regression? To my understanding (and as several CV users have mentioned), quantile regression does not assume any specific distribution of the error terms - does that mean that, in a time series model, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity do not have to be accounted for? What about the other Gauss-Markov assumptions? I would assume that the assumption of no perfect multicollinearity has to be met when applying quantile regression, but do the parameters have to be linear? The linearity assumption only has to hold for the specific quantile I would assume. Anyways - I do not find any backup for any of my thoughts in the scientific literature and I would appreciate a comprehensive answer. Thank you!
