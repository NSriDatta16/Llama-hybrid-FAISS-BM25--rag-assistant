Where $number_of_voters is the total count of members voted on that specific item, and $rating is the total rating for that specific item. That way the $score can't be higher then 5 (which its out of). However I'm thinking of integrating a voting intensity/force according to the users RPG level (which is a number between 1-8 which gradually can increase - which each member has assigned), so if for example they voted and their RPG level was 1 the average score would'nt be too different from the previous (wouldnt effect it too much) however if it was something like 8 then it would effect it more? (too summarise their RPG level would be considered internally when voting). But not sure how to proceed (how to integrate/implement) without effecting the intial specification (ie. I don't want the score going higher then 5 (want it to be $score
