How do you use classification algorithms in a sentiment analysis?

Classification algorithms (logistic regression, SVM, etc) work on $(x, y)$ data where $y$ is a categorical (often binary) response and $x$ is a multi-variate predictor. How are these algorithms applied to a sentiment analysis problem? I get that $y$ is just a binary response on whether the sentiment is "positive" or "negative", but what are the $x$ variables? Each sentence consists of words, and that's all we have to go by, so is each individual word a possible predictor variable in our model? That does not seem very tractable.
