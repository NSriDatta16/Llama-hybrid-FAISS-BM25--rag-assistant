Really? All-caps? Stackoverflow won't do your homework. Here's something to get you started, though: http://www.csi.ucd.ie/Staff/fcummins/NNcourse/intro.html I used it to learn about neural networks and can attest it's an approachable read. Technically, the correct answer would be "Simply implement a neural network and run the data through it". There's nothing special about this data and any neural network should be able to learn it.
