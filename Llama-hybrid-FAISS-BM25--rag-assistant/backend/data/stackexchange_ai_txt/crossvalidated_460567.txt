How can I combine fully correlated effect sizes and their standard errors?

Let's say that I, for a meta-analysis, have two effect sizes, $ES_1$ and $ES_2$ (begin standardized mean differences) with standard errors, $SE_1$ and $SE_2$ , and that I want to combine these into a single measure (they might for example represent two different outcomes on the same test) with a single standard error, $ES_{combined}$ and $SE_{combined}$ . Further, I assume that they are fully correlated, meaning that the number of effect sizes that I combine should not affect how precise the final effect size is (that is, how narrow its standard error is). I've found some sources claiming that you simply can compute the averages, that is: $ES_{combined}=\frac{ES_1+ES_2}{2}$ and $SE_{combined}=\frac{SE_1+SE_2}{2}$ , but they have not supplied a rationale for this reasoning. How can I do this correctly?
