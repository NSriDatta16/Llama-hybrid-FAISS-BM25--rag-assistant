The utf8 pragma merely tells Perl that your source code is UTF-8 encoded. If you have only used ASCII in your source, you won't have any problems with Perl understanding the source code. You might want to make a branch in your source control just to be safe. :) If you need to deal with UTF-8 data from files, or write UTF-8 to files, you'll need to set the encodings on your filehandles and encode your data as external bits expect it. See, for instance, With a utf8-encoded Perl script, can it open a filename encoded as GB2312? . Check out the Perl documentation that tells you about Unicode: perlunicode perlunifaq perlunitut Also see Juerd's Perl Unicode Advice .
