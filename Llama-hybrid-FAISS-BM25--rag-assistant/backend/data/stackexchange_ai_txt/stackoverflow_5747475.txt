I highly suggest using localStorage for a few reasons: It's supported by modern browsers, INCLUDING IE. You can store up to 5MB of data (10 in IE) where as a cookie is mere 4KBs There's lots of libraries to make this easy. One of the most popular is LawnChair: http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/ This will actually write to multiple places, including cookies, so that data isn't lost easily. Also, as a note, you can't store objects with localStorage, just like you cant with cookies, however you can convert them. For example, if you want to store a Date() don't store it as new Date() store it as: '\'+Date().getTime()+'\' . Same for other objects.
