How did you make your case? Professional and non-condescending is good, but it's just the start. When you're trying to persuade somebody to change, emphasize what's in it for them. Figure out what they want and show them how the new tech can help. Management wants more work done and dollars saved. Managers won't care about wanting newer and better stuff. Try to find cases and studies showing that going to the latest stuff saved X% in money and work. Find or create good estimates of what it's going to cost (not only in tools, but in training, dual development tracks, and the like). Remember that the old stuff will stay around, and you have to have a plan to account for that. Your co-workers need to be told how this is good for them, and that they won't suffer for it. They've got a lot invested in this. They know what they're doing, and they know the code base. Move to a newer system, and they won't know what they're doing, won't know the code base, will be incompetent at first, and may be afraid that they'll become expendable. This is a lot to ask of the average person, and may be too much to ask of some people (like the guy who's three years from retirement). Find out what they don't like about the current system, and show them how the new software can help. Discuss training and be at least upfront about how easy it will be to convert. If you can show them how to do what they usually do in the new system, without worrying about taking advantage of new features, that will help a lot. Emphasize that their knowledge is not just of the code base, but of the business and its requirements. And don't expect to dump the legacy stuff. You'll only be able to introduce new tools when starting a project, and if it's incompatible with the legacy systems it simply won't work. This is difficult, of course, and you might be better off staying a few years and moving to a more modern shop.
