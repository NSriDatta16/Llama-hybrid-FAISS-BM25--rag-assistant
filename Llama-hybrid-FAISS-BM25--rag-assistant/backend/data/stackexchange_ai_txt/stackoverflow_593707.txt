We had a guy on our last time who was very up on all the latest oo jargon, and wanted to try out all the latest trendy design patterns. He did -- and the app took about twice as long as it should have. This company just needed a one-off app, and needed it done quickly. So, although the code was beautiful and elegant, the project failed. Ignorance does suck, especially in a lead. But, I'd be careful before judging someone on their knowledge of the latest trendy technical jargon. Sometimes simple ability to get the job done, or other human factors, can be important too.
