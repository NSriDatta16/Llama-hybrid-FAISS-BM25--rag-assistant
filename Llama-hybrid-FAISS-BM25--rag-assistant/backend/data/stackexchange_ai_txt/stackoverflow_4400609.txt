initial_data fixture management in django

The django projet I'm working on has a ton of initial_data fixture data. It seems by default the only way to have data load automatically is to have a file in your app folder called fixtures , and the file needs to be named initial_data.ext (ext being xml or json or yaml or something). This is really unflexable, I think. I'd rather have a fixtures folder, and then inside that a initial_data folder, and then inside there, one file for each model in that app. Or something to that effect. IS this possible to do in django now? Or maybe some other scheme of better fixture organization.
