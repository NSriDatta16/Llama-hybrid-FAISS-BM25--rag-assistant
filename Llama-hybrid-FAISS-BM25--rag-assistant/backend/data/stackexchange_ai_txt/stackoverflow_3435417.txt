Jquery Drag n Drop Stage

I am trying to create a stage. I have 5 items in a draggable div. There clones will be dragged to 20 droppable areas. I have created 20 boxes of divs with different ids. Means multiple drop able areas. The problem is that I don't have the idea that how can I get id the of the div where the item is dropped and how, I will show that product only in that div. Right now it is displaying all of the items in a single first div. The main problem is that how can we create multiple droppable areas dynamically and drop an item in that specific area. Thanks in Advance
