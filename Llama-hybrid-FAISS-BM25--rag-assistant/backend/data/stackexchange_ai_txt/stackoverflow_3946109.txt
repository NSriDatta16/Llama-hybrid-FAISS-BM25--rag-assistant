creating a legend within for loop for Matlab plot

I want to plot several curves, each having a different length. So, I've placed each curve as an array in a cell index, Y (this allows me to index through arrays of different sizes inside a FOR loop). I use "hold all" below to enable each iteration of the FOR loop to plot each new array in the cell array Y inside the same plot. hold all; for i = 1:1:length(maxusers) time = increment*(0:1:length(Y{i})-1); plot(time,Y{i,1,:}); end While the use of a cell array here does simplify plotting the various curves inside Y, the problem I'm having is creating legend. Currently I'm using a really long/ugly switch statement to cover every possible scenario, but I think there should be a more elegant solution. If I have an array (where maxusers=4, for example) that is: filesize = [10 100 200 300]; I know the legend Matlab command that works is: legend(num2str(filesize(1)),num2str(filesize(2)),num2str(filesize(3)),num2str(filesize(4))); but I get stuck trying to create a legend command when the number of curves is a variable given by maxusers. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
