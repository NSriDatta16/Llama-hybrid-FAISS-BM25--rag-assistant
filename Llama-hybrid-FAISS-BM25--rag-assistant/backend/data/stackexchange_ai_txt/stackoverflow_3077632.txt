classpath question, head first servlets book

I'm studying via Head First's Servlets and JSPs, and doing the assignment on the third chapter. On page 81, there's this javac call: > %javac -classpath /Users/bert/Applications2/tomcat/common/lib/ servlet-api.jar:classes:. -d classes src/com/example/web/BeerSelect.java I don't get what it's trying to do. The book says that everything on the path before common should be suited for my specific system, but I don't have a common/lib path (not that I know of). I'm working on ubuntu 9 and I have created the following directory structures for deployment and developing of the web app that the chapter talks about, neither of them has a common/lib/ path on them. Where can I find this on my machine?
