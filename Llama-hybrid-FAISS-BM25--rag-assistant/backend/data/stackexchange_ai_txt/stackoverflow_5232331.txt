Why not allocate storage for one frame at a time until the OS fails to allocate memory? This way, you don't need to bother of 32 vs. 64 bit or shared memory. The only price is an extra indirection. The point is, there is not really a good and platform-independent way to determine the size of the largest block that the operating system can give you (it depends on a lot of factors ... virtual address space fragmentation, amount of physical memory available (including swapspace) , quota).
