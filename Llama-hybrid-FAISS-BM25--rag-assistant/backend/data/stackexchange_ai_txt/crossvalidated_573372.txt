If you are not interested in within-person factors, it does not make much sense to use the repeated measures of individuals. Your coefficients in a mixed model would be a mixture of within- and between-individual effects for the variables that change within individuals during the panel. If you are purely interested in between-individual attributes and are essentially assuming that observations are static, you might consider taking the average or median values per person of non-missing observations over the period (na.rm = TRUE). This would solve your missing data problem, as well. You would have the option to include each person's lowest, highest, and mean value if that is something of interest for your research question.
