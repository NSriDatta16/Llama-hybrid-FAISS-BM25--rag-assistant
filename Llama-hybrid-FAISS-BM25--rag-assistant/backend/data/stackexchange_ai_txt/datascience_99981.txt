finding the defect button

In case of a project where you are going to detect whether the image printed on a button is correct or not and given that you have only a one correct possibility of a correct image and some incorrect ones, do I need deep learning for such a project ? If yes what type of problem do you classify it? (should I use image segmentation? Does image segmentation work when you have letters printed on buttons?)
