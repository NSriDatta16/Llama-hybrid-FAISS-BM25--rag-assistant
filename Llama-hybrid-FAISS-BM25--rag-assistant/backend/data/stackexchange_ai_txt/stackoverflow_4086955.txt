Afaik, you need to use a Content Delivery Platform of a GSM provider for this. I remember researching this a couple years back when mobile content, especially ringtones, had been all the rage. Things might have changed since then (especially with phones having WiFi access), but you had to have a contract with someone that actually has access to the GSM network to send the mobile content to cellphones. You'd then use this providers API to manage your content and to send it to devices. For instance for the german Deutsche Telekom, there is a Zend_Service package that allows you to use some of their telecommunication services (for a charge). This particular one doesn't allow sending of digital content like MMS or MP3s, but it might given you an idea what to look for. Edit: try googling for MMS Gateway and check with your country's GSM providers
