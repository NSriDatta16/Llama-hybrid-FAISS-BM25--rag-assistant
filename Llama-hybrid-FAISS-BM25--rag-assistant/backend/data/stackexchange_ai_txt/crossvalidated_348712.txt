Comparing logistic regression coefficients across similar models

I have a bunch of control demographic variables (collectively termed D) and a dependent variable of interest (y). I also have quite a few independent variables of interest (x i ). Goal: I want to check which x has the strongest relationship with y. If I were to run a total of n logistic regressions, n=total number of x, in the following manner: y = ax i + bD I would get a total of n coefficients for each of the x variables. Aside from the x variable, all of the other variables are the same across models. Question: Would it be possible for me to compare the magnitudes of the x coefficients across models? That is, if the coefficient for x 1 in its model is larger than x 2 's, could I say that the former has a stronger relationship with y than the latter, barring any confounding variables that are unaccounted for in the model? If not, is there a better way to accomplish my goal stated above? Thanks for the help!
