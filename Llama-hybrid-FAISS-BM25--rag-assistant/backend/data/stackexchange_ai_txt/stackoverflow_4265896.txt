You can enable SSRS reports to trigger and show data from SSIS packages - see details here - but note the dire warnings about lack of support and this feature not being production-ready. Another way ot approach this is to use SSRS to trigger SSIS indirectly - I've done similar things in the past using SSRS to trigger SQL Agent jobs (which can in turn trigger SSIS packages) but that was for packages which didn't require run-time parameters.
