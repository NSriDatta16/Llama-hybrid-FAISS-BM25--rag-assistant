This is a bit hard to say without knowing what data you are trying to get. Political opinion? wealth? This being said, the answer is, no, I do not think using the data from last year as a prior is appropiate. One of the main problems, is that you won't have independence, you will ask the same people again. Bayessian statistics does assume that you update your prior with new, indenpendent data. That should answer 1 and 2 as well, since with 50% polled each year you can still roughly estimate that half your populations is polled in both years. Now to the third questions: Ignoring time is not a good idea as well, since it will lead to your model assumption being wrong if you do not include it in an appropiate form. This does not depend on the frequentist or bayesian framework If you could track individuals over the census each year, you might be able to build some very nice models including individual variations and time, but this again depends on what you are trying to model/analyse. However, this is usually not possible due to data confidentially, at least when looking at an entire populations. To conclude: It would be wrong to include the same person twice, unless you actually model that. Hierachical models can do so. This is true for both the Bayesian and the Frequentist approach. In both cases that means you shouldn't pool your data for an analysis, and in the Bayesian case the same person should not influence both the data and your prior. Again, unless you actually model individual persons. It also wrong to pool a clearly time-dependent variable over different years, without modelling the influence if time. This is also true for both Bayesian and Frequentist data. What you might do, with the appropiate discussion, is to choose a prior which is sort of loosely modelled after last year's data, if you start with last's years mean, estimate the largest plausible change in a year with expert knowledge and use that to build your prior. This will usually result in a prior similar in form to last year's posterior distribution, but with a much more wide shape. However, if you talk about surveying entire populations, your data should always dominate any reasonable choosen prior. Last's year posterior is not a reasonable choosen prior, because it will be too tightly focussed on a particular choice.
