Linear regression or mixed effects models for data with two time points?

I have a dataset in which individuals were assessed at two time points during the study on a cognitive test, as such I was wondering which statistical model would be more appropriate for my data, either linear regression or mixed effects models? The average length of follow up for my data is 59 months with a standard deviation of 43.03 (range is 0.63-167 months) with 88 (33%) of people having data for only one time point. For linear regression, the approach I was thinking utilising was taking the delta of the test score between the two time points and regressing that against time (months between test scores). If I used mixed effects models, the main issue I have is how to handle individuals who have only wave of data? While I know mixed effects models are especially robust in regards to the analysis of unbalanced data, would 33% missingnes cause issues? Just sample R code highlighting the output using either linear regression or mixed models. fm1 |t|) (Intercept) -2.74185 2.20667 -1.243 0.216 mmse_months_between -0.01768 0.03051 -0.579 0.563 ORgrs_apoe 0.35163 1.17782 0.299 0.766 mmse_months_between:ORgrs_apoe -0.01973 0.01748 -1.129 0.261 Residual standard error: 7.3 on 170 degrees of freedom (88 observations deleted due to missingness) Multiple R-squared: 0.08481, Adjusted R-squared: 0.06866 F-statistic: 5.251 on 3 and 170 DF, p-value: 0.001725 Num. obs. 174 fm2 Thanks.
