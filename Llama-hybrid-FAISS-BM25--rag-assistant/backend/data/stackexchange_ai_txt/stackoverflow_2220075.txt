Problem with nested jQuery sortables

Here's the basic HTML structure for my page: Root element Level One a Level One b Level One parent Level Two a Level Two parent Level Three a Level Three b Level Two b Level One c eg: Root element Level One a Level One b Level One parent Level Two a Level Two parent Level Three a Level Three b Level Two b Level One c There could be any number of items at each indentation level past the root, but there will only ever be 3 levels, and only one parent per level (ie: there's always exactly 3 s under the root, but the number of s is variable). I'm allowing the user to reorder this structure using the jQuery UI Sortable plugin. To add a new item, there are three groups of items (level one items, level two items, level 3 items) which sit adjacent on the page to this tree. The user can drag from there into the list to add it - but it must be added at the corresponding level. I have this working already using draggable with the connectToSortable option: $('ul.availableItems').each(function(i) { var selector = "#selectedItemsTop > ul"; for (var j = 0; j li > ul"; } // eg: selector == "#selectedItemsTop > ul > li > ul" // eg: selector == "#selectedItemsTop > ul > li > ul > li > ul" // eg: selector == "#selectedItemsTop > ul > li > ul > li > ul > li > ul" $(this) .find('li') .draggable({ connectToSortable : selector }) ; }); $('#selectedFieldsTop > ul > li ul').sortable(); As I said, this works... in everything except IE. The level one items work perfectly, however no level 2 or 3 items will be added into the sortable. Trying to sort one of the Level 2 or 3 items which are already there makes it pick up the entire "Level One Parent" li and move the whole thing around. Is there anything you could think of that would make this work in Firefox but not IE? Could you think of a different way to handle this? Versions: Firefox 3.6, IE7, jQuery 1.3.2, jQuery UI 1.7.2 Update : Here's the working code on JSBin: http://jsbin.com/ixabo/edit -- Unsurprisingly, it doesn't work in IE, but I think that's a problem with JSBin ("_console is undefined"). To see it half-working, perhaps copy/paste into a local file and open it in IE.
