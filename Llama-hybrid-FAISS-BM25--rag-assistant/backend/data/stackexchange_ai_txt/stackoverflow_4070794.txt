You might want to read http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html and then http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html and understand that the best you can do is probe what the user tells you is the browser they are using (this would be the User_Agent). You can never say with 100% certainty that they are using a given browser, because you have to rely on what is transmitted from the browser and it can be overriden at many points. However, the quirksmode.org solution is usually the best way to deal with a single check across all engines and browsers. Are you using a particular javascript framework that could allow you to more accurately determine what they're using? What serverside language are you using? (and as somebody else asked, why Safari only?)
