Loss first decreases and then increases

I am using pre-trained xlnet-base-cased model and training it further on real vs fake news detection dataset. I noticed a trend in accuracy for first epoch. Accuracy increases till some point (approximately half) of first epoch and then decreases. Loss also first decreases and then increases rapidly (it is not Nan). What can be reason of this trend ? I noticed same trend when I tried to run it with roberta-base . But any such trend was not noticed when I trained with distilbert , accuracy goes on increasing in this case. Here is graph for accuracy VS steps: [EDIT] File containing running output of the model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5AWftyHTLf5sqtgWnQm_4lqB84UrJex/view?usp=sharing
