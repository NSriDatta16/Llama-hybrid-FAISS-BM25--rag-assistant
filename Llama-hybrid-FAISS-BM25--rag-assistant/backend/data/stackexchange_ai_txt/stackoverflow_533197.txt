definitely you have to start by turning your 'list of keywords' field into a real tagging scheme. the easiest one is a table of tags, and a 'Many-to-Many' relationship with the image table (that is, a third table where each record has a foreign key to an image and another foreign key to a keyword). it makes real fast to find all images with a certain set of keywords. the bayesian filter to detect restriction phrasing, is interesting. i'd say go for it, unless you're pressed for time. if that's the case, a few simple pattern matching should pick up more than 90-95% of cases, and the rest could be quickly finished by hand by a couple of operators.
