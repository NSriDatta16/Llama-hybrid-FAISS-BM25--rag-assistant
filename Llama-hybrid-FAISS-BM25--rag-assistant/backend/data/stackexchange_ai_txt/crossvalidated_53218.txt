I can't exactly define what you ask in this question. However, I have two hypothesis. Why do we use Gaussian prior for Bayesian linear regression? We use this prior as convenient one and one that has nice interpretation. Really, it is a quadratic penalty for parameters values. Why do we use Gaussian process as a model for the data? Realizations of Gaussian processes with a proper covariance function can provide nearly all functions we can encounter in "real life". Also, they are convenient and provide exact inference and marginal distribution.
