You might want to check out CloudIQ Storage from Appistry. (They have closed shop.) It allows you to take the drives in commodity based machines (linux or windows) and have them appear as a single namespace accessible via a REST based API. When you write files to the system, you can define the number of copies you want saved. So if you had 5 machines in your distributed system, you could specify that a file be saved on 2 or 3 (or N) machines for redundancy. If a machine/hard drive crashes, its not an issue, because other machines hold copies of those files. Check out the Downloads and Community links for a trial version as well as documentation.
