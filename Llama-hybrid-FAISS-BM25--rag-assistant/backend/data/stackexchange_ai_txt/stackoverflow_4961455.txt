What is your recommended PHP/MySQL user registration system?

I am looking for a turn-key, reliable and secure user registration system. It must be PHP/MySQL. I would like to have features such as "remember me", password retrieval and email validation. Does such a script exist? I have been trying to write one, but I am a newby and think that if I could see how one works, then it would help me learn.
