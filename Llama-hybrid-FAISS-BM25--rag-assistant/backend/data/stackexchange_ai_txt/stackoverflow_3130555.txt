I am not using any Web Services, for this. I have simply used the following methods meant specifically for the Bundled Products, which are:- setBundleOptionsData() setBundleSelectionsData() setCanSaveBundleSelections(true) For the first method, the details of the Bundle Options are provided to the method as the parameter in the form of an array. Similarly, for the second method "setBundleSelectionsData()", we are providing the details of the Bundle Selections to this method as the parameter in the form of an array. This is the main logic in what goes through for adding any Bundled Product in Magento. Hope this helps to any newbies!!! Please check this link for more details on Bundle Product creation in a proper way.
