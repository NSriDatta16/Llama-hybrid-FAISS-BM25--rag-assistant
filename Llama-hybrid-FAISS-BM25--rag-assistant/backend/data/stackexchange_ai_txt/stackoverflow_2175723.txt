Map SVN users to Redmine users

We are starting to use Redmine as our task tracking tool and for some reason we can't have the same SVN and Redmine user logins. How can we map SVN user names to Redmine user names via configuration files or something else? As all commits now are being performed by Anonymous, we can't track who was the committer for the revision. Any ideas how we could fix this? ADD: In fact there is a paragraph in Redmine wiki about user mapping configuration, but it's empty now. You can find it at the bottom of http://redmine.org/wiki/1/RedmineRepositories
