try/catch really should be avoided in all but the most extreme cases. Apple have a great API for handling situations where known errors will occur by usually including an NSError parameter in the message invocation or delegate callback. try/catch are not the usual mechanism for error handling but are used in extreme situations where you will usually abort your app anyway. I would encourage you to rethink your application design and use the standard means of error handling before resorting to try/catch.
