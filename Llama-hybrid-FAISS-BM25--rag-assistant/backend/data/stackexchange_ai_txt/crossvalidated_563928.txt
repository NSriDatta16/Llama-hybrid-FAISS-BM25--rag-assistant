How to represent experiment with multiple treatment levels and random effects?

I have an experiment where I used $n$ participations from $k$ schools. Each participoant was assigned to Treatment 1, Treatment 2, or control. And I measured whether each participant got a question right (0 or 1). I want to measure the effect of being in any of the two treatment groups, as well as the effect of each treatment group. So how would I write this as a logistic regression with random effects for school? I think it is: $$logit(y_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 I(Treat1{i}) + \beta_2 I(Treat2{i}) + \epsilon_{ij}$$ for participant $i$ from school $j$ . Then: What coefficient would represent the effect of treatment 1 vs control? I think $\beta_1$ What coefficient would represent the effect of treatment 2 vs control? I think $\beta_2$
