QRubberBand like feature - Static selection area

I'm trying to draw a selection area on top of the desktop/opened windows, which works well by using QRubberBand , but seeing as it does not have a stylesheet command, how would I be able to change the color and width of the border and making the inside of it completely transparent? Edit: Is there a similar method to use than QRubberBand in Qt? Changing the painter methods gives a lot of problems (border is one pixel larger on the left and top than right and bottom, the marked area seems not to be able to be completely transparent). Edit2: The area it will cover is static, not something that is dragged by the user. Edit3: class CustomRubberBand : public QRubberBand { public: CustomRubberBand(Shape s, QWidget * p = 0) : QRubberBand(s, p) { } protected: void paintEvent(QPaintEvent *pe) { Q_UNUSED(pe); QPainter painter; QPen pen(Qt::red, 6); pen.setStyle(Qt::SolidLine); painter.begin(this); painter.setPen(pen); painter.drawRect(pe->rect()); painter.end(); } }; This gives me the border around it that I want, but I haven't found anything about removing the background (completely transparent) that works... Seems like there is a problem with Vista and Qt with this. Any tips on how to remove the background? Right now with no painting method for it it is a semi-transparent white background instead of the default blue one. Edit4: This shows the problem: Visible background error notice how the background, with the border, is a semi transparent white. The paint method I'm using does not draw this but only the border. I want it to be completely invisible, and setting the opacity for the object will also make the border transparent, which it should not be.
