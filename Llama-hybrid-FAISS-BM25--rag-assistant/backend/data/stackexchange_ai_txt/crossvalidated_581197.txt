If you have a satisfactory control and experiment group, you could use the " Difference in differences " approach. But you have to ascertain whether the stores you are comparing are in fact similar. The differences could be due to other factors as well. You could look into the " Segmented Regression of Interrupted Time Series " approach. Your regression under this approach will be: Transaction volume = a + B1(time) + B2(SCO) + B3(time after SCO) + e where, The "time" variable represents the time period of observation. It accounts for any trend in the data. The "SCO" variable takes the value of "0" before SCO is introduced and "1" after SCO is introduced. It will account for the immediate effect on the dependent variable. The "time after SCO" variable represents the time periods after the intervention. It will count the time periods after SCO is introduced. It will show how the effects of SCO evolve over time. For this to work well, the trend in your data must be linear. This is the basic idea and layout, you can add any control variables that you need.
