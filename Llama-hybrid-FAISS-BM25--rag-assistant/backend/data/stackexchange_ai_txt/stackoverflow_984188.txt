The most elegant solution I've ever seen was done by Torkel Ã–degaard over at http://www.codinginstinct.com/ using ViewModel inheritance. It includes a great fluent interface for adding/manipulating tabs. Now his view code is using the Spark view engine but you could easily implement it in the WebForm view engine. http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/10/view-model-inheritance.html
