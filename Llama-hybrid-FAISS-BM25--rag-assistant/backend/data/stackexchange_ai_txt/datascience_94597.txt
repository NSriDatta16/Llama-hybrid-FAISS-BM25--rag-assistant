I think I found what I had in mind at the time. The book Machine Learning Engineering by Andriy Burkov (very good book overall) gives a list of problems that cannot be solved with ML or in other words, some practical limitations of ML. The book being accessible on a “read first, buy later” principle (see here) I copy paste the interesting part: Chapter 1.5 When not to use Machine Learning. There are plenty of problems that cannot be solved using machine learning; it’s hard tocharacterize all of them. Here we only consider several hints.You probably should not use machine learning when: every action of the system or a decision made by it must be explainable, every change in the system’s behavior compared to its past behavior in a similarsituation must be explainable, the cost of an error made by the system is too high, you want to get to the market as fast as possible, getting the right data is too hard or impossible, you can solve the problem using traditional software development at a lower cost, a simple heuristic would work reasonably well, the phenomenon has too many outcomes while you cannot get a sufficient amount ofexamples to represent them (like in video games or word processing software), you build a system that will not have to be improved frequently over time, you can manually fill an exhaustive lookup table by providing the expected outputfor any input (that is, the number of possible input values is not too large, or gettingoutputs is fast and cheap).
