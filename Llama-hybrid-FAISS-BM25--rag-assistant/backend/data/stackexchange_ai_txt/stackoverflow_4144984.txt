I think they will be Z-Fighting , if they have the exact same values for x y and z. About blending: This is separate from the programmable pipeline, so you don't have to do most of the work in the shaders for it. First enable blending with glEnable(GL_BLEND) , then specify your desired blending function with glBlendFunc , most commonly glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) . Now the vertices only need an alpha value set at gl_FragColor.a and their color will blend.
