(Feature Selection) different results from L2-based and Tree-based

I am doing feature selection using Sklearn: Tree-based feature selection : RandomForestClassifier.feature_importances_ L2-based feature selection: LogisticRegression.coef_ Target variable is binary classes. The training set is standardized. How should I interpret when a certain feature shows significant importance in Random Forest estimator, but negative coefficient in Logistic Regression?
