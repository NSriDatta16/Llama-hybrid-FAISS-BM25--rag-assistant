Try to reproduce the problem locally so you can use a tool like JProfiler to debug it. Even if you can't force an OOM locally, chances are you'll see the memory increase in JProfiler. Then you take snapshots and look for classes that aren't being garbage collected. It's not an exact science, but it's much easier than looking through an IBM heapdump. However, if you have to, the old way of examining a heap dump was with HeapRoots. It may depend on the version you're on. I do know that some versions of the IBM JDK have problems with compacting so even if you have plenty of memory, you can get an OOM because there's not a large enough fragment available.
