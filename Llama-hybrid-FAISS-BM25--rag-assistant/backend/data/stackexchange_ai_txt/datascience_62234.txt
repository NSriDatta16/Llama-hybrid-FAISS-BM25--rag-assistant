opening Weka from command line

I'm very new to computer coding and data science in general. I'm trying to open Weka and use it on a practice csv data set called weather.arff. The manual I have says to type this into command line: java weka.classifiers.j48.J48 -t weather.arff When I open the command line it goes to C:\User\Admin When I type in the above on command line it gives me message Error: Could not find or load main class weka.classifiers.j48.J48 Might someone give me some advice on how to proceed to make the command line work. Thank you
