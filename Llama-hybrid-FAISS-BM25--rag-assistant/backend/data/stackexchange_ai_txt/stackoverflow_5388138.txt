How shall empty XML elements be handled?

I'm not this familiar with XML so maybe you're able to help me :-) Let's say we have a very simple XML document like this one: John Doe So, apparently John Doe does not have a middle name. In an xsd file this element is defined as optional with minOccurs=0. Are there any rules, standards, best practices or whatsoever that define how to handle this empty element? If minOccurs=0 is defined for an element, shall it be removed? Empty elements have, in my opinion, no use except if attributes are used along with that element. Thanks, Robert
