Python Tkinter Help Menu

I have a paragraph of help information that I would like to display in a window with an "ok" button at the bottom. My issue is formatting...I want to be able to simply set the paragraph equal to a variable and then send that variable to a message box widget. By default, it formats laterally and in a very ugly manner. Any advice? def aboutF(): win = Toplevel() win.title("About") about = "Top/bottom 3 - Reports only the top/bottom 3 rows for a param you will later specify.\ Set noise threshold - Filters results with deltas below the specified noise threshold in ps.\ Sort output - Sorts by test,pre,post,unit,delta,abs(delta).\ Top 2 IDD2P/IDD6 registers - Reports only the top 2 IDD2P/IDD6 registers.\ Only critical registers - Reports only critical registers.\ Use tilda output format - Converts the output file from csv to tilda.\ Use html output format - Converts the output file from csv to html." Label(win, text=about, width=100, height=10).pack() Button(win, text='OK', command=win.destroy).pack()
