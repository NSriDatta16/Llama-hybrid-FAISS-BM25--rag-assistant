The user wants to automate/synthesize ( not look at ) the information in the autocorrelation function. This is precisely what AUTOBOX ( a piece of software that I have helped to develop) does. Pattern recognition requires carefully honed heuristics used iteratively. I would suggest that you create a set of time series via simulation ( including outliers) and test them with the free version of AUTOBOX and study the results as interim steps are fully disclosed. In this way you might be able to program/reproduce the results. There is no simple procedure that can be used because it all depends on the sample size , the impact of anomalies . the impact of level shifts , the impact of seasonal pulses , the impact of local time trends , the impact of parameters changing over time , the impact of non-constant errors variance , non-seasonal ARMA structure .. to name a few of the considerations.
