Central Limit Theorem, what does it really say?

I know that the Central Limit Theorem states that if a random sample of size $n$ is drawn from iid random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, then the variable $$ Z = \frac{\hat x - E(X) }{{\rm sd}(\hat x)}\text{ is }\mathcal N(0,1) $$ as $n$ is big enough (where $\hat x$ denotes the sample average). My question is: What about $\hat x$, does it also converge to a normal distribution?
