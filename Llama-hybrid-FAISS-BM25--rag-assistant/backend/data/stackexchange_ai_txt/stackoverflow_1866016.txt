Oracle supports a number of ways of using an index, and you ought to start by understanding all of them so have a quick read here: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/optimops.htm#sthref973 Your query select * from table where col2=12 could usefully leverage an index skip scan if the leading column is of very low cardinality, or a fast full index scan if it is not. These would probably be fine for running reports, however for an OLTP query it is likely that you would do better to create an index with col2 as the leading column.
