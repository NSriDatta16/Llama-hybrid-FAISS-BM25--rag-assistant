If you need the basic idea then it will be like this. A flag should be set when the mousedown occurs. If the flag is set and mousemove occurs then change the position of the div according to the mouse position. Unset the flag when mouseup occurs. From this I don't think it is much harder to develop one. If you need one based on a framework then this one will help you. Using jQuery Draggable $("#modaldiv").draggable(); will make the div draggable.
