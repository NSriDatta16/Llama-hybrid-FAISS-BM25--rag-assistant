Embedding QT application in Eclipse/RCP framework

I'm trying to embed my working QT application in Eclipse RCP framework(might not sound wise but i need to do this). I'm using QT 4.5 (not yet explored what QTJambi is all about and has to offer) I convert my existing application as a dll and load it through eclipse application. Things dont work as they should as the QTApplication loop sits listening for events, and there is a good mismatch of events. Certain UI objects dont get the events. If I comment my Qppliaction::exec(), then the behaviour in QT app changes. Is there a way to achieve what I'm trying to achieve?? Thanks
