Here's a simple answer based on Zachary's comment. However, for larger datasets ( dim(data1)[1] ) it isn't efficient and plus it doesn't simply permute the dataset once via sample and then split it into arbitrarily sized samples, which was the elegant logic of the original post I cited above. #data1 desired output is this list rand.samp histogram of random sequence lengths hist(log10(unlist(lapply(rand.samp, length))), breaks = 100)
