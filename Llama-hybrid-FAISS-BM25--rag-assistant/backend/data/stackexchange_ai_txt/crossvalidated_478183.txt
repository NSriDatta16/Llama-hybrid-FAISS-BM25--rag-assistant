Comparing coefficients in logistic regression with curvilinear effects

Iâ€™m conducting a multiple logistic regression with 3 predictors ( x , y and z ). A Box-Tidwell test suggested that the relation between x and the dependent variable is not linear on the logit, so I have added the squared term ( x ^2) to the equation. All the coefficients are statistically significant, but my question is: how can I compare the relative impact of each predictor, now that x does not have a single coefficient (or odds ratio), but two? Thanks!
