What's the most elegant way to retrieve a MySQL table comment?

I'm trying to programmatically retrieve the comment for a MySQL table. The first method suggested to me was: $shown = $db->query('show create table ' . TABLE_NAME)->fetch_row(); preg_match("/COMMENT='(.*)'/", $shown[0], $m); $comment = $m[1]; But that kind of workaround makes me cringe. I stumbled upon another way: $result = $db->query("select table_comment from information_schema.tables where table_schema = '" . DATABASE_NAME . "' and table_name = '" TABLE_NAME '\'')->fetch_row(); $comment = $result[0]; It's a little better (no string parsing), but it still makes me uncomfortable because I'm digging into internal structures where I don't feel like I belong. Is there a nice, simple way to get at the table comment in code?
