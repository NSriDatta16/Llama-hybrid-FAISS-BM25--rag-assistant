Well, that doesn't look good. It is the result of a Windows security problem. This would not normally fail, the coclass lives in c:\windows\system32\quartz.dll. There are many possible operations that could cause the failure, including having trouble reading the registry and loading the DLL. Perhaps the best way to troubleshoot it is to use SysInternals' ProcMon and observe your program's actions. Pay attention to the Result column, you should see the error there. This ought to get you closer to finding out what security configuration problem might be the source.
