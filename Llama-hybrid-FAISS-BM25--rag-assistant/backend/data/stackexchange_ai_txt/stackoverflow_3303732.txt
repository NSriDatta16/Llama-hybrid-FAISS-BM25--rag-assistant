enumerate is trivial, and so is re-implementing it to accept a start: def enumerate(iterable, start = 0): n = start for i in iterable: yield n, i n += 1 Note that this doesn't break code using enumerate without start argument. Alternatively, this oneliner may be more elegant and possibly faster, but breaks other uses of enumerate: enumerate = ((index+1, item) for index, item) The latter was pure nonsense. @Duncan got the wrapper right.
