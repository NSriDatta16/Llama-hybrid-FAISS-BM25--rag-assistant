The federated storage engine offers something similar to the feature you asked for. And if your databases are on the same database server, the federated storage enging sounds a bit like an overkill to me. You may want to create a view instead. Both methods won't be useful if db1 is not available. As Emmerman already points out, you need to store the data in db2 if you want to prepare for the case of db1 being unavailable.
