Organizing Div's, css box model

So I'm putting a few boxes in my footer and right off the bat when I use margins to move them around they are moving the whole footer around as well. Anyone know what I am doing wrong? The site: http://cowgirlsbaking.com/ ---php--- ---The css for the two divs--- #footernavlinks { clear: both; margin:10px 0 0 25px; width: 300px; height: 250px; background-image:url('http://cowgirlsbaking.com/wp-content/themes/autumn-leaves/images/footblockback.png'); } #footnav { background-color: #EB7CDB; height: 500px; width: 100%; }
