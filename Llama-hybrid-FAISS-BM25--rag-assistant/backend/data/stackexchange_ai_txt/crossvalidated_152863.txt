After each tree is grown, the values of a given predictor are randomly permuted in the out-of-bag sample (the one third of unique observations that are not part of the bootstrap sample) and the prediction error of the tree on the modified OOB sample is compared with the prediction error of the tree on the untouched OOB sample. This process is repeated for all input variables, and averaged over all trees. Finally, variables are given scores proportional to the overall decrease in accuracy that their permutation induced. The most important variables are the ones leading to the greatest losses in accuracy when “noised-up” (see Breiman 2001 ). In short, you do have independent samples at the tree level . The importance of a given variable is first computed at the tree level, and the scores are aggregated over all trees to obtain the final, global importance score for the variable.
