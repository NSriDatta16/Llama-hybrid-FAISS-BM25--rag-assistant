Comparing text corpora sentence-wise in Python

I have two corpora (in the form of list of sentences); one is the "original" one, the other is a version of it with some minor changes (with contractions expaned, for instance): s1 = ['He's a real stupid', 'There's no need to worry', 'All right, my friends'] s2 = ['He is a real stupid', 'There is no need to worry', 'All right, my friends'] I'd like to get some rendering of the corresponding sentence pairs where IS some difference between the sentences. Is there any elegant solution to this?
