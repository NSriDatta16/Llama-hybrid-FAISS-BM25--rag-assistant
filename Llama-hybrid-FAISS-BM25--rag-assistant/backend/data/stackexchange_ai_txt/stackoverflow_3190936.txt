The C510 browser is NetFront 3.4. This is definitely from the old school of browsers, back before vendors considered it useful to provide documentation on what was supported, or debugging tools. With NetFront, like other older mobile browsers, you really have to work up incrementally testing features as you go, because some of what we would today consider basic JavaScript (never mind DOM) is broken, and when something goes wrong you have little affordance to work out what it was. jQuery is a complex beast that takes a few liberties with what JS and DOM allow. I would not expect it to work on mobile browsers prior to the current crop of smartphones (WinMo 6.1.4+, iPhone, Android etc). Sorry.
