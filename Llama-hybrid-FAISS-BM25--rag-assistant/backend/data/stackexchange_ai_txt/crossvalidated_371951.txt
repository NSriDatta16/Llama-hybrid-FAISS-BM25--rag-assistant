1) You can use a time-window for your categorical variables; take not only the features of sample at time t, also take t-1, t-2,..... t-n samples as for each training sample. For example, if you have 12 features for each sample and you want your model to seek for possible patterns from 30 samples from the past, you should have 480 features for each sample at time t for your training, validation or test set. Categorical features are usually better than numeric ones on such tasks, so you seem to be safe. 2) From the time stamp data; you can extract useful features such as hour, day, month, year, week of the month, day of the week, whether it is daytime or whether it is a business day(weekend etc.) Those categorical features work usually great with time-sequence machine learning models. Hope I could help.
