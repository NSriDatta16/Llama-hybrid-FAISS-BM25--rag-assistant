I wouldn't use the ternary operator in this way at all. Use the ternary operator when you need the whole expression to return a value, not as a substitute for logical code constructs. For example: if (true) { $w = 100; $r = 200; } else { $w = 300; $r = 400; } var_dump($w); var_dump($r); Advantages of using if/else construct: Easier to read, easier to maintain, easier to debug. Easier to add more steps inside each conditional block if the need arises. If you run tests using code coverage tools, you get a more accurate view of which code paths are being tested when all your code isn't on one line. You don't have to post a question to Stack Overflow to get it working! Advantages of using ternary operator: Uses fewer curly-braces and semicolons, in case you're running out of them or can't find them on your keyboard.
