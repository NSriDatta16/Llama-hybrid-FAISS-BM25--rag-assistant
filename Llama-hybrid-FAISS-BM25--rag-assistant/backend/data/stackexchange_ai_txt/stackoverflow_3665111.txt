I don't think "Server" is a valid property for a connection string. Try "Data Source" instead. "Integrated Security" should also be set to SSPI: UPDATE: I just noticed that you have also used "Database". This should be "Initial Catalog". UPDATE2: There is a neat trick for creating connection strings by using .udl files. If you create an empty file called "something.udl" and double click it, Windows will open a nice dialog for defining connections. To create a connection string for a SQL Server, choose "Microsoft OLEDB Provider for SQL Server" on the "Provider" tab and then fill in your server name, login credentials, and database name on the "Connection" tab. Finish by testing the connection and click "OK". After the dialog is closed, you can drag the .udl file into Notepad or Visual Studio and you will see that the .udl file actually contains a connection string ready for you to use (note that if you wish to use the connection string with SqlConnection in .NET you must remove the "Provider=SQLOLEDB.1" part of the string).
