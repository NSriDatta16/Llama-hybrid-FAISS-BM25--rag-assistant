Android - SD Card - Emulator - Ubuntu

I need to add some files to an SD card on Android Emulator . I am using Intellij Idea on an Ubuntu system . What I 've done so far is: Create SD Card image using mksdcard command -> mksdcard -l SD256M 256M ~/sdcard256m.img . Launched Android Emulator with command line option -> -sdcard ~/sdcard256m.img However, I am unable to add files to the SD Card using DDMS - File Explorer (launched DDMS from command line). I get the following error . E/ddms: transfer error: Read-only file system Failed to push testfile.mp3 on emulator-5554: Read-only file system Also, on the Emulator, under Settings > SD Card & Phone Storage Settings , I see the fllowing: Total Space - Unavailable Available Space - Unavailable Mount SD Card - Insert an SD Card for mounting Format SD Card - Format (erase) the SD Card I am not sure if the emulator is able to pick up the SD card image that I created. Please let me know where I am going wrong ? Thanks a lot!
