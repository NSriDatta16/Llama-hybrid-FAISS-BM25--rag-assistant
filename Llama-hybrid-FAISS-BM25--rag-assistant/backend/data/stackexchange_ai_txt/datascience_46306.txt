Meaning of equation for CNN probabilities

So the first equation above refers to a CNN (rather a committee of CNNs) for image classification. I am unable to understand exactly what the author is trying to do in the first equation. So far, I think they're calculating the index of max likehlihood probabilities for all committees, then adding up the probabilities for all committees for those indices, and finally taking the maximum index. But this seems overly convoluted and I'm not really sure. Could someone clarify this?
