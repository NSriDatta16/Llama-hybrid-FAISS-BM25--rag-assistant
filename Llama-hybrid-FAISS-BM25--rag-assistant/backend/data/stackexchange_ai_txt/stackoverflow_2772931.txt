First, be aware (as others have commented) that Postgresql and Mysql have different ideas on what is a SCHEMA. In Postgresql (and in the SQL standard) a schema is just a namespace inside a database, which you can use to qualify object names (analogous to directories and files; and there is a 'public' schema whichs is used as default for unqualified names). Schemas, then, are related to organization of names, not isolation: as long as we are inside a database, objects (tables, views...) from different schemas are mutually visible; so that, for example, a view can mix tables of different schemas, or a FK can refer to other schema. On the contrary, objects in different databases are isolated (they only share users and groups), you can't join tables of different databases. A dump-restore is the only sane way I can think of, for copying a schema from one database to another. Even so, from the above, it might not be safe/possible if the schema depends on other schemas of the database (it's like you are copying the classes of a Java package from one project to another). I would not dream on attempting a copy of the binary files.
