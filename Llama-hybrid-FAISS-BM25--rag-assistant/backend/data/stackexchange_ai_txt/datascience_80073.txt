With GlobalAveragePooling2D, only one Feature per Feature map is selected by averaging every elements of the Feature Map. e.g. if your global average pooling layer input is 220 x 220 x 30 you will find 1x1x30 output . It means that you are finding a global representative feature from every slice. That is Global Average Pooling . No, this isn't specific to transfer learning. It is used over feature maps in the classification layer, that is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than a normal fully connected layer. On the other hand, Flattening is simply converting a multi-dimensional feature map to a single dimension without any kinds of feature selection.
