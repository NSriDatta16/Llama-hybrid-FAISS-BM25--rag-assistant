Is there such a thing as a manager design pattern?

Is there such a thing as a manager design pattern that controls how different entities interact? This is for a project for which the Environment, EnvironmentListener , and Entity classes have been predefined by our professor. The static class, Environment , has a single EnvironmentListener interface that has a nextAction() method it just continuously calls kind of like a main loop in a game and because it is for a design patterns class, i can't simply change the code. I need to allow entities to be dragged, dropped, animated, etc. and thought i would do that using different controllers. I've been wondering if it was a good idea to make a controller manager which would implement EnvironmentListener and if a pattern like that existed. The controller manager would simply iterate through a list of controllers and use their call function.
