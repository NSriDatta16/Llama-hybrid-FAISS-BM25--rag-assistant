As I understand it, you have 10 predictor variables and 15 countries with the NGO in question. You simply do not have enough to fit such a model (cf., here ). Nor is there some other magical model that will let you assess this. The problem isn't the model, but that you don't have enough information to work with. Some other model also wouldn't have enough information to work with. The options I can think of are: Find some other dataset that allows you to expand the amount of information available (e.g., state-level data). Work out informative prior probability distributions from other sources of information in your field and fit a Bayesian model. Note that because you don't have much information, the result of the Bayesian model will be based largely on what you believed already.
