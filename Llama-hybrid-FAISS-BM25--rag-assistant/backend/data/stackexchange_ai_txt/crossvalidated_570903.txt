Weibull Proportional Hazard in pymc

I’m looking to create a Bayesian proportional hazard model where the baseline hazard is modeled by a Weibull distribution (or some similar continuous distribution). I’ve reviewed (and implemented) the cox proportional hazard example here where the baseline hazard is piece wise constant and modeled with a Poisson’s distribution: https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/survival_analysis/survival_analysis.html I’ve reviewed (and implemented) the accelerated failure Weibull models at https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/survival_analysis/bayes_param_survival_pymc3.html It’s not obvious to me how to put them together. I started down the path of thinking of logs of hazard ratios, but couldn’t quite land how to model this and bring in my measured and censored survival times. Any advice?
