I haven't got time to knock up a complete example. However I'll give away the basis of the solution. Replace the template with one based on a Canvas . For example you could have an ellipse to be the actual point on the map, a draggable border that has the ContentPresenter and a line to act as a tether. The code needed is a) allow the Border to be dragged about and b) to move one end of the line about so that it lies under the Border.
