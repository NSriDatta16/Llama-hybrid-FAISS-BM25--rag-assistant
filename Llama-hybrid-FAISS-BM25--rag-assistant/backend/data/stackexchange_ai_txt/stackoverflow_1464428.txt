Here you have a simple detector based on bigram statistics (basically means learning from a big set which bigrams occur more frequently on each language and then count those in a piece of text, comparing to your previously detected values): http://allantech.blogspot.com/2007/07/automatic-language-detection.html This is probably good enough for many (most?) applications and doesn't require Internet access. Of course it will perform worse than Google's or Bing's algorithm (which themselves aren't great). If you need excellent detection performance you would have to do both a lot of hard work and over huge amounts of data. The other option would be to leverage Google 's or Bing APIs if your app has Internet access.
