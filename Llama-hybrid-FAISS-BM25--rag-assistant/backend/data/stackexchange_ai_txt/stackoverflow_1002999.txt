You can actually use AppleScript to set breakpoints in XCode from within Emacs by embedding the AppleScript inside of elisp. This page contains the code you need .

Just figure out how to do what you want in AppleScript and then embed that AppleScript in elisp within Emacs. BTW, here is the documentation for do-applescript , the lisp function, available on the Mac, that lets you call AppleScript.
