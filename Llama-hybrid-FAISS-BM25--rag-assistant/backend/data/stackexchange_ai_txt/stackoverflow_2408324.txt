This is more of a nitpick. But one of the downsides of dependency injection is that it makes it a little harder for development tools to reason about and navigate code. Specifically, if you Control-Click/Command-Click on a method invocation in code, it'll take you to the method declaration on an interface instead of the concrete implementation. This is really more of a downside of loosely coupled code (code that's designed by interface), and applies even if you don't use dependency injection (i.e., even if you simply use factories). But the advent of dependency injection is what really encouraged loosely coupled code to the masses, so I thought I'd mention it. Also, the benefits of loosely coupled code far outweigh this, thus I call it a nitpick. Though I've worked long enough to know that this is the sort of push-back you may get if you attempt to introduce dependency injection. In fact, I'd venture to guess that for every "downside" you can find for dependency injection, you'll find many upsides that far outweigh it.
