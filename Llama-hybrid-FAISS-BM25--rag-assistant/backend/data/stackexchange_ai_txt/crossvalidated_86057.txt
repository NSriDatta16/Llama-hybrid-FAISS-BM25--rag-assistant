"Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods" by Jon Wakefield, a good introductory Bayesian textbook for frequentist economics graduates?

Here's a link to a good question regarding Textbooks on Bayesian statistics from some time ago. People suggested John Kruschke's "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction with R and BUGS" as one of the best options to get an introduction to Bayesian statistics. Meanwhile, a potentially interesting book called "Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods" by Jon Wakefield was released, which also provides code for R and BUGS. Thus, they esentially both seem to cover the same topics. Question 1: If you have read the book, would you recommend it to a frequentist economics masters graduate as both an introduction to Bayesian statstics and reference book for both frequentist and bayesian approaches? Question 2: If you have read both Wakefield's and Kruschke's book, which one would you recommend better?
