How to create an all browser-compatible hanging indent style in CSS in a span

The only thing I've found has been; .hang { text-indent: -3em; margin-left: 3em; } The only way for this to work is putting text in a paragraph, which causes those horribly unsightly extra lines. I'd much rather just have them in a type of thing. I'm also looking for a way to further indent than just a single-level of hanging. Using paragraphs to stack the indentions doesn't work.
