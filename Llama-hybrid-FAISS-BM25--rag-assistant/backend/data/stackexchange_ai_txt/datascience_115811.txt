How does SelectFromModel from scikit-learn select features?

When I use XGBClassifier with SelectFromModel the algorithm always returns around five features regardless of the max_features value My question is: does XGBClassifier though that there are only five useful features in my dataset? from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel from xgboost import XGBClassifier sf=SelectFromModel(XGBClassifier(), max_features=10).fit(X, y) #The output only contains five True, all remaining are False print(sf.get_support()) ```
