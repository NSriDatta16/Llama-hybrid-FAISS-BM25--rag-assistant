There are research questions in astronomy that you can answer with your naked eyes, for some you need a giant telescope. In biology, there are research questions for which you just need more than 6 subjects in a group. In general, it doesn't matter if a p-value is computed from a parametric or non-parametric model, the same correction methods can be used. As was already pointer out in the comments, the smallest p-value you can get with Mannthe -Whitney test is 0.002, if all subjects from one group have a higher protein level than all subjects from the other group. So with Bonferroni correction(non recommended), you cannot find any significant result. There are better correction or modeling approaches, but I do not think they can help you a lot unless you expect huge effects on many proteins. In general, you can try to use better correction methods than Bonferroni that takes into account that various variables are correlated, you can use something like a MANOVA instead of many independent tests, you can try to limit the number of tests you are going to perform by either selecting only a few proteins based on your prior knowledge or averaging some proteins together or doing some other data reduction techniques. All these methods are probably going to hit their limits with your sample size. Another option is to use a hierarchical Bayesian model, but that is outside of my expertise.
