How to solve several issues with train fucntion in R?

I have to solve some problems with knn algorithm and corss validation. I will post my code and the text of the exercise later so you will be able to understand. At the end of the script R returns this error + warning : You are trying to do regression and your outcome only has two possible values Are you trying to do classification? If so, use a 2 level factor as your outcome column Error: pre-processing methods are limited to: BoxCox, YeoJohnson, expoTrans, invHyperbolicSine, center, scale, range, knnImpute, bagImpute, medianImpute, pca, ica, spatialSign, ignore, keep, remove, zv, nzv, conditionalX, corr In addition: Warning message: In train.default(x, y, weights = w, ...) : You are trying to do regression and your outcome only has two possible values Are you trying to do classification? If so, use a 2 level factor as your outcome column How can I fix it? Thanx in advance here the exercise text and code: Consider a simple classifier (say K-Nearest Neighbours with k=7) applied to some two-class data: 1. Starting with 5000 predictors (assume standard normal) and 50 samples, find the 100 predictors having the largest correlation with the class labels (assume binomial(0.5)); 2. Then apply KNN, using only these 100 predictors; 3. Illustrate the implications of doing feature selection before or within 10-fold cross validation on accuracy library('caret', quietly = TRUE) set.seed(202) n=50 pred=5000 y=rbinom(size=1,n=50,p=0.5) x=matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=pred) for(j in 1:pred){ x[,j]=rnorm(n) } corr.1
