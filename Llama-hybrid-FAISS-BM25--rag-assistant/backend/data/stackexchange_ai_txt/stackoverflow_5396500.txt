Rails Matrix Population

Let's say I have a matrix of values that I want to populate, that reflects the performance of certain widget parts in various tests I've run, **Widget part performance tests** Widgets x y z 1 fast slow good Widget parts 2 slow good bad 3 super shit ok These data are storied in an array of ActiveRecord model objects. Let's call this array w . I'd access attributes for each widgets in the following fashion, w.each do |widget| p widget.part1_performance p widget.part2_performance p widget.part3_performance end What's the most elegant way to iterate through w , populating my matrix, which is implemented as an HTML table?
