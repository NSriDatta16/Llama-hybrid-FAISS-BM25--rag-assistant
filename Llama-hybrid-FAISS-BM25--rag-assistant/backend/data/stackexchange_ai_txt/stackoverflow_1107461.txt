Organizing code in Objective-C and XCode

I have some Objective-C code that looks like this: #define myVar 10 float f = 10.0; - (void) myFunc{ ... } #define anotherVar 20 float z = 30.0; - (void) myFunc2{ ... } // and so on It's all in one class. I'd like to put the first block of code into another file and just reference it somehow. So the above code would end up looking something like this: // some reference to the code... #import? #include? I don't know... #define anotherVar 20 float z = 30.0; - (void) myFunc2{ ... } How can I do this? I just want the most basic, simple, and crude solution . Cheers!
