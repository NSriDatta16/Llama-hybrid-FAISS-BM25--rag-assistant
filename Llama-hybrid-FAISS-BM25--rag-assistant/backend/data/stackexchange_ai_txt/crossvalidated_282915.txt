1) You may consider a logit transform log(p/(1-p)) because you are dealing with proportions (and, by the way, if you know out of how many sample points these proportions are computed, then consider glm with a binomial family for a logistic regression). 2) What are the plotted residuals you used? The variance inhomogeneity may be due to influential points (corresponding to the rightmost points on your residual plots above). You may consider studentized residuals instead. See http://www.statmethods.net/stats/rdiagnostics.html under Non-constant Error Variance. 3) If that does not work and you may also consider the function gamlss from package gamlss. There is a flexible way for fitting inhomogeneous sigma. I don't have enough practical experience to propose a code here though. Hope this helps.
