Difference of nearest-neighbour clustering and K-nearest neighbor clustering

we're two students working on a seminar paper (topic: Marketing in the Age of Big Data) where we have to conduct a cluster analysis by using nearest neighbour clustering. unfortunately, we cannot differentiate between nearest neighbour clustering and K-nearest neighbours. At first of all we thought that it is the same just called different. After we've read many papers where it is said that KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm, while our professor said that the nearest neighbour is an unsupervised algorithm we recognised that there must be a difference. There are a lot of different declarations on the internet, why we are confused now. Hopefully, someone can help us to solve the understanding problems. Many thanks in advance and many greetings
