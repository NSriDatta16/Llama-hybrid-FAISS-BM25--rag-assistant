Sometimes, it is meaningful to visualize high dimensional data since it may tell us physics. There is at least one example in astrophysics where you project your data down to principal components generated by PCA and those principal components correspond to much physical insight about the galaxies. For detail, see the paper . Here is the basic idea. The authors apply PCA to many spectra (e.g., 10,000) from a telescope. Each spectrum has ~1000 attributes. Since this data set has large dimensions, it's difficult to visualize it. However, the first 4 components from PCA reveal much physics about the spectra (see sections 4.1-4.4 in the paper above).
