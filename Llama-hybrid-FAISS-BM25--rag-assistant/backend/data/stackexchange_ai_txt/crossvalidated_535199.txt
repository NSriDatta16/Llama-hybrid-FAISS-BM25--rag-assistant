Assessing mediation with Cox models (in R)

I conducted a simple survival analysis of the association between intervention A and outcome Y, where fu_y indicates the time-to-outcome (from the intervention). coxph(Surv(tt_Y, Y) ~ A) A collaborator suggested that M might be a mediator. I have data regarding the potential mediator and the time-to-mediator. I followed the steps in here . coxph(Surv(tt_Y, Y) ~ A) # Step 1: Total Effect coxph(Surv(tt_M, M) ~ A) # Step 2: The effect of the IV onto the mediator coxph(Surv(tt_Y, Y) ~ A + M) # Step 3: The effect of the mediator on the dependent variable How can I calculate ACME (average causal mediation effect), ADE (average direct effect), and Proportion Mediated? The mediate package does not seem to work with Cox models. Let's assume for clarity that Y is death (binary with a date of the outcome), M is diabetes type 2 (binary with a date of the diagnosis) and A is a dietary intervention (binary with a date of intervention). M could potentially occur before A but these cases were excluded from the study. M cannot occur after Y. Y can occur without M.
