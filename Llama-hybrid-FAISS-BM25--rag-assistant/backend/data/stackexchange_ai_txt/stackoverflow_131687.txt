As far as Im aware XSLT 1.0 doesnt have a builtin for this. XSLT 2.0 allows you to use regexes , though Im sure your all too aware of that. If, on the off chance your using the MS parser, you can write .NET extension libraries that you can leverage in your XSLT and I wrote about this some months ago here. If your using something like Saxon, I am pretty certain they also provide ways of coding your own extensions, and they may indeed have an extension of their own already, but Im unfamiliar with that engine. Hope this helps.
