I would recommend using the ML libraries because you will get stuff done. Ultimately something will go wrong and you will need to understand how the algorithms actually work. I highly recommend Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class on Coursera to help you fix any issues and obtain a deeper understanding of the algorithm. The class is worth the fee.
