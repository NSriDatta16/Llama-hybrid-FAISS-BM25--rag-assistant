A simple way to do this using Autoencoders (without "denoising autoencoders" that need to be trained with "corrupted data") is to train an autoencoder and then inspect the RMSE of the rows from the input that didn't decode well (the ones that the autoencoder had a hard time reconstructing). By some definition that data would represent an anomaly (certainly this would be the case for things like spikes in traffic).
