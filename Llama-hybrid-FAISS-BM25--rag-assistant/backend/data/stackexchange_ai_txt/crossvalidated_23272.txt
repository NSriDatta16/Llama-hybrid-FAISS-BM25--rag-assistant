It depends on what you are measuring. If the different runs are on different input data, it makes sense to compare the mean values to get average expected run times (i.e., the $\Theta(n)$ in algorithm analysis). Or may be the maximum to get the worst case analysis (the big Oh notation $O(n)$). If the different runs are on identical data, and you are measuring wall-time rather then CPU time used by the process, minimums might be useful to get rid of the effect of other processes.
