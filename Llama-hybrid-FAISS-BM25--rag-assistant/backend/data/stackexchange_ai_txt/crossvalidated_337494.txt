Your question is, itself, relatively sparse so not much can be said. But generally If you have an enormous volume of sparse data, you want to avoid any operation (such as mean-centering) that could disrupt sparsity. This is one reason MaxAbsScaler could be helpful: it can be computed without disrupting sparsity, and applying it also doesn't disrupt sparsity. MaxAbsScaler scales by the largest absolute value (which is cheap to estimate). Likely for numerical reasons, the scipy.sparse authors do not implement standard deviation methods for sparse data types; if you disregard numerical concerns, one could scale by standard deviation (but you'd have to write your own sparsity-respecting code to do so). You don't want to use PCA, since it requires centering your data (destroying sparsity). But you can still access an orthogonal basis representation of your data using sparse SVD. PCA isn't feature selection, it just rotates the data. MaxAbsScaler isn't feature selection, either, it just scales data.
