How to display the data of type List > on page?

What way can you recommend? Perhaps, there is some control for this purpose. I'm trying to generate input data for learning neural network for recognation black-white images. I have the table 3x3, clicking on cells the background color is changed. Black means "1", white - "0". And for selected combination it's need to set the output value. So, in that case I receive 0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1 and output - 1 This List I generate using Javascript and send to codebehind by means of hidden field. I must show these combinations on page with the ability to delete them
