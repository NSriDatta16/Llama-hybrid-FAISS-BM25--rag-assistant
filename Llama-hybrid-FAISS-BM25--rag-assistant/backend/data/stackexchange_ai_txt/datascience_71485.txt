I think there are three very different kinds of contributions that can be made: Professional: many countries and organizations (typically the EU , also many NGOs) have issued emergency calls for proposals, some of them involve data science research either about the disease itself or for dealing with its consequences. Participating to these projects usually requires a team of researchers but conditions vary. Citizen Science: participating to a research project as a non-professional, usually through a platform such as SciStarter or Zooniverse . Some of these projects are in the medical domain but I haven't seen any specifically related to the coronavirus yet. Doing your own project and publishing the results. There are many datasets available (see e.g. this question on OpenDataSE ).
