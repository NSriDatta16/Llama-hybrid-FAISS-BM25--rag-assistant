I figured it out. When the applet is initializing, it requests input from the user: private void getNumAgents() { BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); try { if (numAgents Which caused the applet to stall when running in-browser. I had originally set it up this way while testing within Eclipse, and had meant to take it out before uploading. Thanks for the help though, everyone.
