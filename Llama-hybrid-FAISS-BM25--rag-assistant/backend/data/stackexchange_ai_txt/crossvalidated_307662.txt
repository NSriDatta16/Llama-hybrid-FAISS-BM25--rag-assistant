Savitzky-Golay smoothing could be a good answer. It's an extremely efficient implementation of least squares smoothing over a sliding time window (a convolution over that data) that comes down to just multiplying the data in each time window by fixed constants. You can fit values, derivatives, second derivatives, and higher. You choose how spiky you allow the results to be, based on the size of the sliding time window and the degree of the polynomial fit on that time window. That was originally developed for chromatography, where peaks are an essential part of the results. One desirable property of SG smoothing is that the locations of the peaks are preserved. For instance, a 5 to 11 point window with a cubic curve fit cuts noise but still preserves peaks. There's a good article in Wikipedia, although it's referred to as Savitzky-Golay filter (doing slight violence to normal terminology from systems control theory and time series analysis, as well as the original paper, where it's correctly called smoothing). Also be aware that there is (an argument over) an error in the Wikipedia article for formulas for second derivative estimates -- see the Talk section for that article. EDIT: The Wikipedia article was fixed
