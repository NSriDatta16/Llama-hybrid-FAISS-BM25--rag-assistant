Confirmation. Is this the proper way to analyse a replicated (2 store) interrupted time series with a segmented regression (with a control)? I know there are other methods (e.g. longitudinal model using a mixed model) but require more data (more stores). There are better approaches when you have control series. Here is how google does it , they have released causal impact package . Basically, its a structural time series model, with test series as dependent series and control series as independent series. Another possible approach is using transfer function and arima modeling. same as above, you have more flexibility in arima transfer function modeling. A best case study is provided in the following two articles. Intervention analysis using control series and exogenous variables in a transfer function model: A case study and Intervention Analysis of a Field Experiment to Assess the Buildup Effect of Advertising both by same authors. Interpretation of the "effect" of the intervention. If you use the above approach everything will be controlled for including seasonality, trend and other features of time series and clearly separate out intervention effects. How would I use the model to estimate the absolute number of units of Y that decreased during the intervention (period 4,5,6) due to the intervention? for a series this short, simply normalize the values, and find out the difference. This will be the impact of intervention, this works very well in practice for short time series. An excellent reference material are seminal work by Box and Tiao ,and Glenn v Glass and this book by same author. Another excellent work in structural time series area using control series and intervention modeling is by Harvey . Hope this helps.
