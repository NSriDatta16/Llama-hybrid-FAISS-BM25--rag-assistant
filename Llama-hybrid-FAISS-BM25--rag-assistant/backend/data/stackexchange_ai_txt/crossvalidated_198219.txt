Logistic regression with r and stata

I ran the same Logistic regression with R and STATA. The regressors include many dummy variables. In R, the code I used is fit which reports the warning message: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge In STATA, I simply ran Logit y x1 - x20 and the reported table looks OK and the estimation seems to be reasonable. Actually if I have only a few regressors, say only $x_1, x_2, x_3$, they report the same result. I'm wondering why there could be such difference? In R, how to fix the problem? Thanks a lot!
