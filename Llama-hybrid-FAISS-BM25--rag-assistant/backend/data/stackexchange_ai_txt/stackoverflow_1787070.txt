Setting up TeamCity to work with ClearCase

I'm trying to setup TeamCity to work with ClearCase for continuous integration, and I've been having a few problems. TeamCity is complaining that it cannot build the patch for the build. I've been scouring the internet for information on ClearCase and TeamCity, and there is a surprisingly small amount of information on the topic. Has anyone had any success with getting TeamCity to work with ClearCase? Here's my build log: [18:09:11]: Updating sources (2s) [18:09:13]: [Updating sources] Failed to build patch for build #1.0.23-November-2009.18:09:09, build id: 10, VCS root: ClearCase, due to error: Cannot get version in view 'D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project' for the directory D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project [18:09:13]: Will repeat attempt when server will be available, number of attempts left: 2 [18:09:23]: Updating sources (1s) [18:09:25]: [Updating sources] Failed to build patch for build #1.0.23-November-2009.18:09:09, build id: 10, VCS root: ClearCase, due to error: Cannot get version in view 'D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project' for the directory D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project [18:09:25]: Will repeat attempt when server will be available, number of attempts left: 1 [18:09:35]: Updating sources (2s) [18:09:37]: [Updating sources] Failed to build patch for build #1.0.23-November-2009.18:09:09, build id: 10, VCS root: ClearCase, due to error: Cannot get version in view 'D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project' for the directory D:\CCdata\my_vob\my_project [18:09:37]: [Updating sources] Patch is broken, can be found in file: C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\temp\cache\temp58518patch10 [18:09:37]: [Updating sources] Error while applying patch: Failed to build patch for build #1.0.23-November-2009.18:09:09, build id: 10, VCS root: ClearCase...
