Multiple linear regression: p-value=0.25 pre-filter variable selection

I have used many times in a multiple logistic regression the criteria of p-value=0.25 like pre-filter variable selection using bivariate logistic regression , then I use a MANUAL stepwise (backward) to finish the variable selection (p-value=0.05) (only main effects models). I wonder if its possible use this method in multiple linear regression (pre-filter variable selection using bivariate linear regression), then... I have looking in literature this topic but only I got for multiple logistic regression (only main effects models). I know that stepwise variable selection have a lot of critics in literature (I repeat: I use a manual method, not automated method...) but my focus is in bivariate linear regression like pre-filter using p-value=0.25 in variable selection... Could use correlation analysis like a pre filter? I would grateful some reference if exist... Thanks in advance. Regards, Rodrigo.
