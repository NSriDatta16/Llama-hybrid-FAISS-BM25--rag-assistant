Create a separate batch service, as others have suggested, but use it to send ALL of the emails. The web app should record the need to send notifications in a database table, both for the immediate notice and for the reminder notice, with both records annotated with the desired send date/time. Using MSMQ is overkill--you already have a database and a simple application. As the complexity grows, MSMQ or something similar might help with that complexity and scalability. The service should periodically (every few minutes to a few hours) scan the database table for notifications (emails) to send in the near future, send them, and mark them as sent if successful. You could eventually leverage this to also send text messages (SMS) or instant messages (IMs), etc. While you are at it, you should consider using the Command design pattern , and implement this service as a reusable Command executor. I have done this recently with a web application that needs to keep real estate listing (MLS) data synchronized with a third-party provider.
