The suggestion from @Will Robertson works great. I'd just like to add an example for all lazy people: \usepackage{pdfpages} ... % Insert _all_ pages from some_pdf.pdf: \includepdf[pages=-]{some_pdf} % the .pdf extension may be omitted From the documentation of the package: To include a specific range of pages, you could do pages={4-9} . If start is omitted, it defaults to the first page, if end is omitted, it defaults to the last page. To include it in landscape mode, do landscape=true
