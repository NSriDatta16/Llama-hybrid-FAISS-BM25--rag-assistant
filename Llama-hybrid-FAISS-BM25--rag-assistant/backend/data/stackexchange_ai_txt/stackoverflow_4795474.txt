Although you can use any of lots available web framework I'd recommend you to do something else. You said that it is your first web app, so it is expected to be relatively simple. So, you can stand without framework. Moreover you should learn the core, so you should stand without framework. You can create JSP page that generates writable table. You should combine tags and . Each intput tag should have attribute name. All inputs in the same column will have the same name. For example if your table contains 2 columns: car_model and car_manufacturer and 2 lines: megane renault 323 mazda the table will look like the following: This table will be into form that will submit the stuff to servlet using HTTP POST. It is not a problem that you will get several parameters of the same name. Servlet API allows this: request.getParameters("car_manufacturer") returns array of strings that contain in our case renault and mazda. Implementation of links previous and next is not very complicated. To get data you have to implement some paging anyway. So store index of first visible element in collection that you retrieve from DB and number of elements to show. Your JSP should take these elements, perform SQL query and show only relevant elements. Better solution is to modify query dynamically to retrieve only relevant elements. I hope my answer helps. It does not contain exact todo list but I believe contains enough tips to start from. Good luck and have fun.
