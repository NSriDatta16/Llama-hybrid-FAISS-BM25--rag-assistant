magento custom link and insertion of form data

I have added a link named "campaigns" to the Magento "My Account" area after the Address book. The link, when clicked, should have a form with 4 fields: name email number place Once they submit the form, it should insert these fields in the table. But again, can I want to have custom table for this. I have added this link in the xml file of /fronend/base/default/layout/sales.xml like this: orders sales/order/history/ My Orders ` campaign sales/order/history/ Missing orders Now I'm confused as to which controller and model I have to call, etc. Please point me in the right direction.
