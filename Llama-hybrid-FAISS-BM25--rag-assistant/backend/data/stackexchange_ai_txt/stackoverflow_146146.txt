Is my form password being passed in clear text?

This is what my browser sent, when logging into some site: POST http://www.some.site/login.php HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: Opera/8.26 (X2000; Linux i686; Z; en) Host: www.some.site Accept: text/html, application/xml;q=0.9, application/xhtml+xml, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, */*;q=0.1 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1, utf-8, utf-16, *;q=0.1 Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip, x-gzip, identity, *;q=0 Referer: http://www.some.site/ Proxy-Connection: close Content-Length: 123 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded lots_of_stuff=here&e2ad811= my_login_name &e327696= my_password &lots_of_stuff=here Can I state that anyone can sniff my login name and password for that site? Maybe just on my LAN? If so (even only on LAN ) then I'm shocked. I thought using did something more than make all characters look like ' * ' p.s. If it matters I played with netcat (on linux) and made connection browser netcat (loged here) proxy remote_site
