Dragging a TButton from form to form

I have a Delphi GUI app (with RAD studio 2010) and I want the user to be able to rearrange his workspace. I know how to make TButtons draggable around in the same form, but not how to make the user able to drag a button from one form to another form. When you click and attempt to drag a TButton, I don't think it treats it like a drag-and-drop operation. How do you get a TButton to be drag-and-drop capable across multiple forms?
