Generating a maven site including a Cobertura Report

I've got some projects that are already doing site generation via maven, and I want to integrate cobertura reports in them, but no maven goal I seem to run will generate a local preview for me to look at that includes the Cobertura reports in the site. I want to be sure they're generating correctly before I commit the pom changes to the repo and have broken site generated. Below is what I've added to the maven poms (parent and module), but the site I see when I run mvn site:run does not include the cobertura reports: ... org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin false parent-package-name-here.* 80 80 parent-package-name-here/**/*.class clean pre-site clean instrument site instrument cobertura check ... org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin ... What maven command should I use to generate the site with cobertura reports? Or, what should I add (additionally) to get the site generation to include the cobertura reports?
