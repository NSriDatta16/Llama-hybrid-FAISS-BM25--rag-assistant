Can I set up automated publication of a Magento CMS page?

is there a way to schedule publication of a Magento CMS page that is under version control? ie: On March 3, 2011 at 12:00am, change CMS page 'Home Page' from Verision A to Version B is there anything built into Magento that would handle that? or would I need to DIY? thx
