For build automation and continuous integration take a look at TeamCity from Jetbrains . It has a lot of features and is really a breeze to set up and use. If you use Visual Studio 2005/2008 it will build your solution directly without the need for extra scripts (if a build is all you want.) It will also execute your unit tests and gather stats on build success, unit test execution times, etc, etc. Best of all: The Pro edition is free for teams with up to 20 users and 3 build agents.
