Find a path to each node of the tree using depth first search, then call enumerate-paths(Path p) , where p is the path from the root to the node. Let's assume that a path p is an array of nodes p[0] [1] .. p[n] where p[0] is the root and p[n] is the current node. enumerate-paths(p) { for i = 0 .. n output p[n - i] .. p[n] as a path. } Each of these paths is different, and each of them is different from the results returned from any other node of the tree since no other paths end in p[n] . Clearly it is complete, since any path is from a node to some node between it and the root. It is also optimal, since it finds and outputs each path exactly once. The order will be slightly different from yours, but you could always create an array of list of paths where A[x] is a List of the paths of length x . Then you could output the paths in order of their length, although this would take O(n) storage.
