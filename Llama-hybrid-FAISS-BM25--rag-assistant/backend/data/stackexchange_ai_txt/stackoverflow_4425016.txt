I do a complete hack to get SQL executed when the database is being created. I create my own DatabaseInitializer and inherit from one of the provided initializers. public class MyDatabaseInitializer : RecreateDatabaseIfModelChanges { protected override void Seed(MyDbContext context) { base.Seed(context); context.Database.Connection.StateChange += new StateChangeEventHandler(Connection_StateChange); } void Connection_StateChange(object sender, StateChangeEventArgs e) { DbConnection cnn = sender as DbConnection; if (e.CurrentState == ConnectionState.Open) { // execute SQL to create indexes and such } cnn.StateChange -= Connection_StateChange; } } That's the only place I could find to wedge in my SQL statements. This is from CTP4. I don't know how it works in CTP5.
