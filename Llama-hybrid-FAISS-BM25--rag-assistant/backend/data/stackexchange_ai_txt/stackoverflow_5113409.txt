NSAttributedString drawAtPoint and drawInRect - Discrepancies

In the following images, the first character of each line is an NSAttributed string drawn in a subview. The rest of the line is drawn in a regular NSTextView. The subviews have the exact same height and origin as the line fragments in the NSTextView. These are the results calling [NSATtributedString drawAtPoint:lineFragment.origin] These are the results calling [NSAttributedString drawInRect:lineFragmentRect] Can anyone explain the discrepancies to me?
