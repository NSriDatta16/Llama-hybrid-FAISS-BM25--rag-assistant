Performing sensitivity analysis on time series data requires a different approach. One way to do this is by using dynamic linear models (DLMs). DLMs can capture the effect of a parameter change over time and can be used to perform sensitivity analysis. Another way is to use a time series model such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) to analyze the data. These models can be used to identify the impact of a parameter change on the time series over a longer period. Otherwise, you could also split your time series into smaller time periods and analyze each period separately. This approach could also help identify the impact of a parameter change over a specific time period. However, it is important to keep in mind that this approach may not capture the full picture of the time series behavior.
