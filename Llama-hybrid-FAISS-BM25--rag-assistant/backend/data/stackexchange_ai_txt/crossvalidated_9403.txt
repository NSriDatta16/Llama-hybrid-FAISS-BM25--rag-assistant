As we have strong reasons to believe that the cooling will follow the $y(t) = a + e^{-kt}$ function for each beaker I would first check if this model fits the data well indeed. If it does I wouldn't bother with analysing the autocorrelation at all, but focus on the estimation of $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$, and testing the hypothesis about them. To estimate $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$ you need a non-linear model. Your idea of log transformation followed by linear modelling is best when the error (difference between the measured $y$ temperature and the one predicted by the formula) is proportional to the temperature. However, I suspect that the error will be primarily due to temperature measurement and thus normally distributed with the same variance for any temperature (you need to check this). If so, a non-linear model would be more appropriate. A model using the above function will give you estimates for the parameters of the cooling of a single beaker, $a$ and $k$. We may however assume that $a$ should be the same for each beaker, $k$s should be similar for the same substance, and that the standard deviation ($\sigma$) is the same across all temperature measurements. These can be expressed in a model accounting for all the beakers in the same time (second index $j$ is beaker ID): $$y_j(t) = a + e^{-(k_i + \alpha_j)t} + \epsilon$$ where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed error of SD $\sigma$, $k_i$ is one of 3 mean $k$ values for substance $i$, $\alpha_j$ is normally distributed random deviation of a specific beaker from the $k_i$ substance mean, with a substance specific SD ($\sigma_{\alpha{}i}$). This is now a non-linear mixed effect model, that can be fitted using various software. After this you have the $k_i$ values and their standard errors. The next question is how to test the hypothesis that $k_1 > k_2 > k_3$. It may be “cleaner” to formulate such a hypothesis in the Bayesian way. However you used the word test, so you probably want a significance test – but in order to do that you have to have a more specific alternative hypothesis (or family of hypotheses).
