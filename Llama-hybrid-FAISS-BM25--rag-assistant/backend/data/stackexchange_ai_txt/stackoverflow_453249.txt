Before the days of OLE/COM/ActiveX, we would do something like the following: If we received a mouse down event, take note of cursor position. If we received a mouse movement and it moved a certain distance from the original point then we're starting a drag operation. Build a cursor that represents the object you're dragging (determined from the original cursor position). When we received a mouse down: if dragging never started then it's a click otherwise use the drop position to determine what to do with the object. Note: none of this would allow you to drag objects between apps, just inside individual apps.
