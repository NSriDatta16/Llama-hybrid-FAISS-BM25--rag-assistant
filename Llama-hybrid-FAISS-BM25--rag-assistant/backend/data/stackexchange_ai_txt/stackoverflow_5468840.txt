How to get dynamically a size of a drag clone image using jquery

When I drag a image on droppable area then I want to know the selected image size. Here I did some code.but every time it gives only the first dragged image size. can anybody help to sole this problem? In some other discussion there discuss about actual image size not about the clone drag image. only get the id of first image. not the others.
