How to do a discontinuos segmented logistic regression in R?

I'm trying to do a discontinuous segmented logistic regression, something like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AO1Mh.jpg . The 6 breaking points are predetermined from domain knowledge. Unfortunately my textbook (ISLR) provides codes for the continuous one only. After searching on the web, i stumbled on the 'segmented' package, and wrote this code: fit = glm(is_legendary~pokedex_number, family = binomial, data = pokedex) segfit = segmented(fit,seg.Z = ~pokedex_number, psi=c(151.5, 251.5, 386.5, 493.5, 649.5, 721.5)) and it gave me this error: Error in seg.glm.fit(y, XREG, Z, PSI, w, offs, opz, return.all.sol = TRUE) : dims [product 4] do not match the length of object [6] In addition: Warning messages: 1: In id.psi.in & id.psi.far : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length 2: In id.psi.in & id.psi.far : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length am I using the correct package and function for my objective? If so, what caused the error?
