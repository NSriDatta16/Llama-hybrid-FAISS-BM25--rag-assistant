A LONGPTR is an __int3264 . In any case, you can't cast an iterator to this type because an iterator is not a pointer. You can, however, take the address of the element pointed to by the iterator (using &*it ), assuming the type of object stored in the container does not overload the unary & (if it does overload the unary & , it's a bad, bad class).
