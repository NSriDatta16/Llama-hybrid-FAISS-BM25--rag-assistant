private or protected variables?

I am currently reading Code Complete where McConnell strongly encourages making all variables private. Coincedentally I just so happened to be working on a project where I needed to change a private variable. The class had a private variable (a String ) telling it where to load an image from to use in the system chrome. I needed to change this image, I do not know about other languages but as far as I know in Flex/AIR, there is no way to override a private variable. If it had been declared protected, I could have simply extended the class, and overridden that variable. But since it was private, I had to copy all the code from the class and create a duplicate class with the only difference being that string. I think the argument is to use private as it makes for looser coupling between super and subclasses, however I had to completely violate DRY to be able to achieve a simple string change, which seems to me as worse. This makes me think that protected is better than private. However, I want to do things the right best-practices way. So if private is better, I want to understand why. If the general consensus is that private is better, can someone explain why?
