Jack's response about sessions is correct. They are specific to the container that you execute in, although the Servlet spec at least gives you portability between JavaEE containers. As for security, you at least have the opportunity to separate it from your JAX-RS specific code by employing JaaS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and a servlet filter . The filter can be used to enforce HTTP authentication and, on successful auth, setup the JaaS Subject with the appropriate Principals. Your JAX-RS resources can check for the appropriate Principals on the Subject. Since you control the whole stack, you should be able to rely on an authenticated user in your resources (but do test this!), and you can enforce authorization based on the current operation in the resource code.
