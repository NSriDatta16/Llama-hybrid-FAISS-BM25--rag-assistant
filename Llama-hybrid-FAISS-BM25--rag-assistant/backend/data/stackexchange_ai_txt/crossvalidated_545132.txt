Understanding how to find the $1$ in $100$ chance on the $t$-table

Background In my university class, we've been discussing the following experiment: Consider an experiment on artificially raised salmon, with two treat-ments (one a control) and $20$ fish per treatment. Average weight gains(g) over the experimental period were $1210$ and $1320$ grams. The estimate of variation between fish within a group was $s = 135\mathrm{g}$ . Did treatment improve growth rate? My professor established the observed difference between group means $1320 - 1210 = 110\mathrm{g}$ variation between two means expected solely from chance $135Ã—\left(\frac{2}{20}\right)^{0.5}= 42.7$ test statistic = $\frac{110}{42.7} = 2.58$ My work so far I've wanted to work through the formula, to get better intuition on the process $$\begin{align*} t&=\frac{\overline{x}-\overline{y}}{\sqrt{S^2_p\left(\frac{1}{n_1}\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}}\\[5pt] t&=\frac{1320-1210}{\sqrt{S^2_p\left(\frac{1}{20}+\frac{1}{20}\right)}}\\[5pt] &=\frac{110}{^{135\sqrt{\frac{2}{20}}}}\\[5pt] &\approx2.57667\dots \\[5pt] \end{align*}$$ I understand that $2.58$ is statistically signifigant. My professor also stated the $t$ -table shows this being $38$ , and the chance of a value as large as $2.58$ is about $1$ in $100$ . I've had no success getting this, using the following table , to derive the $1$ in $100$ chance. How would this be derived from the $t$ -table?
