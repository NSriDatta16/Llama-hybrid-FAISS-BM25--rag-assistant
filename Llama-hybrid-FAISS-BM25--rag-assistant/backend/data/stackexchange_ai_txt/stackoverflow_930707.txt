For sorting algorithms see link. It is a Wikipedia article - a little general information on sorting algorithms, but down below you have links to every type of them individually, and algorithms in pseudo code (and some languages). As far as "find the average" goes, when you've got "n" elements: SUM=0. DO i=1,n SUM=SUM+element(i) ENDDO AVRG=SUM/n Also, for learning purposes and thinking Project Euler is very nice. Also, do take a look at this question: Where can you find fun/educational programming challenges? I didn't want to copy paste everything, but it has a bunch of links with stuff for exactly what you're looking for (programming exercices). And this: Algorithm Questions Website , What are your programming exercises? . You'll probably find something you think he'll be interested in in there.
