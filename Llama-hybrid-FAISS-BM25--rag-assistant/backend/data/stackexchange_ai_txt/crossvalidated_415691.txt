Bayesian parameter estimation with proportion data

I am trying to do a Bayesian analysis using a model that comes from the literature in non-Bayesian form: $y = \Phi\Bigg(\frac{1}{\alpha} * log(A/\beta)\Bigg)$ . Because the model uses the function $\Phi$ its outcome is in the range $0-1$ . My observations cannot exceed this range either (but can be 0 or 1). However, using a Gaussian in the likelihood function means that the uncertainty bounds are sometimes outside the $0-1$ range (see Figure below). Statistically speaking, is this a problem, and if so, what would be a better solution? $R_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$ $\mu_i = \Phi \Bigg(\frac{1}{\alpha} * log(A/\beta) \Bigg)$ $\alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0.35, 0.1) $ $\beta\sim \mathcal{N}(70, 10) $ $\sigma \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 0.3) $
