This sound like a typical classification problem. So, beyond logistic regression, which is actually a probability modelling technique under the assumption of normally distributed classes, there is a great choice of machine learning methods: (k) nearest neighbour(s) classifier, neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons), support vector machines, random forests, and many more. There is a link on Wikipedia , and this sister site offers a list of algorithms available in Python.
