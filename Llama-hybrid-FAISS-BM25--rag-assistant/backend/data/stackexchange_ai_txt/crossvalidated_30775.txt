Model accuracy can be defined as the difference between the model prediction and truth expressed in terms of squared error. So model accuracy is $E([T_{model}-T]^2)$ However you don't know the true $T$. But you say the you have $T_{obs}$ and you know its error distribution. So based on your assumption $E([T_{obs}-T]^2)=\sigma^2$. Now $E([T_{model}-T_{obs}]^2)$ is unknown but can be estimated from the average squared difference between the model prediction and the observed value. What you are interested in is $E([T_{model}-T]^2)$. Add and subtract $T_{obs}$ inside the brackets and expand. After a few algebra steps you get $$E([T_{model}-T]^2)= E([T_{model}-T_{obs}]^2)+ E([T_{obs}-T]^2 + E([T_{model}-T_{obs}] [T_{obs}-T]).$$ Note that the term $E([T_{obs}-T]^2) = \sigma^2$ and, since $T_{model}$ is independent of $T_{obs}$, $$E([T_{model}-T_{obs}] [T_{obs}-T])= E(T_{model} -T_{obs}) E(T_{obs}-T)$$ and by assuming the error in $T_{obs}$ is $\rm N(0,\sigma^2)$, $E(T_{obs}-T)=0.$ So we have the variance decomposition $E([T_{model}-T]^2)= E([T_{model}-T_{obs}]^2)+\sigma^2$. So we can estimate the model error by taking the estimate for $E([T_{model}-T_{obs}]^2)$ and adding it to the known $\sigma^2$ . However if you want to assess the uncertainty in the estimate of $E([T_{model}-T_{obs}]^2)$ you still need to get a sampling distribution for it under the null hypothesis which amounts to still doing what I recommended in my answer to Steven's previous question.
