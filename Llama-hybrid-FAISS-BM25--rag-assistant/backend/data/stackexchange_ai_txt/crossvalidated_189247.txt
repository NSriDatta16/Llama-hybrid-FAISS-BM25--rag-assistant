Can a value appearing more frequently for a class help predict it?

I am trying to analyse my data before doing multi-class classification with SVM. I have several variables. I pick one of them and study it. This is a categorical variable. It can have the value 0 or the value 1. Most of the time, it has the value 0. But sometimes it gets a 1. I studied the frequency of ones and I got the following results: The variable has the value 1 : 2.71% for all classes 2.22% for class 1. 2.53% for class 2. 4.79% for class 3. 2.23% for class 4. 1.99% for class 5. Can I consider that this variable is important for predicting class 3 or is it incorrect?
