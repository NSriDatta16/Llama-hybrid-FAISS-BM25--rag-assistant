A very simple thing you could try is to think of each movie as a collection of actors, with each actor contributing some positive/negative rating to the movie. In other words each movie is a one-hot vector over all actors $1,2,\cdots,k$ giving you a binary vector $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_k)$. You then want some kind of multiclass regression, for example an ordered logistic regression which predicts movie score based on the actors in it. In other words for movie $i$, the score $s_i$ is modelled by: $$s_i=Model(a_1\beta_1+\cdots+a_n\beta_n).$$ Then when a new movie comes out, you predict its score by plugging in its vector of actors.
