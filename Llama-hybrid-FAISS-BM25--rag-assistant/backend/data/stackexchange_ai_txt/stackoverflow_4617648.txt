iPad Detection You should be able to detect an iPad user by taking a look at the userAgent property: var is_iPad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) != null; iPhone/iPod Detection Similarly, the platform property to check for devices like iPhones or iPods: function is_iPhone_or_iPod(){ return navigator.platform.match(/i(Phone|Pod))/i) } Notes While it works, you should generally avoid performing browser-specific detection as it can often be unreliable (and can be spoofed). It's preferred to use actual feature-detection in most cases, which can be done through a library like Modernizr . As pointed out in Brennen's answer , issues can arise when performing this detection within the Facebook app. Please see his answer for handling this scenario.
