Issues with Cufon in Magento

I'm trying to get Cufon working in Magento and it's not playing the game. jQuery is running in no-conflict due to Scriptaculous, and Cufon is initalising correctly (generating ready tags in the markup), though still no font transformations occur. The fonts in use are already applied on a mock up in a different directory on the same domain, so I'm very confused at to what could be the root of this. Also - does anyone have any idea at all where the call to Cufon.now() would go for IE? Havn't found the true footer (inc. ) in Magento yet! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
