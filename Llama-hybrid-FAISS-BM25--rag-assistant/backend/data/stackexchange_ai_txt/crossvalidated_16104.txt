Machine learning in web application?

There are a lot of outstanding machine learning/data mining standalone applications available in different languages like Java, Python, and others. However, I wonder, practically, in case of applying machine learning techniques into a web environment, is there anything existing that can be handy to use? E.g. any framework or library to apply machine learning in web applications? I understand things can be different in different language environment, but if you can refer to any kind of related information, it could be helpful. Thanks!
