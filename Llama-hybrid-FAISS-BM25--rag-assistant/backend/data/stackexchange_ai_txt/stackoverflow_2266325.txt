Yet another Java XML library question

I never liked XML, and always tried to avoid it. And the day finally has come. When I tried to parse XML it was really hard. I used DOM parser, when I called getChildNodes() of a Node , it returned NodeList . I had to use casting while using XPath. Is there any Java XML parsing library that is similar to WebDriver's WebElement mechanism, where getChildNodes() returns List (or Collection, Iterable etc.), I don't need to do casting.In other words, is there a XML parser library that is elegant and simple. The library can be read only, I don't need manipulation.
