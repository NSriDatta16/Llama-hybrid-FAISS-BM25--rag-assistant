Can I use Pearson's or Spearman's on a Likert-style survey?

I am doing a follow up survey to a previous study. It has to do with scientific news stories, seeing if exposure to the news story changes a negative behavior of theirs. For example, exposure to a media story about how misplaced, polluted waste can end up hurting us to see if that will mean people will litter less often. Can I use one or both of these statistical processes to test for correlation between questions? I would want to compare a question asking if they saw the media story to how likely they are to not litter moving forward, assuming those who saw the news coverage would "strongly agree" that they will not litter in the future based on that media report. Thank you!
