I share the "fail fast" preference/principle. Don't think of this as a conflict of principles though, its more a conflict of understanding. Your counterpart has some unspoken requirement ("dont show the user a bad time") that implies some missed requirement. You did not have a chance to think about/implement this requirement beforehand, so the requirement has left a bad taste in your mouth. Forget this viewpoint, re-approach it as a new project with a fixed requirement you can work against. Maybe the best result is to give an error message like you displayed. But it sounds like you implemented it before having buy-in from your counterpart, when they had a choice to accept it. Earlier communication about what you were doing could have addressed something like that. Be careful in how you prevent the ideas. Constantly referring to the other systems "too complex and fragile" might be rubbing people the wrong way. Express simply the systems are new to you and take longer to understand. Do put the time into understanding them, so you do not reduce peoples expectations of your capability.
