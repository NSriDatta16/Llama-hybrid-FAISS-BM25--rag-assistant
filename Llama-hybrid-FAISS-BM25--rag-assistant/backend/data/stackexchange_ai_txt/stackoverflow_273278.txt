I like paper, and I think it's the best surface for reading. In my opinion, you shouldn't ban printing - or force the office to go paperless. Instead, maybe you could encourage reuse. Once a document has been printed and read - distribute it to colleagues who might also need it. The 'round-robin envelope' (for want of a better name) is a feature of many traditional office environments which is pretty good in this respect. Also print double sided.
