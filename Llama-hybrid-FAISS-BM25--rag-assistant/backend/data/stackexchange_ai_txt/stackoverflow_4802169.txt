For monitoring JMX with Nagios jmx4perl is the perfect solution since it comes already with a feature rich Nagios Plugin check_jmx4perl . It uses Jolokia , an agent which bridges JMX via JSON/HTTP and has advanced features like fine grained security or bulk request which are not available for classical JSR-160 connectors. It is also being actively developed, whereas the REST approaches described above seem to be stuck in the year 2008 (this was also a reason for starting jmx4perl in May 2009). BTW, JSR-262 "Web Services Connector for Java Management Extensions (JMX) Agents" has unfortunately the status "inactive" since some time, so I don't expect much progress from this side.
