If I understand the situation, I think you are right that there will be bias, and for the reason you give. If you start off with an estimate that is 'large' you try again, possibly substituting a smaller estimate based on results from more trials. Simulation with Phases 1 & 2: I simulated the experiment a million times for each of three success probabilities $p = 1/10, 1/6, 3/10,$ respectively. The event cond occurs if we go on to Stage 2. The estimate ext is the average of results based on 30 trials if only Stage 1 is used, and the average of results based on 130 trials if both stages are used. [Notice that if $p = 1/6,$ then the average count at Phase 1 is $5.]$ set.seed(1118); m = 10^6; p = .1 x1 = rbinom(m, 30, p); x2 = rbinom(m, 100, p) cond = (x1 >= 5) est = x1/30; est[cond] = (x1[cond]+x2[cond])/130 mean(est); mean(cond) [1] 0.08819467 # est seems = 5) est = x1/30; est[cond] = (x1[cond]+x2[cond])/130 mean(est); mean(cond) [1] 0.1461873 # est seems = 5) est = x1/30; est[cond] = (x1[cond]+x2[cond])/130 mean(est); mean(cond) [1] 0.3996667 # est seems near 0.4 [1] 0.998444 # aprx P(Go to State 2) Straightforward simulation with 130 trials: If you just go ahead and use $n = 130$ trials from the start (with no Phase 1 or Phase 2 contingencies), you get very good estimates with a million iterations: mean(rbinom(10^6, 130, .1)/130) [1] 0.1000389 # aprx .1 mean(rbinom(10^6, 130, 1/6)/130) [1] 0.1666442 # aprx 1/6 mean(rbinom(10^6, 130, .4)/130) [1] 0.3999704 # aprx .4 Toward a general analytic solution: To find a general analytic solution for any $p,$ you need to start by figuring out such things as: (a) the probability of going on to Stage 2, (b) the expected value of the estimate $E(\hat p_1)$ for Stage 1 only, (c) the estimate $E(\hat p_1 | \text{Stop at Phase 1})$ , and (d) the estimate $E(\hat p_b)$ if both stages are used.
