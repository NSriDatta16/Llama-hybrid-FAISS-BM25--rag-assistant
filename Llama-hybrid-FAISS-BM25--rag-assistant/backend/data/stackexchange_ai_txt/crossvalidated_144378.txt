Is Cross entropy cost function for neural network convex?

My teacher proved that 2nd derivate of cross-entropy is always positive, so that the cost function of neural networks using cross entropy is convex. Is this true? I'm quite confuse about this because I've always learned that the cost function of ANN is non-convex. Can anyone confirm this? Thank you a lot! http://z0rch.com/2014/06/05/cross-entropy-cost-function
