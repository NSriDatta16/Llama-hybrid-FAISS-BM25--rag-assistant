Getting exactly same forecasted values in auto arima

I am using auto.arima from forecast package for time series. The auto.arima selects best p,d,q parameters by itself so need not to worry. But I get worried when I see all forecasting values which are exactly same. I think it is not correct. Also in a tutorial given below, they are getting same forecast values 67.75 Ref: http://a-little-book-of-r-for-time-series.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/timeseries.html > library("forecast") # load the "forecast" R library > kingstimeseriesforecasts kingstimeseriesforecasts Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 43 67.75063 48.29647 87.20479 37.99806 97.50319 44 67.75063 47.55748 87.94377 36.86788 98.63338 45 67.75063 46.84460 88.65665 35.77762 99.72363 46 67.75063 46.15524 89.34601 34.72333 100.77792 47 67.75063 45.48722 90.01404 33.70168 101.79958 Please let me know what additional preprocessing should I perform before feeding to auto.arima so that I get correct forecast values?
