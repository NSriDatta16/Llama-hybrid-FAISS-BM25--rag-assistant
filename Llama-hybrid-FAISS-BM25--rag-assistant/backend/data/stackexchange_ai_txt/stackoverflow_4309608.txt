I strongly DISCOURAGE anyone to buy from Vatlab. There is no 30-days money back guarantee and the support lasts for 6 months only. Also it did not work for me as the code was buggy. It tries to use FBML language. I would suggest using this IFRAME solution instead: http://fbtutorial.computerbeacon.net/section1/fbconnect
