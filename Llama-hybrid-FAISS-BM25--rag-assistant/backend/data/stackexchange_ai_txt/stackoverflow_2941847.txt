This is the signature of generateUrl: public function generateUrl($route, $params = array(), $absolute = false) Pay special attention to the second parameter. It should be an array in case of a regular route, however: if your route is an sfPropelRoute or its doctrine equivalent, it can be an object. I believe you get those errors because the route is not defined as an sfPropelRoute (or doctrine).
