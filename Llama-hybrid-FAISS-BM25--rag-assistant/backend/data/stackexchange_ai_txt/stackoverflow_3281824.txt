SQL Server Merge Replication error

I am getting a very strange error message at one of our client sites and I am having very little luck trying to figure out what is going on. Hr=80040154 ERR:OpenDB failed getting pub version 28627 That is the error message that is from the Merge Agent (IIS) logs. From what I can tell, it is a COM error not being able to load a specific COM object, but I don't know which one. From that, I think this client might not have something installed, but I don't know what that something. Does any one have any thoughts about what might not be installed? Any other ideas on how to troubleshoot this? Thanks.
