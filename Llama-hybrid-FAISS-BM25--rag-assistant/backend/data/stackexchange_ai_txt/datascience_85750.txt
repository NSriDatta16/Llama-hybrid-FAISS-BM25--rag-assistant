For a second, let us take the ML aspect out of the solution. In that case, your argument would still be - Since I1, I2....IN are so similar to I2, I3...IN+1 especially larger the 'N', then every new day stock price should ideally be very close or same as prev day stock price ..after all hardly anything has changed when you look at the inputs. So this logically means the market should not move at all. Nonetheless it DOES and hence we need to see how we can improve the feature set to better capture all the relevant data which we can make use of. This is a valid argument whether we use ML in the equation or not. Hence models using LSTM (or any model for that matter) too would face this issue during prediction. All your network has to do is produce a similar value to the last input of the price. Some of the models I have seen on the web do not take the 'prediction' as the input for the next prediction and instead take the 'actual' value. The 'ideal' model should take the prediction and predict.. Then we can truly say we have discovered a model that can predict stock prices. Of course it is quite difficult to do that. Workarounds could include strengthening the features themselves instead of focussing on the model where the ROI could be lesser. For e.g. gathering all +ve and -ve sentiments around that stock could be one of the feature. In this case the prev day sentiment feature would play a much larger role in prediction. Another approach is to process Output data better by taking taking labels as outputs for the next 10 steps instead of just a single time step or some sort of a moving average. Another way would be to increase the time steps to more than 1 in the sliding-window approach. Predicting changes in value (a derivative or second derivative) instead of the value itself could prove to be more simpler relatively speaking. Also RNN outputs could be clubbed with other approaches including even CNN as a few papers have done. I am sure Quants would have many more tricks up their sleeve and quite a few ideas may be unpublished considering the financial ramifications.
