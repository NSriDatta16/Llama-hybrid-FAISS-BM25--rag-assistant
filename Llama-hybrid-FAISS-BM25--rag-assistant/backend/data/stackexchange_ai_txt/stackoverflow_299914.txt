I'm with wisequark on this one. I think of setValue:forKey: as equivalent to calling the setter directly. If you had a method: - (void)setSomeValue:(NSInteger)aValue You wouldn't expect to be able to pass in an NSString and hope the method can figure it out. Put another way, a key value gives you access to a property, and that property has a type. When using KVC, numbers just get wrapped in an NSNumber object so that there's only one setValue:forKey: method. Therefore, I say it's always the calling code's responsibility to package up the string in an NSNumber object. It's times like these I lament that Cocoa Touch doesn't support bindings. Bindings would allow you to add a value transformer that could handle the transformation from string to number automatically for you. Maybe in the next version!
