How can I remove/filter/ignore some package from Emma (code coverage)

I`m trying to remove some package from my report and having trouble. Could some one give me some help? I'm using EMMA in my ant process. sourcepath="${build.report.src}" metrics="class:${coverage.classes.min},method:${coverage.methods.min}"> I`ve tried to use: But with no success :(
