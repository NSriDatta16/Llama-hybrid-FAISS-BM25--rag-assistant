How to identify strong and low performers

Scenario: Our leadership team want to identify deskside technicians that are under-performing so we can provide them additional training and support. I’d like to take data points, do some math and have each technician end up with a “score” so we can see how they rank in effectiveness so we can help those at the bottom. Difficulties: - How do we identify these individual accurately and fairly using data? Types of data we could use (and caveats): Student count in district (more students means larger district, which means more tech that can break and result in tickets) Number (total or average) of support tickets completed per tech – Caveat: We support 18 school districts and not all of them have the same quantity of tickets so some techs may do 30 a day because their volume is higher and some may do 15 because that’s all they get. How do I weight this fairly? Number (total or average) of tickets that have breached our SLA (eg. if the ticket priority demands that it is done in 3 days, how many took > 3 days to complete, thus not satisfying our SLA) Number (total or average) of tickets per site Number (total or average) tickets across all sites % of total (across all sites) tickets each tech closes Average time to close (timestamp of creation minus timestamp of close = duration open) Rankings of each of these compared to other techs There may be other data points so if you have ideas I can tell you if we have a data point, but these are the ones off the top of my head Initial thoughts: Important metrics would be: % tickets breached SLA, total tickets completed (weighted to compensate for high/low ticket volumes), and average time to close I’m thinking possibly: A= Create a fair process for weighting the total tickets completed to compensate for high/low ticket volumes… this just needs to be weighted fairly B= Create a score for time to close, possibly using some percentage +/- the mean across all techs (maybe measured in days?)… we want this to be low C= Create a score for % of tickets breached SLA, possibly using some percentage +/- the mean across all techs… we want this to be low Final score = (B*C)/A ? If so, how do I properly get to A, B & C?
