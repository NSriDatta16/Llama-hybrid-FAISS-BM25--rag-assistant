how to get relationship between words with nlp stanford parser

I am trying to get the connections between string and other words like: The screen is very good so I want to get screen good I just don't know how to get that the subject is screen and the description is very good . My code is public synchronized String test(String s, LexicalizedParser lp){ if (s.isEmpty()) return ""; if (s.length()>80) return ""; System.out.println(s); Tree parse = (Tree) lp.apply(s); TreebankLanguagePack tlp = new PennTreebankLanguagePack(); System.out.println(parse.dependencies(tlp.headFinder())); } Can someone give me an example of how to do it right? The string s is the sentence to find the connection between words.
