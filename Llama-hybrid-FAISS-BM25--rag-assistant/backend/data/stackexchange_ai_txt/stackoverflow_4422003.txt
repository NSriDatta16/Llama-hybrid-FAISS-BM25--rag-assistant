First of all, jQuery , quoting the tag wiki , is a JavaScript library used for "DOM traversal, event handling, animation, and ajax interactions" - it is not used for embedding custom font into your websites. With Cufon, you can embed the font into your website - just follow the instruction on the website carefully, and you should be fine. Alternatively, you can use @font-face technology to do the same in more simply. Collaboration is available on FontSquirrel , and their prepackaged @font-face kits are extremely easy to use. Addressing the last part of your question, those are not different fonts you're looking at, or different weights, even. Those are different anti-aliasing modes offered by Photoshop. In general, anti-aliasing options are controlled at the Operating System level, so there is no way you can affect how the browsers display those fonts in terms of how they're anti-aliased.
