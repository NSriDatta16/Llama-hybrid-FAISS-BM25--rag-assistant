The result shows that there is no significant difference between sites, but if you check site no. 5 in the data, the percentage of fruit is much higher than the rest. True, however, you have only 2 "yes" and 8 "no", that is why the difference is not significant. Did I use the right test? If I did - did I do it right? Would you suggest any other method? The Fisher exact test is appropriate for your data and I have no suggestion of alternatives. Since I'm not an expert in R I can't tell if it was correctly applied. Additional question: I would also like to check if the number of flowers and pH affect the production of fruits on each site. Which test/method should I use in this case - logistic regression? [...] Yes, the logistic regression is appropriate, considering that the fruit variable is dichotomous (yes/no). As independent variables you should consider the site as nominal, using the first or the seventh category as reference, and the pH as continuous variable.
