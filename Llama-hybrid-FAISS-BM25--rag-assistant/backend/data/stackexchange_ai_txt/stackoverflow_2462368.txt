How can I provide values for non-grouped columns in NHibernate?

I have a criteria query: Session.CreateCriteria () .SetProjection(.ProjectionList() .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.location)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.agent)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.cusip)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.SettlementDate)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.salePrice)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.foreignFx)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.batchNumber)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.origSaleDate)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.planName)) .Add(LambdaProjection.GroupProperty (r => r.dateTimeAdded)) .Add(LambdaProjection.Sum (r => r.shares)) .Add(LambdaProjection.Sum (r => r.netMoney)) .Add(LambdaProjection.Sum (r => r.grossMoney)) .Add(LambdaProjection.Sum (r => r.taxWithheld)) .Add(LambdaProjection.Sum (r => r.fees))) .List (); that generates the following SQL: SELECT this_.location as y0_, this_.agent as y1_, this_.cusip as y2_, this_.SettlementDate as y3_, this_.salePrice as y4_, this_.foreignFx as y5_, this_.batchNumber as y6_, this_.origSaleDate as y7_, this_.planName as y8_, this_.dateTimeAdded as y9_, sum(this_.shares) as y10_, sum(this_.netMoney) as y11_, sum(this_.grossMoney) as y12_, sum(this_.taxWithheld) as y13_, sum(this_.fees) as y14_ FROM MIS_IPS_Sell043Report this_ GROUP BY this_.location, this_.agent, this_.cusip, this_.SettlementDate, this_.salePrice, this_.foreignFx, this_.batchNumber, this_.origSaleDate, this_.planName, this_.dateTimeAdded however the Sell043Report table has additional columns than those listed in the SELECT statement so I'm receiving this error when attempting to get a list of Sell043Reports: System.ArgumentException: The value "System.Object[]" is not of type "xyz.Sell043Report" and cannot be used in this generic collection. I suspect the problem is that I'm not selecting all of the columns for a Sell043Report and so it doesn't know how to map the dataset to the object. I'm trying to achieve something like this: SELECT this_.location as y0_, this_.agent as y1_, this_.cusip as y2_, this_.SettlementDate as y3_, this_.salePrice as y4_, this_.foreignFx as y5_, this_.batchNumber as y6_, this_.origSaleDate as y7_, this_.planName as y8_, this_.dateTimeAdded as y9_, sum(this_.shares) as y10_, sum(this_.netMoney) as y11_, sum(this_.grossMoney) as y12_, sum(this_.taxWithheld) as y13_, sum(this_.fees) as y14_, '' as Address1, '' as Address2 // etc FROM MIS_IPS_Sell043Report this_ GROUP BY this_.location, this_.agent, this_.cusip, this_.SettlementDate, this_.salePrice, this_.foreignFx, this_.batchNumber, this_.origSaleDate, this_.planName, this_.dateTimeAdded How can I do this using NHibernate?
