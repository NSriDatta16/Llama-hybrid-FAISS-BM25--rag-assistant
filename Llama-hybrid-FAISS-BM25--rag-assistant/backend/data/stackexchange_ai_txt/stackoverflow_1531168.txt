Strange margin-behaviour with Sifr spans in link (screens)

I'm making a menu and it's supposed to look like picture nr 1 on this link . However, at this moment, it looks like picture nr 2 . There's no logic in this behaviour, since all three elements have the same css-attributes. Moreover, let's change the word "Reiki" to "Psychotherapie" and see what happens... ( picture nr 3 ) For some reason the word "Reiki" ignores certain attributes. This is not a problem when Sifr is turned off. I guess I'll need some extra CSS to solve this (messing with paddings, heights or margins on that specific element doesn't give any result. It just won't budge). Unless someone knows a more elegant solution?
