There is no real consensus for the presentation layer which is to me still a "throwaway" part of a Java EE application. The mentioned solutions don't suffer from big drawbacks or design problems and will do the job. I would just add Stripes which is a very elegant framework based on Convention over Configuration, simple and easy to learn if you have some experience with an action-based framework. And there is also Wicket , although Wick is a component-based framework which is a different paradigm. Just pick one of them (the one you know the most seems to be a decent choice). FYI, Matt Raible has done some nice comparisons of Web Presentation Frameworks that are not totally outdated and still interesting. Check it out.
