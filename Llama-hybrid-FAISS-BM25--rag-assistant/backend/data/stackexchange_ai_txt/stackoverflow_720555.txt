Name suggestions for OpenSource organisation and MVC CMS Project

Hey guys, a couple of us are looking for a collaborative name to work under when developing OpenSource products. The first of which will be an MVC CMS which is designed to be as usable as possible (no admin system all editing done inline). So can you help us name the two: OpenSource Organisation - mainly dealing with .net and mvc solutions MVC CMS - which is highly usable and intuiative Thanks our efforts have failed us so far. We may even give a prize to the winner. Update: We settled on OpenQuarters for our organisation and WebQuarters for our CMS more information at: http://www.openquarters.org
