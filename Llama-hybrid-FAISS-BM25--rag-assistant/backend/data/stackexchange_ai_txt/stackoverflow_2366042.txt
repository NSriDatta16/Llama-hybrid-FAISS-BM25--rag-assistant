Take a look at this thread . One possible way to achieve this would be to use Javascript to examine all of the a tags on your page when it loads and check if they are linking to an external site. If so, you can add an onclick event to show a confirm/alert box or something more elegant. Of course, using jQuery will greatly simplify the Javascript you'll have to write, like in the above thread.
