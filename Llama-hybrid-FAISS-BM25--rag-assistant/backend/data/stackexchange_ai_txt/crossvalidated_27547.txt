I can warmly recommend Michael Greeenacre's books. Biplots in Practice provides a very easy to understand overview of all kinds of biplots (concentrating on multivariate). This book is available as a collection of pdfs for free. Correspondence analysis in Practice gives a good introduction to methods such as PCA, CA and CCA. Both books contain practical explanations and codes for doing it in R.
