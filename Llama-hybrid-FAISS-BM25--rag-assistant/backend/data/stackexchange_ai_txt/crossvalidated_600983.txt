why sklearn SelectFromModel estimator_.coef_ return a 2d-array

My data df_X has 11 features and y is multi-class label. I used multi-class SVM to select importance of features. estimator_.coef_ should return the score of each feature. But why here it returns a list of scores? The same case occured for multi-class LogisticRegression(). By the way, what's the difference between SelectKBest and SelectFromModel for feature selection in sklearn.
