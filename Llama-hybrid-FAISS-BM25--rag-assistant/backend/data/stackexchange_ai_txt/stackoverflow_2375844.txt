What is the most optimized or simplest way to reduce a file name in javascript

I recently created a function in javascript that takes in a file name and a max character limit where the result needs to follow these rules: Always include file extension If shrinking occurs, leave the first part and last part of the file name intact. Always replace the removed characters with '...' If file length is under the max then do nothing You can assume the max is a least 5 chars long Now I've already solved this, but it got me thinking if there is a more elegant or simple way to do this in javascript using regular expressions or some other technique. It also gave me an opportunity to try out jsFiddle . So with that in mind here is my function: function ReduceFileName(name, max){ if(name.length > max){ var end = name.substring(name.lastIndexOf('.')); var begin = name.substring(0, name.lastIndexOf('.')); max = max - end.length - 3; begin = begin.substr(0,max/2) + '...' + begin.substr(begin.length-(max/2) , max/2 + 1); return begin + end; } return name; } And here it is on js Fiddle with tests
