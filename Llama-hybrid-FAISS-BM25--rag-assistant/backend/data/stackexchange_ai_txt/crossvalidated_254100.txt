Power of a test, and repeated sampling

I am currently studying frequentist theory and hypothesis testing and I came across this paragraph in my textbook which I'm finding rather difficult to interpret, particularly the line in bold - "The fundamental notion is that of seeking a test which maximises power, the probability under repeated sampling of correctly rejecting an incorrect hypothesis , subject to some pre-specied fixed size, the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true hypothesis. I'm not sure how to interpret what "repeated sampling" means in this context. Could anyone possibly shed any light on this? Thanks!
