Is it Possible to Use Machine Learning for Ranking Alternatives?

Right now, Iâ€™m working on road and street safety analysis. I have a dataset of dangerous points in four regions of a city. Some of the available variables are road lighting status, ITS, latitude, longitude, longitudinal protection status, type of point control, as well as the number of injuries and deaths for the past two years. Also, there are some dummy variables(road lighting status, ITS, longitudinal protection status, type of point control). I want to know whether I could rank these points from the most dangerous one to the least dangerous one based on their potential danger using machine learning methods. If possible, which methods could help? I would appreciate it if you could share relevant links or references. Thanks in advance.
