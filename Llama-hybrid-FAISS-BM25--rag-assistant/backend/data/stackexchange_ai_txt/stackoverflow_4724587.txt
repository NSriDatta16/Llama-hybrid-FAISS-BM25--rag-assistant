How to Prevent Caching When using PDF Streaming with Acrobar Reader 10.0 (HTTP1.0/HTTP1.1)

I was trying to find a way to prevent browsers from caching PDF that is being loaded using a streaming methods. FireFox and Chorme deals just fine with the following headers and doesn't cache any pdf file: Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache, no-store"); Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0"); Response.AddHeader("Expires", "-1"); Although, IE 7 (with acrobat reader 9.4.1) works only with the following headers and prevent the caching of the PDF doc: Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache, no-store"); Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "private, must-revalidate, max-age=0"); Response.AddHeader("Expires", "-1"); When i was trying to use IE 7 with Acrobat Reader 10, the above header didn't make any different and cached the PDF no matter what i tried. When i am trying to put Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, the pdf was not loaded at all. According to my understanding, IE use the cache mechanism to load the PDF documents. Is there anyone familiar with a global or specific way (by using other headers for example) that can help prevent caching of PDF documents?
