Since the test is a "correct/not correct" decision for each item you could consider the scores to be from a binomial distribution (if the chances of spelling a word correct are equal and independent) and use binomial distributions to compare, possibly through a logistic regression model. With the small sample sizes and possibility of non-independence, I would look at using a permutation test (the MW U-test is a special case of a permutation test). But consider that with the data you describe, any difference could be due to the teaching method, the teacher, or a classroom effect (one of the students inspired the others to study harder, or distracted everyone, creating a difference that would not be seen in another class receiving the same method).
