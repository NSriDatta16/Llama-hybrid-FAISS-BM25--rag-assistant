how to insert a specific data in text file(with .log extension) into database table?

I have managed to insert the whole text-file data in SQL-SERVER database table with this statement BULK INSERT [dbo].[tablename] FROM 'c:\weblog.log' WITH ( FIELDTERMINATOR = ' ', ROWTERMINATOR = '\n' ) But my text-file is not organized in any format and it contains some data i want to omit from the insertion process. So i am looking for a way to be able to only insert some of the data in the text-file into my database table?
