A tool used by us was CodeWizard from Parasoft. But I think the new version is called "Parasoft C++ Test". From the homepage: Static analysis of code for compliance with user-selected coding standards Graphical RuleWizard editor for creating custom coding rules Static code path simulation for identifying potential runtime errors Automated code review with a graphical interface and progress tracking Automated generation and execution of unit and component-level tests Flexible stub framework Full support for regression testing Code coverage analysis with code highlighting Runtime memory error checking during unit test execution Full team deployment infrastructure for desktop and command line usage
