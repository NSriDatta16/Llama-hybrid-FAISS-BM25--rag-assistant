Open Addressing vs. Separate Chaining

Which hashmap collision handling scheme is better when the load factor is close to 1 to ensure minimum memory wastage? I personally think the answer is open addressing with linear probing, because it doesn't need any additional storage space in case of collisions. Is this correct?
