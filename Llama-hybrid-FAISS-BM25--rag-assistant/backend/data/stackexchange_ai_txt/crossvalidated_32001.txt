What's the difference between mathematical statistics and statistics?

What's the difference of mathematical statistics and statistics? I've read this : Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data. It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. And this : Mathematical statistics is the study of statistics from a mathematical standpoint, using probability theory as well as other branches of mathematics such as linear algebra and analysis. So what would be the difference beetween them? I can understand that the processes of collection may not be mathematical, but I guess that organization, analysis and interpretation are, am I missing something?
