I agree with you that the ROC AUC can be very misleading - a model with a high AUC can have a large number of false positives, which as you mentioned can be very undesirable in many circumstances. popular data science libraries (such as scikit) do not implement it: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics Scikit-learn does have an implementation of partial AUC. You calculate the ROC AUC using sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score and specify the desired maximum false positive rate using the max_fpr parameter. This will give you the AUC only within a certain range a false positive rate between 0 and the maximum you specify. e.g., partial_auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred, max_fpr=0.05)
