tSNE is NOT a Dimensionality Reduction algorithm but a Visualization method . The reason is that it is non-parametric and can not model a new data in the same way. What you are looking for is UMAP and yes, you can reduce dimensionality and use a clustering method to find clusters (indeed this is a common practice in clustering)
