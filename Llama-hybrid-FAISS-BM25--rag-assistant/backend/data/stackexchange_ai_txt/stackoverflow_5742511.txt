You could set the DefaultButton on the Form or the Panel surrounding your TextBox to an invisible(display:none) Button. On this way you have full control what happens when user hits enter-key without (browser-dependent) Javascript. If you don't handle its onclick-event, the enter-key will be suppressed. http://geekswithblogs.net/ranganh/archive/2006/04/12/74951.aspx
