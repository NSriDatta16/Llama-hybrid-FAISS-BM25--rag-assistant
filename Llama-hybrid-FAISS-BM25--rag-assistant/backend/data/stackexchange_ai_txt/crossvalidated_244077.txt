Outliers should never be excluded. They are a part of your data set for a reason—namely something unusual happened. You may want to use the data to detect if a transcription error occured. If that is the case, the error is corrected and the data re-examined. By ignoring data when things are not what is expected or undesireable, you miss the whole point of examining the data. An "outlier" is a point which is 1.5 times the Inner Quartile Range (IQR) from the First Quartile to the Minimum value or from the Third Quartile to the Maximum. If you are trying to detect which points would not be caused by common-cause variation, then you should use an $I-MR$ or an $x-MR$ chart, which plots $\bar{x}\pm3\hat{s}$ as well as a moving range with its control limits. The limits on the individual $x$ chart are based on the average moving range, $\overline{MR}$ and are readily accessible . The linked page also includes the WECO rules for determining if a process is out of statistical control on a Shewhart chart. A greater discussion and resource can be found on the NIST website . If these methods for identifying special cause variation have helped you to identify and eliminate the special causes, then you can start from the improvement going forward to calculate new parameters and continue to monitor for special causes. You should never go back in time and eliminate the data of a problem—especially if it is a problem you never solved: it is all a part of the variation in the process that needs to be dealt with.
