AIC/BIC of ARIMA and ARIMA-GARCH

I was modelling a time series with an ARIMA(1,1,1) model which had an AIC of -4782.96. However, after checking squared residuals and performing ARCH tests (Engle's and McLeod-Li) I detected the presence of ARCH effects up to lag 7. Therefore, it seemed like ARIMA(1,1,1)-GARCH(1,1) would be a good idea. However, the AIC of the ARIMA-GARCH model dropped significantly; it is only -2.36. Does this indicate the ARIMA-GARCH model is worse? What could have caused this and how should I interpret this? My rcode for ARIMA-GARCH is: tryg3 Where ldVIXCLS is differenced log series of the VIX index. I would greatly appreciate any input!:)
