NMF and LDA models produce topic-word and document-topic distributions, so you can compare these models on evaluation tasks of topic coherence (i.e. evaluating topic-word distributions), document clustering/classification (i.e. evaluating document-topic distributions) or information retrieval (i.e. evaluating topic-word and document-topic distributions together). See some examples in " Improving topic models with latent feature word representations ", " LDA-Based Document Models for Ad-hoc Retrieval ".
