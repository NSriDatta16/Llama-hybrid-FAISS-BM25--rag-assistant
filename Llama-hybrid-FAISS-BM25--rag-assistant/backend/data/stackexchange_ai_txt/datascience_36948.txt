Since these two data points have identical features, they will always predict same output, as what machine learning algorithms learn is the mapping from input to output. That being said, they still have different output, since they are different in other features not included in your dataset. Therefore, machine learning algorithm cannot distinguish the difference between such pair of data since their input are completely the same. Actually, such problem always exist. Generally, decision trees will predict the majority for each leaf. There are two things you can do though: As DaFanat said, output a probability to show the uncertainty. Include more features to reduce the uncertainty.
