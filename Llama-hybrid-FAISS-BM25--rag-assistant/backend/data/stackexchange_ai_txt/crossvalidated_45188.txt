Prediction Interval for Neural Net With Hessian :: nnet in R

I would like to construct a confidence interval around prediction from a neural network, without resorting to bootstrapping - given the computational cost. Can I use the Hessian returned in this way to produce a 95% CI? 1) Can you take the negative inverse of the Hessian as the var/covar matrix? I read here that this depends on what is being maximized or minimized. Is this true and how can you know for certain? 2) Is this an accepted routine for producing a confidence interval around a prediction and if so, how would you do it?
