Nested linear mixed modeling including a factor applicable to one subject group only

I am trying to build a nested linear mixed model (LMM) where 2 subject groups are compared, each with a set of measurements (time series). The outcome measure (dependent variable) is speech understanding. One subject group is a patient group wearing an auditory prosthetic (a cochlear implant, or CI), the other a control group (normal hearing, or NH). A total of 32 subjects are included. For the CI group we know that the time they used their CI plays a role in their outcome. We wish to take this factor into account in the LMM. The problem: time of CI use cannot be used as a fixed effects co-variate because it doesn't apply to the control group, since they don't have an implant. Labeling them as '0 years' would also not be OK, because that would imply they have a CI, but haven't used them. So how should I include time-of-device-use in the LMM? I tried fumbling around with the addition of random variables besides the 'subject ID' but that resulted in error messages in SPSS, as it can't seem to build the model anymore with more than 1 random factor (possibly because of the small subject population). In short: can I add a factor into a nested LMM that applies to one group of subjects only, and if yes, how? I'm using SPSS and I am not proficient with R, unfortunately.
