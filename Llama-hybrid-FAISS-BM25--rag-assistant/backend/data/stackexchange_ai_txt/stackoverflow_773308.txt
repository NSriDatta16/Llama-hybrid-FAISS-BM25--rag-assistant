IE (HTTPS): generating pdf from php file doesn't work

Here is my issue. I am trying to call a page: foo.php?docID=bar and return a PDF to the screen which is stored as a BLOB in the DB. Here is the portion of my code which actually returns the PDF: $docID = isset($_REQUEST['docID']) ? $_REQUEST['docID'] : null; if ($docID == null){ die("Document ID was not given."); } $results = getDocumentResults($docID); if (verifyUser($user, $results['ProductId'])){ header('Content-type: application/pdf'); // this is the BLOB data from the results. print $results[1]; } else{ die('You are not allowed to view this document.'); } This works perfectly fine in Firefox. However, in IE, it doesn't show anything at all. If i'm on another page (i.e. google.com), and I type in the URL to go to this page, it will say it's done, but I will still have google.com on my screen. I checked the headers for the responses from both firefox and IE. They are identical. Does anyone have any suggestions? Need more information? EDIT : If it helps at all, here's the response header and the first line of the content: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 349930 Content-Type: application/pdf Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.2 Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=cql3n3oc13crv3r46h2q04dvq4; path=/; domain=.example.com Content-Disposition: inline; filename='downloadedFile.pdf' X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Tue, 21 Apr 2009 16:35:59 GMT %PDF-1.4 EDIT : Also, the page which pulls out the pdf file actually uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. Thanks in advance, ~Zack
