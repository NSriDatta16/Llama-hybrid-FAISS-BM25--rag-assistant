Predict the probability that a customer buy today

My company sells a single product that is a commodity. If you buy it, I can be sure that you will buy it again in the near future from me or from my competitors . The demand is affected by the weather. If we have high temperatures my product sales decrease, and vice-versa. I have this data per sale: Customer Average temperature in the day of the sale Amount of product bought in a transaction Size of the customer warehouse Price at the moment of the purchase Timestamp of the sale The problem: I want, based on historic time series data, to get the Probability that a customer requires my product today. I would like to have a %. Customer X have a 70% of probability of require your product today based on the historic. With that I could get a list of all the customers that today have 80% or more probability of buying and take action with that. The complexities I see: I have a lot of data because I have a lot of customers but for a single customer I have an average of only 5 purchases. If the customer is not loyal and gets the product from my competitors I have holes that make sales separated by a irregular time spans. What would be a good algorithm to tackle this problem? I thought about regressions using time series but I won't get a probability. Maybe transform the timestamp of re-purchase per customer in my training set and try to cluster based on days between purchases.
