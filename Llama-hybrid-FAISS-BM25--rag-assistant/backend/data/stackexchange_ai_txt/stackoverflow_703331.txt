There is a new set of Ant tasks that use Mercury. Mercury is the refactored code that will be the basis of way that Maven 3 interacts with Maven (and OSGi) repositories that is being implemented by Oleg Gusakov. Mercury is well tested, and you can start using it in Ant projects today. Take a look at some of the How-to documents that Oleg has written: http://people.apache.org/~ogusakov/sites/mercury-ant/mercury-ant-tasks/howto.html Here's a simple example of using Mercury in an Ant build.xml file. The following build file creates a classpath that depends on verion 3.0 of the asm artifact: There are a lot of advanced features such as support for verifying PGP signatures or MD5 digests. You can also start to define different repositories that Mercury depends on. This XML allows you to define a reference to a repository such as Nexus in addition to using a local directory as a repository: If you need to reference a repository that requires authentication Mercury has support for storing a username and password: Most compelling is the ability to publish an artifact to a repository from an Ant build file. If you work in an organization of any scale, you'll want to start thinking about deploying artifacts to a repository manager like Nexus . With Mercury, you can start deploying artifacts to a repository manager without having to adopt Maven. Here's a build file that defines an authenticated repository and writes an artifact: Mercury is ready to use, and you can expect a lot of developments from Oleg going forward. If you want to start using it, the best place to look is at Oleg's How-to Page . (Note: This information will soon be integrated into the Definitive Guide )
