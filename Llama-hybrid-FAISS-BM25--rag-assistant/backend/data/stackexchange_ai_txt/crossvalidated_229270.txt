How can I test whether the mean return of stock indices is 0?

I have daily return data for SPX over 50 years. And I calculate the mean return by just taking arithmetic average. I want to test the hypothesis whether the mean is 0. Can I use the t statistic, which is (mean-0)/sample varirance, to test whether the mean return is 0? If not, what statistic should I use? Thanks.
