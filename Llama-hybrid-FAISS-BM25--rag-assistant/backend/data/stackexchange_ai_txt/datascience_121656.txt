You describe that the correlation between survival rate and the variable "SibSp" is first increasing and then decreasing. In this case a logistic regression seems like the wrong choice. The relationship is clearly not linear. A logistic regression means that you apply a logarithmic function to your variables. This models (some specific) non-linear relationsships but the relationsship is still monotonic, more of one variable always implies more of the other variable. This doesn't fit your example. In this example I would suggest to bin the "SibSp" variable, that is map the numbers to a finite collection of groups (say between 0 and 1, between 1 and 2 and so forth) and then use these bins as a categorical variable in your model.
