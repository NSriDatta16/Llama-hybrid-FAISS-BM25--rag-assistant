Choose any classifier you like and which fits your requirements...would be the "easy" answer :D Your problem sounds as if you could go for an easy algorithm for classification up to complicated ones depending on which additional features you want to use. From the top of my head seasonal features could be interesting: Days until the next public holiday, days until christmas, vacation yes/no, month, etc. Your output is binary which in principal could mean that you start with a Perceptron (or Multi Layer Perceptron) as a start. A neural network of your choice would be fine as well. If you want to start with an easy to implement algorithm (for example as a benchmark for further experiments), maybe go with an easy decision tree or logistic regression.
