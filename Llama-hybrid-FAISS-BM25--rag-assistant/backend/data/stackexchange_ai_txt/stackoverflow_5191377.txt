storing a database connection string into my.settings in a .net DLL data layer

Hy everybody I've always used this approach while implementing data layer DLL for web application: 1) put datasets into the dll project 2) use a helper class with a method like this: public shared sub settCnnStr(strconnhere as string) My.Settings.Item("connectionString") = strconnhere end sub 3) when I need to use the dll I call a method like this (usually into global.asax): xxxxxxx.helper.setCnnStr("yyyyyyyyyyyyyy") This method always worked for me nicely but I'd like to know if this method could have serious drawback or if there's a better solution. thanks Pierluigi
