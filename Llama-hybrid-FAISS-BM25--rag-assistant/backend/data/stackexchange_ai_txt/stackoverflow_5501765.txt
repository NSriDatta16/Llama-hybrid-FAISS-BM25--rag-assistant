I think you have a simple requirement of a User Referring Other user to join. If that is the case then you can simply have one more column ReferenceUserID in User Table and whenever a new user refers another user then simply add him with a UserID of referring user. If he isn't a referred user then by default it will be NULL . Later for retrieval you can use a Self Join. Update: For Friend (many to many relationship) you should look at following Question at StackOverflow Database design: Best table structure for capturing the User/Friend relationship? UserRelationship ==== RelatingUserID RelatedUserID Type[friend, block, etc] A similar approach is used by Facebook where they have a kind of Cross join Table for relation between Friends.
