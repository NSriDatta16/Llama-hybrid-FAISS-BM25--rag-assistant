Simple Question about ROC Curve

Motivated by this reference , it states under ROC Space When evaluating a binary classifier, we often use a Confusion Matrix...however here we need only TPR and FPR I'd feel more comfortable if the ROC were instead called positive-ROC suggesting there is an alternative ROC curve that is used from TNR and FNR. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Everywhere I've looked, ROC refers to using T P R and F P R, specifically. Is there a version of the ROC curve that instead accounts to average the success of positive and negative example classification, say $\frac{1}{2}(ROC_{+} + ROC_-)$?, where $ROC_+$ is the popular metric using TPR/FPR and $ROC_-$ is the unpopular version of the same curve using TNR/FNR? My question is, what makes TPR, FPR so much better than chosing TNR, FNR for the ROC curve? Why is it more important ( that is, ROC is a popular metric) to consider classification of positive examples than negative?
