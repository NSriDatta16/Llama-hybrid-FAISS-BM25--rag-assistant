linear regression on time series - has to be stationary, even when finding relationship between X and y?

Question I am finding a relationship between the stock price and other features(predictors) such as the popularity among users or the price of ingredients. My goal is not to predict the future stock price. I am going to use linear regression between stock price (y) and features (X) Example Let's say I am curious to know the relationship between the stock price of Microsoft and "PC sales" and "Games sold". The example table is shown below. Do I need to calculate the percentage change of these values to make them more stationary values before applying a linear regression? So should I regress "Game sales growth" and "PC sales growth" on "stock return"? Or can I just regress the "Games sold" and "PC sales" on stock price?
