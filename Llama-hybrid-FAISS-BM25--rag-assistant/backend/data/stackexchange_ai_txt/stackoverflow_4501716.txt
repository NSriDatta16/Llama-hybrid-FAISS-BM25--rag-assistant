You can do this without complication. As long as you load ga.js, instantiate var gaq , and set the account, you can make any calls you want, including _trackPageview with only a virtual pageview value. You don't even need to call the organic _trackPageview -- you could just do event tracking. In fact, you might want to consider doing an organic pageview, coupled with an Event Tracking that passes some detailed error tracking info to you. Because there can be up to 4 parameters, you can log more and better structured data. So, on your 404 page, you could call something like: _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', '404 Error', location.pathname, document.referrer, time_stamp_value]); (where you've previously defined time_stamp_value as a non-float Number.) Something that simple will allow you to create hierarchies for your errors, count them more easily, and even do things like the referring page and a timestamp value, without cluttering your pageview information.
