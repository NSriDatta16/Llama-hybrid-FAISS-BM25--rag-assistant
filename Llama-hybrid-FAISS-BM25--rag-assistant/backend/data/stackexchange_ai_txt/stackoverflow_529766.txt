Name your projects in a way that helps developers know what they are when you put the under source control. Outside of your current source control it doesn't matter what people call it. Try to pick a naming convention that stays the same it will help organize things in your source control and try to stay away from initials and abbreviations because once all the DEVs on that project leave no one will know what the project is. Try sticking to names like: customerA Website customerB WinApp
