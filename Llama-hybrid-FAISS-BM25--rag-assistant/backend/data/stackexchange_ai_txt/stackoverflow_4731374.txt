So from what it sounds, you need to declare (in .h): - (IBAction) closeWindowA:(id)self; Then tell your application what closeWindowA really does (in. m): - (IBAction) closeWindowA { // your code goes here. Look up method(s) for closing the window - don't know them by heart } Then, just connect your Button or whatever is triggering the action in Interface builder using the draggable connections. Hope this helps - I also have to recommend 'Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX' by Aaron Hillegas. Helps tremendously in understanding these kinds of things.
