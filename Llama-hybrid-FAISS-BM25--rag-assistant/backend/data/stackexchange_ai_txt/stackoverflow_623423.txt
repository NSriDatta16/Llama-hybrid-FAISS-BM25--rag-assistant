What is an easy way to explain how Garbage Collection works?

I have a short attention span so I couldn't make my way through the Wikipedia article . I understand there are several techniques for garbage collection but a common one is the "reachability" test, where an object's eligibility for collection is based on whether or not it can be "reached" by a rooted object (which, to my understanding is an object that is known to not require collection). When you want to know if a certain object is reachable, how would you go about it? How do you know where to look? The collector obviously must be aware of all allocated objects and rooted objects. How does it determine the reachability of each of these objects?
