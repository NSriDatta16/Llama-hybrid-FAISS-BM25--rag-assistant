You should also have a look at Sonar . Its dashboard reports data generated by many code analysers like Findbugs, Checkstyle or Cobertura. It's really quick and easy to navigate in measures like Findbugs bugs. Of course it's possible to filter data by severity (see the page "violations drilldown"). The release 1.9 only supports two levels of severity (mandatory/optional) but next version will define five levels from info to blocker. It should be released next week.
