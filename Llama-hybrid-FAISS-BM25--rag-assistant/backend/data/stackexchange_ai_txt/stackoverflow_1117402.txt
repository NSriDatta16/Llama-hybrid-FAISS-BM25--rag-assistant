Seems to me that there is not a lot of commonality between the different offerings. (for example, the 3 you mentioned....) S3 is more of a machine image type solution, think ESX server in the cloud, so your apps are just deployed to an instance of a machine image, Linux or Windows. AppEngine is a hosted app environment for either Python or Java apps (Java support added just recently) Azure (compute) is more analogous to a hosted ASP.NET web app with a bunch of additional services (messaging, blob storage etc) So while there is some commonality, I don't think app migration between most of these offerings are all that straight forward. However I also don't think its impossible. EDIT: Actually I lie, S3 is not a machine image solution, I was confusing that with EC2 . S3 is a datastorage solution that has nothing to do with hosted applications. (apart from perhaps being a hosted app's storage solution).
