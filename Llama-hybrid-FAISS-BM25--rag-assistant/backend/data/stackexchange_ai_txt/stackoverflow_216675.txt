To answer your question about the speed of online backups of BLOBs in SQL Server, it's the same speed as backing up regular data for SQL 2000/2005/2008 - it's typically limited by the speed of your storage. I usually get over 100mb/sec on my database backups with BLOBs. Be wary of using backup compression tools with those, though - if the BLOB is binary-style data that's heavily random, then you'll waste CPU cycles trying to compress the data, and compression can make the backup slower instead of faster.
