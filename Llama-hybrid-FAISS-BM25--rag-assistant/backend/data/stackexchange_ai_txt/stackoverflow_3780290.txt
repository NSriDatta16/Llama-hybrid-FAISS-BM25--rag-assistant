organization of Redmine projects?

I'm the sole developer working on a couple of webapp sites. I have them in subversion, but I'm not using a project management tool. I recently got redmine up and going, and I want to set up the projects in there. What I'm looking for is a recommendation as to how to structure these two projects in Redmine. From what I can glean, the structure is Project->subproject . So I'm trying to map this to my to-do list structure. From my to-do list, there are three kinds of tasks: new features, bug fixes, and maintenance ( not quite bug fixes but things that really need cleanup ). Should I make each webapp a top-level project, with Features, Bugs, and Maintenance as subprojects? What other ways of organizing projects are there? For instance, in the subversion manual, they recommend having project/trunk , project/branches , project/testing , project/releases , etc. Are there similar guidelines for working in Redmine?
