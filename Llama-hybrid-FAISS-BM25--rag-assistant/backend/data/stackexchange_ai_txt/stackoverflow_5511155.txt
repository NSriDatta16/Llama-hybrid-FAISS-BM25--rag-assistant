Don't use Papyrus with the sequence diagram because it doesn't really work well. It is impossible to create a diagram with this tool. The other tools you mentioned are a lot better. After studing all the market tools my conclusions are: The best sequence diagram on the market is RSA IBM. The best Class diagram is Omondo EclipseUML. The best usecase diagram is RSA and Visual Paragdigm. By the way the xmi model of the sequence diagram has never been a success and is really a mess. Except the sequence diagram all the other diagrams at really well-done at model/xmi by the OMG specification of UML 2.3. Really good specification but sequence diagram was and is still a misery !! s
