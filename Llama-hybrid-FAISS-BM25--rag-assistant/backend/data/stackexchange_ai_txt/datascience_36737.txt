PCA is a linear transformation of your variables to a set of uncorrelated ones. It is good when you want to remove redundancy (in a linear sense) in your data but it is bad if you want to uncover the "true cause" of the variables. Furthermore the causes can be non-linear in nature and the behavior of your data cannot be captured using a linear model. Then you would stay away from PCA and consider e.g. non linear dimensionality reduction methods
