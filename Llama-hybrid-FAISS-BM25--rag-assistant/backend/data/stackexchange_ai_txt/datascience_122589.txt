Do prediction intervals for Random Forest predictions are average of prediction intervals of trees being Random Forest estimators?

I am working on adding prediction intervals for each prediction value of new input samples. Do prediction intervals for Random Forest predictions are average of prediction intervals of trees being Random Forest estimators? Since predictions of Random Forest is an average of predictions of each tree that is Random Forest's estimator
