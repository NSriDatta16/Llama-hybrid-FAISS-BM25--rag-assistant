What are some instructive examples of machine learning reproducing the behaviour of simulators?

I have a computer model which reproduce the behaviour of a physical system we want to control. The model includes a bit of fluid dynamics, heat exchange, pressure calculations etc. Inputs include both prior information like pipe geometry and real-time information like how we choose to control pumps. I would like to build a machine learning system that "learns" from a large number of model-runs for the following purposes: A "stand-in" for the orignal model, that produces approximate results a lot faster. (similar to what caching and interpolation methods may achieve) To later learn from real-world system runs, so as to transcend the original simulator in some aspects. (e.g "learn" the correct heat-loss from a pipe) Eventually, learn to control the system more optimally Starting out with purpose 1 I'm at a loss for good practical examples. I can see that both reinforcement learning and system identification are relevant. Also, deep learning might be applicable, given that I can produce an unlimited number of simulator runs. However, case studies that could help single out practical and relevant approaches would be most appreciated.
