Read something about distributed databases, it might give you another perspective on data-storages. I'm not saying distributed databases are the best option for you. Just read it and see if it's the thing you're looking for. http://www.google.com/search?q=distributed+database http://cassandra.apache.org/ http://voltdb.com/ or read some articles from http://highscalability.com/ Good luck!
