make predictions of the diagnoses at a future date based on prior medical history Good. Note that ICD10 groups ailments hierarchically, and it seems reasonable to score a win if a patient with complex emphysema issues is admitted with "lung1" symptom and then is predicted to be admitted with a similar symptom when ground truth says it was a related "lung2" symptom. One possibility for scoping down this ambitious problem is to segregate patients into Simple and Complex health histories. The Complex patients may actually be easier to deal with, given their repeat admissions for related issues. It is possible that the input dataset reveals genetic or environmental predispositions to disease, based other patient histories in the dataset. Every patient has mammalian organ systems, and the ICD10 hierarchy reflects that. Consider slicing the input dataset along organ systems: solving a lung problem, a heart problem, a liver problem, and so on. Recall that the business problem is that U.S. hospitals are financially incented to avoid early discharge of patients who may soon be re-admitted for the same illness. So you may wish to focus your analysis on rapid re-admits. You didn't mention the timeframe for your observed examples. If it spans decades, you may be able to contrast hospital discharge behavior before and after readmission incentives went into effect.
