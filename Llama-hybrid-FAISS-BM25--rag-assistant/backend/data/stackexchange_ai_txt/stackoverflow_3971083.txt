Caching videos on client browser?

I want to stream video from my web server (might be google app engine, or amazon simple storage). I'm curious if browsers can somehow cache a video. My site will often have users playing the same video over and over again, and I'm wondering if I can hint the browser to just cache videos from my site so the user isn't constantly streaming (thus, reducing my operating costs). Is there some way to do this? I haven't picked a streaming video player yet, not sure if that factors into this, Thanks
