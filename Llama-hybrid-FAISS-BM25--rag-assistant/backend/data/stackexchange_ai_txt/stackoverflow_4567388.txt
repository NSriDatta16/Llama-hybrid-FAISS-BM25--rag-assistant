Why does touchesBegan stop working when UIImageView in placed inside a UIScrollView?

UIView -> UIImageView I know I have things somewhat working ok since I can tap on my UIImageView and see an NSLog() statement in my touchesBegan method. . UIView -> UIScrollView -> UIImageView I drag that same UIImageView into a UIScrollView and touchesBegan no longer gets called when I tap on my UIImageView . (I haven't changed anything else. All the same connections, methods, and code remains unchanged.) Why does touchesBegan no longer work? And what can I do to get it working again?
