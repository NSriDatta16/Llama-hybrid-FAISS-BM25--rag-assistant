It used to be that crackers would figure this sort of stuff out by reading. There are examples in HTTP::Request::Common, which LWP::UserAgent tells you to check out for sending POST data. You only need to send the form data, not the meta data that goes with it. You might have an easier time using WWW::Mechanize since it has a much more human-centric interface.
