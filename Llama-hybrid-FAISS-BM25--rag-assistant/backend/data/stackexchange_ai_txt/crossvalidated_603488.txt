Bayesian inference for a model that is a Poisson process

Suppose you have some data, represented by the vector $\bf{y}$ , and you have a model that maps parameters in vector $\bf{x}$ to $\bf{y}$ : $$f(\bf{x}) = \bf{y}$$ Suppose that $f$ is actually a Poisson process. So given $\bf{x}$ , you can imagine sampling a poisson distribution to compute $\bf{y}$ . This is a stochastic process, such that evaluating $f(\bf{x})$ two times with the same $\bf{x}$ can yield a different $\bf{y}$ , because you are sampling a Poisson distribution. Now suppose given data $\bf{y}$ , you want to do a Bayesian inversion for the $\bf{x}$ parameters. To do this with a method like MCMC you must evaluate the the likelihood function, $p(\bf{y} | \bf{x})$ , which involves computing $f(\bf{x})$ , so therefore the likelihood function is a Poisson process. How do you do this inference problem? Is it OK to just code this up using a MCMC algorithm like emcee such that $p(\bf{y} | \bf{x})$ samples poisson distributions, and therefore has some randomness? Or is there a better way to do the problem? Edit: I’m most uncomfortable with a likelihood function that is not deterministic / contains randomness. Is this ok? Edit 2: I’ve realized this question is not very well explained, so I have posted a new question: Bayesian inversion with a stochastic likelihood function
