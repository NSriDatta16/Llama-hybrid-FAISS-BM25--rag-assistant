Determine which Unit Tests to Run Based on Diffs

Does anyone know of a tool that can help determine which unit tests should be run based on the diffs from a commit? For example, assume a developer commits something that only changes one line of code. Now, assume that I have 1000 unit tests, with code coverage data for each unit test (or maybe just for each test suite). It is unlikely that the developer's one-line change will need to run all 1000 test cases. Instead, maybe only a few of those unit tests actually come into contact with this one-line change. Is there a tool out there that can help determine which test cases are relevant to a developer's code changes? Thanks!
