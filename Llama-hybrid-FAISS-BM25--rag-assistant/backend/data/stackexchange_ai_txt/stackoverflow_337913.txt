Apparently VS 2010 will do a LOT more for multi monitor setups. ScottGu went over this at DevConnections 2008, and a few more times, usually wherever he goes. I got the impression that the MDI or tabbed codefiles might be able to be detached from the IDE, and float/draggable onto another monitor. As it stands today in VS 2008, Solution Explorer, Immediate Window, etc are detachable and be able to float onto another monitor, separate from the main IDE.
