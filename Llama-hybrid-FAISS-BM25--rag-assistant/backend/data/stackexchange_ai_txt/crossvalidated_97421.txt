To get some intuition for what is going on, let us feel free to make $N$ very large and in so doing ignore $O(1/N)$ behavior and exploit asymptotic theorems that state both Beta and Binomial distributions become approximately Normal. (With some trouble, all this can be made rigorous.) When we do this, the result emerges from a specific relationship among the various parameters. Because we plan to use Normal approximations we will pay attention to the expectations and variances of the variables: As Binomial$(N, p)$ variates, $n_A$ and $n_B$ have expectations of $pN$ and variances of $p(1-p)N$. Consequently $\alpha=n_A/N$ and $\beta=n_B/N$ have expectations of $p$ and variance $p(1-p)/N$. As a Beta$(n_A+1, N+1-n_A)$ variate, $P_A$ has an expectation of $(n_A+1)/(N+2)$ and a variance of $(n_A+1)(N+1-n_A) / [(N+2)^2(N+3)]$. Approximating, we find that $P_A$ has an expectation of $$\mathbb{E}(P_A) = \alpha+O(1/N)$$ and a variance of $$\text{Var}(P_A) = \alpha(1-\alpha)/N + O(1/N^2),$$ with similar results for $P_B$. Let us therefore approximate the distributions of $P_A$ and $P_B$ with Normal$(\alpha, \alpha(1-\alpha)/N)$ and Normal$(\beta,\beta(1-\beta)/N)$ distributions (where the second parameter designates the variance ). The distribution of $P_A-P_B$ consequently is approximately Normal; to wit, $$P_A-P_B \approx \text{Normal}\left(\alpha-\beta, \frac{\alpha(1-\alpha) + \beta(1-\beta)}{N}\right).$$ For very large $N$, the expression $\alpha(1-\alpha) + \beta(1-\beta)$ will not vary appreciably from $p(1-p)+p(1-p)=2p(1-p)$ except with very low probability (another neglected $O(1/N)$ term). Accordingly, letting $\Phi$ be the standard normal CDF, $$\Pr(P_A\gt P_B) =\Pr(P_A-P_B\gt 0) \approx \Phi\left(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{2p(1-p)/N}}\right).$$ But since $\alpha-\beta$ has zero mean and variance $2p(1-p)/N,$ $Z=\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\sqrt{2p(1-p)/N}}$ is a standard Normal variate (at least approximately). $\Phi$ is its probability integral transform ; $\Phi(Z)$ is uniform .
