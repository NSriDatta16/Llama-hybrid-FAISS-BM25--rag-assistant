Oracle does not have the concept of "clustered indexes" as SQL Server does. In general, Oracle table are "heaps" with the data stored in no particular order. There is a special type of table called an INDEX ORGANIZED table, which is (as its name suggests) a table that is organised like an index. However, in Oracle most tables would not be index organized - whereas my understanding is that most tables in SQL Server do have a clustered index. Do not be tempted to declare all your Oracle tables as index organized in an attempt to emulate SQL Server; what is right for one DBMS is not necessarily right for another. I suggest you read the Oracle Database Concepts guide to get to know how Oracle works. Index organized tables are identified by IOT_TYPE = 'IOT' in ALL_TABLES and USER_TABLES.
