Magento backend problem

I've just installed Magento on my website, but I can't access the backend. The frontend works fine, but in the backend once I successfully login, it takes me to a blank screen. I've read there's an issue with cookies and I've tried a range of commenting out lines in varien.php, but didn't work.
