How to parse and output JSON object with dynamic values?

I need to output JSON object, that looks like: { "dynamicvaluenumberone":3, "dynamicvaluenumbertwo":7 } In something, that looks like: dynamicvaluenumberone (3), dynamicvaluenumbertwo(7) I've found some articles with static values or parsing JSON with jQuery. I don't want to use any framework to do this simple task.
