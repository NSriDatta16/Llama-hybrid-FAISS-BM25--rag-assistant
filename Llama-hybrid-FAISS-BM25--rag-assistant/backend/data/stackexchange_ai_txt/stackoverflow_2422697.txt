How to code Fizzbuzz in F#

I am currently learning F# and have tried (an extremely) simple example of FizzBuzz. This is my initial attempt: for x in 1..100 do if x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0 then printfn "FizzBuzz" elif x % 3 = 0 then printfn "Fizz" elif x % 5 = 0 then printfn "Buzz" else printfn "%d" x What solutions could be more elegant/simple/better (explaining why) using F# to solve this problem? Note: The FizzBuzz problem is going through the numbers 1 to 100 and every multiple of 3 prints Fizz, every multiple of 5 prints Buzz, every multiple of both 3 AND 5 prints FizzBuzz. Otherwise, simple the number is displayed. Thanks :)
