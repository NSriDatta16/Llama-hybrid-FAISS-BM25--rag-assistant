Eager loading of collection properties during query execution

Is there a way to eagerly load the child collections of entities fetched in a query without having to specify the paths of the collections as string s in the Expand method? Currently I have the following: foo_entities ctx = new foo_entities(new Uri("http://url/FooService.svc/")); ctx.MergeOption = MergeOption.AppendOnly; var things = ctx.Things .Expand("ChildCollectionProperty1," + "..." + "ChildCollectionPropertyN"); foreach (var item in things) { foreach (var child in item.ChildCollectionProperty1) { //do thing } } Is there any way to avoid putting string s in the .Expand method, or is reflection my only out to avoid creating copy/paste unchecked by compiler fragility in my code?
