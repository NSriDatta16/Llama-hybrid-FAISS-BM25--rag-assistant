Is a Linear mixed model the same thing as logistic regression?

Im studying for a statistics test and the book pages talk about linear mixed models, so adding random effects in this case. Then in the reviewing lecture that no longer is mentioned but instead we are to understand logistic regression. Are these the same thing? Can linear regression be performed for a linear mixed model? im just slightly confused about the whole terminology because a big part of this test will be multiple choice
