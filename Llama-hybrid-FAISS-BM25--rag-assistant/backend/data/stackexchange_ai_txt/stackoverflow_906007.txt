output text from a textbox directly into an html page?

How do you output text from a textbox directly into an html page where it will be stored permanently? The purpose of the question is that I would like to implement a comment script for a site like this: ommmm.de/modelle_sticky.htm Each time a team memeber hits one of the buttons "Comments - send" I would like that everything that was typed into the textbox below will update immediately into the space above. (I was thinking php-mysql before, but I'd also like to know the most simple way of using the very same html file the comments are on as the flat file storage). EDIT: It just seems odd to me that there seems to be not one most simple solution where you can type something into a textbox, hit a button and have it be embedded as html on the same page right away. Thanks for the article on how to insert data into a database table. But then, what will be the best way of retrieving the data? Do a Select * on each column in each table everytime the page reloads? Is that it?
