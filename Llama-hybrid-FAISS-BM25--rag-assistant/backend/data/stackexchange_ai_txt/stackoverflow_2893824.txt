I would definitely recommend a database over plain text files any day. For one, databases do a lot of optimization on your access to the data, so you won't have to worry as much about performance. Secondly, you have so many more capabilities. You can use the SQL language to do things like: Select all customers whose age is greater than or equal to 18 Get the number of products you've sold Get the total revenue from your products sold Get the average price of all your products Get a list of the customers who live in a certain area ...and much, much more, with simple SQL statements. Trying to code all that for a text file would be counter-productive and a lot less flexible. With a database you get all that for free.
