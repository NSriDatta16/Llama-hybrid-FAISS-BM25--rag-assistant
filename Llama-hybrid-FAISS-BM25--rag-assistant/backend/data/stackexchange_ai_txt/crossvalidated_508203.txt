In which cases should I split the data in training set and test set

I am taking a course on machine learning and in one problem I should perform a Ridge regression to fit some given data to a known model. I was wondering if, in this case, there are any advantage in splitting the data into training set and test set. At the end of the day I am performing Ridge regression on a known model, hence there is no risk of overfitting. Is there any other reason to split the data in such way?
