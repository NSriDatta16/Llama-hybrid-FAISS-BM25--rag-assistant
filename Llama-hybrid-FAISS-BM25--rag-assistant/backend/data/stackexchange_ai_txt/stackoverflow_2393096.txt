I can't see that as being bad practice, however you might wanna consider as an alternative organizing your stuff per logical functionality rather than syntactic definition, so that all code for a given unit of functionality interfaces/abstract classes/normal code goes in the same package. This is one of the principles of modular programming . Said so, putting all the interfaces (but only those) in a separated package might be necessary depending on the size of the project, and might eve become almost necessary if you have a pure component based plugin architecture (so that other module know only about interfaces and the actual implementation is somehow dynamically injected).
