How to calculate the likelihood for Bayesian Inverse Problems

Let $$y=Hx=3x_1+5x_2$$ I would like to use Bayesian approach to solve the inverse problem, where I am give the above system in addition to an output vector $$y=[12.9,28.9,45.1,61,76.9,92.9,109.1,124.9,141.1,157]$$ (where I synthetically added noise $\sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.1)$). The posterior solution is: $$P(x|H,y)=\frac{P(y|x,H)P(x)}{P(H,y)}$$ In this case, let's say we know the prior, $P(x)\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_p,\sigma_p)$.My problem is how to construct the likelihood. If I assume normally distributed errors, then I can write $$P(y|x,H)= \frac{1}{\sigma_e\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y-Hx}{\sigma_e}\right)^2 }$$ However, how am I going to get $x$ in the likelihood equation if that is exactly what I am looking for? Reading around I found that I should construct a synthetic $x$ with a range that should more or less cover the expected range of the real $x$. If that was true, then I will be applying the forward model many times, and I might be better off just doing a brute force (generating all possible outputs and see which are same as my output, that would have the corresponding input I am looking for). Any ideas? Edit: this problem is artificial. While looking on inverse problems I always found complicated models assumed for the problem and I wanted a simple problem to understand. Here x1 and x2 are vectors and 3 and 5 constants.
