Why does caret print each fold twice?

I am just curious about the running output of R caret train function. I am doing a grid search for a random forest model. Here is the code: predCount Here is the output: + Fold1: mtry=10 - Fold1: mtry=10 + Fold2: mtry=10 - Fold2: mtry=10 + Fold3: mtry=10 - Fold3: mtry=10 + Fold4: mtry=10 - Fold4: mtry=10 + Fold5: mtry=10 - Fold5: mtry=10 Aggregating results ... Why are the folds printed twice? What do the + and - before each fold denote?
