jQuery remove elements after creation

I'm building a jQuery sortable list where the user can add items from a table, drag and sort and/or remove them. I can add and sort no problem, but I can't work out how to remove an item element after it has been added. I'm relatively new to js / jQuery, so I have a feeling there's something new to learn here about how it works! I'll leave out the ui.sortable stuff here as I'm only concerned with removing items.. add Item 1 add Item 2 $("a.addrelease").click(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); cat_id = $(this).attr('cat_id'); remove_str = " remove "; str = cat_id + remove_str; $(str).appendTo("#list").hide().fadeIn(); }); $("a.remove").click(function (e) { alert("This function doesn't seem to be called"); $(this).parent().remove(); //Doesn't happen.. }); I'm guessing that javascript doesn't recognize the new generated items - but I'm not sure, so I'm not sure where to start fixing it Cheers
