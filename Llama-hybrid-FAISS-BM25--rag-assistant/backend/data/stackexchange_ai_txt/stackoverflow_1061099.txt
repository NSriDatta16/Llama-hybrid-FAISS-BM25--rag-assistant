How to let resize vertically a DIV with only jQuery - no plugins?

Edit: I put this snippet of code in jsbin: http://jsbin.com/eneru I am trying to let the user resize (only vertically) a DIV element with jQuery. I read about jQuery UI, I tried it, and in some minutes, I had it working. But the library is adding a ~25KB overhead that I would like to avoid, since I only want simple vertical resizing. So I tried to do it on my own. Here it is the HTML, I am using inline styling for clarity: Lorem ipsum blah blah As you can see, there is a little bar under the DIV element, so the user can drag it up or down to resize the DIV. Here it is the Javascript code (using jQuery): $(document).ready(function(){ var resizing = false; var frame = $("#frame"); var origHeightFrame = frame.height(); var origPosYGrip = $("#frame-grip").offset().top; var gripHeight = $("#frame-grip").height(); $("#frame-grip").mouseup(function(e) { resizing = false; }); $("#frame-grip").mousedown(function(e) { resizing = true; }); $("#frame-grip").mousemove(function(e) { if(resizing) { frame.height(e.pageY - origPosYGrip + origHeightFrame - gripHeight/2); } }); }); It works, more or less, but if you drag the bar too fast, it stops following the mouse movement and everything breaks. It is the first time I try to do something serious (ahem) with JS and jQuery, so I may be doing something dumb. If so, please do tell me :)
