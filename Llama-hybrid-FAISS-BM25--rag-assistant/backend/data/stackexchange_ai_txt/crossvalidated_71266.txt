I am not an R user, but I suspect it is because you are using the soft-margin support vector machine (which is what I presume "C-svc" means). The support vectors will only lie exactly on the margins for the hard margin SVM (where C is infinite). Essentially the C parameter penalises the degree to which the support vectors are allowed to violate the margin constraint, so if C is less than infinity, the support vectors are allowed to drift away from the margins in the interests of making the margin broader, which often leads to better generalisation.
