cannot fscanf into a double dereferenced pointer

I have an array elsewhere in my program: data=malloc(sizeof(int)*lines); I want to read data from a file into this array. I have opened the file etc. I created a function to read the data into this array: int readfile(FILE* fp,int** storage_array,int lines) { int i=0; for(i=0; i Dev c++ gives me invalid lvalue in unary '&' I have tried so many different ways to get this to work and it's really stressing me out :( Have you guyd got any ideas what i'm doing wrong? Thanks so much :)
