I hope this one helps you out with your problem: I built a simple program that lets the user put values to the datagridview control. After that, a button is pressed to get the values from that table and store it to a 2D array. The array may then be used to manipulate data as you wish. Code: ' declare array for storage of all values Dim array_of_all_values(,) As Object ' number of columns and rows from the datagridview control Dim Num_of_Columns, Num_of_Rows As Integer ' this block of code asks the user to how many columns does he want to add to the DGV Private Sub btnNo_of_Columns_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnNo_of_Columns.Click Num_of_Columns = txtCol_Num.Text For columnCount = 1 To Num_of_Columns dgv_Test.Columns.Add("Column_" & columnCount, InputBox("What is the header of Column " & columnCount & "?" & vbCrLf, "Column Header", "no header")) Next btnNo_of_Columns.Enabled = False txtCol_Num.Clear() dgv_Test.Focus() End Sub Private Sub btnGetSpecific_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGetSpecific.Click ' this code gets the specific value of the cell that is selected by the user (selection by mouse click) rtb_TestResult.Text = dgv_Test.Item(dgv_Test.CurrentCellAddress.X, dgv_Test.CurrentCellAddress.Y).Value ' you may now insert the value of the cell into a variable ' you may code for the specific validation that you require/desire End Sub Private Sub btnGetAll_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGetAll.Click Dim rowValue As String ' this code will get values of all cells and record it to an array Num_of_Rows = dgv_Test.RowCount - 1 ReDim Preserve array_of_all_values(Num_of_Rows, Num_of_Columns) For dgvColumnIndex = 0 To Num_of_Columns - 1 For dgvRowIndex = 0 To Num_of_Rows - 1 array_of_all_values(dgvRowIndex, dgvColumnIndex) = dgv_Test.Item(dgvColumnIndex, dgvRowIndex).Value Next Next ' you may now manipulate the inputs using the 2d array ' you may now construct validation codes ' this code displays the array values in table form ' this is useful in checking arrays For arr_X_index = 0 To UBound(array_of_all_values, 1) For arr_Y_index = 0 To UBound(array_of_all_values, 2) rowValue &= array_of_all_values(arr_X_index, arr_Y_index) & vbTab Next rtb_TestResult.Text &= rowValue & vbCrLf rowValue = "" Next End Sub Sample of how the program worked: Hope that answers your problem.. please be specific next time. :D
