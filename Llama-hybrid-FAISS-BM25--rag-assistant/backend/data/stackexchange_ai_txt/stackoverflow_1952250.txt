Getting ID of newly added item into Sharepoint List from Silverlight

I am adding item into Sharepoint List from the Silverlight Application using Sharepoint' list.asmx web service. I need to know the ID of this newly created item. The UpdateListItemsCompleted's e.Result (XElement) is returned having the following XML fragment. How can I extract the ID of this item. I am not good in XLinq! 0x00000000
