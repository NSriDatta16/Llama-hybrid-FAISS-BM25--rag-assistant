Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Continuous Treatment (e.g. using BART)

Overview: Most of the causal inference literature (both theoretical and applied), I have seen on heterogeneous treatment effects, only considers the case with a binary treatment $T\in\{0,1\}$ . However, I would like to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in a design with a continuous treatment $D\in \mathbb{R}$ . I would like to my model to be nonparametric, such as the regression tree based model BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees). I have three questions: Do you know any good references for basic theory on heterogeneous treatment effects, when the treatment is continuous? Do you know if BART can handle continuous treatments? If so, do you know of any references to theoretical or applied research, where I can learn more about this? Do you know of other nonparametric models that could be useful for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, when the treatment is continuous? Thank you very much for your help. Technical details: Let $D\in \mathbb{R}$ denote a real-valued treatment variable (sometimes also called a dose ). Let $Y$ be some real-valued or binary outcome variable, and let $Y^d_i$ denote the potential outcome of a unit $i$ , if $i$ were treated with dose level $d$ . Let $X_i\in \mathbb{R}^p$ be a vector of covariates for unit $i$ . Let $\mu^d(x) = E(Y^d_i | X_i=x)$ denote the conditional average dose response function. That is, $\mu^d(x)$ denotes the average potential outcome for individuals with covariates equal to $x$ , if they were treated with dose level $d$ . I consider $\mu^d(x)$ to the fundamental quantity of interest, since we can use it to calculate e.g. the conditional average treatment effect of changing the dose level from $d_0$ to $d_1$ for any $d_0,d_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ : $\mu^{d_1}(x) - \mu^{d_0}(x)$ . Likewise, we can use it to calculate the conditional marginal treatment effect of an infinitesimal change in dose level for any dose level $d_0$ : $\frac{\partial}{\partial d} \mu^{d_0}(x)$ . All in all, I am therefore interested in methods for estimating nonparametric models of $\mu^d(x)$ . I am especially interested if BART can be used for this task.
