To use logistic regression your response needs to be binary, or binary counts. So it depends on how your response was collected. If your response is not binary then by all means use OLS. Interpreting logistic regression can be tricky but I find if you just exponentiate the coefficient then you are working with odds. If you do a google search there are a lot of good examples of interpreting logistic regression. Also The Statistical Sleuth in chps 20-21 does a good job explaining logistic regression.
