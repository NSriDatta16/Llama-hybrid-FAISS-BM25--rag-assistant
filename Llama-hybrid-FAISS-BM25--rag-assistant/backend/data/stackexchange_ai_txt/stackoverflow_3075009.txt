Android: How can I pass parameters to AsyncTask's onPreExecute()?

I use an AsyncTask for loading operations that I implemented as an inner class. In onPreExecute() I show a loading dialog which I then hide again in onPostExecute() . But for some of the loading operations I know in advance that they will finish very quickly so I don't want to display the loading dialog. I wanted to indicate this by a boolean parameter that I could pass to onPreExecute() but apparently for some reason onPreExecute() doesn't take any parameters. The obvious workaround would probably be to create a member field in my AsyncTask or in the outer class which I would have to set before every loading operation but that does not seem very elegant. Is there a better way to do this?
