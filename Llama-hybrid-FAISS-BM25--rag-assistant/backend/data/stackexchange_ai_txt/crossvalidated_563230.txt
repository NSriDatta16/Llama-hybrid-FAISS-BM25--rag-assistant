The last part of your statement is incorrect. Suppose for example that $x$ is the average number of rainy days in a year in some location that you know nothing about, so a-priori $x = 0$ is possible with some (possibly) finite probability. But it only takes observing a single rainy day to convince you that $x=0$ is completely impossible.
