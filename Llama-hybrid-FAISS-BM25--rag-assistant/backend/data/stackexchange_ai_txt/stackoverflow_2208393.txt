I think the Strategy pattern would be more appropriate here. You may create a non-abstract Converter class with the common behavior, and supply it with the ValueSource , which can perform a table-specific value retrieval. Then you create a QueryValueSource (a subclass of ValueSource ) to retrieve a value based on the specified query. To get a concrete strategies, you can either pass different queries into a constructor of QueryValueSource , or subclass it to create table-specific sources.
