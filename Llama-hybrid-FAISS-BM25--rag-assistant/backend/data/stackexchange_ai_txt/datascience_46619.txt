NLP to recognize the meaning of a paragraph

How can I apply NLP to extract the summary of a paragraph,I found this but was wondering if there is a better and easy way before implementing it, as the ans seems to be an old one. Basically what I need is, I have 2 paragraph and wanted to know how related they were(maybe in percentage) in context of their meaning . PS:I am new to both NLP and this forum.
