ICD10 (categorical) encoding

I am trying to figure out how best to encode ICD10 codes for input into a machine learning model. It isn't ordinal by any means, however, there is a sort of logic you can apply to just the labels that will tell you which ones can be grouped together without any additional knowledge. In some ways, it's closer to an interval data type in that the difference between consecutive codes frequently (but by no means always) has some kind of meaning. This makes me think that binary encoding may be more effective than one-hot, but are there other options I should be considering? for example: I71.1 Thoracic aortic aneurysm, ruptured I71.2 Thoracic aortic aneurysm, without mention of rupture I71.3 Abdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured I71.4 Abdominal aortic aneurysm, without mention of rupture J12.2 Parainfluenza virus pneumonia J12.3 Human metapneumovirus pneumonia J12.8 Other viral pneumonia J12.9 Viral pneumonia, unspecified
