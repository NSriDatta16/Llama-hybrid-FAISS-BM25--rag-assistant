nu SvM basically uses a parameter nu instead of C (which is used as a hyperparameter in case of linear SVM) as a hyperparameter for penalising incorrect classifications. Range here basically indicates the upper and lower limits between which our hyperparameter can take it's value. E.g. k is between 1 to N in case of Knn and lambda is between 10^-4 to 10^+4 in case of regression. Similarly hyperparameter C has a range of 0 to infinity in Linear SVM whereas hyperparameter nu has a range between 0 and 1 in case of nu SvM.
