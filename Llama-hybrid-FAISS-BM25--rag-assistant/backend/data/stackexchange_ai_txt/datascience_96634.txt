Filling in missing values for time series data

Suppose I have time series data. So 200 cells of data with each row representing a millisecond - although some rows skip certain milliseconds. For example, it goes from 6:22:37 PM to 6:22:39 PM to 6:22:42 PM. Should I fill in the missing millisecond data with their corresponding millisecond and then average the dependent variables and fill in that row? Or just leave it as it is?
