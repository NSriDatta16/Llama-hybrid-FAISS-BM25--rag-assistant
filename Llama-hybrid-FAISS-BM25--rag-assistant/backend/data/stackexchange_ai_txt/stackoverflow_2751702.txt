I pulled my .sdf file into a completely new project, regenerated the DataSet, and dragged a ComboBox onto the window. It works fine! Then I realized the difference between this project and the last was that the controls were in a UserControl. I added a usercontrol with a combobox and compiled. The combobox in a UserControl is empty, the ComboBox on the main window is filled correctly.
