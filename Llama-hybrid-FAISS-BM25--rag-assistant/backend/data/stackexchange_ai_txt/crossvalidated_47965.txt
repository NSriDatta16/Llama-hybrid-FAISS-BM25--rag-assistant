Markov Chain process - Missing values

I have a vector of sequences with presence ( 1 ) and absence ( 0 ), from were I have calculated the first order Markov Process. This is how the data looks like: dataset=c(NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0, 1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,NA,0,1,1, NA,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,NA,0,1) For thsi vector I have calculated: Probability of Presence ( P1 ) and Absence ( P0 ) Probability of having Presence followed by Presence ( P11 ), Presence followed by Absence ( P10 ), Absence followed by Presence ( P01 ) and Absence followed by Absence ( P00 ) The transition probabilities were obtained by using a loop the checks for sequence of 2 values: to calculate P_00 I am using P_00 : dataset[j]==0 & dataset[j+1]==0 , etc. These are the results: P_0=0.3913043 P_1=0.6086957 P_0+P_1=1 P_00=0.1538462 P_01=0.2307692 P_11=0.4615385 P_10=0.1538462 P_00+P_01+P_11+P_10=1 The idea is to populate the NA with presence/absence sequences according to the Probability values obtained for the sequence. The problem is that for now I am not being able to find the best and more adequate process for this problem and I am a newbie with this type of problems. Even if there is already a package that can do this for me, I would prefer to understand how can I do it.
