Your view of what is a "standard" text seems to be restricted to what may be seen in econometrics. Statistics is much, much broader than the subset of it that is the focus of econometricians. This is to be expected, since the kinds of questions econometricians want to answer, and the kinds of data they can get, are different from what is common in other areas (econometricians don't tend to focus on classification problems for example). Those things will tend to shape the methods that are used and the kinds of problems in applying that methodology that need to be solved. So, for example, econometrics deals with multivariate data, but it tends to deal with it over time rather than cross-sectionally (and so less likely to use PCA, for example). It also tends to be observational rather than experimental, so even though (for example) a researcher in psychology and one in econometrics may both deal with longitudinal data, the psych researcher will tend to deal with quite short series in a controlled experiment, while the econometrics research will tend to deal with longer series in an observational setting (and typically with quite different assumptions about the structure of the variables and their relationships). The same goes with methods common in machine learning, for example -- the questions they ask tend to be different, and the kinds of data that are available tend to be different, too. So there's much more of a focus on approaches like classification and clustering, and a lot of the problems relate to very large data sets, which impacts the kinds of techniques that are used (for example, even though OLS regression has a closed-form solution, that closed-form solution is often not the best idea when dealing with some really big data sets). That is not to say that a good fraction of the techniques in use in areas outside econometrics would have no econometric applications, though; each application area -- econometrics included -- has a tendency to focus on a subset of the tools that would be useful for the kinds of data that they deal with. Technological inertia -- doing what we do because that's what everyone we know does (which in turn impacts what is taught to the next generation) -- is a very real issue (though only to be expected) and affects every area of application of statistics. There's also a bit of a tendency to reinvent the wheel (when sometimes better versions the wheel are already in use elsewhere). It can be very fruitful to explore what other people do, even if you don't see immediate applications for it. Picking up a stats book or two with applications in a variety of areas can be both interesting and informative (and, occasionally, baffling, especially at first).
