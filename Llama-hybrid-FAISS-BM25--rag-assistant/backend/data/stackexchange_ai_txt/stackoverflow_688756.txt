Before you start refactoring you should create tests that will be able to test what you're going to change - if you say unit tests will not be enought, or they will be hard to create, then by all means create higher level tests possibly even excersising the whole of your product. If you have code coverage tools for your language use them to measure the quality of the tests that you've created - after it's reached a reasonably high value and if the tests are kept up to date and extended you'll be able to do anything with your code very efficiently and be rather sure things are not going in the wrong direction.
