Recommnedation for books and material for solving differerntial equations through neural networks

I was going through some past and recent papers on using neural networks for solving ordinary and partial differential equations. One of the fascinating papers that inspired a flurry of papers is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561.pdf . I was looking for some nice books/tutorials about " Differential equations and Neural networks " if there are any. I would be extremely grateful for any recommendations in this regard.
