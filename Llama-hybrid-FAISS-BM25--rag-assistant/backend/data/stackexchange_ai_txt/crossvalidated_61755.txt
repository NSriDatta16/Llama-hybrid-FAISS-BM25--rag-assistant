Variance and bias

Consider the mean squared error $$\text{MSE}(x_0) = E_{T}(f(x_0)-\hat{y}_0)^{2}$$ $$ = E_{T}(\hat{y}_0-E_{T}(\hat{y}_0))^{2}+(f(x_0)-E_{T}(\hat{y}_0)^{2})$$ Is the first term after the equal sign in the second line basically saying the following: Get an estimate and find its deviation from the average estimates over all training samples. The estimate $\hat{y}_0$ will depend on the training set which is why we take the expected value. Also is $E_{T}(\hat{y}_0)$ constant?
