When you redirect to the login page, put the URL that you intercepted (often called a return URL) into a session variable (or some other storage as appropriate). Then, when login is complete you can redirect to this URL. You sometimes see the return URL in website querystrings during a logon process. For example if you go to docs.google.com when you're not logged into any google account you can see a "continue" value in the querystring as below: https ://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&passive=1209600&continue=http://docs.google.com/&followup=http://docs.google.com/&ltmpl=homepage
