An embedding is a mapping from discrete objects, such as words, to vectors of real numbers. - Tensorflow/Embeddings With reference to the FaceNet paper, I should say that embedding here simply means the tensor obtained by performing a forward propagation over an image. The obtained embedding of the image and the target image are then compared to find the closeness among the images. The loss function specified by the equation $L=\sum_{i}^N [ ||f(x_i^a)-f(x_i^p)||_2^2-||f(x_i^a)-f(x_i^n)||_2^2+\alpha]_+ $ is simply used here to to find the euclidean distance between the generated embedding of the anchor, positive and negative images obtained by performing forward propagation. This technique is also called as Siamese network. I suggest you to read the full original FaceNet paper for clearer understanding of the FaceNet architecture and working.
