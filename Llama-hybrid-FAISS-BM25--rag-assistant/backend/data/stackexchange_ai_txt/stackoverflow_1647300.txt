char* wrong = "la1 4yt"; This declares a pointer to a string constant. The constant cannot be modified, which is why your code crashes. If you wrote the more pedantic const char* wrong = "la1 4yt"; // Better then the compiler would catch the mistake. You should probably do this any time you declare a pointer to a string literal rather than creating an array. This, on the other hand, allocates read/write storage for twenty characters so writing to the space is fine. char wrong[20]; If you wanted to initialize it to the string above you could do so and then would be allowed to change it. char wrong[20] = "la1 4yt"; // Can be modified char wrong[] = "la1 4yt"; // Can be modified; only as large as required
