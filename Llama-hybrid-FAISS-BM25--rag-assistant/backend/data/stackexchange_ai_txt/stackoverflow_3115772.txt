I would suggest solving this problem using Bayesian inference . Bayesian Classifiers As the problem is currently stated, the only classification of the content that is available is the distribution of the users which have visited it and the characteristics of those users. The joint probability distribution across all user-characteristic dimensions for all users is the classifier for that content. So how does one use the above information? Given content A with user access distribution B for all users and a target user characteristic profile C, one can compute the probability that the latter user would be interested in content A. If one performs this computation against all content relative to user profile C, one gets a list of interest probability values for all of the content. Sort that list by the probability values to identify the best possible content for the target user. In many cases, only a subset of user characteristic parameters may be predictive of the value of a given content item to users. This is a common situation for Bayesian classifiers in general and has led to the development of Bayesian networks , which are structured graphs of key variables and their conditional dependencies. Such networks can be modeled via Bayesian inference methods as well. Bayesian Network Software The WEKA Data Mining software is an open-source Java library which implements many common classification methods including Bayesian network classifiers, and it is well worth trying out. I can't recommend any specific C# equivalent packages, but a quick web search identified at least one commercial Bayesian package for .NET, Bayes Server . Recommended Reading There is a pretty large body of literature surrounding bayesian classifiers, and it is a very sound technique that is use in SPAM filtering, drug discovery, etc. Two books that I can recommend for this are listed below. Bolstad's book is for beginners, while Pearl's book is more advanced. Bolstad, William M. (2007). Introduction to Bayesian Statistics , Second Edition, John Wiley. Judea Pearl (2000). Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference , Cambridge University Press.
