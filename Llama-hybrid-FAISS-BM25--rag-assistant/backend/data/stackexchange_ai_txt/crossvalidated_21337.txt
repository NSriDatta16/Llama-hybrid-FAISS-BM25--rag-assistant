A classical use for Bayesian statistics is in diagnosing disease. Suppose you have a test that gives a positive result 90% of the time if someone has the disease. The test also gives a false positive 5% of the time if someone does not have the disease. Further you know that in the general population 1 in 100,000 people have the disease. Someone comes into your office and you want to know if they have the disease. Perhaps the only way to know for certain if they have it is during an autopsy after they die, so the best you can do right now is run the test. The key to understanding the Bayesian nature of this situation is that you have no way of observing directly what you want to know (does he have the disease?) The best you can do is observe the test results. Thus the problem becomes, "What is the probability the person has the disease given a positive test result?
