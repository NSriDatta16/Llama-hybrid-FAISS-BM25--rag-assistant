Have the domain model layer define interfaces for the methods you'll need to call, and POCOs for the objects that need to be returned by those methods. The data layer can then implement those interfaces by pulling data out of your data store and mapping it into the domain model POCOs. Any domain-level class that requires a particular data-access service can just depend on the interface via constructor arguments. Then you can leverage a dependency-injection framework to build the dependency graph and provide the correct implementations of your interfaces wherever they are required.
