Confused about prediction output for glmnet package cv.glmnet model

I am using the glmnet package to perform logistic regression on a dataset. The x.train and x.test data is a simple dataset of numbers. y.train and y.test is data with categories "Coffee" and "Tea". Basically the prediction needs to be either "Coffee" or "Tea" My first question is that do I need to factor the y datasets? I haven't factored them yet. Secondly, and mainly, this is the problem: My code is as follows: lr.fit However, when I see the output of the lr.predicted variable, I see a list of numbers. I am asking this question because, I was actually expecting predictions like "Coffee", "Tea", "Coffee", "Coffee", "Tea", ........... and so on. Kindly guide in the right direction. I am a beginner with R and machine learning, so apologies for being an amateur.
