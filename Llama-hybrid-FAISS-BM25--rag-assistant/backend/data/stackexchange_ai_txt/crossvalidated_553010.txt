Time Series Regression when X are not i.i.d

Suppose we have two time series $x_t$ and $y_t$ and both are i.i.d. The content of $y_t$ and $x_t$ do not matter. We can think these two are just two random time series. However, we run the following regression \begin{align*} y_t = a + b z_t, z_t = x_t + x_{t-1 } + x_{t-2} + x_{t-3} + x_{t-4}. \end{align*} The questions are whether the t-statistics of $\hat{b}$ is correct and if not how do we adjust without re-running the regression. My intuition is that $z_t$ are not i.i.d across time. So this may introduce serial correlation which causes a larger t-stats. In order to adjust, we need to think about the correlation between $z_t$ and $z_{t-1}$ . However, I am not sure how to derive this.
