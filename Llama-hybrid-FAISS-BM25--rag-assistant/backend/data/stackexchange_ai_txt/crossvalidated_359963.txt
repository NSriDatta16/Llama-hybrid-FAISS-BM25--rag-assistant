I am the first author of [1], the work is almost ten years old now (done during my master's degree for one of the courses) so I do not remember everything, but what I can say is that we did not "propose" the Gini criterion for feature selection, at that time we have used the definition as described in "Machine Learning and Data Mining" by Kononenko and Kukar. For what I know they did not propose it either, but simply mention it (the book does not make any clear reference who proposed it). In the book the definition is indeed linked to Gini "criterion" [2]. I cannot reliably comment on the rest of the questions as my work is nowadays no longer pure machine learning.
