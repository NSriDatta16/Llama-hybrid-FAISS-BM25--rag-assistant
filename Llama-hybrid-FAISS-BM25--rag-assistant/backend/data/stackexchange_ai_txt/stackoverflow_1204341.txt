This program reads strings of numbers from a txt file, converts them to integers, stores them in a vector , and then tries to output them in an organized fashion like so.... (emphasis added) What is the point of this storage step? If you are reading the numbers from a file, then you already have them in order, ready to be processed (counted) one at time, as you encounter them. However, I would need a way for it to know when it sees a new number. I advise you to have a look at std::set or std::map . I expect either of these containers would do what you're looking for.
