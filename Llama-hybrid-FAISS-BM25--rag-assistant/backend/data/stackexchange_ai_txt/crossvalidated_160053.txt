In short - you have misunderstood something. There is no such condition in SVM formulation, nor is there any $\beta$ parameter. Original (linear) formulation goes like $$ \min_{w,b} \frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N\xi_i $$ subject to $$ y_i(\langle w, x_i\rangle -b) \geq 1- \xi_i, i=1, \dots, N $$ And in kernel formulation $$ \max_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^N \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j) $$ subject to $$ 0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C $$ $$ \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_iy_i = 0 $$ and these conditions come directly from KKT conditions for solutions of dual problem in convex optimization with linear constraints.
