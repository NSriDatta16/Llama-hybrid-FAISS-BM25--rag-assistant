First, you have not told us what this series represents. Subject-matter knowledge is generally useful when trying to model the data. the volatility of the series is increasing The log returns exhibit this even more clearly It would be more accurate to say that volatility has been very low in the beginning, high for a while and then quite low again. There is no linear trend in the magnitude of volatility -- see your second figure. Which alternative model could I use to model this behavior of the volatility of the series ? You may want to reconsider the model for the conditional mean first. Perhaps you could model the apparent trend in the original series and the dip during approx. 2009 by including some other explanatory variables and turning the AR model into an ARX model. Also, you could consider ARCH-in-mean specification, as the volatility seems to have been the highest when the series was going down. Now to answer the question, there is a great variety of GARCH models suited for different features of the data. One survey (not necessarily the best) can be found here : Terasvirta "An introduction to univariate GARCH models" (2009). You could take a look at the stylized facts and the characteristics of the different models and see if there is one that suits you. You could also have a GARCH model with exogenous variables. E.g. a GARCH model with a time trend could suit a case where conditional variance is increasing linearly (which does not seem to be the case here, though). Or you could have an IGARCH model where the conditional variance is an integrated process. That also answers your second question: When modelling the conditional mean of the series the classic approach would be to integrate the series. Is there a similar approach considerable for the volatility? Sorry for being a bit vague about the choice of the model, but I think it would be careless to recommend a particular model just by having seen a graph of the data. I would be also very happy about any hint to a particular Stata or R command that seem promising to model the volatility of this time series. In R I may recommend using "rugarch" package with main functions ugarchspec (for specifying a GARCH model) and ugarchfit (for estimating the specified model for a given data series). There is a nice vignette to consult. P.S. the estimated coefficients sum to a value greater than one implying that volatility is growing without bounds which is clearly undesirable It is not only undesirable, but it also does not seem to fit the data -- I do not see gradually exploding volatility in the second figure.
