Bayesian Naive Classifier with 0 variance

I am experimenting with the Bayesian Naive Classifier and I have come across a situation for which I wasn't able to find a solution on the net. Suppose you have a dataset with a few attributes that takes real values. The values of the observations varies around a mean as they typically do -- except for a particular attribute and for a particular class where all observations have the same value. For that particular attribute-class subset, the variance will be 0 and the probability density for such a distribution will be infinity for any 'x'. How should a BNC handle such situations? Should we discard an attribute if it has a degenerate (zero variance) distribution for any class even if it has a normal distribution otherwise? Edit: I'd rather not ignore them if possible. They may have a lot of information, just not for the class for which variance is 0. I'll try to explain myself: Suppose you have a bowl of cookies, some of them were made by a machine and the others were handmade and you want to classify them (as well as eating them). One of the attributes you use to classify is the diameter of the cookie. A handmade cookie will have a good variance while the machine-made ones all have the same (0 variance). Say all machine-made cookie are all 2.5 inches in diameter. I agree that picking a 2.5 inch cookie at random will give us no useful information; but picking a 3 inch cookie is a pretty strong indication that is was handmade. In the case of a 0 variance distribution, I was thinking making the Probability Density function return a 1.0 (neutral) when 'x' is the mean and 0.0 when it's not. But I'm not experienced enough in statistics to understand the possible side-effects of this.
