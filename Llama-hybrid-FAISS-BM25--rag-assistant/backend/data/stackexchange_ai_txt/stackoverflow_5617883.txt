You can't really return two different primitive types from the same method. With reference types you could return Object , that that isn't a good idea anyway. Your return false looks like an error condition, so you might think about throwing an exception here: public double getAverage(){ if(students >= minimum){ return studentGrades / students; } else { throw new IllegalStateException("not enough students"); } }
