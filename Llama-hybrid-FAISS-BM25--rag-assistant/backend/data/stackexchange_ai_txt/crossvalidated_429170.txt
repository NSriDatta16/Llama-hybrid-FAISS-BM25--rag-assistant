expected value of a time series/ stochastic process

I am new to time-series analysis and I found myself getting confused by the most fundamental concepts. A stochastic process is a collection of random variables $X_t$ for $t=1,\dots,n$ where each $X_t$ is a random variable with its own probability distribution. A stochastic process can generate an infinite collection of realizations, and we call this collection an ensemble. (And an observed time series is 1 realization from that ensemble.) Am I correct in this understanding? So when we say the expected value of a time series $E(X_t)=\mu_X(t)$ , do we mean the expected value of a particular $X_t$ from the sequence, let's say $X_3$ , which we can find by calculating the weighted average/integral of the probability distribution of $X_3$ ? And is it correct to assume that each $X_t$ in the sequence would have a different expected value since they most likely will not have the same probability distribution? Similarly, a white noise $\{w_1,\dots,w_n\}$ is defined as a collection of random variables with mean 0 and s.d. $\sigma_w$ . Does this mean each $w_i\in\{w_1,\dots,w_n\}$ is a random variable that has a probability distribution with mean 0 and every $w_i$ have the same s.d. $\sigma_w$ ?
