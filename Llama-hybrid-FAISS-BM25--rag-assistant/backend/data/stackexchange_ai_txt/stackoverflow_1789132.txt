Oracle bring a huge set of functionality with it, some of it optional extras that you pay for but much of it included for free in every edition. http://www.oracle.com/database/product_editions.html Flashback query is a free include, and lets you query the database "as of" some time in the recent past. Expression filters are another good example of a freebee, and the Rules engine is also powerful. http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/rules_manager/index.html So when you make your choice you ought to consider what features you can leverage that will get you functionality that you would otherwise have to develop and support yourself.
