We can relate this problem to object detection (given an image, create a bounding box on the objects present and identify the detected objects). Take a look at this neural network based object detection algorithm . Your training data would be the images with bounding boxes as labels and the classification of each boxes. Just manually label some and then switch the placement of the objects to create more training data. Finally, use OCR to translate the detected objects into text data.
