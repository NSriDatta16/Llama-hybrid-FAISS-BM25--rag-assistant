It might not use boost, but it probably uses threads and thread local storage, which leads to the same problem. CLR is not compatible with __declspec(thread). I believe there is no simple work-around, unless you are willing to modify ffmpeg code (if you are, google those keywords for examples: clr, __declspec(thread) ). I suggest isolating ffmpeg in a different process and using some means of interprocess communication.
