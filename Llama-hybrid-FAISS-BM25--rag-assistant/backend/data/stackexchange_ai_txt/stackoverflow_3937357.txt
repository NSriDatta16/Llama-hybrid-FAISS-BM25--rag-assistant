If you change your function to this, it will work. Public Function GetControl(Of T)(ByVal ctrlId As String) As T Dim ctrl As Object = Me.FindControl(ctrlId) If (Not ctrl Is Nothing) Then return CType(ctrl, T) Else return Nothing End If End Function This is due to the fact that the type needs to be in a way that it can convert, as if you convert to a control, it would be upcasting to the concrete type. Now, be sure to keep in mind that you could throw exceptions here if your send the id of the wrong type, etc.
