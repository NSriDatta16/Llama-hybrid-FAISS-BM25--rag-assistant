Estimate variance of sub-sets from overall variance

I am looking for a way to estimate the variance of a summed sub-set based on the variance of those sums. Si = sum( Ai ) S = { S0...Sn } V = variance( S ) That is, each sample value Si is actually the sum of a set Ai . V is then the normal variance of the set S . Is there any way to estimate the variance of the values in sets Ai using the final variance, or some result from the above? Currently I do variance / (len(Ai)^2) but the value is then an averaged value of the variance. I'm wondering if there is a way to improve upon this. Background: The reason the I don't calculate variance on individual samples from the population is that the measurement is then too small. I am measuring elapsed time, and so individual samples the elapses time is too small for the timing device to measure, so instead I do a series of operations and calculation the time for the whole group. Note: In the application I have no ability to store samples and am using an online algorithm (Knuth).
