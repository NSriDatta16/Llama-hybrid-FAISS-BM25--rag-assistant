The predicted grand average (see onestop's answer) may not be all that informative - after all, you are fitting a model to understand systematic deviations from it. You can predict your p for any setting of your predictors. Given that you are interested in the effects of the predictors, it would make sense to look at what happens when your continuous x takes values at the first, second and third quartile of the values in your sample, while the categorical predictor varies over the categories you have. Then again, you sound like you have more than one continuous and more than one categorical variable, in which case an enumeration as I proposed in the previous paragraph becomes unintelligible. Better look at and report p for "interesting" or "relevant" predictor settings.
