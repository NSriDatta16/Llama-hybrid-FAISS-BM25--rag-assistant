No you're neural network is not necessarily useless just because you aren't aware of a relationship between your inputs and your outputs. It's possible there is a relationship between your inputs and your outputs that you are not aware of. If your NN reliably predicts the correct output given your inputs, then you can probably assume there exists a relationship between the inputs and the output.
