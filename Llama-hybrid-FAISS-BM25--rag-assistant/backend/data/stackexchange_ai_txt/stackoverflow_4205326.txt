Wordpress show Today's posts organized by category

I need to create a "Today's Daily News" page for an internal company 'newspaper'. It is run on a wordpress, so the not-so-savvy can handle it. The page just needs to display a tree-ish view of the categories with ONLY TODAY's posts listed in them. If there are no news items in any of the categories for today, then they should not be displayed. I have found some useful bits of code which I can patch together to achieve this, but really I want to utilize as much of wordpress' built in functions as possible. This is the format I am looking for: Today's Daily News -Category 1 ---News Item Title 1A ---News Item Title 1B ---News Item Title 1C ---News Item Title 1D -Category 2 ---News Item Title 2A ---News Item Title 2B
