You can use ASP.NET and SQL Server to get something online that will allow users to edit a database table fairly easily. They've simplified it to the point where you can drag and drop the necessary controls (GridView and a SqlDataSource for instance) and define your datasource in a wizard for most simple table CRUD functionality. Basically give users the ability to edit a table without writing any code. If you need to do something a little more difficult it's easy to write code that will add functionality to the original drag/drop stuff you did. There are lots of good resources out there for asp.net and C# also, so it will help you get up to speed quickly. Keep in mind that I work almost entirely with .NET/SQL Server so my opinion will be slanted towards them...
