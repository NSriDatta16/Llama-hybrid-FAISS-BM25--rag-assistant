I do a lot of AJAX requests for SVG markup, where I insert the markup into the DOM. You can't just insert it as a fragment, as far as I know, you have to recursively walk the retrieved XML doc, and create the individual SVG elements. So, you might be better off combining the files on the server, before you send them to the browser.
