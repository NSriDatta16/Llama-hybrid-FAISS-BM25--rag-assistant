I agree with Stephen's comment that your 10% return rate is effecting your model greatly. Really, you are attempting to capture to different phenomena in one model: returns and revenue. To correctly model this, one option would be to use a Hierarchical model. Hierarchical models are really just multiple models that branch. In your case, the top level model would be a logistic regression predicting whether or not a product was returned. Then, using only the data points for products not returned you would create a linear model (absolutely keeping the log transformation). So you're code would look something like this. mod1 I would also suggest using the pairs() function to look for multicolinearity. Without seeing your data I can't be sure, but I would bet good money you could easily drop several regressors.
