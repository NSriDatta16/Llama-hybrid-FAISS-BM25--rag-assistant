A barcode typically simply is a graphical representation of some string value, e.g. letter and numbers - so I'd just store that string (usually a product code or something like that) in a VARCHAR(x) field and not bother storing the actual graphical barcode at all. If you must store the graphical representation of the barcode for whatever reason, use a VARBINARY(MAX) field - gives you up to 2 GB of binary storage.
