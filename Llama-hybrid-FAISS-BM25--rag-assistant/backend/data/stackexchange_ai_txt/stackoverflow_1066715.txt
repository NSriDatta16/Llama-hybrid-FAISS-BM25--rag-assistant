I think most people agree first one is O(n^2). Outer loop runs n times and inner loop runs n times every time outer loop runs. So the run time is O(n * n), O(n^2). The second one is O(n^2) because the outer loop runs n times. The inner loops runs n-1 times. On average for this algorithm, inner loop runs n/2 times for every outer loop. so the run time of this algorithm is O(n * n/2) => O ( 1/2 * n^2) => O(n^2).
