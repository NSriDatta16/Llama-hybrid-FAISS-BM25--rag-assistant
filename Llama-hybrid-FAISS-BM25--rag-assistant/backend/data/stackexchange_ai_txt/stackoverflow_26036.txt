As the other answer says, you are forced to trust a potentially malicious client, and a simple deterant plus a little human monitoring is going to be enough for a small game. If you want to get fancy, you then have to look for fraud patterns in the score data, simmular to a credit card company looking at charge data. The more state the client communicates onto your server, the potentially easier it is to find a pattern of correct or incorrect behavior via code. For example. say that the client had to upload a time based audit log of the score (which maybe you can also use to let another clients watch the top games), the server can then validate if the score log breaks any of the game rules. In the end, this is still about making it expensive enough to discourage cheating the scoreboard. You would want a system where you can always improve the (easier to update)server code to deal with any new attacks on your validation system.
