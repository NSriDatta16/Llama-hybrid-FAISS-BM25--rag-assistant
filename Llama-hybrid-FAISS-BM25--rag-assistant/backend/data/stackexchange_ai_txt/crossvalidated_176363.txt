I believe that should be possibly. Basicly you need both adaboost and random forest to not only classify, but also quantify some kind of certainty. For RF, probabilistic voting is the average vote over trees. I see adaBag package for R outputs a similar probabilistic measure. citing from package manual, "predict.boosting: Predict from a fitted boosting object." prob a matrix describing, for each observation, the posterior probability or degree of support of each class. These probabilities are calculated using the proportion of votes in the final ensemble. Use ROC plots to check if combined ensembles actually are better.
