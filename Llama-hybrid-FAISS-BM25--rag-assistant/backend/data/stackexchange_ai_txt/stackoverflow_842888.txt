Karp Rabin just uses four ints and has linear average time. It just computes a hash of the search string and uses some math tricks to quickly get the hash of the next substring, given the hash of the substring before it. The standard version runs into trouble because most languages don't do a true mathematical modulo but Gonnet and Baeza-Yate's Handbook of Data Structures and Algorithms has a version which uses the word size as an implicit modulo (its also faster).
