Are you trying to add some images to an html email? To accomplish this you will need to embed the images inside your email. I found a tutorial to accomplish it in a few lines of code. You can also buy the aspnetemail assembly. It has always helped me a lot to send emails with embedded images, they also have an excellent support team if anything goes wrong. Keep in mind that embedding images makes your email heavier, but nicer :)
