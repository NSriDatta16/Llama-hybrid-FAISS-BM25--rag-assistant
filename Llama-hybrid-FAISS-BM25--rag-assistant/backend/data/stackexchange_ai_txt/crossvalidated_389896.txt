Is there a connection between the normal and the logistic distribution?

Regarding Bayesian statistics I found in a script that there is such link, and the logistic arises in context of a normal distribution and a "binary state". However, I have no idea what is the meaning behind this. And I found no further hints. The Student-t is highly connected to the confidence interval for mean of a normal distribution, so I wonder if there is something similar regarding the logistic distribution.
