Programmatically change the submitter user in the webform module

I automatically create users for visitors that submit my webforms as per http://www.mikewagan.net/2010/10/drupal-create-user-accounts-through-the-webform-module/ This all works fine, with one little problem: The Webform submission data should be changed as to represent the correct submitter (my newly created user), currently it is tied to the unauthenticated user. I tried $form['details']['uid']['#value'] = $account->uid; in the Additional Processing field, but that does not seem to work. Which part of Webform's submission data do i have to massage to make this happen?
