I have not used the sklearn implementation of random forest that much. [ EDIT ] It seems sklearn actually provides the full probabilistic state of terminal nodes. R, randomForest, does not. See also this thread . So depending on implementation: predicted probability is either (a) the mean terminal leaf probability across all trees or (b) the fraction of trees voting either class. If out-of-bag(OOB) prediction, then only in trees where sample is OOB. For a single fully grown tree, I would guess the predicted probability only could be 0 or 1 for any class, because all terminal nodes are pure(same label). If the single tree is not fully grown and/or more trees are grown, then the predicted probability can be a positive rational number from 0 to 1.
