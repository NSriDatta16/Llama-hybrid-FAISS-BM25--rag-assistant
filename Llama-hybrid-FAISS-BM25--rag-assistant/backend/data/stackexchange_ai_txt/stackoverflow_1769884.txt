I've never known being certified to help greatly but I don't live in the US or a hot bed of the IT industry. Someone else may be able to shed more light on this topic, but I can only assume that in a more vibing city for IT such as Silicon Valley or perhaps NY, it may look a little more impressive if two or more candidates are evenly matched. But if you're weak in interviewing skills or thinking on the spot etc, being certified might not help too greatly. The book you mentioned sounds good and will probably be sufficient. I've always enjoyed the head first series too and in your case perhaps the Head First Java might be worth a look (also Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates). Some other posts relating to SCJP may be of help too: Does scjp help is an scjp certificate worthwhile
