Like Jeff Yates, I would use one file per type. Java enforces that, .NET not - but this seems the way to go for well organized solutions. Also, I would place all BST related files in a separated project in the same solution. If I understood you correctly, your application is not about BST's, it just uses them, right? If that's the case, a separated project is the way to go here. And make well-named and well-defined namespaces too. Like MyApplication.Bst for BST related files, and MyApplication.UI for the front-end, for instance.
