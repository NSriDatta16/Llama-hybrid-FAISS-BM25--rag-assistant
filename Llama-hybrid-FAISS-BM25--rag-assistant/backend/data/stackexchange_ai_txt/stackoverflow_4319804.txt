Objective C - Setting variables in a Request Object

I am trying to debug an iPhone application created by a contractor that is no longer with us. My background is C#, and am not familiar with Objective C at all. I was wondering if someone here could interpret a piece of code for me. To give a little bit of a background, the application is providing latitude/longitude coordinates to a .NET service through a request object. (void)ShowNearestPOI:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinate { ASIFormDataRequest *theRequest = [ASIFormDataRequest requestWithURL: [self URLBuilderFunctionWithEndpointName:kServiceIdGetNearestPOI] ]; /* NSString *tmpGeoLatString = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%2.6f", coordinate.latitude] stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; NSString *tmpGeoLongString = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%2.6f", coordinate.longitude] stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; [theRequest setPostValue:tmpGeoLatString forKey:@"latitude"]; [theRequest setPostValue:tmpGeoLongString forKey:@"longitude"]; */ [theRequest setPostValue:@"1" forKey:@"latitude"]; [theRequest setPostValue:@"1" forKey:@"longitude"]; [theRequest setPostValue:kINGMethodNameGetNearestPOI forKey:@"method"]; [theRequest addRequestHeader:@"User-Agent" value:kCustomUserAgent]; [theRequest setDelegate:self]; [theRequest startAsynchronous]; request_state = 1; // Loading please wait } What I want to know is whether the contractor has hardcoded the latitude and longitude with 1 and 1 respectively. The two lines I believe this is happening in are below: [theRequest setPostValue:@"1" forKey:@"latitude"]; [theRequest setPostValue:@"1" forKey:@"longitude"]; Any help will be appreciated. Cheers!
