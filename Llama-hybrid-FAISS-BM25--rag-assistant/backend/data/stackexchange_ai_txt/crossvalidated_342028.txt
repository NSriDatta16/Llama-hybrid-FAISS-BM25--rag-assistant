8 groups is not great for a random effect, but it's probably better than the alternative of using a fixed effect for each of them - especially if you are expecting group-level variation in more than the intercept. Perhaps more appropriate would be to switch to a Bayesian framework and specify your priors; the lack of data would just mean that the data will (probably) have a weak effect on your posterior, and you would have less cause to be concerned that the error estimates are poor. But that would not be my biggest concern with this analysis. With 3 data points through time, you would have to be very confident that the metabolite will change in a specific way (e.g. linearly, exponential decay, etc). Deviation from this expected shape would be very difficult to pick up in your analysis.
