A clustered index is not really an index - in the sense that it's all the data organized in the tree according to the key. A non-clustered index is just the key in the tree with any additional included columns and the necessary bookmark to get to the data row when necessary. The data itself may be stored in a clustered index or a heap. And there can be many non-clustered indexes, but obviously only one real way to choose to store the data. For performance of a particular query, a covering non-clustered index on a heap (or whatever, it doesn't matter, since the index is covering) can often easily outperform a clustered index, since the index may fit more rows per page and requires no bookmark lookups to get data out of the row, while a clustered index seek/scan is going to read and discard a lot more data and fit less rows per page. Typically you will want a clustered index and the clustering key should be narrow, static, increasing, unique. But for query performance you really want to look at non-clustered indexes and have a selection which are covering and which have sort orders in the right direction where applicable.
