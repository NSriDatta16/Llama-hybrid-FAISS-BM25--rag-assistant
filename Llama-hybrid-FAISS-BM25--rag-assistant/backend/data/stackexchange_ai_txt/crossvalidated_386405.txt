How to improve a model that is consistently underestimating

I've been trying to predict house prices (real data from my country) and I noticed that initially, errors are centered around zero, but around the $2,500,000 mark, the model starts underestimating prices, at an increasing rate. I'm using a random forest model, which brings the best results. My question is: is there something I can do to improve estimation on the right tail? I thought about regressing these two variables after the $2,500,000 mark and then using the beta from that regression to re-center those predictions around zero, but doesn't seem to be a very orthodox way. Is there any advice for these cases? Thanks
