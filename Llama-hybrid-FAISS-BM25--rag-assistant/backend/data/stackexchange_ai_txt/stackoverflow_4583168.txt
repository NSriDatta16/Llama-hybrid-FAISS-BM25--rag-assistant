Best practices in implementing multi-tenancy in a roo app

I am developing a simple CRUD app using roo. User auth is done using database tables (Ref: http://roosbertl.blogspot.com/2010/06/using-spring-security-database-in.html ) I want to limit a "normal" user to only reading, searching, updating records created by him/her. Is this possible directly with roo? What is the best approach to achieve this?
