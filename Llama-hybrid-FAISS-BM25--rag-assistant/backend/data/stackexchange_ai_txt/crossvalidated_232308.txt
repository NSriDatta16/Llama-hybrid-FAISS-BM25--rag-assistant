What is the minimum number of "cases" for minority class to perform logistic regression?

I have 6 out of 167 cases of cancer in the dependent variable. I would evaluate if three independent variables predicted the cancer. Are 6 cases enough? Is there a rule to determine this? Is there difference if the indipendent variables is nominal or numeric?
