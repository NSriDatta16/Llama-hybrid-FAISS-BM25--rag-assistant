The hard drive head (needle) starts moving and the disk starts spinning up (unless already spinning) at the read operation. There is no head move or spinup at the seek operation. Please note that the head may move nonsequentially above the disk even if you are read ing a file sequentially, i.e. the the read of the 2nd, 3rd etc. 512-byte block may cause the head to move far away as well even if there aren't intervening seek s. This is partially because the file is fragmented on the filesystem, or because the firmware has a sector number remapping (i.e. logical sector 5 is not between logical sectors 4 and 6) to compensate bad-block errors.
