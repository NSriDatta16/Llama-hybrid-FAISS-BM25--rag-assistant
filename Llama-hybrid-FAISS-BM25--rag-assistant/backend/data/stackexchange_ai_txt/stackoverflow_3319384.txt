Strip out special characters

I pull some data from a HTML page with a list of products and for some text it looks like this: Organicâ„¢ In the HTML page when I look at that same text I can see its supposed to read Organic with the TM (Trade Mark) symbol after it. Why does it look like the above! My main question is How can I get rid of TM, @ and Copyright symbols so I am just left with a clean name of the product? Thanks all for any help
