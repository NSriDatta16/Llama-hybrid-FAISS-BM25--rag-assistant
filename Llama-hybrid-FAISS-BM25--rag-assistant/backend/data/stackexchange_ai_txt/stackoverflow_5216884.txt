Local only, revision/version/source control

From what I've read: Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar are good version control software. Subversion is a server based one. But what is the best (and I encourage adding your own) system when the only requirements are: simplicity - single-user / local I want to "go back (and forward) in time" integrates well with Visual Studio 2010. This will be used with C++ if that matters and maybe C# in the future. I don't really want it to be cluttered by server interface things that I'll never use. The backward and forward I suppose implies branching.
