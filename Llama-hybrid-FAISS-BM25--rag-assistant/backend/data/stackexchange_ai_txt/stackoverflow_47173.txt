A) I have a similar CMS app and I store an ordinal value with the page for a particular tree and sort on this value -- because lots of my pages appear in completely different sites I have to maintain the ordinal number against a page / tree combination. B) I too would like a better way to do this. Currently they click on the node in the treeview and in the main page screen they can move the page around. I've tried drag and drop with java script and other solutions but my users could never work with it without lots of hand holding. I'll be interested in the responses to this one.
