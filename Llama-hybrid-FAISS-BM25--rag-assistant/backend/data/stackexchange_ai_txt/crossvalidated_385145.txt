multicollinarity issue

I ran a logistic regression moderation analyses and I noticed that with the addition of the interaction term, one of the predictors flipped signs. The variable (X) was previously -.015 and became .006 when the interaction term was added. I suspected this might be an issue with multicollinearity but the VIF for each of the variables is below 1.5. I understand that suppressor effects can occur upon adding predictors. However, can someone tell me whether they think the sign switching upon adding an interaction term is a problem? Would it make sense to correlate the variables in the interaction term?
