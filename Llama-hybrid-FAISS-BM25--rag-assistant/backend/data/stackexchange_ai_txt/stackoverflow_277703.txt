"How big should I let an event log table get before I start archiving / clearing it out?" Never clear the event logs -- the information has significant value. However, when some manager insists that an archive is necessary, you can show the cost of storage vs. the cost of your time to (a) think about it, (b) get second and third opinions, and then (c) write a procedure to archive log records. The cost of storage is plummeting. Your time is better spent on ANYTHING other than purging log records. Bottom line: you have permission to stop wringing your hands. It's all good. You're not making a fundamental mistake.
