Magento router: How can I catch parameters in all URLs?

Think of a small and basic affiliate system. I want an URL like www.myshop.com/mynewproduct.html?afid=123 Every time afid is found in the URL, a method should be called (basically to save "afid" in the session and when the customer buys stuff, I want to track it).
