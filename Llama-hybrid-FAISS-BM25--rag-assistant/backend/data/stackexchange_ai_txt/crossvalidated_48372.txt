In response to whuber's follow-up, I would advocate that an all-purpose black-box approach would be using a non-parametric bootstrap. The basic pseudocode is: Jointly resample from observed rows of data, allowing for replications and holding the sample size fixed. Re-estimate covariance in the resampled data. Repeat 1-2 for a sufficient number of iterations. Use the simulated values to compute variance estimates or empirical 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles to form confidence intervals. An example here: set.seed(1) x var(x)) } o Feel free to try this simulation with any random or non-random distribution of $X$ and functional form of the mean model. I am unsure (though cautiously optimistic) CIs based on bootstrapped covariance estimates give correct 95% coverage.
