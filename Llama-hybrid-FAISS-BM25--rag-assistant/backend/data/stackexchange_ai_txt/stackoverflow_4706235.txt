$q = strtolower($_GET["q"]); becomes $q = mysql_real_escape_string(strtolower($_GET["q"])); your connection to the db must be established and there must be only one link, but that is the case otherwise your mysql_query wouldnt work correctly. the code is not very elegant but it'll work. you may want to change that: if (!$q) return; to if (strlen($q) == 0) return;
