Excess kurtosis in the error term

I am modelling the residual errors terms in my time-series model using Student's $t$ -distribution. This distribution allows for more kurtosis (‘heavy tailedness’) than the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, the level of kurtosis that is accommodated by this distribution in excess of the Gaussian’s level of three equals $\dfrac{6}{\nu - 4}$ provided that $\nu > 4$ , where $\nu$ is the number of degrees of freedom (Harvey, 2013, p. 20). In this case, the number of degrees of freedom does not refer to the sample size minus the number of estimated parameters, but instead is a “shape” parameter for the distribution. In my current model, the value of $\nu$ is $2.87$ . Any sense of what this means about the level of excess kurtosis? Here is a reference to Harvey's book: Harvey, A. C. (2013).
