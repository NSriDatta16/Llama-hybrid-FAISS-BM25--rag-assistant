How to perform "shell" icon embedding in Visual Studio 2010?

As far as I can tell, there have been (at least?) three types of icon embedding. There's the original style used by shell32.dll and friends, .NET's embedding, and the new type that WPF uses. I'm looking for how to perform the first one, as I want to have a few other icons available as resources for a jumplist, which can only accept that style. However, I can't figure out how to embed in this style, only the other two. How do I do this? All the results I find on google, etc are for adding icons to ResX files or similar.
