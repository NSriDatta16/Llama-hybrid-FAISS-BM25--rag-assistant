How do dependent samples affect variable importance in random forests?

In random forest models variable importance is calculated based on how the variable affects the model's predictive performance on out-of-bag samples. A typical application generates a training set by sampling records with replacement from the dataset. My intuition is that if the samples in the dataset are dependent (e.g. temporally dependent data collected over time) the variable importance calculation may be biased unless some modification is performed (for example by transforming the responses to be stationary or by modifying the resampling step to preserve the data structure) to handle the data dependence. I searched around but I couldn't find any scholarly works saying this was the case, however. Is my intuition correct? Any citations discussing this issue would be greatly appreciated.
