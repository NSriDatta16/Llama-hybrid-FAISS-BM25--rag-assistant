To test whether the error term in a latent-response formulation of logistic regression has different variances across observations, a researcher has to assume certain heteroskedasticity patterns as specific predictors of the scale effect in cumulative link models, of which binary logistic regression is a special case, and test them, with likelihood ratio tests for example. There are two specification tests for binary and ordinal regression, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the Lipsitz test, to test bias in the predicted probabilities. No need to use robust SE in discrete choice models. If the model specification (predictor inclusion and functional form of the location and scale structures) is correct, robust SE is less efficient than regular SE; if the model specification is incorrect, robust SE is generated for inconsistent point estimates, which does not correct the most substantive problem. Therefore, instead of using robust SE, after fitting a logistic regression model, a researcher should perform specification tests to screen lack of fit and examine potential nonlinear functions of predictors, such as interaction, squared, cubic, and logarithm terms, in both the location and scale parameters.
