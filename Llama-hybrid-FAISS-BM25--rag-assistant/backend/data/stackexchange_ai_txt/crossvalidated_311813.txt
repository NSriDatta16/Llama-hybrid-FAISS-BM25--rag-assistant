Can somebody explain to me NUTS in english?

My understanding of the algorithm is the following: No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method. This means that it is not a Markov Chain method and thus, this algorithm avoids the random walk part, which is often deemed as inefficient and slow to converge. Instead of doing the random walk, NUTS does jumps of length x. Each jump doubles as the algorithm continues to run. This happens until the trajectory reaches a point where it wants to return to the starting point. My questions: What is so special about the U-turn? How does doubling the trajectory not skip the optimized point? Is my above description correct?
