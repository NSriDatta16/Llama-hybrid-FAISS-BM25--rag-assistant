Why would a Drupal form not be cached in cache_form?

My form, lets call it organize_issue , is a form in a custom module being called from the menu using the page callback drupal_get_form function. The form works perfectly well. I'm trying to implement some AHAH type functionality now, and need to get the page from cache using form_get_cache($form_build_id, $form_state) but, oddly enough, my form isn't being cached. Ever. Other forms on the site are, just not this one. As I said the form works fine, and submits and validates and whatnot... it just never caches. Is their something simple I'm missing?
