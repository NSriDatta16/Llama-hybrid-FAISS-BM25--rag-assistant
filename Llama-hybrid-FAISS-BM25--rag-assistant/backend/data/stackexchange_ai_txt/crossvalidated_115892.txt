Determining the class of a new sequence using Markov chains

I want to use a Markov chain to classify a new given sequence as from model+ or model- . For that purpose first I trained two sequences from model+ and model- . When the new sequence is given how to say that belongs to which class? Please note the sequences are based on web browsing not biological sequences.
