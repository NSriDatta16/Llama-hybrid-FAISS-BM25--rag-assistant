Favorite emacs minor mode?

I just discovered tabbar , a minor mode that provides firefox like tabs in emacs. I also modify org-mode into a minor mode and use it with other major modes for code folding and organizing my code, for example: ( ahk-org-mode ) What are your favorite minor modes. Are there major modes that you have turned into minor modes so you can use them with other major modes ?
