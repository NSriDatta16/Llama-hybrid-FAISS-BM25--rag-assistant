Today (3rd Feb 2011) Apple released the GM-Seed of xcode4. It's now ready for usage and you can compile your apps and release to the app-store. So if you are new with xcode, I would suggest using xcode4. Why? The new compiler has a lot of optimizations done. The compiler (as far as I can see the results) generates faster code. It's big fun! The new Userinterface is more reliable. It makes your development a lot faster! 2a. Interface builder is now integrated. You can "drag and drop" your userinterface Item using the "ctrl"-key into your code and xcode creates the source for you! This accelerates creation of userinterfaces a lot! git support has been added to sourcecontrol, which makes development in teams easier The new LLVM compiler shows errors immediately while coding. And it displays errors, which xcode3 never mentioned In xcode4 Apple changed a lot! So if you start with xcode3, you will have a new learning curve with xcode 4. For newbs I suggest: Download the xcode4 goldmaster and get startet with xcode4!
