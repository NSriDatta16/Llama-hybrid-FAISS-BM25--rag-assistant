I used to use DataSets in early .NET days, then started using typed DataSets, over time found that the memory footprint left by DataSets are very high and it did not make sense to use unmanaged objects for every simple tasks. Hence concluded that DTOs/POCOs are a better choice and started using NHibernate and iBatis. My average(or below average) developers found them complex and hard to use(no pun intended). So I made a home grown ORM XmlDataMapper that was much easier to use that the complex ORMs out there. To integrate XmlDataMapper all you need to do is 4 little steps Create a Business Entity / DTO for the tables Create an XML File with the mapping information between the table and the DTO. Specify the DTO and xml file in the configuration. Just call the DTOConverter.Convert(dataReader) and other such methods to convert your database record to DTO / Business Entity
