I think the best design would be the Android LocalService example: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html#LocalServiceSample I wouldn't. Use the loosest possible coupling you can stand. Hence, on average, aim for the command pattern with startService() instead of the binding pattern with bindService() . Notably, binding is a bit of a pain when it comes to dealing with configuration changes (e.g., screen rotations). What is the best way for the Service to call the Activity? Do I use Intents, BroadcastReceivers, Messages? How? See Notify activity from service
