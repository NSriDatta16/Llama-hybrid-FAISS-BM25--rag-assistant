You can use logistic regression. In SPSS the categorical variable (group A, B, or C) can be entered as a single variable using the contrast command, in which case one of the three will be designated as the reference category, or if you prefer you can create 2 dummy variables to account for the 3 groups. You would run the regression hierarchically: first enter those risk factors you want to control, then on a separate step enter Group and watch for the coefficients, odds ratios [in SPSS, "Exp(B)"], and/or p-values you obtain for each category as compared to the reference category. For example, if C is the reference and if the odds ratio for A is 1.3, then A has 1.3 times the odds that C has of developing the disease. (Just be careful to distinguish odds from probability.)
