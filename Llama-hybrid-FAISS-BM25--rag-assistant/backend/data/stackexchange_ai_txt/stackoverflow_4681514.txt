StratifiedJS allows you to do exactly that. There's even an article on how to apply it on browser storage: http://onilabs.com/blog/stratifying-asynchronous-storage And this is the Stratified JavaScript library it uses https://gist.github.com/613526 The example goes like: var db = require("webdatabase").openDatabase("CandyDB", ...); try { var kids = db.executeSql("SELECT * FROM kids").rows; db.executeSql("INSERT INTO kids (name) VALUES (:name);", [kids[0]]); alert("done"); } catch(e) { alert("something went wrong"); } maybe a bit late, but the tech didn't exist back then ;)
