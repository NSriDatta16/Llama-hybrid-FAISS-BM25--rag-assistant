Centrality measures and interpretation

I am new to graph theory and I have some questioning. First of all, how can I determine the significant of two different degree centrality means and two different closeness centrality means? For example, I have a network of international organizations which are public or private, but I don't know how to determine if the difference between their means is significant or not : Type x 1 private 0.05613594 2 public 0.05668078 Type x 1 private 4.441558 2 public 8.750000 In order to evaluate if the type of international organization is linked with a higher degree centrality (and with a higher closeness centrality), I performed an ANOVA test; However, does it the right test to determined a possible link ? Thanks you very much
