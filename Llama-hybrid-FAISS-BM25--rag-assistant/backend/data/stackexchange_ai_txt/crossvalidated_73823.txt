I am not certain, what exactly you are trying to capture, but as they are financial time series I've assembled some possible alternate methods to visualize the information. As they are stock time series, and I assume returns or price differences, I would recommend integrating (cumsum or cumprod) the series. The cumulative price series would be a better way to visually discern differences between the series. If you are trying to visually get a feel for difference of the series in the current form, I would consider breaking up the series into smaller time ranges (using something like panels or trellis plots), as the data looks too compressed to discern much. Here, one can see some correlation of daily series on monthly time intervals. You could also run overlapping density plots of each of the individual series to quickly ascertain differences in sample statistics (mean, variance, higher moments). In your case, I would expect to see some separation between the distributions, indicating differences in mean (drift), as well as differences in variance (volatility) between series. The plots were generated via R.
