Python statmodel coint doesn't give the same p-value as adfuller on OLS residual

According to Eagle and Granger (1987), if I have 2 time series y1 and y2, we can test their cointegration with the p-value of an ADF stationarity test performed on the OLS residual. Though, when running statmodels coint function and doing the ADF on OLS residual, I end up with 2 different p-values. Here is an example : ols_result = linregress(y[0], y[1]) # y_1 = alpha + beta y_0 print('OLS done. Results:') print(ols_result) residuals: ts = y[1] - (ols_result.intercept + ols_result.slope * y[0]) df_result = ts.adfuller(residuals, regression='c', autolag='AIC', maxlag=1) print(df_result) print('Testing cointegration using coint') coint_res = coint(y[0], y[1], trend='c', maxlag=1, autolag='AIC', return_results=True) print(coint_res) This script gives 2 different p-values. What did I miss in my script ?
