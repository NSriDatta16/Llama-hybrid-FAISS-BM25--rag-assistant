You have a modeling problem, as well as possibly a non-normality problem. My reading is that you have three time points, but if you look at the anova, you have 1 d.f. for Time because it is being modeled as a quantitative predictor rather than a factor. That's why in your emmeans output, you have results for just one time value -- the average value of Time -- rather than the three time points, and no comparisons for time. So the non-normality is the lesser of your problems, given that the model itself has no reasonable interpretation. For starters, I suggest fitting models like this: m1 I suspect you may still have a non-normality problem for some response variables. That often comes up because the variation in the data is related to the mean, and you can tell the most about that situation by plotting the residuals vs. the fitted values: plot (resid(m1) ~ predict(m1)) There will be six stacks of points for this model. If those vary in scatter is a systematic way (especially if they get more dispersed to the right than to the left), it can often be helped by transforming the response variable, e.g., m2 The EMMs will then be on the transformed scale, but you can put the means (not the comparisons) back on the response scale by adding type = "response" to the emmeans() call. It may serve you well to find a statistical consultant. It is vitally important to get the model right and to understand what you have. It isn't enough to just be able to get programs to run.
