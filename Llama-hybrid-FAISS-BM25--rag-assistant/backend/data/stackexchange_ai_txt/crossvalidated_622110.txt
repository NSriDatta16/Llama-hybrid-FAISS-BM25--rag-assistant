Projection pursuit regression

Projection pursuit regression (PPR) is described in Hastie et al.'s The Elements of Statistical Learning in the chapter on neural networks. The algorithm was introduced by Friedman and Stuetzle (1981) . It seems to be equivalent to fitting a neural network with one hidden layer, but where the hidden-node activation functions are non-parametric functions to be estimated. There is a function ppr in R for fitting PPR models, but I can find very little discussion of this method on the internet. Much of the scientific literature where PPR is mentioned dates from the 1990s and earlier. Is it fair to say that PPR is now obsolete, or are there situations where it has unique advantages over more commonly used methods such as neural networks?
