How can I check if the hit rate of the correct answer significantly differed between groups?

I have a task in my experiment, where participants had to select an emotion out of 7 options dependent on a video they saw. The participants were split between three groups. Now I want to check, if there is a significant difference in hit rate between the groups and I am not sure how to do this. I transformed the data the participants submitted to a binomial variable: They either had the correct response or not. On that data I tried out binomial logistic regression, but I realized that might not be what I am looking for, since the logistic pretty much finds out all groups have a probability of hitting the correct emotion, so there is no significant difference. So how can I do it? For example, for the surprised emotion, the hit rates between the groups were: 95%, 73,7% and 70% with group samples of 20 persons in first and third and 19 persons in the second condition. EDIT: In a perfect world, I would be able to even check the difference between groups over all three hit rates. But I guess this might lead to issues, since there is only one hit rate per emotion, so we don't have anything like a distribution. EDIT2: I found that apparently there is something with the Chi-Squared-test that gives me information. I tried the test for surprised with all three groups and it reported non-significance (since the difference between group 2 + 3 is highly insignificant). But when I exclude group 2 it reports significance for the other two. So I basically want to do something like an ANOVA, but for the hit rates, telling me if there is some difference between any groups and being able to do post-hoc tests for the different groups. Example data: Quota Emotion Correct? 1 Yes 2 Yes 3 Yes 1 Yes 2 No 3 Yes 1 No 2 Yes
