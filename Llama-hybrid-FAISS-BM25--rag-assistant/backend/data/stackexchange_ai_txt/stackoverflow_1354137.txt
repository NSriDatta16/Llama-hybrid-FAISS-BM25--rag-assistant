That's a bit of a difficult question to answer since most modern IDEs offer such a wide range of features. From a general standpoint, I'd become familiar with hot key combinations for repetitive tasks (saving, building, code folding, etc.) and how to install/enable/disable add-ons and plug-ins. That will make you more efficient. As Aiden mentions, knowing how to to a build from the command line/compilation in general will be useful as well as version control systems. Get familiar with GIT and Subversion. The IDE will not make you write better code. For that, you're going to need practice and some time spent reading/listening to podcasts. Read Robert Martin's "Clean Code" for starters. Additionally, spend the time to learn proper TDD and the toolset(s) available for your IDE.
