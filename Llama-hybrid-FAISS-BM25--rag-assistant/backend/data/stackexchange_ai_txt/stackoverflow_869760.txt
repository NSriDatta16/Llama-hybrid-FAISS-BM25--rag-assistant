According to this, the tab was removed from newer versions of Visual Studio: How to make clipboard ring appear in VS2008 toolbox? Probably they're keeping the name reserved in case they ever want to bring it back. You can however still drag text to the Toolbox tab and drop it there for later use. I use Control+Shift+Ins to cycle through the ring. Control+Shift+V works too.
