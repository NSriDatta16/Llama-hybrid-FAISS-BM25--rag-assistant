Confusion in RNN terminologies?

I recently started working on RNN and LSTM and got confused with the terminologies. What is the meaning of RNN layer ? When I say RNN has 2 layer - does that mean Two RNN cell connected horizontally ? Two RNNs connected vertically. In that case what we call the connection of multiple RNN cell horizontally ?
