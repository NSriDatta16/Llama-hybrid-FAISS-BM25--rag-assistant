Interpreting average linkage clustering results in SPSS

I am trying to cluster 6 PC scores for a 1600 cases data (so its a 1600 x 6 matrix). I am using average linkage clustering technique that would be followed by a K mean clustering. The purpose of Average linkage clustering is to provide seed values for K mean clustering. Would somebody explain me how to extract the results of average linkage clustering from Agglomeration Schedule?
