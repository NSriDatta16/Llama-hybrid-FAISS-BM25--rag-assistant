If you can treat the confidence values $c(t)$ like inverse-variances, then perhaps you could use a simple moving average , but with inverse-variance weighting . You'd have to specify a window size $k$ , but to get a smoothed value given $x(t-1), ..., x(t-k)$ , your formula is $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k c(t-i) \cdot x(t-i)}{\sum_{i=1}^k c(t-i)}$ . You may have to jigger your confidence scores somewhat so that you can treat them like inverse-variances. I'm sure someone's investigated the properties of this in the context of time series analysis, but for the life of me I don't know what it would be called.
