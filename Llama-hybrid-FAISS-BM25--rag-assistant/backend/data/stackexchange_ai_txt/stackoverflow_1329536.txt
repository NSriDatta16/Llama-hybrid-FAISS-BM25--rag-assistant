web app data layer dis/advantages

I am wondering about the long term advantages (if any) of layering my web app by separating my business logic and data from my web forms. (ie a form, business logic, data not in the same file, but each in it's own class in another folder by itself or combined with other like classes). I like to make everything as modular as possible and to do so efficiently it seems that keeping all the code in one file - in the web form makes organization and reuse much easier. There are certain functions that are used across the site like managing connections that would be in their own classes and files. I am pretty new to c#, sorry if I am messing up the terminology. Thanks
