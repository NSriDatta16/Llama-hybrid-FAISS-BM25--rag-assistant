In this case, your input tensor should have the shape of (num_of_samples, 1, 30), where the 1 indicates the number of channels in the time series data and the 30 indicates the number of time points per sample. The input tensor shape of (num_of_samples, 30, 1) would be appropriate for data with 30 features and 1 time point per sample.
