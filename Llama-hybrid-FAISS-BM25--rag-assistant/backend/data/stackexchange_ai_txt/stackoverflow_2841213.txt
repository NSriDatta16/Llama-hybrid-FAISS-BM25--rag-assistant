Heap property of this array

From programming pearls, it is known that array[1...n] has heap property if for all 2 . Here is my code: import java.math.*; public class Heap { public static void main(String[]args) { int x[]=new int[]{12,20,15,29,23,17,22,35,40,26,51,19}; for (int i=2;i Here I used Math.round because 4/2 and 5/2 is same and =2. When I compile this code it shows me at last line that it is not heap. Maybe because the index starts from 1 and we don't pay attention to index 0, yes?
