Tooltip triggered by text selection

I am looking to create a tooltip that is triggered by the selection of text (left-click dragging over text). Preferably by creating a JQuery plugin. My ultimate goal is when a user selects/highlights a sentence, phrase, paragraph, it will trigger a tooltip. The tooltip will contain social sharing buttons that will allow a user to post the selection to their personal profile status. So if you like a particular quote, you can select it, click share to twitter, it will call the twitter api to post the selection (if over the 140 characters it will add an ellipsis) with a shortened url back to the page of the selection. Obviously this is going to take a bit of development, but as a front-end designer I just need to get the ball rolling. Thank you for any help you can provide. An example of the functionality I desire is similar to how the apture extension functions: http://www.apture.com/extension/
