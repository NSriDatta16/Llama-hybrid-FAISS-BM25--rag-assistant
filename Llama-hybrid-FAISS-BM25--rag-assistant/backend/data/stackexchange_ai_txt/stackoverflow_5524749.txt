You can fake it by making a more complex layout, but I'm not sure whether it's worth it. Here's something I hacked together: There might be a more concise way to do it. I tend to struggle getting RelativeLayout to do what I want sometimes. Note that you need to pay attention to the z-order (Button needs to appear first in the top level RelativeLayout) and you might need to adjust padding to get it to look the way you want.
