Answering your question with a question: what exactly is machine learning? Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman in The Elements of Statistical Learning , Kevin P. Murphy in Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective , Christopher Bishop in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville in Deep Learning and a number of other machine learning "bibles" mention linear regression as one of the machine learning "algorithms". Machine learning is partly a buzzword for applied statistics and the distinction between statistics and machine learning is often blurry.
