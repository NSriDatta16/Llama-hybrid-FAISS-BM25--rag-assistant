It's possible you are getting subclasses for your objects (i know hibernate creates proxy classes for lazy loading support). in your Car class equals method, you do a "getClass()" comparison which will be false if you are comparing a proxy subclass to an actual instance. you could try the instanceof operation instead of getClass() (like in your Garage equals method). You could confirm all of this by including "getClass()" in your toString() method. also, (again a lazy loading thing), you should never refer to member vars directly in an entity class, you should always use the getters and setters. (so your equals,toString,... methods should use getName(), etc.
