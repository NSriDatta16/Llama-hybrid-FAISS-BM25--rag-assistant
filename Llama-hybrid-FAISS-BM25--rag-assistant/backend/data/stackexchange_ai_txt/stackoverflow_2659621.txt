My approach in this situation is usually to unit test non-GUI layers, use automated testing for the GUI as far as possible and then manually test anything that's left. I also use manual testing for ad-hoc defect detection to identify missing test cases. For me, this provides the best ratio of test coverage to cost. Ultimately it depends on what you're trying to achieve - is this mission-critical software or a simple app where failure is purely an inconvenience?
