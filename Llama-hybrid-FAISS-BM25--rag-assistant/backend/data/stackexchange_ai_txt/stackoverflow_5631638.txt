From Python documentation , 5. Built-in Types / 5.9. File Objects: In order to make a for loop the most efficient way of looping over the lines of a file (a very common operation), the next() method uses a hidden read-ahead buffer. BTW: It is generally discouraged to use keywords (e.g. file ) as variable names.
