There isn't a way to produce an assembly with script embedded in it. I think the /assembly flag might be a remnant, or is there primarily for the script# compiler to know where the assembly produced from the same code as produced by the c# compiler exists. If you want to embed the script in that assembly, you'll need to do a two pass c# build - in pass 1, there is a placeholder script, and then in pass 2, the real generated script. Alternatively I can think of some approaches involving ildasm, add script resource reference, and then ilasm'ing to get back a new assembly. What is your scenario? I am curious. I've debated whether to make the two pass build be supported out of the box... but never gotten around to it, since the embedding a script was a nice-to-have.
