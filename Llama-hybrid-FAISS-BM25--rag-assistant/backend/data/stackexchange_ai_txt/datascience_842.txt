Data Science Project Ideas

I don't know if this is a right place to ask this question, but a community dedicated to Data Science should be the most appropriate place in my opinion. I have just started with Data Science and Machine learning. I am looking for long term project ideas which I can work on for like 8 months. A mix of Data Science and Machine learning would be great. A project big enough to help me understand the core concepts and also implement them at the same time would be very beneficial.
