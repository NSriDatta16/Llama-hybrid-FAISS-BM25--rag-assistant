Estimating Flash project hours

I'm trying to estimate the hours required to build a group of 5 simple children's games in Flash. They will include such things as having kids drag and drop healthy food items into a basket; choosing the healthy and unhealthy food items by marking them in some way; etc. I have no experience building games in Flash, but I have programmed in Flex and Actionscript. How many hours do you estimate for this project?
