My usual starting point for these kinds of expeditions is to write a simple accounting program; money in/Money out with scheduling and graphing. It turned out to be a pretty useful exercise when i started out with WPF because it gives you the scope for some pretty advanced stuff when you get around to visualizing the data (if you want to get fancy!) and also has a LOB edge to it meaning you're more likely to gain some commercially viable skills with it. I also used IsolatedStorage in mine which was fairly useful. Anywho, that's my suggestion.
