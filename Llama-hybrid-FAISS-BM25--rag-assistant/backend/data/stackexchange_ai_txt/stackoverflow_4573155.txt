First off, the very best thing you could possibly do to solve this problem long term is to use a service to send your emails out. There are a lot of them, but I've heard good things about these three: http://sendgrid.com/ (I'm using these guys and am happy so far) http://postageapp.com/ http://postmarkapp.com/ There is also a new entrant that's supposed to be cool, http://www.emailyak.com/ , but they are still in beta. All the services are very affordable, have super simple APIs, and will likely make your problem go away immediately. If that is not an option, or if you just don't want to go that direction, you're going to need to generate (or get someone to send) a spam report that shows why your messages are going into their spam folder. Here's an example of what I'm talking about from spam assassin: Content analysis details: (7.9 points, 6.0 required) pts rule name description ---- ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------- 3.2 FH_DATE_PAST_20XX The date is grossly in the future. 1.1 DNS_FROM_OPENWHOIS RBL: Envelope sender listed in bl.open-whois.org. 0.6 SPF_SOFTFAIL SPF: sender does not match SPF record (softfail) 0.0 UNPARSEABLE_RELAY Informational: message has unparseable relay lines 1.6 HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28 BODY: HTML: images with 2400-2800 bytes of words 0.0 HTML_MESSAGE BODY: HTML included in message 0.0 BAYES_50 BODY: Bayesian spam probability is 40 to 60% [score: 0.5000] 1.5 MIME_HTML_ONLY BODY: Message only has text/html MIME parts Once you have this info, you can diagnose the problem. I doubt it has anything to do with your SPF records, but it's hard to be positive, even though they are listed as "pass" in the headers. Good luck!
