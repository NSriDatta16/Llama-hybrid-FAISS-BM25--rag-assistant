I think I misunderstood your question. What you're asking for is not in scope of how the application handles its key storage, but rather how your company will store it. In that case, you have two obvious choices: Physical: Write to USB drive, burn to CD, etc. Store in physically secure location. But you run into the recursive problem: where do you store the key to the vault? Typically, you delegate 2 or more people (or a team) to hold the keys. Software: Cyber-Ark Private Ark is what my company uses to store its secret digital information. We store all our admin passwords, license keys, private keys, etc. It works by running a Windows "vault" server that is not joined to a domain, firewalls all ports except its own, and stores all its data encrypted on disk. Users access through a web interface that first authenticates the user, then securely communicates with the vault server via explorer-like interface. All changes and versions are logged. But, this also has the same recursive problem... a master admin access CD. This is stored in our physical vault with limited access.
