With the logistic regression model, heteroscedasticity is automatically assumed to exist. The conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ is assumed to be Bernoulli with parameter $\pi(x)$ , a probability. The variance of this distribution is $\pi(x)\times (1-\pi(x))$ , a nonconstant function of $x$ . Likewise, you do not need to worry about normality. You still need to consider the linearity (in the logits) and independence assumptions, however.
