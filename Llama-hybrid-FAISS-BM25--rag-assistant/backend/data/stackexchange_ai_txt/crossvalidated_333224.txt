Does it make sense to use Logistic regression with binary outcome and predictor?

I have a binary outcome variable {0,1} and a predictor variable {0,1}. My thoughts are that it doesn't make sense to do logistic unless I include other variables and calculate the odds ratio. With one binary predictor, wouldn't calculation of probability suffice vs odds ratio?
