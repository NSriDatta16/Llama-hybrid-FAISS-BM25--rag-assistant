As a quick check against the normal 'gotcha' have you explicitly set the canvas height / width properties? If I knock up some xaml for test purposes and run it: Will not show a scroll bar, even though I have explicitly created content in the canvas 2000 to the left, the canvas width not being set means the scroll viewer has no range to bind to so to speak. The canvas without a width is considered is just infinitely wide from what I can see. Whilst this is not the same as dragging the concept of putting a piece of content outside of the current view is there. As soon as you add a width, it defines a finite area to scroll on and the scroll bar shows up.
