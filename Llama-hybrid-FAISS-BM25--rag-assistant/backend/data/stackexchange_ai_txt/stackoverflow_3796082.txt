Don't use a DataInputStream to read lines from a file. Instead, use a BufferedReader , as in: fis = new FileInputStream(file); BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fis)); while ((String line = reader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } The javadoc on DataInputStream.readLine tells you to not use that method. (it's been deprecated) Of course, when you actually get around to reading the numbers, I'd encourage you to forget reading the lines yourself, and just let Scanner read the numbers for you. If you need to know which numbers were on the same line, Scanner can do that for you too: Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(file, "UTF-8").useDelimiter(" +| *(?=\\n)|(? numbersOnLine = new ArrayList (); while (fileScanner.hasNextInt()) { numbersOnLine.add(fileScanner.nextInt()); } processLineOfNumbers(numbersOnLine); if (fileScanner.hasNext()) { fileScanner.next(); // clear the newline } } That fancy regex makes it so that the newline characters between lines also show up as tokens to the Scanner .
