simple trend analysis, time series

For purposes of a non-technical analysis of a simple time-series, what is a quick (but effective) technique / approach to understand (or even 'conclude' with some confidence level) that a trend has shifted (versus that the most recent 'unexpected' observations are due to 'noise' or driven by the unexpected error term E)? One such technique could be to look at moving averages - if so, what would be sensible 'ranges' for the data below (and why)? PS. This is primarily meant for hands-on business oriented questions, not an academic exercise.
