Bivariate Cointegration Test using Johansen Test

I am currently working on my final thesis on the subject of pairs trading and have to carry out a large number of cointegration tests. The reason for this is that I want to compare 100 foreign shares with about 500 shares of the S&P 500, and this over a period of 10 years, rolling every month. This adds up to a seven-digit number and thus an enormous runtime of my code if I design the whole topic in a bivariate way with the help of Engle-Granger test. I have now taken a closer look at Johansen approach, but I can't figure out whether I can test several time series for cointegration at the same time and still get the pairwise connection. My question now is whether I can pack the time series of share A together with the time series of shares B, C and D into a VAR model, test this model for cointegration with Johansen and still get the respective cointegrations between A-B, A-C, A-D? Thanks for your help
