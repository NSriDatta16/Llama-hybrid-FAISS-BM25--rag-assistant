Are positively biased bootstrap-derived GAM predictions indicative of model issues?

all, I am using a negative binomial GAM fitted with mgcv::gam to estimate counts for new data, and I wanted to use bootstrapping to find a 95% confidence interval for point estimates. In my bootstrapping function, I resample from original data, refit the model and run that refit model on the data for which I want count estimates. I believe this is called a nonparametric bootstrap. It is my understanding that the mean of the bootstrapped model predictions should equal the mean of my model predictions when applied to the original data. This small simulation, that I ran in R, seems to confirm that: > x b c(sample.mean = mean(x), bootstrap.mean = mean(b)) sample.mean bootstrap.mean 507.376 507.405 When applied to my GAM, however, my bootstrapped estimates are on average about 5% greater than estimates that stem from the original data, and I wonder if this is cause for concern. I've tried to illustrate these results in the figure below. The left panel shows a histogram of my 1000 bootstrap estimates. The red and blue lines represent my estimate from original data and the mean of my bootstrap estimates, respectively. The right panel shows the mean of the all bootstrap estimates up to the ith bootstrap iteration, so at e.g. x = 100, the y-value corresponds to the mean of the first 100 bootstrap estimates. The light blue region similarly represents the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the bootstrap estimates up to the ith estimate. Figure: Left: histogram showing frequency and range of bootstrapped estimates. Right: Mean of bootstrap bootstrap estimates up to the ith bootstrap iteration Based on these results, I have two questions: Could these results be indicative of a serious problem with my model? If these results are not symptomatic of a serious problem, should I correct my point estimate (derived from the model fitted on the original data) by subtracting the bias? This is my first time posting on stackexchange - I searched thoroughly among already answered questions before posting this, but couldn't really find any answers that I could wrap my head around. Thank you for any pointers you may provide!
