Does my model add any value?

I have 4 features in my dataset. let's say one feature is currently used by doctors in hospital (along with their domain expertise) to make informed decisions. So if I build a binary classification model with just that one feature, it gives me a f1-score of 50% But I as a non-clinician but just a data guy does some exploration of data and do some feature engineering and come up with 3 new features. So, now when I use this 3 new features along with one old feature, my model gives me a f1-score of 53% So, should I consider this 3 new features adds value to my model and helps improve prediction accuracy or how can I justify that these 3 new features are useful? As a layman, I see that f1-score increased from 50% to 53% under same settings like algorithm ,hyperparameters etc. So, am I right to understand that it is good to add these values? my questions are a) Should I add these new features or not? How to determine they are really adding value and not by chance? (I ran multiple time and everytime, the addition of 3 new features improves the f1-score by 3 points approximately) b) or should I drop the whole project because f1-score of 50% is already bad and good for nothing
