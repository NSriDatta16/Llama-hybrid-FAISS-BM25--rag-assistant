These two concepts are not necessarily related. A p-value gives you a measure of strength of association between your y and x, while predictive accuracy is in relation to how good the model predictions are. Below is a simple example, y and x are highly related (on average), but the model is trash (for predicting), because of high variability in y, so the predictions will be quite bad (notice low $R^2$ ). > x=seq(0,1000,1) > y=rnorm(length(x),x,1000) > summary(lm(y~x)) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -6.7322 61.3748 -0.110 0.913 x 0.9593 0.1063 9.026
