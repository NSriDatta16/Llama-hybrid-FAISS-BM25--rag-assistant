Automatically Position Application Window Using Command File in Windows

I'm using PuTTY to access my BSD file server and I have several terminal windows open at once. I wrote a simple command file to automate opening the terminal windows and I'd like to know if it is possible to place them at a specific location. I have two monitors and as it is now, I have to manually drag the terminal windows over to my second monitor.
