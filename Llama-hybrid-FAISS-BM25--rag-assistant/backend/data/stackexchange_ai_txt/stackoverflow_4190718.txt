How to duplicate a .xib file?

I see there's no "duplicate" when I right click on a .xib. So is the way to do it: just to go to finder, copy the file to another name, and then drag it to my resources? Would that be all I'd need to do? [Note: just wondering if there's other files or settings I need to bother with.]
