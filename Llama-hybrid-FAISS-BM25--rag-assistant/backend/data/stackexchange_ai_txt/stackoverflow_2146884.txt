Why does OpenGL use degrees instead of radians?

The OpenGL designers were never afraid of mathematics, and knowledge of linear algebra is essential for all but the simplest OpenGL applications. I think it can safely be assumed that OpenGL programmers are familiar with angles in radians. Mathematically, radians are more elegant than degrees in every respect. They also have practical advantages: The C standard library uses radians. Pretty much any other library out there uses radians as well. Radians are more convenient in some computations, e.g. the length of a circular arc. Why, then, did the OpenGL designers decide to specify functions like glRotatef and gluPerspective to use degrees? (I know it's of no practical importance, and it's not going to change anyway. I'm just curious, and I couldn't find the answer on OpenGL.org.)
