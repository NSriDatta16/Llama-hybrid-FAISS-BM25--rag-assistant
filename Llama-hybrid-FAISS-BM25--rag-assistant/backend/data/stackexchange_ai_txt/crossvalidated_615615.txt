How do I use many highly correlated continuous variables in a logistic regression?

Low Blood Pressure (BP), below a threshold, say 90 mmHg, is associated with worse outcomes in surgery. The depth (how low the BP gets) and the time spent at that depth are both associated with worse outcomes. The association between BP and outcome is also non-linear. I have time spent at each BP value BP OR 60 1.2 59 1.4 58 0.6 57 1.5 Binning the BPs (e.g., 51-55, 56-60, ...) produces the same pattern - every several values there is one BP or one BP bin that is way out of whack from its neighbors. I don't want to combine the BPs into a summary statistic (e.g., time spent below 90 or area under the 90 curve). any help on how to analyze this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
