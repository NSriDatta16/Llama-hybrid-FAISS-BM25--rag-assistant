I use GWT on my penwag.com website, and for some time used the approach where it was nearly 100% AJAX. I did a revamp not too long ago (see http://penwag.blogspot.com/2010/04/april-penwag-update.html ) basically to change who's in the driver's seat. Now, The basic navigation is controlled by HTML, there's a lot more HTML content than there used to be. This helps in a number of ways. First, search engines have more to work with. Second, the navigation is simpler. Third, separation of concerns is easier to achieve, since each page is its own module. Fourth, integration with third-party tools is more seamless. Things that specifically affected penwag.com were Google Ads integration and Google Friend Connect integration. This is probably true of most gadgets out there: they're designed to be embedded in HTML, and embedding them into a GWT component is harder. Some of what I said here is specific to GWT, but a lot of it is true whatever AJAX framework you're using.
