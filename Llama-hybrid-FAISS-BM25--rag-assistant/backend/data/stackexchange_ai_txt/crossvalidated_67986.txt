Does Neural Networks based classification need a dimension reduction?

I am using a Neural Networks based classifier to run a classification for my data in n-dimensional. Then I thought it may be a good idea to run dimension reduction like PCA for my data at first, and then put the PCA results into the classifier (I keep 3 PCs). However, the classification on the dimension reduced features are not as good as using the original high-dimensional features directly. Then I came across this post NN as a DR1 that discussed Neural Networks as a dimension reduction method. Also some information can be found in this paper NN as a DR2 I am confusing now: If I use Neural Networks based classification (in Matlab), does it automatically do the dimension reduction for me? Should I run dimension reduction like PCA before running Neural Networks classification? Are there any other reasons the classification on PCA results is not as good as using the original high dimensional features?
