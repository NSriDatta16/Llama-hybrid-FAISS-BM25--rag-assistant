Easy thought experiment: Do it for unit vectors in x and y direction. Intuitively you can picture that the "average" would be a unit vector at a 45 degree angle up and to the right. That's exactly what happens. The thought experiment suggests that you need to normalize the average by its magnitude to get a unit vector. I'd advise that you do so.
