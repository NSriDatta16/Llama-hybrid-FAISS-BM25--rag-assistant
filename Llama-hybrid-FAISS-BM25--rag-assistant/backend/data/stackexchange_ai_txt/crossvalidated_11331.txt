Identifying oscillation in a time series

I asked this on the mathematics site, but now I think this is a better place. Sorry for the cross-post. Given any line graph, is there a reliable way to identify any sort of regular oscillation? Let's assume I'm charting the prevalence of different species of animals in a single location, over the span of several years. What sort of algorithm could I apply that would identify a regular migration instead of a steady increase or decline? I hope this makes sense. Thanks for the help!
