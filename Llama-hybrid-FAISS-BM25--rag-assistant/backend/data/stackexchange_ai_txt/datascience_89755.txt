How to use GridSearch for LinearSVC / Random Forest with time series data

I have a question related on how to use the GridSearch to find the best models for my problem with time series data. Every 3 rows is 1 one row in the original dataset. To make my time series problem a supervised one, I parsed like the one below. This was resolved from one of my previous question. id Age gender m1 m2 m3 Label 1 20 M 12.4 34 12 0 2 20 M 13 324 34 0 3 20 M 34 232 12 0 4 45 F 1.3 32 19 1 5 45 F 14 132 19 1 6 45 f 94 232 19 1 My question is: How can I use GridSearch for example to find my best machine learning model configuration using time series data? As far as I understand, using cross validation wouldn't work in this case because of the time series nature of the dataset. I'm not sure how to proceed with this.
