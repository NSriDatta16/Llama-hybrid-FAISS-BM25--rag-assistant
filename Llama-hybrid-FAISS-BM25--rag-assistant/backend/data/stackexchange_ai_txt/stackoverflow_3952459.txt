Change format of date in DatePickerDialog?

Following the Android SDK tutorials I have implemented my first basic date picker dialog. It works fine but is there any way to change the format of the date shown? Example: The date picker dialog displays the date as "17 Oct 2010". I would it like to be displayed as "17 10 2010". Greetings, Robert
