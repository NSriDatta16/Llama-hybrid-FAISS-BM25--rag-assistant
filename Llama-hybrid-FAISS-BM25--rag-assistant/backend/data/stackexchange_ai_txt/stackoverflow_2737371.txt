the easiest way would be to add a get variable to your URL: my $URL = "http://www.example.com/?from=perl"; then your PHP doesn't have to do anything fancy. However, you can look at the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] value and parse the referring script's name. But since this value is set by the user agent, it is not necessarily reliable or present.
