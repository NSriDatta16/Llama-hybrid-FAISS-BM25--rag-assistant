How can I apply models to predict the output of a test dataset using SAS?

I'm trying to use SAS from more of a machine learning perspective than a pure stats perspective. I want to perform resampling on a dataset to measure the predictive accuracy of a LDA and Logistic Regression. However, when I perform proc logistic or proc discrim all SAS seems to output is a bunch of statistical measures. I want to use the models to predict the output of my test dataset. Is there any way to do this in SAS?
