You'll have to manipulate the XML writer object you use when calling the Serialize method. Its Settings property has a OmitXmlDeclaration property, which you'll want to set to true. You'll also need to set the ConformanceLevel property, otherwise the XmlWriter will ignore the OmitXmlDeclaration property. XmlWriterSettings settings = new XmlWriterSettings(); settings.OmitXmlDeclaration = true; settings.ConformanceLevel = ConformanceLevel.Fragment; XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(/*whatever stream you need*/,settings); serializer.Serialize(writer,objectToSerialize); writer.close();
