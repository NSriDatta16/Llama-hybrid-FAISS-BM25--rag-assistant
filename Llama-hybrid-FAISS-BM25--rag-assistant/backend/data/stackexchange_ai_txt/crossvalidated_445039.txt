Spurious relationships: flavours, terminology

The following types of relationships come to my mind when I think of the term "spurious" (as in "spurious regression" or "spurious correlation"): A statistical relationship specific to a sample but not the population / the data generating process (DGP). Say, a couple of variables happen to covary in a particular sample. A statistical relationship that exists in a finite population but is not specific to the DGP behind the population. Basically the same as (1) as long as we are interested in the properties of the DGP. A relationship that is inherent in the DGP and has a subject-matter explanation, but the explanation is uninteresting from the subject-matter point of view (the view is problem specific). E.g. the number of drownings and ice cream sales, both driven by air temperature. The relationship is uninteresting from the point of view that neither causes the other. A relationship that is inherent in the DGP but has no subject-matter explanation. (Is that even possible?) Questions: Which of these cases are instances of a "spurious relationship"? How could the remaining cases be termed? Bonus question (just in case you have an opinion on the matter): Which ones may deserve the most attention in a quantitative methods class taught to management students? Edit: An example of 4: Correlation between two random walks with independent increments has a high chance of being far from zero in both small and large samples. There is no subject-matter explanation for the statistical relationship between the random walks (the increments are generated independently of each other), but there is a statistical explanation, i.e. a characterization of the distribution of the correlation coefficient between two random walks with independent increments.
