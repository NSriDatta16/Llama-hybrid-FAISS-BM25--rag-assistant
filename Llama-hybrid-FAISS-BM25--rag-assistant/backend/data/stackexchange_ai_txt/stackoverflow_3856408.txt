Detecting touches on a scrollview

Is it possible to detect the touches in a scrollview which is filled with a grid of buttons as in the image below? For example, in this image, i can only drag the scroll view by dragging on the red areas, but i would like to be able to scroll the scrollview no matter where it is touched (like the iPhone's home screen)? Thanks
