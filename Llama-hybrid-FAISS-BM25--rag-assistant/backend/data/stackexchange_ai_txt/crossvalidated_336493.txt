"Data beats hardware and algorithms in neural nets" paper?

I'm trying to track down the citation information for an article. The paper concerned itself with the recent explosion in successful applications of neural networks, and whether this was cause by more data, better algorithms, or faster hardware. It provided a number of detailed examples (e.g., data corpora with some well-defined performance metric, like MNIST or ImageNet). The conclusion was that the primary driving force was availability of data. I think I read the paper in 2014, probably in arXiv, but I have now spent many hours searching and cannot find it. If anyone can point me to this paper, I'd be very grateful.
