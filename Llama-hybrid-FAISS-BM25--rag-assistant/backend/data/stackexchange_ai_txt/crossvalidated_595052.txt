Can someone explain why finding similar embeddings coming from two different net gives bad recall?

I'm currently working on an ensemble of 5 differently trained networks using MinkLoc3D v2 as base-net. I'm currently investigating the reason for lousy recall when I compare the extracted database embedding using one network (trained for example with seed 42) and the extracted query embedding using one network (trained for example with seed 69). If a create an ensemble of those networks using bagging (making the average of the embeddings extracted by every model), I have good recall, similar to the result of the MinkLoc3Dv2 as a single net. I know that every net, map the input into a different feature space and so my recall would be bad, but I can't understand why it's so bad. I put here my results:
