Take a look to the following algo/repositories: https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn/blob/master/README.md "xLearn can be used for solving large-scale machine learning problems. First, xLearn supports out-of-core training, which can handle very large data (TB) by just leveraging the disk of a PC. In addition, xLearn supports distributed training, which scales beyond billions of example across many machines by using the parameter server framework." https://github.com/fmfn/FTRLp/blob/master/README.md From the last one description: "More over this method is very efficient at obtaining sparsity and has proven to perform very well in massive Click-Through-Rate prediction tasks."
