pdflatex and shell script

I need to watch for a specific directory changes in osx, in order to see if a file was uploaded, when the file is inside the dir i want to run a very basic script(simply 'compile' .tex files using pdflatex), what I've done so far : 1)launchd to monitor my dir, this is my test.plist file Label DirMonitor ProgramArguments /Users/Caffeina/Desktop/test.sh path modified QueueDirectories /Users/Caffeina/Desktop/test_dir/ 2) test.sh : #!/bin/sh /usr/texbin/pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode /Users/Caffeina/Desktop/test_dir/test.tex 3) starting the monitor : launchctl load /Users/Caffeina/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist 4) to test if all is working properly I move a file inside the monitored dir.... but nothing happen. Looking into the console output i can red this error : logger[4155] This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (TeX Live 2010) logger[4155] restricted \write18 enabled. logger[4155] entering extended mode logger[4155] ! I can't write on file `test.log'. logger[4155] (Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit; default file extension is `.log') logger[4155] Please type another transcript file name logger[4155] ! Emergency stop logger[4155] ! ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced! com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[127] (logger[4155]) Exited with exit code: 1 I don't understand why this error, any idea?
