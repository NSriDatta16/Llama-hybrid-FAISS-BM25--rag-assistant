there is a logarithmic weighted average that you could do. the advantage of this is that you only ever need to store the "current value" and the weighted average. In your case the "current value" could be number of votes that day, and you could recalculate the weighted average each night. const float WeightFactor = 0.70; //for example float PreviousAverage = GetPreviousAverage(); float CurrentValue = GetVoteCountToday(); float NewAverage = (WeightFactor * CurrentValue) + ( (1-WeightFactor) * PreviousAverage); This only really works if you have a new value that occurs at a set frequency. If you want to recalculate your vote at arbritary times then this wouldn't work.
