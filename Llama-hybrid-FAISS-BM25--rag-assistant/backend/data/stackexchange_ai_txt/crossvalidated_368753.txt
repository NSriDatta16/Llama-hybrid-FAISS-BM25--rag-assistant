There is a vast literature associated to MCMC. So the good news is that there probably exists a technique which would be of help to you. The bad news is that we would need to know more about the model you are trying to fit. For example, it might make sense to block the $\theta$ in various ways, do Gibbs sampling, various HMC or other gradient based techniques etc etc. From the description already there, have you tried initialising the chain using the parameters from a regular multinomial logit fit? Also note that random walk metropolis also does often have very low acceptance ratios.
