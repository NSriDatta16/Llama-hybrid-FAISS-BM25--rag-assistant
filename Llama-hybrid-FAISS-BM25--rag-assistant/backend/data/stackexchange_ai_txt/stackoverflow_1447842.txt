What happens if the meta tags are present in the document body?

I am working on a ASP application and the code, template and files are organized in a way that does not allow me to alter anything outside the body tag. So I am thinking about inserting the meta tags inside the body -- like this: Default Title "> I am wondering how good it is to put meta tags inside the body of an HTML document. How does it affect: search engines browsers
