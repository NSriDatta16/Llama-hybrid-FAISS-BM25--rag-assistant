Your problem is a lack of information. An explanation follows, but your options are to Collect more data Use a bayesian method where you provide information about the variable's beta via a prior Use a penalized objective function, like those provided in the glmnet package Explanation Without typing in the data manually, what I believe is happening is that you have a dichotomous predictor where the sample proportion is 1.0 within one of its levels. Note that when the true proportion is exactly 1, the linear link function $\log p / (1 - p)$ must be infinity. In reality however, when the likelihood is being maximized on your computer, that variable's value of beta just keeps getting larger as the optimization routine continues, until it terminates due to some stopping condition. It's not infinity, but it's pretty close ;) Edit: From comments below, I learned that the situation was not the dichotomous predictor situation described above. So I took a closer look at the data and noticed what I believe is the culprit: whenever ZRE_1 is positive, MOCHA2DICH is 1, and whenever ZRE_1 is negative, MOCHADICH is 0 . The same basic reasoning from my earlier explanation would apply to the coefficient of ZRE_1, if MOCA2DICH is indeed the response.
