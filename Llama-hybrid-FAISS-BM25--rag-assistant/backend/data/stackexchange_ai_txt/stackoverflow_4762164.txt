Unexplained Java shenanigans - possibly to do with threading?

The Problem I am currently halfway through building a Game of Life simulator in Java (in Eclipse), using the Swing GUI, as part of a project for college. This is going along marvellously, apart from one small flaw - It works on my netbook, but not on any other PC I've tried. This is under Ubuntu. Some structural outline - I have a Model, a View and a Controller. I haven't defined the Model properly yet, but I've done the View (the GUI part) and started the Controller. The Controller is run by the Main method, and the Controller then creates the View class in a separate thread and enters a while loop. The View implements a queue of 'orders' that it has received from user input, mouse-clicks and what not. The Controller picks these orders out of the queue on an iteration of the while loop, and executes them as necessary. However, while the code works fine on my netbook (latest version, Java 1.6.0_20), it does not work on my PC (latest version again, Java 1.6.0_20) or on the college PCs (karmic, some previous version of Java). It simply stops once it hits the 'getNextCommand' method. No errors, it just refuses to print/comply The source files are located here - http://www.mediafire.com/?dfwtdkj1tdxd5xl The files of interest are Controller and View. Example In View, I have this function: public Command getNextCommand() { System.out.println(commands.getFirst().id); return commands.pop(); } Pretty self-explanatory, when Controller calls for getNextCommand(), it prints what command that was. Here is the while loop in Controller: while(!stop) { if (gui.hasCommand()){ order = gui.getNextCommand(); //System.out.println("Something"); //if(order.id.equals("stop")) { stop = true; } } } This works fine. It prints in getNextCommand as you'd expect. Uncomment either of the two statements though, and it suddenly stops working. No more printing for you! Why would this happen? Why would this work on my netbook, but not my PC? :C Further notes In addition, if I run the .class files that Eclipse makes, it prints (assuming those two lines are commented out). If I just compile them myself using javac, nothing prints. Any insight would be appreciated! Thanks, Luke. Edit The same problem occurs if instead of returning a Command (a simple container class with an id (String), x,y (int) and value (int)) when I call getNextCommand I return an Integer. Or anything else.
