Version Control for Homework Assignments

School is back in session and I've found myself at a loss. At the end of last semester, we had a group project utilizing subversion (group of 4 people) to make commits and get it complete. I also noticed how easy it was to have access to a central point for my homework. I want to utilize SVN or Git (recently introduced to git) and I have a problem. What is the best way to organize SVN for multiple homework assignments for multiple computer classes. I've got 2 programming classes that I definitely want to track. With at minimum of 1 assignment a week that's 32 assignments to manage over 2 classes. Should I keep them all in one repository and just label 1 Java and 1 C++? Thanks in advance. Edit: I should mention I have yearly hosting that allows both git and subversion through WebDAV. That's how I accessed the svn repo for my project last year. I have the ability to lock my homework up away from public view through this tool, for those not familiar with that setup.
