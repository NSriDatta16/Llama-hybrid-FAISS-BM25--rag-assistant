Hosted server, changing IP and JNLP

I have the following scenario for a customer of mine: He has a hosted server (1) (i.e. http://customer.net ) which basically redirects to an address in this format: http:///app (server 2) The IP address changes frequently (they told me even each two weeks). There's an application in server 2 with a jnlp link which obviously is configured to download from server 2 IP. When the IP of server 2 changes the jnlp will be broken. For me the obvious option is to obtain a dedicated IP address with the provider, but wanted to know if there are any other options. Thanks in advance!
