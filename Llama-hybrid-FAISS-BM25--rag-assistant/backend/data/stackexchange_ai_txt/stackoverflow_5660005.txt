It's quite simple to achieve this task using Visual Studio. (Instructions are for Visual Studio 2005) Open a toolbox (View -> ToolBox) Right-click on the toolbox -> Choose Items Choose "COM Components" tab. Select COM components of your interest. References are added to the project automatically as well. Now you can simply drag'n'drop your COM components since CCW (COM Callable Wrapper) should be created automatically by Visual Studio.
