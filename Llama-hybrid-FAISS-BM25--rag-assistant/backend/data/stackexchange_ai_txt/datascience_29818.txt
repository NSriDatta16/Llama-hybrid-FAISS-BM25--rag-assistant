Stacking/Concatenating/Combining two vector space models

I have two vector-space models, with different dimensions. The number of vectors in one model is the same as the number of vectors in the other. I.E: if I have vector representation for a car in one model, I have vector representation for a car in the other model, but the number of dimensions can be different. I want to combine these models (and then cluster using the combined model), I cannot average (BoW) or add these models together as stated earlier they have different dimensions. I was going to simply concatenate the vectors. Is this valid or is there better way to do this? Also before you concatenate should you normalize?
