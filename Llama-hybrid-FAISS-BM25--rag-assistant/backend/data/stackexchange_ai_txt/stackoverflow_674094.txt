At 15-16MB you may be above average but you certainly won't be in "extreme" territory for size. Apple's got special instructions on uploading apps that are >200MB, so they're prepared to deal with bundles that are much, much larger than you're contemplating. I've got one app on my phone that weighs in at 283MB. Whether to include the videos or provide for later downloading should really depend on whether you expect new videos to be available to users without downloading a new version of the app. Having said that, if the videos can possibly be reencoded for a smaller size without significantly compromising their appearance on the iPhone's screen, it would be a really good idea to do so.
