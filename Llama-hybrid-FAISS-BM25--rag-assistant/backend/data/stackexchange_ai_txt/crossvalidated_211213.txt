Fitting an SARIMA model of time series regressed on another

I'm fitting a $$ARIMA(p,d,q)\times (P,D,Q)_{12}$$ model. The first loop fits p and q. The second loop fits P and Q. Here, d and D are both assumed to be 0 since I'm looking at the interaction between two cycles. >= aic_table >= aic_table2 The thing is when I try this, I can get ACF values under the ARIMA just fine. It's when I run the second loop that I get issues. Is there a workaround for this? Is it because I'm using the cyclic decompositions of each time series? I want to understand how my cars time series relates to the steel time series. Error in optim(init[mask], armafn, method = optim.method, hessian = TRUE, : non-finite finite-difference value [1]
