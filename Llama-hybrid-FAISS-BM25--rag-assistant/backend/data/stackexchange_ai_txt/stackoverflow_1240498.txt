Does internal types compromise good API design?

It seems to me that anytime I come across internal calls or types, it's like I hit a road block. Even if they are accessible in code like open-source, it still feels they are not usable parts of the API code itself. i.e. it's as if they are discouraged to be modified. Should one keep oneself from using the internal keyword unless it's absolutely necessary? I am asking this for an open-source API. But still not everyone will want to change the API, but mostly use it to write their own code for the app itself.
