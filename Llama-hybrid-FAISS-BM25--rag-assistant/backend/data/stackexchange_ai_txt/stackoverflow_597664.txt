When should weak types be discouraged?

When should weak types be discouraged? Are weak types discouraged in big projects? If the left side is strongly typed like the following would that be an exception to the rule? int i = 5 string sz = i sz = sz + "1" i = sz Does any languages support similar syntax to the above? Tell me more about pros and cons to weak types and situations related.
