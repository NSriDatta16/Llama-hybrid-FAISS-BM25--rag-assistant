I use const extensively to communicate design intent. If I intended that a method was a pure query, and not a modification function, I would both enforce that and communicate it with a 'const' in the signature. I encourage you to look at Meyer's thoughts on the matter of side-effect-free functions, and the implications that has on enabling testing.
