Significance test testing whether one variance is larger than the other

I feel like I am missing a key link and this tasks is quite easy: I am given the following averages and standard deviations: $\bar{x}_1 = 971$ , $s_1 = 42$ , $n_1 = 1000$ $\bar{x}_2 = 983.9$ , $s_2 = 60.18$ , $n_2 = 10$ For the second dataset, I have all observations. What is an appropriate test to check whether $\sigma_1$ is larger than $\sigma_2$ ? Of course I stumbled upon the F-Test, but as far as I understood it, it can only handle testing whether variances are equal or not; not whether one is larger than the other. A friend of mine used Chi-Square, but I do not see how Chi-Square would be applicable here. Thank you and best Paul
