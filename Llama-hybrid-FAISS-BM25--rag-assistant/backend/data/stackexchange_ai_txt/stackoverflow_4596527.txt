Can you explain this odd behavior with dragging items into nested sortables?

I have the following setup: A sortable list where one of the has a table with lists in each cell. All of the lists are sortable with each other. Draggable items that can be added to any of the sortables Issue: When adding a draggable item ('drag 1', 'drag 2', 'drag 3') to one of the lists in the horizontal lists (table of lists) it duplicates the draggable when dropped. Sometimes it will create both copies in the same list or one in the item list and one in the column list. Here is a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/MQTgA/ Question: How do I prevent the second item being created when dropping the draggable? UPDATE : With changing the class names of the horizontal lists to something else ('hlist') and omitting the new class name from the 'connectToSortable' option ('ul.hlist'), it no longer drops two copies and still allows the item to be dropped in any list. This doesn't seem right. Also when trying to drop an item into the horizontal list instead of the main list it seems very touchy as well (won't make for a good user experience). Thoughts?
