How to get a single paragraph text from a richtextbox when double clicking on it

I'm having some trouble getting control of the WPF richtextbox control. What I want to is as follows : I have a RichTextBox control called richTextBox1 that I filled up with data from a database. I need to get the text on a single line (meaning - a single paragraph) when I click the control. All I found over the net is a code to copy ALL the RTB text. Any ideas how to get just the text in the line that was clicked ?
