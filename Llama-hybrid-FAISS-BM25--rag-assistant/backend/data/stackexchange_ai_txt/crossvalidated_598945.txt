Does it make sense to convert a single dummy variable into a factor?

I have an R lecture script infront of me, where we are using logistic regression to try to predict the probability that an observation belongs to the target class (e.g. y_i = 1) or not (e.g. y_i = 0). Hence Y is given as a vector of 0's and 1's. Before running the regression our Prof. turns Y into a factor, but I don't really understand why. Does this have any influence on the accuracy of the prediction? Do all dummy variables have to be turned into factors before they can be used in a ML model?
