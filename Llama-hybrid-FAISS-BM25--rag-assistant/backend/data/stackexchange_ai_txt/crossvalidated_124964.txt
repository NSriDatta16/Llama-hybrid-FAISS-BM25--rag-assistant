Without context it is a bit hard to say what is meant by the phase. However, I will take a guess. For the sake of the argument, let's use a linear SVM in a two dimensional case as shown in this example on Wikipedia : While planes H1 and H2 separate the training data correctly, H2 is chosen by the SVM because it has higher margin. The greater the size of this "buffer zone" the lower the risk of a wrong classification for an unseen sample. Hence, one might say that a SVM does SRM by choosing the separator with the greatest margin.
