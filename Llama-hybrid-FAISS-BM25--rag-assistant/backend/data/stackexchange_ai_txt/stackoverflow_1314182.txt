Not much experience with Windows 7 but I can tell you that it took some time to get the installation procedures for Windows XP and the associated development tools documented on our team. Our basic approach was to install Windows and all Windows components (like IIS) first. Then we installed the development tools in order of their release (i.e. Visual Studio 2003 before Visual Studio 2005/2008). My biggest suggestion would be to document the installation and be prepared to start from scratch a few times until you get it right. You'll know if you got it wrong by the presence of error messages and such. Another suggestion would be to eliminate tools that you don't need. Our installation would be much cleaner if we could kill off old tools (or host VMs - our organization won't allow us to do that). In fact, you could have a clean workstation hosting VMs for the various development efforts you will undertake (one VM for SharePoint, one VM for Web, etc.). Then the developers could restore VMs easily without following installation procedures.
