Question for the derivation of the probability of a trajectory

I'm studying reinforcement learning now and I'm quite a newbie to this field. I have some questions about how to derive the equation as below. $p_{\theta}(s_{1},a_{1},\dots,s_T,a_T)=p(s_1)\prod_{t=1}^T(\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t))$ The equation above is the probability of a trajectory. But in my opinion, the equation should be, $p_{\theta}(s_{1},a_{1},\dots,s_T,a_T)=p(s_1)\prod_{t=1}^T\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\prod_{t=1}^{T-1}p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ I don't know why $p(s_{T+1}|s_T,a_T)$ emerges in the original equation because there is no $s_{T+1},a_{T+1}$ in the trajectory. I think I'm missing something. Can somebody help me?
