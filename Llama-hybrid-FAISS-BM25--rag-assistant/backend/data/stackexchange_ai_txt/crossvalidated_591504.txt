M ultiple i mputation using c hained e quations (MICE) is an approach to imputing missing data which accommodates data missing in multiple variables. The basic approach is: Start with probabilistic initial values for the all variables with missing data you wish to impute. Model the first variable you wish to impute missing values for as a function of other variables in your data set, and estimate missing. This typically looks like a regression model appropriate to the data type of the target variable (e.g., multiple logistic regression, multiple ordered logit regression, etc.). Note: These models can be sophisticated—using constraints, specifying deterministic relationships, using different estimators, etc. Proceed to the next variable with missing values, and create a model for it based on some set of variables in your data set (possibly including the 1st imputed variable—and using that first variable's newly imputed values). Do this for all variables you wish to impute. Repeat steps 1–4 but now using the newly imputed values where those variables appear on the right hand side of the imputation models in 1–4. Do this many times, until the imputation algorithm is satisfied by some measure of convergence. You now have a single imputed data set. Repeat steps 1–5 until you have some target number of imputed data sets (per Rubin and Schafer this is on the order of 5 to 10). Atem, et al. are concerned with imputing observations for a Cox proportional hazards model and data set, where some data are incomplete (i.e. have some form of censoring). They describe a case where the censoring process producing data missingness is not completely at random, and has a particular kind of dependency structure. From Bartlett's 2015 article "Two conditional models are said to be incompatible if there exists no joint model for which the conditionals (for the relevant variables) equal these conditional models." To me this suggests that, for example, the baseline hazard function in the Cox proportional hazards model assumes a particular kind of dependency structure for right censoring (proportionality, survival until time $t$ , etc.). One could imagine that the models highlighted in my outline of MICE above could build in dissimilar assumptions to the Cox model resulting in the kind of incompatibility Bartlett, and Atem &Co. warn about. For example, one might model a covariate with respect to a different hazard function (including no hazard function). References Atem, F. D., Matsouaka, R. A., & Zimmern, V. E. (2019).
