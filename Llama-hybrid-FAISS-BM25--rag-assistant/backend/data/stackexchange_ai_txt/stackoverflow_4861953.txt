Apache userdir + suEXEC + fcgid doesn't recognise dot separated useraccounts

I've setup Apache with suEXEC, fcgid and userdir to enhance overall website security. Everything works expect for useraccounts with a "." between their accountnames. Before using suEXEC and fcgid, this used to work although that practice has been discouraged many years ago. For example: mydomain.com/~mytest/ works mydomain.com/~my.test/ doesn't work The error message that I get is "Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand." Is there a quick workaround to this or I'm I doomed at recreating all the accounts without any accountname separation?
