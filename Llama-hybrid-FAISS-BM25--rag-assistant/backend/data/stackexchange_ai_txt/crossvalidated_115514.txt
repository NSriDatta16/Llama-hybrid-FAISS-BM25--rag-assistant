Metrics to compare time series results with no defined truth standard

I have several (~10) models which all predict time series results for a specific problem (hourly heat loss from a building over a year). I do not have any measured data or truth standard results to compare the absolute accuracy of each model's prediction. I am looking for a way to quantitatively compare each time series to the others to give some indication of agreement among the models, or to identify outlying results. Do such metrics exist? If so, what metrics would be useful for me? Here is a quick sketch of what the results might look like (each color represents the results from a different model):
