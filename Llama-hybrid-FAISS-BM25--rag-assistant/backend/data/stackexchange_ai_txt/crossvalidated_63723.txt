Constructing a tridiagonal Markov Chain given a desired distribution

Given a desired distribution over a set of finite states, I wish to construct a tridiagonal Markov chain that would have a stationary distribution same as the desired distribution. The reason I want to do this is as follows. I have a linear sequence of blocks that an agent can traverse. Each time, the agent can choose to stay at the current block, move forward one block, or move backward one block. However, I also have a target distribution such that over time, I want the frequency that each block gets visited to be similar to the target distribution. I personally don't know any existing methods/tools that could easily solve this due to my limited knowledge in statistics. I'd appreciate it if anyone can provide some advice on how I might be able to approach this problem.
