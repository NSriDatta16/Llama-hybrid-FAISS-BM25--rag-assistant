Distance covariance (or distance correlation) is a correlational metric. Basically, it takes as input two distance matrices and outputs a scalar (the distance covariance). If the distance covariance is much greater than 0 (test significance with many random permutations), then there is a relationship between the two random vectors. So note that distance covariance does not give a kernel or similarity matrix that methods such as MDS or Laplacian Eigenmap use to perform dimensionality reduction. However, it has been used for linear dimensionality reductions that identify linear and nonlinear relationships between sets of variables (see http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/cowley17a/cowley17a.pdf and https://stat.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/Wenhui%20Sheng_IWSM%202013.pdf ).
