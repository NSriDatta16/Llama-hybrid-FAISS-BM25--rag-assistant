Each word in a given sentence is converted into an index on an array that contains a dictionary of all words in your corpus. This is your variable length x vector and is separate from the word2vec embeddings. This index is also used to lookup the associated fixed length word2vec vectors in a lookup table during training and prediction. This RNN deeplearning tutorial explains it better with code samples. In torch this word index lookup is handled by the Lookup table layer.
