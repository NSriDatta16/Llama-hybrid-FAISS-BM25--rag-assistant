How to find set of directions in Stahel-Donoho outlyingness measure?

Currently I’m trying to understand and use the Stahel-Donoho outlyngness measure. But unfortunately I’ve got a problem in the part where one is taking the maximum over the set of directions. I found papers and tutorials about the Stahel-Donoho estimator, but their explanation is not good enough for me. In one paper, it has been suggested that one way to find this set of directions is by taking $p$ directions through 2 randomly chosen observations. In another paper [0], the authors use many directions through 2 randomly chosen observations. The original definition itself uses as direction $d$ the direction orthogonal to the hyperplane through $p$ randomly chosen data points. Then, the full set of directions is obtained by repeating this procedure for many random $p$ subsets (see page 3, 2nd paragraph from the bottom of this paper ). Unfortunately I cannot get any idea how to deal with this problem. Should I use random projection? The problem I'm having is that I don’t know how to obtain the directions $d$ and projections. I really stuck at the moment. Could someone kindly help me to understand or provide me a good reference for better understanding? [0] Hubert, M., Rousseeuw P. J. and Vanden Branden, K. (2005).
