Core graphics and UIKit interaction

Hey all, I'm am trying to make a very interactive UI with lots of animations and effects. But I don't know if: Core graphics can support user interaction (touches, drags, etc) Core graphics supports object rotation Core graphics can interact with UIKit and Core Animation in any way Thanks!
