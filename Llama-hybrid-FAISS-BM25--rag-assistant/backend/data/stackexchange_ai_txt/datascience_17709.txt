Best way to fix the size of a sentence [Sentiment Analysis]

I am working on a project that is about Natural Language Processing. However I am stuck at the point which is I have a ANN that has fixed size of input neurons. I am trying to do sentiment analysis with using Imdb movie review set. To able to do that, firstly, I calculated the word embeddings for each word with creating a word-context matrix then applied SVD. So I have the word embedding matrix. But I do not know the best way to compress sentence's vector (which contains embeddings for each word in the sentence) into a fixed size to be able to feed the neural net. I tried PCA but result was not satisfying. Any help?
