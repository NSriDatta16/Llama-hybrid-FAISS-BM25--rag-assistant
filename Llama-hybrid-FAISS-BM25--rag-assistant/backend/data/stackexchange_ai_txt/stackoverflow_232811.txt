Boundary for comment box

In my java application, I need to create a comment box for the users to add comments. Moreover, I need to provide the user with the provision for resizing and dragging the comment box. For this, I need to show a boundary around the comment box as in the case of comment box in Microsoft Excel which I have shown below: I dont need the circles shown on the boundary for resizing because I will be using a triangle kind of a thing on the bottom-right of the box. But I need the dotted area. How do I create it for my application in java? Any good thoughts? Currently I am in an analysis phase, just to find good options for this. What we have thought till now is to draw few dotted lines around the box to give the impression.
