Three words: search engine spiders. Or Browser plugins that prefetch links to speed up browsing. All kinds of software implicitly assumes that a GET request can be made freely without negative effects. It's not just REST, the HTTP standard itself ( RFC 2616 ) says so: In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
