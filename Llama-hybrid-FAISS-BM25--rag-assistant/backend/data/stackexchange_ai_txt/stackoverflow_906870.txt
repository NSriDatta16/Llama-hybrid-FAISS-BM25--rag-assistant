Sure you can. If you compose your SQL SELECT statement in the code, then you just have to generate: in case nothing or all is selected (check it using your language), you just issue non-filter version: SELECT ... FROM ... in case some checkboxes are checked, you create add a WHERE clause to it: SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE MyTypeID IN (3, 5, 7) This is single SQL command, but it is different depending on the selection, of course. Now, if you would like to use one stored procedure to do the job, then the implementation would depend on the database engine since what you need is to be able to pass multiple parameters. I would discourage using a procedure with just plain 3 parameters, because when you add another check-box, you will have to change the SQL procedure as well.
