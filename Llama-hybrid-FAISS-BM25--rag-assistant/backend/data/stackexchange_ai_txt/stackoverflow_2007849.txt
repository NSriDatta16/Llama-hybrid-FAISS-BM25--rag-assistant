Open-source inventory agent

Can anyone recommend a good open-source inventory-agent, which would help enumerate both the running software and the installed hardware? I'm actually looking to couple SIGAR (or alternatives) with such agent, to integrate the servers statistics into a single view. Thanks in advance.
