iPhone / .NET WCF Interoperability

I'm architecting a .NET "web service" and an iPhone application that will consume these services. I'm curious if there are any best practices for architecting the protocol for exchanging data between the two. SOAP-based web services feel too heavy to me for an iPhone app. Perhaps REST, JSON, POX instead? Certainly the specifics of the application dictate the protocol to some degree, but I'm curious what others have done. Ideally, I'd like to leverage WCF if possible (again, perhaps its REST, JSON, or POX support) so that I can keep my options open for creating other bindings for other client applications in the future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
