Platform-independent detection of arrow key press in C++

In a C++ console program, I've found how to detect and arrow key on Windows, and I've found a lot of other stuff that had nothing to do with the question (despite what I thought were good search terms), but I want to know if there is a platform-independent way to detect an arrow key press. A decent second place for this would be how to detect arrow key press in unix and mac. Code fragments would be appreciated.
