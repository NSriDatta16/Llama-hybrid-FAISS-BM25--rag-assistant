Flash Builder folder structure + .fla workflow

I built 3 variations of a game for different platforms (i.e. Facebook, mobile etc.) in Flash CS4. I now have the following structure (5 folders): Facebook Mobile Website Shared_classes Shared_assets In each of the top three folders there is a .fla file. Every .fla uses assets and classes from the "shared folders" but also platform-unique code. I would now like to migrate this project to Flash Builder but 1) what is the best approach to stay organized? 2) what is the best .fla file workflow?
