Data Pagination: SQL Server 2005 + SL3

Hey everybody, got an interesting question I think. I've got a Silverlight3 application which is querying a SQL Server 2005 database asynchronously. However, some of the data sets the queries return are massive and so I'm looking into data pagination. Goals: 1) Just in time data calls - I only want to query for page 3's data when the user clicks to go to page 3. 2) I want a slider to control which page I'm on - SliderControl is SL3 with its movement binded to a stored procedure call (is my initial guess as to an approach). 3) Read ahead data as a label for the slider. So the slider will say "Page 1 of 50" or perhaps "Gant - Hart". Some sort of indication as to where you are in the data without actually querying for all the data until the user drops the slider into position. I'm almost positive that I need to do some sort of a query to get the total number of rows and some sort of bookmark data that the query will eventually return. Otherwise I don't know how to split up the slider nor would I be able to do page labels (The gant to hart stuff). Anyone have experience with this kind of thing? Thanks.
