How to verify if object variable is set

I have a User class which is created when a user logs in $user = new User($userId); Now to check if a user is logged in, I tried doing if (isset($user)) { // user is logged in } else { // user is not logged in } However, isset() doesn't appear to work for objects? And I've also tried is_object() . Please advise! Hopefully there is a way to do this elegantly, perhaps if ($user->isLoggedIn()) { } Thanks for your time!
