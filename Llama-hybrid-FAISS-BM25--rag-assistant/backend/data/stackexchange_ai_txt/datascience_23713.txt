Forecasting one time series with missing data with help of other time series

I have time series $R$, which shows, how something changes at the regional level. I have several time series $U_i$, which show, how something changes at a special unit $I$ level. There are many units in the region. $R$ has no missing data. Different $U_i$ have their own missing periods. I want to forecast $U$ after a missing period using information of $R$ and information of $U$ when it was availible. My thoghts till now : Suppose $R$ is known on interval $[0, 365]$. Suppose $U_i$ is known on interval $[0,300]$. Let's take $R$ and $U_i$ both on interval $[0,300]$, take difference between them and trying to predict that difference with linear regression. So for interval $[301,365]$, I will have differences and to restore $U_i$, I will just have to take out my differences from $R$. I don't like my solution , because: We need a model for each $U_i$. Because, sometimes data is more sparse and I don't even have a $[0,300]$ known interval, so not able to train regression properly.
