If you mean multiple databases all being updated within one transaction then you would do this for Atomicity - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems) Hypothetically consider a bank transfer, with a different database for each account provider - the money has to leave one account and be updated to the other. If it fails part way through - e.g. the 2nd database update fails, then the money has left one account but not arrived in the other, which is not acceptable. The transaction means that a failure on one of the updates means that they are all cancelled (rolled back), to leave the data in the state that it was before the transaction began.
