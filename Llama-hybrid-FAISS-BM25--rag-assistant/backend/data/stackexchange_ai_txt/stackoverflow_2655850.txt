a loading screen for a c# wpf listbox

I'm using a list box where there are on average about 500 thumbnails (items) that can be sorted and searched. Since I'm using default databinding and search descriptors (which I've heard are slow due to reflection) the list takes a noticeable pause of a few seconds loading, sorting, and searching (the list dynamically updates based on the contents of the search box so the first one or two letters typed are really slow). I don't think I can fully do away with reflection give the timeframe for the project, and speed isn't super essential, but I'd like some kind of graphical indication of the delay so it doesn't confuse the user. How could I do something like a website video loading screen where the listbox grays out and some kind of loading circle indicates it's processing until the list is ready? Or even just grayed out with the words "Loading..." for a few seconds could work. Any ideas? Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions!!!
