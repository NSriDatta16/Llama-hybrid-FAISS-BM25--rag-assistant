Definitely not. Initially, there are not enough documents to run the topic model. This means that the number of documents you have does not provide enough information to generate a meaningful topic model. Duplicating documents to make the list of documents longer doesn't add any information, so does not solve the problem. In real life, a library with 10 copies of the same 5 books doesn't contain any more information than a library with 1 copy each. The more interesting question is - why are you trying to run a topic model at all? If you only have a small number of documents, does it make more sense to just generate summaries of each (e.g. with GPT), rather than trying to force them into clusters?
