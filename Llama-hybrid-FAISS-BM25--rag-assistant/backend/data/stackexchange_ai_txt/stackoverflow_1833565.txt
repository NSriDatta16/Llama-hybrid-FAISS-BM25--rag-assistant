The GPL (and similar licenses) work via copyright. In the US, as well as any country that's a signatory to the Bern convention, works are copyright to the creator by default, and cannot be distributed without their permission. The GPL grants such permissionâ€”with some additional restrictions to boot. Since you would normally not have permission to distribute the software at all, the restrictions in the GPL that you have to endure in exchange for redistribution can be automatically activated merely by redistributing the software. Thus, your question shouldn't be how a program can be GPL'd and be copyrighted; rather, it'd be how the GPL leverages copyright to work.
