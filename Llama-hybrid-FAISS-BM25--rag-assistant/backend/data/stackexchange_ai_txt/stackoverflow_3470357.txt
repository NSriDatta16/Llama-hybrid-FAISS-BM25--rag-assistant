Here is how you can get the image part: $str = '/home/adam/Projects/red/storag/22ff0bc0662bd323891844f6ed342cce2603490ec0_tumb_2.jpg'; $exploded = end(explode('/', $str)); echo $exploded; Result: 22ff0bc0662bd323891844f6ed342cce2603490ec0_tumb_2.jpg Now you can concatenate it with whatever eg: $new_str = 'http://localhost/storage/' . $exploded; echo $new_str; Result: http://localhost/storage/22ff0bc0662bd323891844f6ed342cce2603490ec0_tumb_2.jpg And It is most likely you want to concatenate the image path with your document root which you do like this: $img_path = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $exploded; The idea is that you explode the string with explode function by specifying / as delimiter. This gives you array, now you use the end function to get the ending part of the array which is your image actually.
