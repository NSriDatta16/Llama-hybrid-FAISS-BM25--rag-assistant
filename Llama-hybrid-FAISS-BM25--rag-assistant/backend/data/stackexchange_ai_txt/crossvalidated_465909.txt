Are a model's predictions (such as for stock prices) always correct at a global minimum?

Say you have a model, for example, a neural network with the aim to predict future stock prices in a time series. Theoretically, if the parameters are chosen such that the global optimum is found, (not a "good enough" local optimum, but the global optimum), will the model get the stock prices correct, 100% of the time, with absolute precision?
