If your variables are ordinal, then you can leave them by using labelencoding. However, since KNN works with distance metric, either you need to change your distance metric accordingly or use one hot encoding as you are using but as you said, it will create a huge sparse matrix. I will suggest using a tree based algo such as random forest that need not requires one hot encoding
