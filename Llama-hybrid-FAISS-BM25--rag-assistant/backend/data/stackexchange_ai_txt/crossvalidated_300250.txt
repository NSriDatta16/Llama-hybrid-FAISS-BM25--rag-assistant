The function RFcluster() from the gamclass package for R "adapts random forests to work (albeit clumsily and inefficiently) with clustered categorical outcome data". The following example is from the help page for RFcluster : library(randomForest) library(gamclass) data(mlbench::Vowel) RFcluster(formula=Class ~., id = V1, data = Vowel, nfold = 15, tree=500, progress=TRUE, printit = TRUE, seed = 29) This returns an OOB accuracy (where the "bags" are bags of speakers, not bags of individual speaker samples), that my machine gives as 0.57 .
