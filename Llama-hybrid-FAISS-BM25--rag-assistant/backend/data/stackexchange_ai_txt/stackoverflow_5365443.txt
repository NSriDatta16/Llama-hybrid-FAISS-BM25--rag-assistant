To answer your question: Yes, scripts loaded with document.write are guaranteed to execute in the order written. Same applies to scripts loaded using the W3C DOM methods. var scriptElm = document.createElement('script'); scriptElm.defer = true; // Causes faster (parallel) loading in some browsers. scriptElm.src = 'path/to/script.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild( scriptElm ); That said, document.write() is generally considered really bad practice (for a variety of reasons) and can lead to breakage and annoying edge-case problems later on. I, therefore, recommend that you use the W3C DOM injection shown above, if nothing else. - - - - Then there are script loading libraries that make this sort of resource loading easier, more elegant, and sometimes even faster. Some load scripts in parallel but execute in a predictable order - like the one already linked to by @CoBaLt2760 http://www.dustindiaz.com/scriptjs jQuery also has a very simple method $.getScript( 'path/to/script.js' ); ( documentation ) that you can use. If memory serves me right, It uses simple W3C DOM injection. Google "javascript loading" or some such, or search here on StackOverflow,com if you're interested in more links to such libraries.
