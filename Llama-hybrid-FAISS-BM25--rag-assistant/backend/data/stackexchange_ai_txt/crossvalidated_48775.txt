That's right. The diagonal of $\Sigma$ contains the square roots of the eigenvalues of $XX'$. That's true for the original matrix $X$, and for the matrix obtained by scaling the data by column means and standard deviations (which gives you PCA on the correlation matrix). I'm not sure I understand the last paragraph of your question. The eigenvalues are not the sum of squares of X.
