Would the support vectors in SVM algorithm change with scaling of the functional margin?

Would the Support Vectors in the SVM algorithm change every time that I change the functional margin ? The optimization objective in the SVM algorithm is this - The rest of the SVM optimization algorithm is then derived by setting i.e. Gamma (hat) to 1. Does the Support Vectors derived depend on Gamma, w or b in any manner ?
