total is a variable with automatic storage duration. Every time myFunction() is called, a new total is created and initialized to 0. You could: give total static storage duration (with the static keyword), but you won't be able to assign its value to anything, because it is still local scope. A bad idea if you want to reuse this function, anyhow. make total a global variable. Also a bad idea if you want to reuse this function make a "functor", as described in Martin York's answer. This is the most reusable implementation But, my chosen solution is "you're asking the wrong question" and you should be using std::accumulate() : #include #include int main() { int array[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }; int total = std::accumulate(array, array+10, 0); std::cout
