I actually find CSS search expressions easier to read than either. There probably exists at least one library in the language of your choice that will parse a page and allow you to write CSS directives for locating particular elements. If there's an appropriate class or ID hook nearby then the expression is pretty trivial. Otherwise, grab the elements that seem appropriate and iterate through them to find the ones that you need. As for fragile, well, they're all fragile. Screen-scraping is by definition dependent on the author of that page not changing its layout drastically. Go with a solution that's readable and can be easily changed later.
