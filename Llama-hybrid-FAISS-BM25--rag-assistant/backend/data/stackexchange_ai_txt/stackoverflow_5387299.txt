Python unittest.TestCase execution order

Is there a way in Python unittest to set the order in which test cases are run? In my current TestCase class, some testcases have side effects that set conditions for the others to run properly. Now I realize the proper way to do this is to use setUp() to do all setup related things, but I would like to implement a design where each successive test builds slightly more state that the next can use. I find this much more elegant. class MyTest(TestCase): def test_setup(self): # Do something def test_thing(self): # Do something that depends on test_setup() Ideally, I would like the tests to be run in the order they appear in the class. It appears that they run in alphabetical order.
