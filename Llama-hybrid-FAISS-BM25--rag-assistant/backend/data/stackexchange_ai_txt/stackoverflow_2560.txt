Flash is certainly the most ubiquitous and portable solution. 98% of browsers have Flash installed. Other alternatives are Quicktime , Windows Media Player , or even Silverlight (Microsoft's Flash competitor, which can be used to embed several video formats). I would recommend using Flash (and it's FLV video file format) for embedding your video unless you have very specific requirements as far as video quality or DRM.
