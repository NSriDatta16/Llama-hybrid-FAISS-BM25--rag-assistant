Make your image view user interaction enabled in the xib (or through the code if you are adding it programmatically) and use the UIResponder methods touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded etc to detect the touch on the image view: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == yourImageView) { //add your code for image touch here } }
