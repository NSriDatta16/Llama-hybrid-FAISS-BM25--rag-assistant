I experienced the same problem when opening a project I had previously checked out using another SVN client (Versions). So I fired up Wireshark to look at the SVN traffic and saw that it was an HTTP authentication problem. I opened up the Xcode Organizer window (Shift-âŒ˜-2) and deleted the autogenerated repository bookmarks. Then I added my own fresh bookmark. That fixed it. You could also try deleting the repository bookmark in the organizer and just reopen the project. That seemed to work for another of my projects. It asked me for my password and everything started working. And don't forget to tell the organizer the paths to trunk, branches and tags. It can't guess those from a local checkout, and setting them up will enable you to do branching, merging and tagging from within Xcode 4. It is probably worth noting that Xcode 4 crashed on me about 5 times during this process. I think it is still early days for the new and improved SCM integration. So good luck!
