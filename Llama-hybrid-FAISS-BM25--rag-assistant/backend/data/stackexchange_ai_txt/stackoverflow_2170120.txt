Operating on multiple lists?

On page 224 of Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation this example is given with the output. > (mapcar #'(lambda (x y) (list x 'gets y)) '(fred wilma george diane) '(job1 job2 job3 job4)) ((FRED GETS JOB1) (WILMA GETS JOB2) (GEORGE GETS JOB3) (DIANE GETS JOB4)) Is there a way to do the same thing in Emacs Lisp? The other example is also interesting because only 3 results, the number of elements in the shortest list, are produced. > (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3) '(10 20 30 40 50)) (11 22 33)
