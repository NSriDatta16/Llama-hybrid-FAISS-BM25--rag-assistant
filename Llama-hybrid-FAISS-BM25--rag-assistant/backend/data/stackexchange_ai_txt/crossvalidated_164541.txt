Logistic regression with bootstrap, how to interpret high standard errors and choose coefficient?

I am attempting to do a logistic regression bootstrap with R. The problem is I get high SE's. I'm not sure what to do about this or what it means. Does it mean that bootstrap does not work well for my particular data? Here is my code: get.coeffic = function(data, indices){ data = data[indices,] mylogit = glm(F~B+D, data=data, family="binomial") return(mylogit$coefficients) } Call: boot(data = Pres, statistic = logit.bootstrap, R = 1000) Bootstrap Statistics : original bias std. error t1* -10.8609610 -23.0604501 338.048398 t2* 0.2078474 0.4351766 6.387781 I also want to know that after bootstrapping, how would this help with my final regression model? That is, how do I find what regression coefficient do I use in my final model? > fit summary(fit) Call: glm(formula = F ~ B + D, family = "binomial", data = President) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7699 -0.5073 0.1791 0.8147 1.2836 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
