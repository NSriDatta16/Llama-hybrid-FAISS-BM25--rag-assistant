How to normalize the output of a neural network

We have a VGG16 network trained from scratch with a Sigmoid output function. We have 6 classes and the usual output looks like this: scores': [6.494849458249519e-08, 1.8738395510808914e-06, 3.010111981893715e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8633317947387695] The problem is that the output value is very low in each class, I would like to have a normalized output that sums to 1.0 Thanks
