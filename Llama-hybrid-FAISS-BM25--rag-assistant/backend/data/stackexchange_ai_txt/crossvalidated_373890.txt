Separate Models vs Flags in the same model

I have customer data from 2 brands. The data structure are the same, but I expected the customer behaviour to be different in different brand. So I could train 2 models, 1 for each brand, or I could train one model on both brands, but flag which brand the customers belongs to within the data. So my question is, would training on both brands with flags be too much more work for the Machine Learning (I'm using neural network), and therefore be harder to achieve good accuracy than to have dedicated models for each brand?
