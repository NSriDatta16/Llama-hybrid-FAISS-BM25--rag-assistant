How to setup a good java build environment?

Java/Eclipse. Development works fine. We have either Windows or FreeBSD for build server. To deploy though I would like to do the following (in a very automated way): 1: Pull down everything from source control (perforce) 2: build all source (and all dependency projects) with configurable javac and arguments (we want to see if different compilers will affect performance any) 3: run proguard 4: Package up all resources (.class, "res/" directory, external .jars, etc) into a jar. 5: Create a .jnlp web start 6: Create a native windows installer (any suggestions?) 7) For our android apps 4/5 should be build/sign into deployable android package instead We've tried ant, but seems very clunky and prone to error. Maybe the best way to do this is to just script it all? Seems like there should already be a good way to do this.
