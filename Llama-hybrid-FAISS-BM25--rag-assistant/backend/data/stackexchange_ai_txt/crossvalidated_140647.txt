Fitting a model while adjusting for some variable

I plan to figure out the effect of variable X on variable Y. I have time series data for both X and Y and a simple regression model should do the job. Unfortunately the variable Y is also affected by variable A and B (both are time series). What I want to inquire is how can I find the exact effect of X on Y while adjusting for the effects of A and B. Will a simple regression model Y ~ X + A + B + intercept do the job? For simplicity, let's assume that X and Y have a linear relationship.
