Setting selection to Nothing when programming Excel

When I create a graph after using range.copy and range.paste it leaves the paste range selected, and then when I create a graph a few lines later, it uses the selection as the first series in the plot. I can delete the series, but is there a more elegant way to do this? I tried Set selection = nothing but it won't let me set selection. I also tried selection.clear, but that just cleared the last cells that were selected, and still added an extra series to the plot.
