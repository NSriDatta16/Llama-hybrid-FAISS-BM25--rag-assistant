Don't start with a table, start with a conceptual ER Diagram of your base entities, forums, threads, replies,members, keywords, categories etc. and express the relationships first.Then get into logical design mode and define the tables needed to implement the functionality. As suggested have a peek at the way phpBB tables are organized. I like to do my first diagram on a printing whiteboard or on paper then move to a diagramming tool for logical design. I think there's still some room for a 'better' forum, so good luck.
