What is the scope of the workflow? If it's set to something lower than Organization, she may not be be able to see it due to her business unit. Some other quick things to try that might help move your troubleshooting along: If she creates an On Demand workflow for herself, does the button appear? Can you temporarily raise her privileges just to see if the button appears? You could try enabling tracing on the server. Turn tracing on, have her load the page, and then turn tracing off. It's possible you could find something helpful in the trace output. If you're using the Trace Log Viewer and don't see any errors or warnings, there might still be some helpful information at the Info or Verbose levels. Since elevating her privileges isn't really an option, do you have a test user available to you or can you create one? You could set it up to have exactly the same roles she has. If the test user also doesn't see the button, that would point towards a privilege issue. And then you could then also raise the privs of the test account to see if that solves the problem. Another way of accomplishing the above would be to temporarily reduce the roles of a user that can see the button to match the roles that she has to see if the button then disappears.
