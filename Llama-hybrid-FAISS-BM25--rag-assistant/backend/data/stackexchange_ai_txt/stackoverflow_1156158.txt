After looking around, automagically adapting user-agent strings from WURFL and seeing redirection activate for FF, I opted for something with a little less magic and danger of bouncing a desktop user to the mobile site. You can see the result at http://JonathansCorner.com/ on the home page: just a link at the top of the page that says "Mobile-friendly site" and shows up on most mobile usage but not most desktop usage. This is nowhere near perfect, but it is a modest improvement. (And, AFAICT, it doesn't have stuff that search engine spiders will interpret as text shown to search engines but hidden from regular users, which is penalized as blackhat SEO.) How I did it: Following http://www.alistapart.com/articles/return-of-the-mobile-stylesheet , I set my main stylesheet to not display divs of type mobile_notice. This is countermanded in a mobile stylesheet that catches iPhones. From the page header: Most of the browsers that don't use JavaScript are not wizards using NoScript or the like; they are less capable mobile browsers, probably the ones which need the simplified mobile site the most: Mobile-friendly version And, without search-engine-penalized text that appears to be spider food hidden from the general public, I add a nice, deprecated document.write() so phones with more capable browsers will see a div that displays on mobile phones only. document.write(" Mobile-friendly version "); Net effect? A modest improvement; on mobile devices there is an invitation to use the mobile site , but visitors can stay on the full web main site if the want. And it avoids stuff that is penalized by search engines. There is room for improvement--in particular, this does nothing for visitors who enter someplace else than the home page and don't stay around long enough to see this invitation. But I think it's a real improvement.
