If willing to do an alternative test, here is code to do an E-test for the difference in Poisson means : # Forgive me, will make putting this in a package on my ToDo list source('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r4zmlxmi41tqsts/ETest.R?dl=0') poisson.etest(0,10,10,10) Which returns a p-value of 0.0005782135 . If you want/need to stick with GLM's, it is common for logistic regression to use penalized regression for perfectly separated data. It may also make sense here for Poisson, although there isn't an obvious default for the penalties, nor am I sure about how the standard errors/coverage for coefficients will behave.
