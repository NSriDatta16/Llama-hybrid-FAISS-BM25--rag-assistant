Unsure what test to use for my non-parametric data

I would like some help choosing the most appropriate stats test to use for my data. I have two different types of organism, four different treatments and then the dependent variable is yes/no did they carry out a behavior. For example: EDIT In a comment OP added: I have the raw data total number yes and total number no for each organism and treatment, which is what I used to calculate the percentage of positive responses .
