Variance split interpretation in factor analysis

I have a quick question on PCA and Factor Analysis. One of the benefits of FA over PCA as I understood (correct me if wrong) is a more comprehensive model of the variance in the original data as split in common variance, unique variance and error variance but I am struggling to see how error variance is modelled. Let me explain with an equation. Assume my data points are stored in matrix X. When I perform factors analysis the following decomposition is estimated: QUESTION: If we assume the original data has been standardised to zero mean to ignore mu (not relevant here), am I right in assuming common variance is modelled by the common factors term while unique variance is modelled by ? If so, is the error variance modelled within as well? Thanks a lot for your help and hope my question makes sense.
