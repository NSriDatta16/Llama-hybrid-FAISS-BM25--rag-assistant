xcode linker error

I'm trying to compile a bundle that uses a third party library. I've had this working a while ago, but now it just refuses to link. Here's a sample of the errors: "lwpp::GlobalBase ::globPtr", referenced from: __ZN4lwpp10GlobalBaseIFPKcS2_EE7globPtrE$non_lazy_ptr in main.o __ZN4lwpp10GlobalBaseIFPKcS2_EE7globPtrE$non_lazy_ptr in license-2998A499.o ... ld: symbol(s) not found collect2: ld returned 1 exit status The third party project (lwpp) is included as a sub-project. I've clicked and dragged it's build products into the Targets > plugin_name > Link Binary With Libraries, but it still does not work. If I import the source files for the lwpp, then these link errors all go away. I'm at a complete loss.
