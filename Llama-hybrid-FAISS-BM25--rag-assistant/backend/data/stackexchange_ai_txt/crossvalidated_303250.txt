Are Chi-squared test and F-test both eligible for testing significance in ANOVA?

I was reading this article (Kim and Cohen, 2010 [1]), and realized that the authors used chi-square test to test the significance of two-way ANOVA on page 541 (1st paragraph of "Results and Discussion" section), but used F-test for testing the significance of two-way ANOVA on page 543 (again, 1st paragraph of "Results and Discussion" section). I understand that Chi-squared distribution and F distribution are closely related, but is it possible to use Chi-square test for testing whether "Between-variances" is significantly larger than "Within-variances"? and if it is indeed possible to use Chi-square test for ANOVA, then what would be the rationale to choose the test instead of F-test?
