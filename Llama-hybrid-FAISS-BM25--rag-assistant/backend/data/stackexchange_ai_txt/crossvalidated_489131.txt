Simply regress your time series on the dates. R will automatically convert your dates into a numerical object that counts days from some origin. The parameter estimate will then show the increment day-over-day. If you want to detrend your series, simply take the residuals from this model. If you don't want to center the detrended series (i.e., don't want to also remove the overall level), then just add the estimated intercept back in. dates
