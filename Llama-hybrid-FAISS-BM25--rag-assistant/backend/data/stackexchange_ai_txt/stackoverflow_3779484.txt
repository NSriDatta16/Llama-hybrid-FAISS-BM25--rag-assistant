Looking for guidance on detecting overlap of UIImageViews

The scenario is that I have a UIViewController containing multiple "InteractiveUIImageViews" (inherited from UIImageView) each containing their own UIImage. In InteractiveUIImageView I have iplemented methods for touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded to handle their movement and behaviour on screen. Certain objects of this type will be set as 'containers' (think recycle bin) with the objective being that when one image is dragged onto it, it will be removed from the screen and placed inside it to be potentially retrieved later. My current thinking would be to call a new method in UIViewController from the touchesEnded method of my InteractiveUIImageView but being new to all this I'm not really sure how to go about doing that (e.g. calling a method from the 'parent') or indeed if this is the best way to achieve what I want to do. Thanks in advance for any advice.
