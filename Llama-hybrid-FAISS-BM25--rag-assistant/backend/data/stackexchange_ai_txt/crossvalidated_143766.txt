Summary on correctly classfied instances WEKA for a 10-fold cross-validation

I ran a 10-fold cross-validation BayesNet (but it could be any method in WEKA), and the output I got was (among other things): ... === Stratified cross-validation === === Summary === Correctly Classified Instances 142 88.75 % Incorrectly Classified Instances 18 11.25 % Kappa statistic 0.8594 K&B Relative Info Score 13968.9989 % K&B Information Score 324.3318 bits 2.0271 bits/instance Class complexity | order 0 371.9209 bits 2.3245 bits/instance Class complexity | scheme 13057.6688 bits 81.6104 bits/instance Complexity improvement (Sf) -12685.748 bits -79.2859 bits/instance Mean absolute error 0.045 Root mean squared error 0.212 Relative absolute error 14.0471 % Root relative squared error 52.9716 % Total Number of Instances 160 ... My questions is related to the Correctly Classified Instances. In this case I got 142 out of 160, but on which run? To my knowledge, a 10-fold cross-validation runs several times. This statistic is for which run? The best? The last? For all of them? And if it was an average on all runs, don't you guys think that it's a little bit convenient that the number was a nice integer (I ran a lot of classifications and its always an integer).
