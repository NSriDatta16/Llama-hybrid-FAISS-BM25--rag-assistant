Certainly an independent sample t-test is a start point. But considering the complexity of the data you have I think you can improve your model a bit. Here some suggestions. I think you could analyse this kind of data within a full factorial mixed model with group and time as factors and a random intercept. In this case a significant time:group interaction would indicate that the treatment is effective. However in your case the time factors will have 10 levels... so if this is too much you can either treat it as a continuous variable (and then maybe have also nonlinear terms - you should plot your data as a function of time and decide on that), or restructure your data, namely you average the timepoints corresponding to pre- and after treatment.
