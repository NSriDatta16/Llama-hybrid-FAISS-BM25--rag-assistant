That's OK. You expect a strong relationship between the parameters and the log density. Sometimes it's U-shaped with a clear maximum marginal likelihood that is within the sampled posterior and sometimes like what you show. The Bayesian posterior won't necessarily include the maximum likelihood estimate or anything near it in the posterior. Instead, it gives you the typical set, which is the kind of draws you'd expect if you could draw from the posterior at random. This is why you can get posteriors in cases like hierarchical models where there is no maximum likelihood estimate (only marginal maximum likelihood estimates as produced by packages like lme4). You should be able to see this if you plot the log density vs. sigma_overdisp with the other parameters fixed to some reasonable value.
