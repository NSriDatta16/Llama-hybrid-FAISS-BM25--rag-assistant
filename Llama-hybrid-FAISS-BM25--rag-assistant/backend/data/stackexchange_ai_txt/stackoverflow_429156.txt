If a typical NullReferenceException will do, don't bother checking and just let the runtime throw it. If you need at add contextual error information, for logging or debugging purposes (or whatever), go ahead and factor your validation out into a different method. I'd still encourage you to throw a NullReferenceException with the original exception nested, in that case. I've had to do similar things when I've been forced to manually munge through deep XML documents. In general, I try to enforce null-correctness at interface boundaries in my classes. I can then ignore null checks within my private methods.
