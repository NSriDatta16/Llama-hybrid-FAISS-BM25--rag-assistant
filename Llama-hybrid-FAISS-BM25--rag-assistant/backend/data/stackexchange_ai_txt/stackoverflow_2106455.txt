I'd also go with Lua due to it's absurd customizability and versality (if you don't like it's syntax you can change it to a functional or a python-like one). As said in the previous answer, you've got sandboxing and strong concurrency. I personally would never even think of embedding anything else than Lua ;>. However, Lua lacks a expanded standard library, and this is where Python wins big time :/.
