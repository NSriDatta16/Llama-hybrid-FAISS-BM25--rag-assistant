Reconstruction of java command line arguments

Is there a way to reconstruct the command line arguments passed to Java within a Java program, including the JVM options and classpath option? I have a Java program that needs to restart the JVM and manipulate its bootclasspath (i.e. trying to override some system classes). I use the libc system method to invoke the new JVM. I'm open for better approaches, but Java agents isn't an option.
