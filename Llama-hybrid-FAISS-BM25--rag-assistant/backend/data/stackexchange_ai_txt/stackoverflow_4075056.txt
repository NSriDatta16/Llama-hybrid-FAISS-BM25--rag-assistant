What are the options for saving data in iOS?

I'd like to serialize a bunch of data and save it to a file, then be able to load it (naturally) and play it back with a feature I have written. (Sorry if my terminology is off, I am a novice with this sort of thing.) What is the best way to do this with iOS? From looking at documentation here: Standard Application Behaviors Guide I've gathered that I should use NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains for finding the appropriate storage directory root (Documents?) and then use NSData to store these data buffers I create and write them to file. Am I spot on with that or have I got it wrong? Any other sage advice?
