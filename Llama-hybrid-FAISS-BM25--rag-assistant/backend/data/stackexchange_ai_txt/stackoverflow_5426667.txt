spring RequestHeader annotation on model object?

Can I put @RequestHeader on a model object property? I.e. class MyModel { String ua; public void setUa(@RequestHeader("User-Agent") String ua) { this.ua = ua; } } This works with @RequestParam, but seems to have no effect when I use @RequestHeader. Am I missing something? And, if this isn't supported, is there some reason why?
