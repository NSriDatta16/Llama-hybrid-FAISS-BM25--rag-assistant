I like to try to "let the data do the talking" instead of "coming to it and telling it what to say". I encourage you to perform Exploratory Data Analysis before culling any data. If this were my data then I would consider making a bubble plot where the mean (or median) lake size is along the x-axis, the variation in lake size is along the y-axis, and the bubbles are colored by kurtosis (or its multiplicative inverse if too much data occlusion occurs). It is particular and possibly goofy sounding but will give a distribution of central tendencies, the relation to distribution of variation tendencies, and the relation of that to variation in variation tendencies. This will allow your high-performing human brain to look for patterns, clusters, or characteristic phenomena. You might also make a graph of lake size, variation and kurtosis, and look there too. This sort of graphical exploration can help you get a more informed understanding of your data before you start throwing information away. EDIT: Before you average them for a year (and thus throw away data) why not put all the data into the analysis. I know it multiplies your sample size by 3x, but I think your sample size isn't too big. If you are under a million samples, you might have enough data, maybe. I think a 3d scatterplot of mean size by variance of size, by kurtosis of size is going to give clear indication of clustering or divergence of the data. If there is a place to draw a line and cull data, a graph like that would inform it. questions: what format is your data in? what software package are you using to process it? what graphing and analysis options are available with it?
