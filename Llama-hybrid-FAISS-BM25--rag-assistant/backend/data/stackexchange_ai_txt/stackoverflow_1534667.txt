jQuery draggable clone with y axis restriction

If I have this markup: 111 aaa 222 bbb And this jQuery code: $(".x span").draggable({ helper: 'clone', axis: 'y'}); When dragging the first column the cloned span is snapping to the second column rather than the first column. If I try to drag the table cell rather than the span inside it snaps outside of the table. If I remove axis:'y' is works as expected except I no longer have the Y axis restriction that I would like. Any ideas? Thanks.
