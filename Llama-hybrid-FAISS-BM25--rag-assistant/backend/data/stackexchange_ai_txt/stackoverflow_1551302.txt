How to store simple name value pairs in an ldap directory

I'm creating a user repository ldap backend for a series of web applications sharing the same users. I would like to store preference information in this ldap location. This way everything related to users is maintained in the same place and can be shared among all applications. I'm thinking of a general structure like this: ou=People,dc=domain,dc=com uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=domain,dc=com ou=Preferences,uid=jdoe,dc=domain,dc=com ou=firstpreference,ou=Preferences,uid=jdoe,dc=domain,dc=com value : 123 value : 456 I have several questions: Is jsut below the user entry the right place to start storing the preferences? What objectClass should this entry be? I'm experimenting with organizationalUnit but it doesn't seem right. What is the best way to store name value pairs for the preferences? Here my best guest is to create an entry just below the preferences having a name and create the value just under it. This way I can account for multiple values. What should be the correct objectClass for those entries? I'm working with OpenLDAP and wouldn't like to change the schemas that come with it. Is there a way to set this up using available schemas?
