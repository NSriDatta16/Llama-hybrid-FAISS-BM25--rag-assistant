The fact that you have to even ask this question, and that the solutions given are, shall we say, less than perfectly readable :-) should be a good indication that REs are not the real answer to this question. You would be far better, from a readability viewpoint, to actually code this up as a relatively simple parser. Too often, people try to use REs to be "clever" (I don't mean that in a disparaging way), thinking that a single line is elegant, but all they end up with is an unmaintainable morass of characters. I'd rather have a fully commented 20-line solution that I can understand in an instant.
