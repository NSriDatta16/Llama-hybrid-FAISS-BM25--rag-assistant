Avoiding the zero problem

I have a dataset and I'm trying to predict the label for my sample but I couldn't map it since that case never showed here is my sample (I'm using na√Øve Bayesian method) X=(Age=middle, has_job=false, own_house=true, credit_rating=good) and that's it the dataset What I'm supposed to do to fix the problem? I know that I should avoid it but didn't know how
