i dont know what infragistics is. ill assume its some framework over which you have no control. if i were you i would try the following: 1) set a timeout to take focus back to the window after 1000 ms, or set a timeout loop to set focus to the window you need. this is a hack. 2) figure out what functions fire the events that ruin your life, override those functions in your code and add a flag that will prevent them from doing something evil 3) last, atleast read this: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html there might be something useful for you in there
