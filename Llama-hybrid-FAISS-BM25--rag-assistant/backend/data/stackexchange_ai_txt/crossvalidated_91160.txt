Why are after training 5-state HMM only few entries of transition matrix left greater than zero?

I try to create the speech recognition system based on 5-state HMM + Multivariate Gaussian function. I use my own feature vector derived from MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients). The problem is that after training only a few entries of the HMM transition matrix are left greater then zero. It should be mentioned that only states 2 -- 4 can emit observation. States 1 and 5 help connecting model with other models to make a chain. The initial matrix: $$\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.6 & 0.4 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.6 & 0.4 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.7 & 0.3 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \end{array} \right]$$ Matrix after model training on phoneme "a" samples is looking like that: $$\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.8910256 & 0.1089744 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 \\ 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \end{array} \right]$$ The training corpus consists of 187 sequences with about 10 vectors in average in every sequence. The performance of such model is quite poor. So what might be the main reasons for such sparse transition matrix after model training? Thank you for any help in advance.
