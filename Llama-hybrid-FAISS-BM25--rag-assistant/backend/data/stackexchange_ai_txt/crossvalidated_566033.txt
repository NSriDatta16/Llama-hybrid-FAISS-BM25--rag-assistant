How to compare nested multilevel path models

I have two multilevel path models, one is nested in the other and I want to compare the models to see whether I should prefer the full or nested model. The models have cross-level interactions and I am currently using Mplus with a bayesian estimator. However, Mplus doesn't have (as far as I have been able to find) a way to compare models outside of things the DIC (for example DIFTEST doesn't work for Bayesian ML-SEM). Similarly, R's Mplusautomation package has a model comparison function, but it doesn't seem to produce something like a chi-square Log Likelihood ratio for Bayesian estimators. Although alternative packages like Lavaan handle ML-SEM and can be compared relatively easily with a Likelihood Ratio Test, it doesn't currently support cross-level interactions (as far as I know). I am looking for suggestions on how to compare two nested multilevel path models with cross level interactions. I am aware you can use the DICs, but I am a bit lost as to what constitutes a meaningful difference between two DICs. So any advice in this direction would also be helpful.
