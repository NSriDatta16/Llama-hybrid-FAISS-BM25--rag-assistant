This depends on the type of smart card. You won't be able to use the ATR, because this will be the same for each card. However, some smart cards support a "CHUID" (card holder unique ID), many MIFARE cards support this. However, sometimes the MIFARE card is configured to report a psuedo-random value for the card ID to eliminate the chances of someone tracking the card. My company makes a web-browser based scripting environment for smart cards that will get you started, the paypass demo shows how to get the card ID for paypass cards: https://cardboss.cometway.com/content.agent?page_name=Paypass+Demo
