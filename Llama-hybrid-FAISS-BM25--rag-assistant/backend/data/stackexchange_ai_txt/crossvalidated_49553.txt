OK, let's talk about the elephant of statistics with our sight blindfolded by what we've learnt from one or two people we've closely worked with in our grad programs... Stat programs require what they see fit, that is, what is the most important stuff they want their students to learn given a limited amount of time the students will have on the program. Requiring one narrow area means kissing goodbye to some other areas that can be argued to be equally important. Some programs require measure theoretic probability, some don't. Some require a foreign language, but most programs don't. Some programs take Bayesian paradigm as the only thing worth studying, but most don't. Some programs know that the greatest demand for statisticians is in survey statistics (at least that's the case in the US), but most don't. Biostat programs follow the money and teach SAS + the methods that will sell easily to medical and pharma sciences. For a person designing agricultural experiments, or collecting survey data via phone surveys, or validating psychometric scales, or producing disease incidence maps in a GIS, machine learning is an abstract art of computer science, very distant from statistics that they work with on a daily basis. None of these people will see any immediate benefit from learning support vector machines or random forests. All in all, machine learning is a nice complement to other areas of statistics, but I would argue that the mainstream stuff like multivariate normal distribution and generalized linear models need to come first.
