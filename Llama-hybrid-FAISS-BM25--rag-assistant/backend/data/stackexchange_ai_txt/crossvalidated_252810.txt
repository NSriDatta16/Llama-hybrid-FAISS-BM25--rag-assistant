In CNN, are upsampling and transpose convolution the same?

Both the terms "upsampling" and "transpose convolution" are used when you are doing "deconvolution" ( Transpose convolution : looks like we can use it when we propoagate the loss via convolutonal neural network. http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/convolutional-neural-networks/#Backward-Propagation https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034v2.pdf , section 4 "For the convolutional layer..." Upsampling : seems like we use it when we want to upsample from smaller input to larger input in convnet-decovnet structure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByjaPdWXKJ4&feature=youtu.be&t=22m
