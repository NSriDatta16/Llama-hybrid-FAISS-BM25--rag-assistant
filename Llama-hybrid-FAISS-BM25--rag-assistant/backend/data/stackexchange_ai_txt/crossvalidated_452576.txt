How to measure smoothness of inputs over outputs?

I know similar questions have been asked for time series data. But my question is a little bit different. Consider that we have input dataset $X \in R^{N \times M}$ , where $M$ is the dimension of inputs and $N$ is the number of samples. The output can be more than one dimension. Therefore, the output of our dataset is $Y \in R^{N \times T}$ , where $T$ is the dimension of outputs. The problem refers to multitarget regression in the literature. My question: Is there any criteria to measure the smoothness or the roughness of this dataset? My definition for smoothness: Small change on inputs does not change outputs significantly. Also, if there is a method for just $T=1$ , I would like to know.
