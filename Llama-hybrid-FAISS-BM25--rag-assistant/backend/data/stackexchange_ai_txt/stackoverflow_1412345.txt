Which is a lighter object

I am confused here. Which is lighter object? is orgWithNullImageCollection or orgWithImageCollection ? in the below code. Or is it lighter object concept at all. Please find the code snippet below for the reference. class Orgnization { public Collection ImageCollection { get; set; } } Organization orgWithNullImageCollection = new Organization(); org.ImageCollection = null; Collection imageCollection = new Collection(); // Adding 100 images to imageCollection Organization orgWithImageCollection = new Organization(); org.ImageCollection = imageCollection; Is there any difference in performance if I pass these two objects to any other methods? ie passing orgWithNullImageCollection over orgWithImageCollection ? I believe that, it won't make any difference whether ImageCollection property of Organization objects points to something or not. Please clarify.
