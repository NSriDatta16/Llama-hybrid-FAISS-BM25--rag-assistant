strong evidence for H1 with Bayes factor but very weak with Bayesian regression estimation

I performed a Bayesian hierarchal regression with the brm package. Looking at the parameter estimation and confidence interval, I found no support for one of the parameters. However, when I computed Bayes Factor (using different packages), I found strong evidence (BF=11). I am assuming I am doing some kind of a syntax mistake. How could this be? I attach the code and output below. Any idea would be appreciated. Thank you #this summary shows the effect of condition is very weak (CI includes 0) summary(brm_reward_noint) #this BF analysis shows strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis that condition_num_c has an effect bayesfactor_models(brm_reward_nocondition, brm_reward_noint)
