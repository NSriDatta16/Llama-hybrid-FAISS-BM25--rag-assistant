A polynomial can have matrix or operator inputs. let $p(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x+2)^2$ . If $p(x)=0$ and if $\textbf{A}$ is a square matrix of full rank we have, $p(\textbf{A}) = (\textbf{A}+2)^2 = (\textbf{A}+2)(\textbf{A}+2) = 0$ what is wrong with. the above? We need to 'replace' $2$ with $2\times\textbf{I}$ Now pick any column $c_j$ from $(\textbf{A}+2\textbf{I})$ . We have, ( $\textbf{A}+2\textbf{I})c_j = 0 \quad \implies \textbf{A}c_j = -2c_j$ So $c_j$ is an eigenvector of $\textbf{A}$ with corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda = -2$ . $c_j$ is obviously in the nullspace of $\textbf{A}$ . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every univariate polynomial of degree $n$ can be decomposed into $n$ monic polynomial terms. By range-null-space decomposition , because the null-space of a matrix of rank $n$ stabilizes (or stops growing) at [at most] $n$ powers of $\textbf{A}$ (e.g. $\textbf{A}^n$ ), we expect at most $n$ distinct eigenvalues (roots of $p(\textbf{A}) = 0$ ). Ergo, the polynomial $\prod_i^n(\textbf{A}-\lambda_i\textbf{I}) = 0$ satisfies the characteristic equation. In time-series analysis it is often the case that we need to divide by the eigenvalues so as to attain terms of the form $(1-\lambda_i^{-1}\textbf{B})$ where $\textbf{B}$ is the backshift operator. See section 3.6 of 'Time Series: Theory and Methods' by Brockwell and Davis.
