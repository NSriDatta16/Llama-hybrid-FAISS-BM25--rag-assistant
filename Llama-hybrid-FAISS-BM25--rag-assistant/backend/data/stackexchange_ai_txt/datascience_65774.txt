Lets go back to basics here. It is not possible to only use Keras without using a backend, such as Tensorflow, because Keras is only an extension for making it easier to read and write machine learning programs . All the actual calculations needed to create models are not implemented in Keras, which is why you need to use a backend library for anything to work. When you are creating a model in Keras, you are actually still creating a model using Tensorflow , Keras just makes it easier to code.
