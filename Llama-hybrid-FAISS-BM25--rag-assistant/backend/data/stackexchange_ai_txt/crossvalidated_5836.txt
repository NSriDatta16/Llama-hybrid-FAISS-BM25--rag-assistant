Annotating graphs in R

This is more of a "how to use R" question than an actual hardcore statistics question, but I think the concentration of R masters here makes this a good forum for it. I'm refreshing a time series graphing package that currently uses gnuplot. The first step is getting somewhere close to the current graphs, and then I hope to be able to add more statistical analysis from R later. Currently, the gnuplot-generated graphs look like this: The corresponding graph from R looks like this: I'm reasonably happy with this. What's missing is the legend stuff from below the gnuplot graph. I can add a legend saying "In" and "Out", but how to best present the average, maximal and minimal values? I could add horizontal lines to the graph and print the values inside the graph area, but the placement might interfere with the actual graph.
