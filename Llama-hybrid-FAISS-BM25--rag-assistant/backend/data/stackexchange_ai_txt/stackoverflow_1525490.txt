You put the array values in automatic storage ( usually on the stack ) in Do but only pass pointers to those arrays as arguments to DoSomething . Whether the arguments are passed on the stack or as registers depends on your environment's ABI . If the architecture passes the arguments as registers and the call is inlined by the compiler and DoSomething doesn't need any variables, it may be that no stack is used by DoSomething . Conversely, some architectures always pass arguments on the stack and some compilers don't inline, in which case the stack will have the argument values as addresses of the arrays, as well as other state such as the return address.
