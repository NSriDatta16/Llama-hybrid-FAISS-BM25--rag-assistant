Clear iPhone simulator cookies

I have an app that makes request to a REST service. Authentication is done using cookies. This already works. What I have problems with is to test the case when the cookie is no longer valid and my code has to reauthenticate. To test this I have to wait until the cookie is invalid, which could take some time. To accelerate this I figured that if I delete the cookie it would have the same effect. How to delete all cookies of an app on the iPhone simulator? I already tried the following: Deleting /Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies doesn't work. It seems that my cookies are never written to this file. Deleting all cookies in NSHTTPCookieStorage on app startup doesn't work either.
