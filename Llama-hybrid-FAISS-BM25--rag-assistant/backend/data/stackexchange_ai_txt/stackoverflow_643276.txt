At what point do you need to be a programmer to work with Drupal?

Drupal seems to have lots to offer to the non-programmer. Tons of modules and easy installation. But at what point would you say you need to be a programmer? Where does it fall down and require more hands-on attention? Also, even though they aren't "meant" to be done, I'm interested in any custom tweaks you've had to do to the code base.
