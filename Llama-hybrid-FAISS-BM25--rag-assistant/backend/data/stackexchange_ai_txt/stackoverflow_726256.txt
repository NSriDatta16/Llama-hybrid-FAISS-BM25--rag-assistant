You might want to look into the DevExpress grid control which not only does this but also allows the user to manually drag columns to the top to categorize in any way they see fit. You can limit which columns can be used. I don't know if you can do this in a GridView (I don't think you can) but you can absolutely do it with the DeveExpress grid.
