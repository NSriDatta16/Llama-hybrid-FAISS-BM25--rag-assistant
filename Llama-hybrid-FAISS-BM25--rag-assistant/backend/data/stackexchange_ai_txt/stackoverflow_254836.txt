Thanks to Owen for pointing me in the direction of RDFa, I think I've got the solution now: &copy; 2008 Example Corporation Depending on the situation, it might be better to use dc:creator instead of dc:publisher. From the Dublin Core web site: If the Creator and Publisher are the same, do not repeat the name in the Publisher area. If the nature of the responsibility is ambiguous, the recommended practice is to use Publisher for organizations, and Creator for individuals. In cases of lesser or ambiguous responsibility, other than creation, use Contributor. I will also be adding a meta tag to my head element for search engines that don't support RDFa yet.
