At first glance this looks like snowball sampling, but snowball sampling usually proceeds to get more referalls from the refered subjects. This could also be considered cluster sampling where a cluster is defined by a working mother, her manager, and her closest co-worker. You are sampling an entire cluster by choosing the mother. So you could use techniques based on cluster sampling. Or it could even be that each triplet is really your observational unit (if you are more interested in relationships between the 3 people than something like the average age of the managers) and could be treated as a simple random sample (but the data is the triplet). The problem comes in that it is unlikely that the population of interest matches the population that you are sampling from. Any employees who are not the closest coworker to a mother have 0 probability of being sampled, any manager who does not supervise a mother has 0 probability of being sampled, and any manager who supervises more than 1 mother has a higher chance of being sampled than those that only supervise 1. The last part could be handled by weighting, but the under coverage in the other 2 could seriously bias any results.
