HTML makes it quite easy to do this, actually. No need for really cunning amounts of steganography, etc. Let's see: This sentence embeds 123 and then stops embedding. This sentence embeds 0102 and then stops embedding. (We'll have to see whether it actually works in markdown, but I suspect so.) Admittedly it's pretty obvious if you know that there's something to look for, but I think you'll agree it's not obvious to casual observers. I've left it as a little puzzle to work out the scheme, but add a comment if you want it to be explicitly explained.
