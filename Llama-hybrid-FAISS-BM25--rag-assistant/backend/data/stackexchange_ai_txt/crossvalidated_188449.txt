The authors are talking about odds, so I'd guess they used logistic regression with multiple covariables ("multivariable regression"). The terms "ANOVA" and "ANCOVA" do not make much sense in the framework of generalized linear models since no (residual) variances are compared but rather "deviances" (which is a quantity linked to the maximized value of the likelihood function). Still, they are sometimes used when doing analyses that mimic ANOVA/ANCOVA of linear models. It would be better to say "ANOVA-like analysis" or "ANCOVA-like analysis" to distinguish. BTW: It is quite unconventional to use the classic linear model (ordinary least squares) with a binary response. There are different reasons: The equal variance assumption of OLS is inviolated because conditional variance depends on conditional mean. This is certainly a problem with inferential results and fitted probabilities close to 0 and 1. Predictions might be outside the unit interval. This can easily be fixed by setting predictions below 0 to 0 and those above 1 to 1. The additive structure of the model equation is often unnatural: Using OLS, a jump from 50% to 60% probability is equally worth than a jump from 90% to 100%.
