Your code seems ok to me. I suggest little changes: Since your are going through all possible combinations you might get the toLowerCase() of your back at the start. Also, if an exact match already occurred, you don't need to perform another equals . result = result.toLowerCase(); searchStr = searchStr.toLowerCase(); String[] resultWords = result.split(" "); String[] searchWords = searchStr.split(" "); int score = 0; for (String resultWord : resultWords) { boolean exactMatch = false; for (String searchWord : searchWords) { if (!exactMatch && resultWord.equals(searchWord)) { exactMatch = true; score += 3; } else if (resultWord.contains(searchWord)) score++; } } Of course, this is a very basic level. If you are really interested in this area of computer science and want to learn more about implementing search engines start with these terms: Natural Language Processing Information retrieval Text mining
