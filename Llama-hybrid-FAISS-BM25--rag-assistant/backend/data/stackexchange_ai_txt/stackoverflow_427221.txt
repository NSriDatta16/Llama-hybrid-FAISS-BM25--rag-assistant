Better (non-linear) binning

The last question I asked concerned how to bin data by x co-ordinate. The solution was simple and elegant, and I'm ashamed I didn't see it. This question may be harder (or I may just be blind). I started out with about 140000 data points and split them into 70 groups equally spaced along the x axis I then took the average position (x_avg, y_avg) of each group and plotted them; a nice curve appeared. Unfortunately there are two problems. First of all, the edges are much less populated than the center of the graph; Second of all, some areas change more than others and thus need a better resolution. I thus have two specific questions and a general invitation to throw suggestions: Does matlab have a builtin way of splitting a matrix into either a fixed number of smaller matricies or smaller matricies of a fixed size? Is there an algorithm (or a matlab function, but I find that unlikely) to determine the boundaries required to bin regions of interest more finely? More generally, is there a better way of condensing tens of thousands of data points into a neat trend?
