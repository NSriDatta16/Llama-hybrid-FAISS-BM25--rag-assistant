Using border-right with floats displays incorrectly

I am floating a couple divs inside a container div & the first div has a border on the right. It works correctly WITHOUT the border, but when I add the border it all messes up & the text inside the container on the right displays itself under the border from the other div. To show you what I mean here is a picture: Here is my code: Resolution/Megapixels Average Quality Size/Best Quality Size 0.5 megapixels 3x5 inches/NA Edit: Please disregard. Worked it out as soon as I posted this.
