How can I correlate different types of variables?

first of all, my knowledge on this subject is very limited, therefore it may be a silly question. I have 3 vectors, two of them are (distance vectors) in the range of 0 and 1, and the other is (Pearson Correlation Coefficients) between -1 and 1. I want to look at the correlation between them in Matlab, but I'm confused is it necessary to normalize the correlation coefficient? If so I read that the correlation coefficient is not directly averaged. Does the same process apply when normalizing? Thanks for the help.
