I tried running your example, with the exact same password (on a test account) and did not have any issues uploading my sample image. I even looked through a pcap to make sure the encoding is being done correctly. -desktop:~/Dropbox$ curl -vv -F "username=********" -F "password=='hwsh[g" -F "message=test twitpic" -F media=@./code_Quality_Measurement_wtfm.jpg http://twitpic.com/api/uploadAndPost * About to connect() to twitpic.com port 80 (#0) * Trying 174.36.58.233... connected * Connected to twitpic.com (174.36.58.233) port 80 (#0) > POST /api/uploadAndPost HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.19.5 (i486-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.19.5 OpenSSL/0.9.8g zlib/1.2.3.3 libidn/1.15 > Host: twitpic.com > Accept: */* > Content-Length: 46066 > Expect: 100-continue > Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------50b761e49108 > 6311967029 ********** rzu6c http://twitpic.com/rzu6c * Connection #0 to host twitpic.com left intact * Closing connection #0 what Shell are you using? depending on what "special" characters you use in your password, you may need to escape them differently to keep the shell from expanding/etc any time you use double quotes in a command line, you have to deal with variable expansion, especially if your password contains a dollarsign ($). it may be better to use single quotes around the password field, and explicitely escape any single quotes in your password: -F 'password==\'hwsh[g'
