Conditional mean independence assumption in linear regression

In Linear Regression, we have the Conditional mean independence assumption: E(u|x) = 0, where u is the error in the linear relationship. May I clarify: my understanding of this is that implications of this assumption are that: u is normally distributed around 0, therefore expectation = 0 (I understand that it may not be a normal distribution now after seeing an answer here, but at the very least the average value is at 0) x doesn't influence anything about u (i.e. gives no information about u, and by extension its expectation) since x and u are independent (so this shows the independence) Is my understanding correct?
