Already many good answers, so why one more? This is mostly to draw attention to the interesting ideas discussed here at the The n-Category Caf√© . While diversity in ecology (and elsewhere) mostly only looks at abundance, one should also look at how similar/dissimilar the different species are. By representing the species (or whatever, like SE sites ...) as points in a metric space this leads to generalizing entropy to metric spaces, see for instance The maximum entropy of a metric space by Tom Leinster, Emily Roff . The same ideas could be used within SE sites by looking at tags as points in a metric space. EDIT Now the ideas linked above will be published as a book , a version of which is already on the arXiv .
