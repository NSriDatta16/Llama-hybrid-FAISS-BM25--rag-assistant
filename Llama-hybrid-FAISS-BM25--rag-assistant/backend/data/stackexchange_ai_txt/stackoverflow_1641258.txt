Depends very much on a couple of factors. Are you hosting the repository yourself or outsourcing it to a company that handles that for you? (Highly recommended, since that usually means you get off-site backup and redundancy for cheap. Things that can sometimes be hard to get right.) It's a lot easier to find stellar hosting for Subversion. I believe there's only one or two options on the market for TFS hosting. How many people will have access to the repository? Do you need to set permissions on portions of the repository? How do you want to handle access control? If you need to do anything particularly complicated, it's either not possible in TFS or its very expensive. Subversion can usually handle it, though it's not always easy to set up. Almost everything that TFS's version control can do can also be done on Subversion, either out-of-the-box or with the aid of some additional tool. Subversion also integrates pretty well with Visual Studio, though personally I always preferred TortoiseSVN. It's also a lot less expensive, assuming you don't already have TFS through MSDN subscriptions of some sort. However, if you ever get into the extreme realms of version control (absurdly huge repositories, or gigantic binaries in the repository, for example) what you really want is Perforce.
