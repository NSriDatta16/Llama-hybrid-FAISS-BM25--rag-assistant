Relationship between people's insight and behavior

My main interest is to see how well people can identify the reasons behind their decisions. To measure this, I have collected 2 types of data: one set of variables that measures how important people think given factors are, and another set that measures the same factors in real situations when a decision was made. I can analyze the second half by building a mixed-effect logistic regression model using 11 predictor variables and a binary outcome variable in a repeated measures design (because there are 10 measurements per participant per variable). How should I determine the degree to which peopleâ€™s insight corresponds with their behavior?
