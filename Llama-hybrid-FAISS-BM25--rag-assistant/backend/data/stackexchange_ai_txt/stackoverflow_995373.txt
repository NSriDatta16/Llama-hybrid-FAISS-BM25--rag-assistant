MySQL: Sort GROUP_CONCAT values

In short: Is there any way to sort the values in a GROUP_CONCAT statement? Query: GROUP_CONCAT((SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(parent.name SEPARATOR " &raquo; ") FROM test_competence AS node, test_competence AS parent WHERE node.lft BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt AND node.id = l.competence AND parent.id != 1 ORDER BY parent.lft) SEPARATOR " \n") AS competences I get this row: Crafts » Joinery Administration » Organization I want it like this: Administration » Organization Crafts » Joinery
