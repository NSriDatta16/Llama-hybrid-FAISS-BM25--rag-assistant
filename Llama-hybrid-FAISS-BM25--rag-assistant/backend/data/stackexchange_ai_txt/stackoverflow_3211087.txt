You need to change your query to: SELECT * FROM fsb_profile WHERE fsb_profile.profile_id IN ( SELECT fsb_friendlist.friendlist_friendid FROM fsb_friendlist WHERE friendlist_memberid = $id ); i.e. replace fsb_profile.profile_id=( with fsb_profile.profile_id IN ( Edit : I didn't pay attention to the actual query, I only tried to correct the error you are getting. The correct query should be something like: SELECT * FROM fsb_profile WHERE fsb_profile.profile_id IN ( SELECT friendlist_memberid FROM fsb_friendlist WHERE friendlist_friendid = $id );
