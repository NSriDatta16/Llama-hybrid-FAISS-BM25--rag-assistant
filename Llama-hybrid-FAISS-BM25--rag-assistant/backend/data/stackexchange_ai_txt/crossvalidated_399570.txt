Forecasting data with multiple seasonality

I'm attempting to forecast the number of taxi rides per hour that occur in NYC. I've turned the data into a time series using 24*7 as the frequency: taxi_ts I then use decompose() to split my ts into seasonal, trend, and random components. parts side question if anyone knows, why does this include alot of NA in the data? I'm assuming now that I would fit a ARIMA model to my trend component to forecast on that. After I do this though how would I add the seasonal component back on to the predictions?
