In WPF RichTextBox, does overriding of Underline/Strikethrough work?

In a WPF RichTextBox , the effective style of a Run of text is a result of combining the properties defined on the Run with the properties it "inherits" from the enclosing Paragraph and finally the styles on the Document . So you can set FontWeight to Bold at any of those levels. You can also set it Bold on the Paragraph and then switch it to Normal (override it) for a specific Run . However, underline and strikethrough are different. They are items that can optionally appear in a list of TextDecorations , which is a property of Inline (and hence Run ) and of Paragraph , but not of Document . And you can switch on Underline in the Paragraph , and it gets inherited so that all Run s within that Paragraph default appear underlined by default. Is it possible to switch it off underline in a specific Run ? i.e. is there a way to insert an entry into the list of TextDecorations which would mean " Don't underline", thus overriding the Paragraph 's setting?
