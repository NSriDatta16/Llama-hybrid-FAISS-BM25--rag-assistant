Touch Events in UIScroll View in iPhone

I have created scroll view in my view controller and set the buttons in the scroll view. I have set the scroll view between the two images. The buttons are scrolling horizontally. Now i want to enable and disable the images. For Eg: Initially left images are to be hidden, once moving the button horizontally and enable right button and hidden the left button. How can i write the touch events for the scroll view?. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"ImagePressed"); } If i have used this method in my application. But the methods are doesn't called. SO how can i write the touch events when i clicks the scroll view. If i get the touch events, then only i could enable and disable the images. so please help me out? See my images, (I have set the two images(left arrow and right arrow images)). I have set the two images in the imageview and I have set the scroll view as subview for the custom view.(Scroll view is not subview for view controller). UIImageView *leftImg; UIImageView *rightImg; Thanks!
