Yes, you are correct, that averaging the measurements for each plant is a bad idea as it loses important information. And again, you are correct that a mixed effects model can, in principle, be used, by fitting random intercepts for plant ID. In lme4 (and several other packages) in R, you could specify this as lmer(yield ~ predictors + (1 | plantID) This will control for the repeated measurements and also handle the unbalanced design. Depending on the data (and your research hypotheses) you can also allow the effect of predictors to differ for each plant, by specifying random slopes for the predictors.
