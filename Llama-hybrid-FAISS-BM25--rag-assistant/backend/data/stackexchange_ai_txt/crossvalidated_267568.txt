There is a tradeoff between dimensionality and lag order: in VAR($p$) you have a potentially high lag order $p$ but low dimensionality (the number of time series) $K$; in the corresponding VAR($1$) (the companion form) you have low lag order $1$ but potentially high dimensionality $p\times K$. Sometimes manipulating $p$ small coefficient matrices of size $K\times K$ can be easier than manipulating one large matrix of size $pK\times pK$. Also, it is more natural to think about VAR($p$) than the companion VAR($1$). It is no coincidence that the companion form is only introduced in textbooks when it is needed for proofs, but not for general exposition.
