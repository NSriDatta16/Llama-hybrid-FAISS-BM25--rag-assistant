Mass email tracking

Most services offered online today that claim to "track" e-mails, do so by embedding images in the emails. My questions are: Is this the only way to do it and if not, what are the other methods? Are any of the methods actually fool-proof? Has anybody had any luck with specific software or even an online group?
