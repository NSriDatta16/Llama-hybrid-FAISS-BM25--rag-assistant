Visual Studio ad-hoc tools and plugins

Guys, I opened this question (I hope could help some others) but reading stackoverflow I find some really interesting pearls of information lost in the cloud. What do I mean? For example I was reasearching the Web for the best way to validate parameters in methods. I was breaking my head trying to find a nice, elegant way to do it, then I found a question about Code Contracts. Then I found that many programmers are using the new FWK 4.0 Contracts and that blew up my mind ( I didn´t even know that exist).- I was trying to reinvent the wheel again.- So there are plenty of plug ins, tools, addons, kits, frameworks, etc and not everybody are aware of all of them. Perhaps somebody is having a headache during the design of an application and a "well known" VS add on can help you.- So what is that little tool that you can´t stop using and makes your development much more easy. Three that I found (Im sorry if this is too newbie) NetReflector (Sweet!) http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/ VSDocman (For documentation, free trial) http://www.helixoft.com/vsdocman/overview.html Code Contracts (for parameter validation) http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/
