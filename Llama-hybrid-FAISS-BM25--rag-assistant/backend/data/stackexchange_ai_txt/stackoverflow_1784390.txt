My entirely unscientific view is that a lot of pressure is placed on Microsoft by open source projects like Ruby on Rails, which gain a lot of popularity and divert attention from Microsoft. ASP.NET MVC is a direct response to Ruby on Rails, and it is completely open source. In other words, if you can't beat 'em... Microsoft stands to gain a lot from being perceived as cooperative with the open-source community. Making C# and the CLR an open standard ultimately insures that their code will run anywhere, and helps them achieve their vision of world domination. :)
