If you read the documentation of finalize() closely, you will notice that finalizers enable an object to prevent being collected by the GC. If no finalizer is present, the object simply can be removed and does not need any more attention. But if there is a finalizer, it needs to be checked afterwards, if the object didn't become "visible" again. Without knowing exactly how the current Java garbage collection is implemented (actually, because there are different Java implementations out there, there are also different GCs), you can assume that the GC has to do some additional work if an object has a finalizer, because of this feature.
