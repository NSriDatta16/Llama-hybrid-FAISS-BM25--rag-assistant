how to create a new site navigation in magento

I'm just wondering if someone can show me the way of creating a new site navigation in magento, I'm really lost, I need to make a site navigation like Home, About us ,Brands and so on, it is in the header section, I know I should use block in page.xml but I just can't figure out how everything goes together. any help would be appreciated,
