We identified the following high-level best practices for GWT 1.6/1.7 (just after 3 months of research and development): Use design patterns (MVC/MVP, Command for GWT-RPC, Composite for widget composition, Observer for event bus, etc.); Isolate application logic with MVP by abstracting out widget classes and views using presenter display interface and GWT characteristic interfaces (such as HasValue, HasText, etc.); Use dependency injection with gin on a client and Guice on a server (or stick with existing server framework like Spring); Use GWT Composite in combination with HTMLPanel to drive your views with html, css and MVP; Use mock testing based on isolation of application logic with MVP; Implement Event Bus with GWT HandlerManager; Use GWT modules to effectively optimize code compilation; Use client, shared, and server packages when organizing GWT modules;
