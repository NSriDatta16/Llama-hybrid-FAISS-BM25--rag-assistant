The TeeChart that comes with Delphi has Gantt support. You can see it in the provided demo. WHere to find that demo varies with the version of Delphi you have installed. For Delphi 7 and earlier, you can find it in your ($DELPHIDIR)\Demos\TeeChart folder. In Delphi 2007/9 on WinXP, it's in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents\RAD Studio\x.0\Demos. EDIT: For D2009/2010, you can download demos from the TeeChart website .
