Linking simple products to configurable product via SOAP API V2

Does anyone know how to link a configurable product to a simple product via the API? I don't think the Product Link API does this: http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/doc/webservices-api/api/catalog_product_link#catalog_product_link.assign Seems others are having the same issue.. just trying to see if anyone here has a solution: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/75803/
