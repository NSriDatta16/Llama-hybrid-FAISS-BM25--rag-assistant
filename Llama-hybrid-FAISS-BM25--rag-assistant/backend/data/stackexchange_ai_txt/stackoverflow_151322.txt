Properties of your classes/interfaces should be exposed through interfaces because it gives your classes a contract of behavior to use, regardless of the implementation. However... In local variable declarations, it makes little sense to do this: public void someMethod() { List theList = new ArrayList(); //do stuff with the list } If its a local variable, just use the type. It is still implicitly upcastable to its appropriate interface, and your methods should hopefully accept the interface types for its arguments, but for local variables, it makes total sense to use the implementation type as a container, just in case you do need the implementation-specific functionality.
