The concept is not complicated, here's how I see it: -When the user click on the edit icon, in javascript it takes whatever html code is inside the specified "div", replace it with a text box (an html editor like tinymce would be even better) and place the existing html inside it. -When the content has been edited, it should have a submit button. On submit it should make an ajax call to a server-side function that would save the content in your database. -The last step would be to refresh the whole page or just the modified section via another ajax call. Here's a plugin for jquery that would simplify your work: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable and here's the demo (simply click on the text to edit it): http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html You could also implement a drag and drop function, so the users can place the "div" where they want. Hope it helps
