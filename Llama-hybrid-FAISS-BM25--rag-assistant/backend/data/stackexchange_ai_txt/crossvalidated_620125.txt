The standard error of a parameter estimate is just a model-based estimate of the true SD of the estimator. Often, standard errors are based on asymptotic results that may not be valid for finite samples. The process you describe is a way of checking whether the standard error is unbiased for finite samples. Specifically, we can generate a huge number of replicates (datasets) and compute the parameter estimate of interest based on each. We can then find the sample SD of these (iid) estimates, which is consistent for the true SD of the estimator (i.e., as you generate more replicates, the sample SD will approach the true SD with probability 1). So, with enough replicates, you can think of this sample SD as the true SD. Now, with each replicate, you also get a SE of the parameter estimate of interest (an estimate of the true SD of the estimator). The average of these SEs will approach the mean SE as the number of replicates grows (with probability 1). If the estimator of the true SD is unbiased, as the number of replicates grows, the average SE will equal the true SD (which will equal the sample SD described above). Essentially, this process allows us to determine whether the model-based SE is a good approximation to the true SD of the parameter estimator.
