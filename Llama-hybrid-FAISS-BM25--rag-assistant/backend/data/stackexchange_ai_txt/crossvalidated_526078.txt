Sure! First you'd have to transform your country variable into a set of "dummy" variables. In other words, one column for each country, with a zero or a one indicating whether it's that country or not. Then just run your regression on all of those dummy variables. Your average country-level satisfaction would be $$ satisfaction_c = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_c country_c $$ where $\hat\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\hat\beta_c$ is the coef for country $c$ . Note that this will return the same thing as an average of the sort implemented by the following python code: df.groupby('country')['satisfaction'].mean() It becomes different from a simple average if you want to control for other variables that might influence satisfaction.
