Drag and Drop and identify locations with java

I'm trying to do something quite simple, but I'm having a hard time finding good examples on the net to what I want specifically. I'd like to somehing very similer to what it's here: Dao It's a simple game called DAO and I just need to have a background image with 16 squares (4x4) and drag and drop the images (pieces) on each square to the others. I'm developing the interface using swing and I simply want to know a good place to find tutorials for such implementations or a simple suggestion on how to do it. Thanks in advance
