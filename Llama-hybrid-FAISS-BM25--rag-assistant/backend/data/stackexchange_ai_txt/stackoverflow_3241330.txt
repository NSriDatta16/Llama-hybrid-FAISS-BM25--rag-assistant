I agree with bta about if you want use a C++ approach you should create a class that abstract all implementation about the states. But I wont overload the +=, -= operators because you continue carrying C old school. I suggest the declaration of method to do this. You could choice between one method with a boolean flag or two for setup & clear. class Status{...}; void main(){ Status status; //first approach status.SystemOnline(true); status.BackUPOnline(false); //second approach status.SetEmergencySystem(); status.ClearSystemOnline(); } with this style you encapsulate the implementation about how to implement the storage of the information.
