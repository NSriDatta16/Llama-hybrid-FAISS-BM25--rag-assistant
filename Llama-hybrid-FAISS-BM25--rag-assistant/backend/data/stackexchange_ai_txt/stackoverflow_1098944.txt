You may want to consider using temporary tables. Or even standard tables if your data has to be shared between database connections. If you are looking for in-memory datasets for the speed they provide, you may want to look at in-memory table storages (MySQL and PostGreSQL do it, and others can be tricked into doing it by setting the table storage space on a ram-disk for instance). Short-lived tables are often overlooked, but they are actually very helpful.
