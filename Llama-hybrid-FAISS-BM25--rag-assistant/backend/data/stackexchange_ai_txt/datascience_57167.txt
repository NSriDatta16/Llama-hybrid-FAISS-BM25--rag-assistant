I had the same issue while trying to predict LTV of players installing a free-2-play game and realised after trying all the different architectures, weights, different loss functions to optimise, etc that DNNs are not the best solution for such a problem and consistently underestimate as they are just trying to fit various continuous functions. (Trying different loss functions like mean absolute error, mean squared logarithmic error, etc made it even worse) Finally I went with a RandomForest Regressor and gave more training data for the tails to ensure that my Random Forest learns better on the tails, since I knew that tails is where the problem was severe. This solution worked like a charm, of course after a bit of fine-tuning.
