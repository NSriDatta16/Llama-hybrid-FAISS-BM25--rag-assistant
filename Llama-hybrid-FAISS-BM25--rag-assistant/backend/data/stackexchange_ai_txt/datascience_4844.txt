Hardware requirements for Linux server to run R & RStudio

I want to build a home server/workstation to run my R projects. Based on what I have gathered, it should probably be Linux based. I want to buy the hardware now, but I am confused with the many available options for processors/ram/motherboards. I want to be able to use parallel processing, at least 64GB? of memory and enough storage space (~10TB?). Software wise, Ubuntu?, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, some NOSQL database, probably Hadoop. I do a lot of text/geospatial/network analytics that are resource intensive. Budget ~$3000US. My Questions: What could an ideal configuration look like? (Hardware + Software) What type of processor? Notes: No, I don't want to use a cloud solution. I know it is a vague question, but any thoughts will help, please? If it is off-topic or too vague, I will gladly delete. Cheers B
