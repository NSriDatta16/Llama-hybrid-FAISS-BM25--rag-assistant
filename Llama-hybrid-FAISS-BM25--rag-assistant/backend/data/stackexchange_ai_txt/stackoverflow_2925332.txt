clever way to conditionally split this string?

I've got a string that could be in one of two forms: prefix=key=value (which could have any characters, including '=') or key=value So I need to split it either on the first or second equals sign, based on a boolean that gets set elsewhere. I'm doing this: if ($split_on_second) { $parts = explode('=', $str, 3); $key = $parts[0] . '=' . $parts[1]; $val = $parts[2]; } else { $parts = explode('=', $str, 2); $key = $parts[0]; $val = $parts[1]; } Which should work, but feels inelegant. Got any better ideas in php? (I imagine there's a regex-ninja way to do it, but I'm not a regex-ninja.;-)
