Embedding all font glyphs in an external font.swf

I need access to a range of font glyphs for a localized flash application. I am using Myriad Pro which supports character sets such as Greek and others. Is it possible to embed all font glyphs by simply adding the font to the library and checking the option Export for Actionscript ?
