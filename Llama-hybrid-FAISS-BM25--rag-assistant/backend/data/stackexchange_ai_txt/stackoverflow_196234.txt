What you are looking for is interpolation . Roughly speaking, there are functions that vary from 0 to 1 and when scaled and translated create nice looking movement. This is quite often used in Flash and there are tons of examples: (NOTE: in Flash interpolation has picked up the name "tweening" and the most popular type of interpolation is known as "easing".) Have a look at this to get an intuitive feel for the movement types: SparkTable: Visualize Easing Equations . When applied to movement, scaling, rotation an other animations these equations can give a sense of momentum, or friction, or bouncing or elasticity. For an example when applied to animation have a look at Robert Penners easing demo . He is the author of the most popular series of animation functions (I believe Adobe's built in ones are based on his). This type of transition works equally as well on alpha's (for fade in). There is a bit of method to the usage. easeInOut start slow, speeds up and the slows down. easeOut starts fast and slows down (like friction) and easeIn starts slow and speeds up (like momentum). Depending on the feel you want you choose the appropriate one. Then you choose between Sine, Expo, Quad and so on for the strength of the effect. The others are easy to work out by their names (e.g. Bounce bounces, Back goes a little further then comes back like an elastic). Here is a link to the equations from the popular Tweener library for AS3. You should be able to rewrite these in JavaScript (or any other language) with little to no trouble.
