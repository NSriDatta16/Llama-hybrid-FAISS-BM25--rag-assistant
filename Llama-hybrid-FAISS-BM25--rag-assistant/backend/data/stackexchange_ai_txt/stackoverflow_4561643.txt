Even though both of them have comparable and bad, worst and average case complexities, there are certain points which show that selection sort is better than bubble sort. The Selection sort spends most of its time trying to find the minimum element in the "unsorted" part of the array. It clearly shows the similarity between Selection sort and Bubble sort. Bubble sort "selects" the maximum remaining elements at each stage, but wastes some effort imparting some order to "unsorted" part of the array.
