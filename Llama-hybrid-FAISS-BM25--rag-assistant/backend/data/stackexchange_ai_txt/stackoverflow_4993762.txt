Normally, running the succession of all migrations should produce your actual DB schema (if it's not the case, then you didn't use your migrations correctly*). Another way of doing is to copy over the schema.rb (created/updated when you migrate), which is used by rake db:setup and should produce an exact copy of the schema you have in production (unless, again, you didn't use migrations correctly*). Then, if you need "sample data", you can insert it using the db/seeds.rb file, which contains ruby code that can access your models, and thus create and persist new entities & so on... *: There are cases where you can't put all your database changes in migrations in a "usual" way (it is uncommon and should be avoided if possible)... These should be included in migrations however (in plain SQL execution statements), or the changes would need to be made manually on the dev DB as well... And then using a snapshot of prod. is sometimes more convenient. But again, I would discourage doing so.
