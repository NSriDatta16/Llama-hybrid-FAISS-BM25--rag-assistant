What if the trend is changed?

I want to forecast tourist arrivals using time series analysis. I expected to use monthly data from 2000-2013. But due to the civil war, the trend was changed after 2008 as in the following plot. These are the data in Comma Separated Value format containing the monthly observations by rows, respectively for each year: Year,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1980,1981,1982,1983,1984,1985,1986,1987,1988,1989,1990,1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013 Jan,9386,10915,11740,15627,17569,23114,28366,36108,45168,40932,49104,33546,28814,32890,25446,20400,12962,26592,28932,35730,42726,45402,45987,30957,32652,37224,44379,43311,44187,28296,40647,49950,38187,52103,56553,56916,38468,50757,74197,85874,110543 Feb,8343,9648,10388,15214,18064,22427,25226,33896,39384,40148,44018,32406,27012,30512,23714,19150,12344,26368,28080,38859,40116,41067,42591,29550,35010,35283,41526,43287,46575,31683,39081,43584,36645,52687,43051,40551,34169,57300,65797,83549,113968 Mar,7875,9847,11158,13431,18216,20497,25472,34416,38376,42178,44710,32628,29886,28932,22838,19430,16032,26946,27153,33399,37953,41277,40074,26442,34098,32256,41022,40110,44290,33084,40818,38418,50418,54746,35031,38049,34065,52352,75130,91102,113208 Apr,5468,6400,5890,8886,9891,11545,18847,21806,28568,29606,32556,23684,19778,19262,16238,13834,12312,22788,20541,28410,29589,28080,33756,20376,26907,25578,34443,33642,36906,27057,33714,30672,42261,49776,33039,29747,26054,38300,63835,69591,80737 May,4168,3241,5587,6097,7602,8803,13042,19468,21642,28972,32850,18224,14014,13100,8204,11124,12750,18286,17745,21024,22368,21777,24672,17655,22407,20394,25212,23404,26924,26661,30048,30162,40878,43825,26307,31140,24739,35213,48943,57506,74838 Jun,3246,3303,4787,4550,5536,7134,10674,15082,16836,25772,24350,17866,11092,9536,7650,11540,11630,18050,17394,23157,20412,21399,22416,19668,23160,22410,26184,21825,28323,26355,31836,32119,45699,44066,30810,27960,30234,44730,53636,65245,90279 Jul,5919,5404,5925,4278,9881,13252,16801,22986,28266,30942,25132,26694,18362,12330,10200,17660,15194,26410,30645,33771,32904,35370,35994,25380,30867,29529,33288,33267,28566,35742,43743,50525,56745,55354,44142,32982,42223,63339,83786,90338,107016 Aug,6680,6147,8565,3481,11129,15542,20203,27440,32788,34332,8430,27626,20138,15190,11408,18670,17220,26786,28824,40143,32796,32817,35814,24765,32034,31446,39081,34422,15717,35475,42111,48675,51216,52931,44742,30672,41207,55898,72463,79456,123269 Sep,4184,4986,5287,6707,7594,10245,14798,19962,24086,29754,10050,21764,15242,12398,10072,14980,14264,22438,24762,29838,27495,31062,30828,23211,29793,31653,33915,31035,11758,32982,36054,51525,43536,38485,37104,29529,37983,47339,60219,71111,90339 Oct,5977,6199,7622,10636,11541,14340,19376,23646,27030,30296,16410,25800,18176,12732,12146,16742,15050,23060,25173,32079,30621,33216,30603,23511,28314,31767,35112,26658,12904,36258,49922,59442,44095,38815,37011,35103,37575,52370,69563,80379,107058 Nov,7137,8338,11271,13600,17106,20759,25743,23988,29512,33748,20570,27906,23218,18114,14188,10560,18948,24596,28272,35967,35103,33306,28365,24921,31995,38421,41952,32469,17344,37395,54946,64971,48457,37591,45102,36901,44311,72251,90889,109202,109420 Dec,9505,10583,14984,16464,19536,24934,31616,37982,39086,40550,29350,29590,31724,25110,20516,8572,26026,35568,40182,41292,40167,42738,32001,35829,38928,45102,40326,36984,23300,42183,57722,66159,51171,39224,61116,48925,56862,84627,97517,122252,153918 Should I use data ONLY from 2009-2013? According to this book "A good model will allow for changing trend and changing seasonal patterns." So is there a really problem in using data from 2000-2013? I'd be grateful if anyone can help me in this problem Thank you
