I still want to know the advantages... and disadvantages. Is it faster - or simpler to read? If you have a view that needs to render all the info isn't it simpler to eager fetch everything to display in a single DB Get instead of multiple lazy chatty connections? In one view wouldn't the user want to see the "organization summary" which includes all associated "Environments" and "Machines". The counts of the potentially nested items if nothing else. (Not the Environment and Machine details - these merit different views) There seems to be a leaning towards building views to serve a single responsibility (View Machine (only shows machine info) -> View Machine Detail (only shows Machine Detail) ) It would be simple enough to make this happen but there comes a time when the views are not feature rich as there is simply too little information.
