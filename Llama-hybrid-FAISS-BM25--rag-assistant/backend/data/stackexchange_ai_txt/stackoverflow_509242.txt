Well, since a programmer's primary tool is his computer, I think it's fair to assume some expertise with it. Most of those sorts of things you've described are difficult for someone unfamiliar with computers, but pretty easy (even with little prior experience) for someone who understands the domain and knows how to find and read documentation. In a big, well-organized business or project, I'd expect someone who was more specifically familiar with those sort of administrative things to take care of them. However, if there's not enough of them to warrant a full-time job, then I don't think it's unreasonable to have anyone competent work on it; and programmers are probably at the head of the queue in that regard.
