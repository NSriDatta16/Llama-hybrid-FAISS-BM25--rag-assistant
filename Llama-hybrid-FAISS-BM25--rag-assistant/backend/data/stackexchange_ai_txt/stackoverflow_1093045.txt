I would say the "best practice" is to test something of significance with the object that is different now that it stored the entity in the list. In other words, what behavior is different about the class now that it stored it, and test for that behavior. The storage is an implementation detail. That being said, it isn't always possible to do that. You can use reflection if you must.
