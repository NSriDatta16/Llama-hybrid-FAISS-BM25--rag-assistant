Is the size of the output vector of all machine learning algorithms the same? No, the output vector depends on the architecture that you define, which should itself be dependent on the data that you have. Can't an ML algorithm predict only one value as output? Absolutely it can. Think for instance of regression problems. I cannot think of any algorithms that don't allow you to have an arbitrary sized output vector. Given the LSTM is many-to-one type how does it produce two values as output(x,y)? I don't think you are using "many-to-one" correctly in this case. It seems that you have a single input which happens to be a time-series and you want to predict a vector containing two values, so it is in fact a "one-to-one" problem. A network can produce as many outputs as you want. It all depends on the architecture. Could an MLP also do that? Yes, absolutely. RNNs are essentially a specific way to use MLPs to achieve a specific purpose (in this case, use the positional information). SO anything an LSTM can do could be replicated using MLPs.
