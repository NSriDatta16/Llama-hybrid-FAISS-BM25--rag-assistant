You might consider using Lua (or another scripting language). You get a nice data structure syntax (roughly on par with JSON), with the full power of a programming language. Thus you have variables (you can build up your data structures piece by piece, symbolically declare recurring values, etc.), loops (test data is often repetitive), functions (think of them as macros for boilerplate constructs in your data). Lua is a particularly attractive candidate for this sort of use because it's small (adds 100-200K to your program) and has a pretty elegant interface to and from C code.
