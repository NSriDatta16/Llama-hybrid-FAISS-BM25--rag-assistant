It looks like you are just appending the new div at the end of the current paragraph. Instead I think you want to traverse up the DOM and find the li that is it's parent, then insert/append below here. Using jQuery $('.comment-reply-link').click(function() { var parent = $(this).closest('li'); // Find the nearest li (parent) parent.append(addComment.moveForm("comment-reply-25", "25", "respond", "383")); Something like that to get your started.
