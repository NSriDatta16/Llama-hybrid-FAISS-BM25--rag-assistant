Yes. Many frameworks are moving in this direction, and most consumer sites (Facebook, Twitter) load most of the content after the main page is loaded. Provided your users have JS enabled browsers, the AJAX load improves user experience by providing a faster response time and a more dynamic interface for the content which is likely to change. If done correctly, it will actually improve the maintainability of your application by carrying data organization and presentation methodologies through your front-end. If you want to dive all the way in there are good JS frameworks that incorporate this philosophy into your design, Sproutcore and Backbone are both worth looking into. Edit I'm building web applications now, so I read questions with that slant. If, as people have pointed out, you're just building brochureware webpages then you won't see a real benefit from AJAX content loads and will hurt your SEO.
