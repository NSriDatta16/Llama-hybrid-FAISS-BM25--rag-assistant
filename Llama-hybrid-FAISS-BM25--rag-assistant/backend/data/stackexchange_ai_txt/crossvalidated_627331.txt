SVM kernels corresponding to different types of distance measures

This answer to Data normalization for RBF kernel points out that RBF kernel implies Eucledean distance. Are there kernels corresponding to other popular distance/dissimilarity measures, such as Bray-Curtis or Jensen-Shannon? Or could they be easily designed? What are the constraints to take into account (e.g., does Bray-Curtis pose a problem because of its non-analiticity?) Related: About Gaussian kernel for distances other than Euclidian
