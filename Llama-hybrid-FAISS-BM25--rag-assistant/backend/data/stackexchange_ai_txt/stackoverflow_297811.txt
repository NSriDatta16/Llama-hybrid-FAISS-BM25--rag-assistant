I figured out a "better" way of formatting the output. As usual, I was trying to nuke it out when a more elegant method will do. for key, value in sorted(self.dict.items()): self.current_list.WriteText(key + " " + str(self.dict[key]) + "\n") This way also sorts the dictionary alphabetically, which is a big help when identifying items that have already been selected or used.
