Try using a "Range" request header: // Open connection to URL. HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); // Specify what portion of file to download. connection.setRequestProperty("Range", "bytes=" + downloaded + "-"); // here "downloaded" is the data length already previously downloaded. // Connect to server. connection.connect(); Having done that, you can seek at a given point (just before the length of your download data, say X ) and start writing the newly downloaded data there. Be sure to use the same value X for the range header. Details about 14.35.2 Range Retrieval Requests More details and source code can be found here
