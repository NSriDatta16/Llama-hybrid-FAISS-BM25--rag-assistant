connection between residual variance and explained variance PCA

The publication introducing Isomap compares PCA and Isomap by means of $$\text{residual variance} = 1 - R^2(\hat D_M, D_y)$$ where $R$ is the standard linear correlation coefficient over all entries of $\hat D_M$ and $D_Y$. $\hat D_M$ is the euclidean distance matrix for PCA and the geodesic distance matrix for Isomap. $D_Y$ is the euclidean distance matrix of the low dimensional embedding, this matrix changes with the number of dimensions you use for the embedding. Doing some testing reveals that "residual variance" is numerically different from $$ 1 - \text{explained variance}$$ derived from the eigenvalue spectrum. Is there a link between "residual variance" and "explained variance" for PCA and possibly Isomap?
