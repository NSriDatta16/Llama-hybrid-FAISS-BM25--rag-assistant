Setting Maven Java compiler debug to false does not remove line number table?

Perhaps this is my lack of understanding, but I would have assumed that doing this in a Maven Java project would disable all debug info from going into the Class file: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin false However, I just tested it and while the local variable table is gone, and the source file reference is gone, the line number table is still present. I did a javap -l MyClass and still got things like: protected com.mycorp.myapp.randomMethod(); LineNumberTable: line 197: 0 line 68: 4 line 69: 9 line 70: 14 line 198: 19 Clearly, the stuff is still in there....I think.
