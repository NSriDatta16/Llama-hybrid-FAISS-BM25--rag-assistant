There is more information here: Droid Incredible storage mount points . It seems that Droid Incredible mounts its internal storage to /emmc, supposedly mounted r/w. It is not yet verified whether the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary in order to gain r/w access - I'm trying to get this information from Google Code I will probably solve this by allowing the user two options to store the data: SD-Card Droid Incredible-only Internal storage Edit: It seems that the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is sufficient: according to droidForums both /sdcard and /emmc has the same GID of 1015. Edit2: According to Google Group Thread the Incredible returns /sdcard as the result value of Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() . Therefore, the user needs to decide whether he wants to use /sdcard or /emmc. The auto-detection of Incredible may be based on existence of the /emmc path.
