How would one represent scheduled events in an RDBMS?

I have to store scheduled events, (like say class times, for example) that can be organized on a weekly, daily or monthly basis. Events can occur, say, every Monday and Wednesday, or every second Thursday of the month. Is there a way to store this information in an RDBMS that adheres to 3NF? EDIT: This is not homework; I'm building something with a friend for our own edification and we want it in 3NF. To be specific, I'm trying to store the schedules for mass and confession times at RC parishes. These can be scheduled in a hell of a lot of ways, such as every Sunday at x time or every Tue/Thu at a different time. Sometimes it's only the third Friday of the month,and others are only offered at a certain time once a year. I need to not only store this information, but query it, so that I can quickly get a comprehensive list of available times in the next day or week or whatever. I suppose that strictly speaking 3NF isn't a requirement, but it would be easier for us if it were and it's better to get it correct off the bat than to change our schema later.
