Sports prediction using machine learning

I am trying to predict soccer scores using past results. The dataset I have only consists of the home team , the away team , goals scored by the home team and goals scored by the away team in each match. How can I use the limited data on my dataset to model this using a random forest algorithm and the naive bayes algorithm?
