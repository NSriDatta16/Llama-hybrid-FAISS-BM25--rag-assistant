It sounds like you need a priority queue with efficient increase and decrease key operations. You might be better of creating you own your own priority queue implementation. The priority_queue container is great for dynamic sets. But since the number of terminal in an airport are pretty much fixed you can a fixed size container with the heap family of algorithms. As the internal storage, you could use any container that provides random access iterators (vector, array, deque). Then, use make_heap(), sort_heap() family of functions to heapify the array. Now you can cheaply access the top(), modify the priority of a random member in the heap and iterate through all elements easily. For an example see: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/make_heap/
