PyBrain so slow

When I train a simple neural net using all the defaults it takes very long (I have played around with changing some of the defaults to little success). Are there any tricks I am missing with PyBrain, or implementation of neural networks in general? My dataset has has 100,000 observations, with one feature (covariate) and a binomial response ([0,1]). example code: net = buildNetwork(1, 1, 1, bias = True) ds_train = SupervisedDataSet(1, 1) ds_train.addSample(x,y) trainer = BackpropTrainer(net, ds_train) trainer.train() I was actually using this as a test case for the larger regression I am looking to do which will have 20 features. Right now it seems that pybrain is too slow and I'm currently looking into Theano, is this a good idea?
