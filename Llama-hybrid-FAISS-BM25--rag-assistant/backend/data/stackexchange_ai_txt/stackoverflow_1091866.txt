The filter attribute is useless if you're trying to do a an exclusion. Case in point: Just yesterday I wanted to use cfdirectory to grab all the subdirectories but EXLCUDE any directory that started with a period "." so that I could exclude things like ".svn" and ".git". Needless to say I searched all over the place and couldn't find an answer. In the end I ended up just using some conditional logic in my loop: Which got the job done. Of course I could of used a QoQ, but to me adding all that overhead to filter out directories that began with a period seemed silly. Bottom line is that, yes, we're screwed when it comes to exclusion filtering with cfdirectory, but there's no reason you can't use your imagination and a little bit of code to get the results that you want.
