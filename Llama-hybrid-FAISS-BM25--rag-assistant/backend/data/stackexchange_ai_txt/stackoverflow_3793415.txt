Any modern database, including MySQL, will handle queries on a properly indexed table in reasonable time with several tens of millions of rows in it. That's what they're for . My usual rule of thumb is that for any table up to 10,000 rows and straightforward queries you don't even need to think too hard about data access paths or anything else. In the 10,000 to 1 million row range I would be giving it significant attention to ensure the table was properly indexed, and beyond a million row then more advance management techniques may be required to keep performance acceptable (although for a simple log table this would be less of an issue).
