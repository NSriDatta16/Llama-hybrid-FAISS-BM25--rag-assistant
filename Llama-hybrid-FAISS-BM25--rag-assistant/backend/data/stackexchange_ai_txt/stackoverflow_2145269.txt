Avoid this if at all possible as it violates the rules of database normalization and makes it difficult to index such values. Your values could be kept in a separate look-up table or similar. If you really have no choice but to live with this design, then you can query the values like this: select * from mytable where concat(',', multivals, ',') like '%,5,%' which will most likely kill performance for anything other than trivial amounts of data, or write a function that splits the row (based on your delimiter ",") and checks the resulting array, or use fulltext indexing. EDIT : the find_in_set operator is much more elegant than using like , although I've no idea as to how it is implemented under the covers.
