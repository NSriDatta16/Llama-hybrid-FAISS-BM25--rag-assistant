As this appears to be a "I need a prepackaged version of FOP and I essentially never want to hear a bug report" as opposed to "We need FOP as part of another product which will have developer attention for quite long and it is essential that this works properly", I will strongly advise you to go the mainstream way and create a traditional bytecode based package which requires the Sun JVM to run. You will most likely find the "executable jar" concept interesting as it allows you to boil down the startup script to "java -jar .../myfop.jar". The Eclipse "Export" function names this as a "runnable jar". EDIT: After reading the various comments, I understand that what you actually want is a DocBook authoring environment. I believe the shortest amount of developer time spent to get there, would be writing the glue needed for the XML tools in Eclipse to talk to FOP, i.e. an Eclipse plugin.
