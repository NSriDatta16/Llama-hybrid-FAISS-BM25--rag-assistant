Using a uniqueidentifier field means that for every user you store 16 bytes for each user. If it were an integer that would be 4 bytes. When it comes to millions of records, this impacts on storage and amount of required IO (disk and network), both for the field itself and any index defined on it and any foreign keys referencing it. In terms of how they perform internally in SQL Server (joins, indexing and foreign keys), it will not impact performance. In short, yes, it can have an impact on performance.
