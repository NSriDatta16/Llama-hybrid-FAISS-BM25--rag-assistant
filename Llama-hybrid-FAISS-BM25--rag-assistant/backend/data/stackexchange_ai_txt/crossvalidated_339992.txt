I've actually written two papers on zombie epidemiology, so this is a question near and dear to my heart. One suggestion I have is to use a dynamic model to estimate this, rather than just a time series (this is the technique used by the Smith? (the question mark is part of his name) paper). There's a good site for tinkering with some of the parameters you've suggested that's the result of a paper I worked on: https://www.cartwrig.ht/apps/whitezed/
