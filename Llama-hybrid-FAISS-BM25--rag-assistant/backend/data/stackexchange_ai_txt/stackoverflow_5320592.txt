Value is in enum list

I have a fairly basic question: How can I check if a given value is contained in a list of enum values? For example, I have this enum: public enum UserStatus { Unverified, Active, Removed, Suspended, Banned } Now I want to check if status in (Unverified, Active) I know this works: bool ok = status == UserStatus.Unverified || status == UserStatus.Active; But there has to be a more elegant way to write this. The topic of this question is very similar, but that's dealing with flags enums, and this is not a flags enum.
