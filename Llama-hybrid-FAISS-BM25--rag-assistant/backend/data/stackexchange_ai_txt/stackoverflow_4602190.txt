Suggestion for best standard API protocol to be used in web services in a javaEE server?

We have not used Webservices yet(in fact we are new to JavaEE infrastructure), I am looking at JAX-WS as the webservice format, but I am not sure if there are still newly emerge better solutions out there that we may try instead. We can choose which standards we wanted to use, and clients that will be using the webservices will in a way also used that standard. Any idea is very much appreciated.
