Can't see or add Website Data Sources in RDLC report in ASP.NET MVC

In the RDLC report, in Design view in Visual Studio 2008, we don't see anything in the Website Data Sources tab and the button to Add New Data Source is grayed out. Only the Refresh button is enabled, and clicking it doesn't do anything. Our business logic layer returns Lists of business objects and the business logic and business object projects are both referenced by the MVC project. This is an MVC app, so there is no App_Code folder. How do we get our business objects to appear in the Website Data Sources list so we can drag and drop fields from the object onto our RDLC report?
