Fisher had his own interpretation, called Fiducial probability. There is a school of Likelihood theorists, who try do something similar to Bayesian but don't use priors. They just compute and report the likelihood function. (Misguided in my view.) Apart from probability there are some approaches to uncertainty (all wrong-headed in my view) that are used in computer science. Possibility theory, Dempster-Shafer theory, rough sets, Desert-Smaradanche theory.
