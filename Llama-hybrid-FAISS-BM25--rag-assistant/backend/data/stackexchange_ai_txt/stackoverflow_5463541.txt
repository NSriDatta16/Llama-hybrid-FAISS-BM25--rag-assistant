Moving the point downwards in a floating point number

First off all, thanks for the attention, I'm new to this site ^^ so excuse me if I do something wrong... I have a huge problem with my Python code... I'm new to programming, and I'm new to Python as well. I need to take a floating point number and move the point right so it becomes an integer, like taking 60.27 and getting 6027. The algorithm that I'm using is recursively multiplying num*10 until num%2==0 , then getting the int(num) . The problem is, when I multiply (for example) 602.47*10 it returns 6024.700000000001 and it obviously doesn't work :-) Is there any way to fix it, or any other technique or other way to do this recursively?? I'm allowed to use anything I need, but its got to be recursive: no for or while ... Thanks for the help!! My first language is not english, so I beg your pardon if it's hard to read...
