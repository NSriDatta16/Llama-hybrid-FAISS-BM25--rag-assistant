As @forecaster notes : sure you can. Just separate your data by customer. However, you will need to consider a couple of things. For instance, you only have sales acts, no zeros, so you will need to think about how to fill in zeros. From when till when? Are there periods where zero filling makes no sense, because the product was not even available? And: are you interested in a daily, weekly or other time granularity? No matter how you decide these questions, your time series will likely be very intermittent, i.e., contain many zeros. ARIMA (as your question is tagged) is not appropriate for that. One well-established forecasting technique for intermittent demands is Croston's method ( croston() in the forecast package). Here is a brand new article discussing an alternative that also models obsolescence (which makes sense for your data: this would be customers that won't return) and gives further pointers to the literature. Most time series forecasting methods, like Croston's, will give you either average demands (e.g., 0.1 if someone buys one unit every 10 time buckets), the usefulness of which is a bit dubious. Or it gives you the demand size conditional on demand being nonzero . You will need to think about what exactly you need. And actually, depending on what you actually want to use the forecast for, it may turn out that you don't really want separate forecasts per customer, but a total forecast aggregated over all customers. For instance, you will likely capture seasonality far better on aggregate data (Croston's and other intermittent demand methods don't model seasonality at all).
