You need to store the first run time of the program in order to do this. How I'd probably do it is using the built in application settings in visual studio. Make one called InstallDate which is a User Setting and defaults to DateTime.MinValue or something like that (e.g. 1/1/1900). Then when the program is run the check is simple: if (appmode == "trial") { // If the FirstRunDate is MinValue, it's the first run, so set this value up if (Properties.Settings.Default.FirstRunDate == DateTime.MinValue) { Properties.Settings.Default.FirstRunDate = DateTime.Now; Properties.Settings.Default.Save(); } // Now check whether 30 days have passed since the first run date if (Properties.Settings.Default.FirstRunDate.AddMonths(1) User settings are stored in a pretty weird location (something like C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Local Settings\Application Data) so it will be pretty hard for average joe to find it anyway. If you want to be paranoid, just encrypt the date before saving it to settings. EDIT: Sigh, misread the question, not as complex as I thought >.>
