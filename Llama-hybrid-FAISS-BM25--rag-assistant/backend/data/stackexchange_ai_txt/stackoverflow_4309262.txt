It sounds like you should be using the SQLite database to store the values you pull out from the JSON. This should help you get started: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db All of your activities within your application can then query the database for the data. If you are using a ListView to view the information, you would be able to use a CursorAdapter to easily populate the list. You could even create a Content Provider to share this information with other applications
