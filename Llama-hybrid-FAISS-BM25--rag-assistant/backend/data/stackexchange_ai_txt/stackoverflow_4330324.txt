Can required WCF4 DataMemeber's be organized into required groups?

Is there a way to have required DataMember's within a DataContract to be organized into groups so that you really only require group one or group two but no both to be provided? I am looking to see if there is functionality similar to Workflow Activity validation where you can flag InArgument's with a RequiredArgument and then use OverloadGroup attribute to put these into groups so that only the arguments in one of the specified groups are required.
