Designing a website that will later interact with mobile apps

I have very little technical knowledge and I'm organizing the launch of a new website. Later down the line, we'll launch apps for the iPhone, Android and Blackberry. So I'm wondering if the website should be designed in a certain way to take account of our future plans for mobile apps. The apps will push information to the website and pull information from the website as well.
