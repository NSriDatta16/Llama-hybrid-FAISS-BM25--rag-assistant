What are features in the context of reinforcement learning?

In machine learning, "feature" is a synonym for explanatory variables . I know what a feature is. However, in the specific case of RL, it's not clear to me what features are. What are "features" in the specific case of RL? What are examples of features in RL? Which RL algorithms require the specification of features? Why do we need "features" in RL?
