Not really an expert but this question has been unanswered for a while, so I will try an answer: I can think of 3 differences between GLMs and Time series models a l√† Box and Jenkins: 1) GLMs are rather to model variable Y as function of some other variable X (Y = f(X) ). In the time series models you are (mostly?) modeling variable Y as function of itself, but from previous time steps ( Y(t) = f(Y(t-1), Y(t-2),...) ); 2) Related to the previous point: GLMs do not consider per se autocorrelation of the input covariate, while the time series models like ARIMA are auto-correlative in nature; 3) I think the auto-regressive models base on the assumption that residuals are normal with zero mean, whereas GLMs accept more complex data structure of the response variable, possibly having a non-normal distribution (Gamma, Poisson, etc). Are there any rules when to use GLM and when to use Time Series? Unless you are considering in your model time as a random effect, I think GLMs are simply the wrong approach to model time series.
