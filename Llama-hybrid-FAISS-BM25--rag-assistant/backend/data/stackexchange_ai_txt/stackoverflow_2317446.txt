Error in plotting SVM classification graph

I'm using the support vector machine from the e1071 package to classify my data and want to visualize how the machine actually does the classification. However, when using the plot.svm function, I get an error that I can't resolve. Script: library("e1071") data Output: plot(model,data,fill=TRUE, grid=200, svSymbol=4, dataSymbol=1, color.palette=terrain.colors) Error in rect(0, levels[-length(levels)], 1, levels[-1L], col = col) : cannot mix zero-length and non-zero-length coordinates Traceback: traceback() 4: rect(0, levels[-length(levels)], 1, levels[-1L], col = col) 3: filled.contour(xr, yr, matrix(as.numeric(preds), nr = length(xr), byrow = TRUE), plot.axes = { axis(1) axis(2) colind Part of my (4488 lines long) data file: -1 0 23.532 +1 1 61.1157 +1 1 61.1157 +1 1 61.1157 -1 1 179.03 -1 0 17.0865 -1 0 27.6201 -1 0 17.0865 -1 0 27.6201 -1 1 89.6398 -1 0 42.7418 -1 1 89.6398 Since I`m just starting with R, I have no idea what this means and how I should deal with it, nor did I find anything useful in other places.
