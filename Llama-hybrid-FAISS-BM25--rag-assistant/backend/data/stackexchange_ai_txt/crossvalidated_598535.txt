The coefficient on such an indicator variable indicates the difference in mean outcome between 0 and 1 values when other predictors are held constant. Outcomes are on average 0.184 lower when public rather than private or 0.184 higher other way round. (I would say here indicator or binary rather than binomial, but there are many competing terms for (0, 1) variables. Economists in particular seem compelled to use the ugly term "dummy variable", all too often misunderstood within social science as disparaging.)
