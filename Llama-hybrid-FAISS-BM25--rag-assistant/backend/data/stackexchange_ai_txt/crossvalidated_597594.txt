Is it possible to regularize a covariance matrix?

I have many "parallel" time-series (about 100). They have relatively short history. I calculate a covariance matrix between these time-series. Now, I believe that the observed covariance matrix is very inaccurate / noisy. For example some time-series might look to be very correlated just because of noise / chance / coincidence. My question is if there is a method for smoothing / regularization (in machine learning sense) of the covariance matrix.
