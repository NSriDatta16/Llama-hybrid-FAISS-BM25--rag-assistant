How can I encode a stream so that it can be stored in an xml file?

I am working with QuantumGrid 6 from Devexpress. I need to store the grids settings in an xml configuration file. Unfortunately, the grid does not allow XML as a storage option. I can however export the settings to a stream. I'm thinking to export to a stream then convert the stream to text and store it as an xml value. I guess the text must only contain printable characters and it would be nice if it was compressed in some way. Can somebody suggest a method of encoding the stream?
