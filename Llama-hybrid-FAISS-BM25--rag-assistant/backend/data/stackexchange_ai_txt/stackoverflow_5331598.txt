A priority queue has a lot of extra code associated with it to ensure that the items within the priority queue are ordered by priority. An array list has none of that code, so you can't just cast it into a priority queue. Generally things can be upcast safely, but you're trying to downcast something here. You can't do it, as there's no assurance that the array list is ordered with any kind of priority. Nor are the underlying data structures implementing the two internally guaranteed to be the same.
