if $y = F(\beta x) $ and $y\: \epsilon\: (1,0) $ where $F(x) $ is a logit function then $dy/dx_1 \neq dy/dx_2 $. This is because of the chain rule as $dy/dx = \frac{dy}{dF(x)}\frac{ dF(x)}{dx} $. If you look at a logit function You will see that the slope of x changes depending on where you are on the curve. In practice this means that you only interpret rank and sign in a logistic regression as the magnitude of the impact will depend on how you parameters and variables interact with the logit function
