What I believe to be the best combination is: map-reduce implementation like apache hadoop or gridgain or JPPF (for processing large datasets) + jdmp for data mining + NoSQL db for query and retrieval (neo4j or bigtable etc). It is still not clear on what is the exact use case ;-) Also look this link for more detaiLs: Do you know batch log processing tools for hadoop (zohmg alternatives)?
