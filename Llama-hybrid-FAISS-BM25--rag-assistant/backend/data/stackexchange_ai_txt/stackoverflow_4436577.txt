As Brian said , the error message points at str::string being initialized with NULL , which is forbidden. However, your code looks like written by someone who comes from Java or C# and is used to mindlessly new everything. In C++, however, automatic storage is preferred. If you change your code to this struct HookAct { enum { PRINT } hkAct; vector params; HookAct() : hAct(HookAct::PRINT), params() {} }; no manual dynamic memory managing is necessary anymore: HookAct hookAct;
