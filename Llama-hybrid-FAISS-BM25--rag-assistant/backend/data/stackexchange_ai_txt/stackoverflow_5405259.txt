Client/server message-based architectures over the internet

The Problem I've been thinking for some time now about the intricacies of message-based architectures when one of the channels for messages to pass along includes the internet. I'm fine with the concept of queuing messages up on clients that, when processed, result in web-service calls over the internet that then queue those same messages on the server to be processed against business rules. What I don't currently know of is a mechanism of sending messages back to the client to tell it that something happened. The Example Consider for this example a desktop warehouse management application that wishes to receive messages from a server, rather than polling to see if there are any. E.g. User creates urgent order on website with tight SLA for picking within a few minutes, because someone is already on their way to collect the item. OrderCreated message is published on the server. Magic happens to send the OrderCreated message to the client software running on a PC in a warehouse. The client software displays the new order on the screen (and perhaps caches to disk in case of restarts etc). Warehouse team pick the items to fulfill the order. It's point 3 above that I'm looking for technologies to fill the gap. Some Possible Solutions Polling the server regularly and often (sub-minute) to see if there are messages, and download them to a local queue for processing. Use something like two-way comms in WCF, though this requires channels/sockets/ports etc are kept permanently open between clients and server, so it won't scale elegantly. Actually open up ports and configure port forwarding and firewalls etc in local sites to enable MSMQ (or some other tech like WCF, which could mean hosting IIS or similar on client hardware) to push messages to clients. Of course the deployment and support costs here are astronomical. Does anyone have any experience of achieving this with a solution I've not listed here? I'm not looking for details necessarily, I'm just poking around in this space to see how it might be done. Many thanks in advance.
