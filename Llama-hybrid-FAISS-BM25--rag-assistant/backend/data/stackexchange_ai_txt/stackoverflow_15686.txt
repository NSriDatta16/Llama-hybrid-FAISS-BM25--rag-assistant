Network shares. Of course, then you have killer lag on the network, but at least there's only one copy of your files. You don't want to hear what I did when I was developing on both platforms. But you're going to: drag-n-drop copy a few times a day. Local build and run, and periodically checking it out on Unix to make sure gcc was happy and that the unit tests were happy on that platform too. Not really a rapid turnaround cycle there.
