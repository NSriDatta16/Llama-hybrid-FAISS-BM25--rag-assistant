Why f beta score define beta like that?

This is the F beta score: $$F_\beta = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{(\beta^2 \cdot \mathrm{precision}) + \mathrm{recall}}$$ The Wikipedia article states that $F_\beta$ "measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches β times as much importance to recall as precision" . I did not get the idea. Why define $\beta$ like that? Can I define $F_\beta$ like this: $$F_\beta = (1 + \beta) \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{(\beta \cdot \mathrm{precision}) + \mathrm{recall}}$$ And how to show β times as much importance ?
