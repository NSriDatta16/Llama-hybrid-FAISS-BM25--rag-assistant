robots.txt and Mod Rewrite in .htaccess

In the robots.txt file, I am about to disallow some sections of my site. For instance, I don't want my "terms and conditions" to be indexed by search engines. User-agent: * Disallow: /terms The real path to the file is actually /data/terms_and_conditions.html But I have used .htaccess to rewrite the URL. Now to my Q, should I specify the rewritten url in the robots.txt or the actual url? Follow-up question: Do I need to have an "allow" line too, or will the search engines assume all other is allowed which isn't in the robots.txt file? Thanks
