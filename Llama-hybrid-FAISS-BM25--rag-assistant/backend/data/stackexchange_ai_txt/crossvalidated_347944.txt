What is meant by: neighbor identities are preserved in t-SNE?

From the article on Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (by Geoffrey Hinton and Sam Roweis): Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) tries to place the objects in a low-dimensional space so as to optimally preserve neighborhood identity and can be naturally extended to allow multiple different low-d images of each object. What is actually meant by this? and how can it be seen in practice? Why don't other algorithms like Isomap preserve nighborhood identity?
