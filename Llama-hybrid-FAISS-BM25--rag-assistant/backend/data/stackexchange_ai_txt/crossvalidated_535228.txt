Why does the exponential moving average equation divide with 1+(1-⍺)+...?

I am trying to understand an exponential moving average, reading its Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Weighted_moving_average In the middle of the explanation, the page says, "since 1/⍺ = 1 + (1-⍺) + ..." but why is ⍺ equal to it?
