How to find Title case phrases from a passage or bunch of paragraphs

How do I parse sentence case phrases from a passage. For example from this passage Conan Doyle said that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations.[1] Michael Harrison argued in a 1971 article in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine that the character was inspired by Wendell Scherer, a "consulting detective" in a murder case that allegedly received a great deal of newspaper attention in England in 1882. We need to generate stuff like Conan Doyle, Holmes, Dr Joseph Bell, Wendell Scherr etc. I would prefer a Pythonic Solution if possible
