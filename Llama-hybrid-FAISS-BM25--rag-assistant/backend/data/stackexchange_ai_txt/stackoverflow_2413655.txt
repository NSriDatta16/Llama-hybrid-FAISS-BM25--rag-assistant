database independent Silverlight application - possible?

I am developing my application in Silverlight with MVVM pattern support. Now I use Sql server 2008, but I am start thinking about in future use also Oracle and XML as storage for my data. I query with linq to sql. It is pattern which I can use to completely automated and independent from database my application? Where I will only replace few parameters (for example in web.config) to change database, and I write code as little as possible in code behind... Maybe it's chance to connect and implement it in MVVM pattern ? What do You think ? I work out that in some db i will force to write queries in other ways(which will double or even triple code), cause db have other data types..so it's good idea to create so much independent app?
