Model training Using log-loss is a good idea because it is a proper scoring rule. Stratified cross validation also sounds like a good idea, but with so few samples (only about 2,500 in the 500,000) I wonder if stratified cross validation is a good idea or not since you'd basically be testing against a lot of the same observations. Right or not, I certainly find this a justifiable approach. Hyperparameter Optimiztion Brier score is preferable to AUC since Brier score is a proper scoring rule. AUC can be insensitive to model improvements. That is to say, your model could improve in so far as the probabilities are more extreme in the right direction, and yet the AUC may fail to detect these. See Frank Harrell's blog post on the topic re: AUC and its usefulness for model selection. Frank writes... And there are various ways we may be misled by this measure ( Cook, 2007; Lobo, 2007). As the ROC curve does not use the estimated probabilities themselves, only ranks, it may be insensitive to absolute differences in predicted probabilities. Hence, a well discriminating model can have poor calibration. And perfect calibration is possible with poor discrimination when the range of predicted probabilities is small (as with a homogeneous population case-mix), as discrimination is sensitive to the variance in the predictor variables. Over-fitted models can show both poor discrimination and calibration when validated in new patients. Inferential tests for comparing AUROC are problematic ( Seshan, 2013), and other disadvantages with the AUROC are noted ( Halligan, 2015). For various reasons, the AUROC and the c-index or c-statistic are problematic and of limited value for comparing among tests or models, though unfortunately, still widely used for such. In short, pick a proper scoring rule and check calibration of the risk estimates rather than optimizing AUC. Resampling/weighing If your focus is on good probabilities, DO NOT RESAMPLE THE DATA . This will bias the risk estimates. See my answer here for why.
