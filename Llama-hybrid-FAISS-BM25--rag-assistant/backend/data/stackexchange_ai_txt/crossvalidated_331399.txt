Identifying two distributions from a circular scan and then finding their centre points

I’ve got three clusters of points. These are 315 readings taken from a circular scan, i.e. the reading at x = 315 is actually next to x =0. There are two clusters in the data - zero and non-zero (but the readings have an element of noise (gaussian). I’ve plotted a moving average to be able to visualise this. I’m trying to return the mid point (in terms of x) of the non-zero group (i.e. approx x = 190). I tried k-means clustering, with the intent of taking the centre point of the non-zero cluster, this gives 195 but is affected by outliers. This seems a bit of a hack. Grateful for any ideas on better ways of doing this. I originally asked the question here orig stack question , but it was suggested that this community may be more appropriate.
