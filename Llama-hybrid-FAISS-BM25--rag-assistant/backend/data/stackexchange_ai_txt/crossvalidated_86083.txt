Variable with high number of categories

I would like some help with my analysis. I have an outcome variable that represents average number of errors somebody experiences per hour. It has about 26% zeros. 85% of values are smaller than 1. There are some outliers going up to >700. My explanatory variables are only categorical variables. One has 3 categories, one has 2 categories, one has six categories and one has 91 categories (area within a country). My question is whether anyone has some tips analyzing this dataset. I want to know the effects of the variables and potential interaction effects on the outcome. I would like to know as well if there are some locations that experience significantly high numbers of errors. Can anybody help me going in the right direction? I am just starting in statistics.
