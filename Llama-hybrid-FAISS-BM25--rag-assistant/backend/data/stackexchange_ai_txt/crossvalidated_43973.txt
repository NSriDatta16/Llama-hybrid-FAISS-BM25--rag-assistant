You could generate a vector of means from a normal distribution (or t if you prefer) representing your uncertainty in the mean, then generate a vector of variances from a $\chi^2$ distribution representing your uncertainty in the variance, then generate the actual observations from a normal with your vector of means and the vector of variances as the parameters. This will take into account the extra levels of uncertainty that you mention. If you have some feel for where you think the mean and/or variance should be (but don't know exactly) then you may want to try a Bayesian approach where you can use that prior information.
