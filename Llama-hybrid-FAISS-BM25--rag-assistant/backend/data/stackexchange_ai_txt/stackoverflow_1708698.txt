JavaScript IE appendChild() - Unexpected call to method or property access

I have been having this problem in IE. I have two divs which I use to drag selected elements from one to another. Lets say I have a child element (also a div) in div1 and some child elements in div2. I call the div2.appendChild() method on child element of div1. It removes the child from div1 and appends it to div2. If I then try to append the child back to div1 I get the following exception "Unexpected call to method or property access" in IE. It is working perfectly in firefox. See below code snippet for the javascript. function moveSelectedGroupBoxItems(toLocation, grp){ document.body.className = 'groupBoxDefaultCursor'; if(groupBoxfromLocation != toLocation){ if(grp == groupBoxGroup){ var fromVal = document.getElementById(groupBoxfromLocation); var toVal = document.getElementById(toLocation); var children = fromVal.childNodes; for (var i = children.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { if(children[i].className == 'groupBoxItemSelected'){ children[i].childNodes[0].name=toLocation; toVal.appendChild(children[i]); } } } } groupBoxfromLocation = ''; groupBoxGroup = ''; return false; } This basically moves the selected child divs from one parent div to another on dragging.
