Java database question homework problem

I have to write a Java program that creates a Car table with car manufacturers, models, model years, and fuel efficiency ratings. Insert several cars. Print out the average fuel efficiency. Use CREATE TABLE , INSERT , and SELECT AVG SQL commands. This is a homework question I am having trouble starting. This has to be done solely in UNIX, like using mysql in a unix shell and writing the java code in the shell which I can do. I have also figured out how to make tables in the shell using mysql. I have the JDBC driver and access to mysql in unix. The problem is, is how to write the code to connect to the database (I have a url, username, and password). If you could help me with the code, I would greatly appreciate it. The shell I am running on has the JDBC driver built in and ready to use. This is what I have done, but I am not sure if its how you do it. String userName = "user name"; String password = "user password"; String url = "jdbc:mysql://Hostname/DatabaseName"; Class.forName ("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance (); conn = DriverManager.getConnection (url, userName, password); Please help walking me through this with some code examples. Thanks.
