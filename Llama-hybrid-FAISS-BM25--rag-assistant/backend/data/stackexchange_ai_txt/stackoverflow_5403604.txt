Certainly prior to the introduction of enums, if you had a large collection of constants that needed to be shared between a number of classes, a Constant Interface was probably the most pragmatic way to do so. If those constants were only used in one class then the comments in other answers ('a pattern to avoid') are quite valid - they would be most useful if declared by the class that uses them. With newer versions of Java, I'd move towards enums with a constructor that allows value(s) to be set. However it's still the case that if the set of values are only used by a single class, it makes most sense to declare them within that class rather than separately.
