In addition to Brian's answer I think you also have a problem here: char getstring_e_uart1(char *stringPtr_, const int SIZE_) { char buffer_[SIZE_]; stringPtr_ = buffer_; after the function returns buffer is no longer valid but stringPtr_ would still point to it. You could make buffer_ static or allocate it globally
