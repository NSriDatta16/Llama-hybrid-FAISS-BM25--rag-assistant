There's a very small set of web-safe fonts; Rockwell isn't one of them because it comes with third-party software like Microsoft Office. That said, if you must use Rockwell as your primary font, be sure to define a decent font stack for it. That is, use CSS to define a list of fallbacks, where each fallback is a web-safe font: body, input, textarea { font-family: Rockwell, "Courier New", Courier, Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif; } Some information on font stacks: http://www.petercolesdc.com/web-fonts-nice-honest/ (includes info on Rockwell) http://unitinteractive.com/blog/2008/06/26/better-css-font-stacks/ Nowadays (2011), modern browsers support embedding custom fonts via @font-face . Popular options include Typekit , Google Fonts , and Font Squirrel . Note that not all browsers support loading custom fonts via CSS, so you should still list web-safe fonts as fallbacks.
