This problem falls under the category of unsupervised learning , in which the most common approach is clustering: One tries to divide data in different groups based on the features that are given. Various approaches exist, for example k-means or density-based approaches ; take a look at for example sklearn . Another possiblity is to perform dimensionality reduction in order to visualize your data. This can be done by for example principal component analysis or by constructing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) . The first one is a linear method (which can be extended to a non-linear method, so-called Kernel PCA ), the second one is non-linear.
