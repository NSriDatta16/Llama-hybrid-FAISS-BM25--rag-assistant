One thing you might want to look into is packages as a way to organize your functions and classes. From the documentation: Packages are special folders that can contain class folders, function and class definition files, and other packages. Packages define a scope (sometimes called a namespace) for the contents of the package folder. This means function and class names need to be unique only within the package. Using a package provides a means to organize classes and functions and to select names for these components that other packages can reuse.
