In C, everything is passed by value . You have to pay attention what is passed by value, though. A C-style array like char from[] is not a container object, like you might expect from other languages. For most practical purposes, a C array is equivalent to a pointer to the first element, i.e. char * from . So, the parameters to and from do get passed by value, but what they are is pointers to the data, so you can modify the data pointed to through them.
