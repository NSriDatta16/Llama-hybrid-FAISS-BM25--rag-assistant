When you add layers you are increasing the depth of the neural network. If you add more units to the existing layers, you are increasing the width. In terms of hyperparameters selection, the best I can recommend is to try both and see which one gives you the best performance. Take into account considerations like over fitting, which may happen specially when you increase the complexity of a model.
