There are two reasons MS developers made this restriction: Some UI functions have access to thread-local storage (TLS). Calling these functions from another thread gives incorrect results on TLS operations. Calling all UI-related functions from the same thread automatically serializes them, this is thread-safe and doesn't require synchronization. From our point of view, we just need to follow these rules.
