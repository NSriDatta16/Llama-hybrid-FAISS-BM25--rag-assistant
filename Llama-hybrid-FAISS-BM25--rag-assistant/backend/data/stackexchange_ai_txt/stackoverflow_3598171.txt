One thing that makes passing an HTML / CSS template between multiple front-end developers is proper structuring and indenting of the markup. The same way books are broken down into volumes, chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words, spaces, and periods, there is a hierarchical structure that makes HTML and CSS easy to read (and on the other hand a way of coding that makes things a total mess) As a rule of thumb: Some text goes in here... A list item A list item A list item A link This kind of adherence to structure can really cut down on time by making scanning code super easy for whoever is working on itâ€“ regardless of whether they wrote it or not.
