It seems that I need to improve my feature engineering. When I read this https://mlcourse.ai/book/topic09/topic9_part1_time_series_python.html tutorial, I understand this, specially the section https://mlcourse.ai/book/topic09/topic9_part1_time_series_python.html#linear-and-not-only-models-for-time-series . PS.: the cardinality to factorial features stills a thing that I do not figure out.
