How to add extra word features other then word Embedding in Recurrent Neural Network model

I am building a deep learning model for NLP. I am pretty comfortable with adding word embedding from word2vec or Glove vectors as extra word features but I wanted to add other word features like POS tag of a word, NER tag of word along with embedding as features. How can I do this. Should I give these word features by concatenating their vector with the word vectors. Or is there some other method. Please suggest.
