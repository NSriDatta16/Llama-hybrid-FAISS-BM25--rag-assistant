Android : How to Remove all capital letters from image filenames before importing into Eclipse

As you know, you can't have capital letters in your image filenames that you use in your Android project (Ressource/Drawables folder). I've got hundreds of small images (GOOG.GIF as an exemple) that I need to import into my project (I usually do a simple drag and drop from a desktop folder into Eclipse). So here's the question : How do I quickly change all the filenames (replace all capital letters to lower case) before importing into my project ? So, GOOG.GIF becomes goog.gif AAPL.GIF becomes aapl.gif etc. Any quick command line solution or another tool to do just that ? Thanks.
