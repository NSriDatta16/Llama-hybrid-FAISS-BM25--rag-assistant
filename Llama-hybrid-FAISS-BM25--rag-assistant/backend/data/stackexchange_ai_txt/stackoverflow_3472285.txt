CSV files treatment with Delphi

I've gotten a CSV file supposedly with seven columns, and I was doing just fine until recently, they started using commas inside the third data column, and also CR and LF characters, also inside the third column, all of this between double quotes. I was reading it line by line, so I could cross-check it with another file, and point it to the right row in the other file, but now that they are including new line codes and also commas, my code is just messed up. For example: 1,4778,"El murciélago estaba navegando",10/08/2010,906610,13496-86219-1,1 . This one runs just fine. 1,4778,"El murciélago estaba navegando, y además estaba de parranda",10/08/2010,906610,13496-86219-1,1 . Now this is bad . Any way you suggest to solve this? The third data column is ALWAYS the one with these sudden changes. The others will never get to work with new lines or additional commas, so there is no need to filter those... Thanks in advance!
