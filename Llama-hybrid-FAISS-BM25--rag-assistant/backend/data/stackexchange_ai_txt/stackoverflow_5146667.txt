umar... Saving instance state is quite different on the Android. On a soft kill (phone rotation) you may save your non view state in onSaveInstanceState using bundles. On a hard kill (back button while activity has focus) you may elect to save your non view and view state in onStop perhaps using preferences. You can restore your state in onCreate. You can leverage the fact that IF onSaveInstanceState is called it will be called BEFORE onStop. So this lets you set a flag isSavedInstanceState to true in onSaveInstanceState to avoid saving prefs in onStop except on a hard kill. The trick is to reset the flag isSavedInstanceState to false in onResume NOT in onCreate. JAL I have sample code here .
