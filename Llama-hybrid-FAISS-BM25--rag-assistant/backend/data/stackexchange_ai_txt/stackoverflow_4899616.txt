The easiest way is to pass the world-position down from the vertex shader via a varying variable. However, if you really must reconstruct it from gl_FragCoord , the only way to do this is to invert all the steps that led to the gl_FragCoord coordinates. Consult the OpenGL specs, if you really have to do this, because a deep understanding of the transformations will be necessary.
