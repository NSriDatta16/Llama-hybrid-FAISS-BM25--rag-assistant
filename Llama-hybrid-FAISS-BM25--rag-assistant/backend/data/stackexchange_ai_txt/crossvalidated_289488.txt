In non technical terms, a manifold is a continuous geometrical structure having finite dimension : a line, a curve, a plane, a surface, a sphere, a ball, a cylinder, a torus, a "blob"... something like this : It is a generic term used by mathematicians to say "a curve" (dimension 1) or "surface" (dimension 2), or a 3D object (dimension 3)... for any possible finite dimension $n$. A one dimensional manifold is simply a curve (line, circle...). A two dimensional manifold is simply a surface (plane, sphere, torus, cylinder...). A three dimensional manifold is a "full object" (ball, full cube, the 3D space around us...). A manifold is often described by an equation : the set of points $(x,y)$ such as $x^2+y^2=1$ is a one dimensional manifold (a circle). A manifold has the same dimension everywhere. For example, if you append a line (dimension 1) to a sphere (dimension 2) then the resulting geometrical structure is not a manifold. Unlike the more general notions of metric space or topological space also intended to describe our natural intuition of a continuous set of points, a manifold is intended to be something locally simple: like a finite dimension vector space : $\mathbb{R}^n$. This rules out abstract spaces (like infinite dimension spaces) that often fail to have a geometric concrete meaning. Unlike a vector space, manifolds can have various shapes. Some manifolds can be easily visualized (sphere ,ball...), some are difficult to visualize, like the Klein bottle or the real projective plane . In statistics, machine learning, or applied maths generally, the word "manifold" is often used to say "like a linear subspace" but possibly curved. Anytime you write a linear equation like : $3x+2y-4z=1$ you get a linear (affine) subspace (here a plane). Usually, when the equation is non linear like $x^2+2y^2+3z^2=7$, this is a manifold (here a stretched sphere). For example the " manifold hypothesis " of ML says "high dimensional data are points in a low dimensional manifold with high dimensional noise added". You can imagine points of a 1D circle with some 2D noise added. While the points are not exactly on the circle, they satisfy statistically the equation $x^2+y^2=1$. The circle is the underlying manifold:
