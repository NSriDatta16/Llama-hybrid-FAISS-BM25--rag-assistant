Opinions/expertise/suggestions wanted - provide feedback from php performing a lengthy task

I am thinking about converting a visual basic application (that takes pipe delimited files and imports them into a microsoft sql database) into a php page. One of these files is on average about 9 megabytes in size. (I couldn't be accurate about the number of lines involved but I'd say it's about 20 thousand) One of the advantages being that any changes made to the page would be automatically 'deployed' to the intended user (currently when I make changes to the visual basic app, which was originally created by someone else, I have to put the latest version on all the PCs of the people that use it). Problem is these imports can take like two minutes to complete. Two minutes is a long time in website-time so I would like to provide feedback to the user to indicate that the page hasn't failed/timed out and is definitely doing something. The best idea that I can think of so far is to use ajax to do it incrementally. Say import 1000 records at a time then feed back, implement the next 1000, feed back, and so on. Are there better ways of doing this sort of thing that wouldn't require me to learn new programming languages or download apps or libraries?
