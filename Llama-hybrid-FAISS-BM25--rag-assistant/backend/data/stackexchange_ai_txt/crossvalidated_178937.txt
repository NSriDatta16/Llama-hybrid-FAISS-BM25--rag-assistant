Find state space model to compare with Box-Jenkins ARIMA model

I asked a question here about how to get predictions for the random-walk component of an ARIMA model. Are there time series models in the state-space framework that might be suitable for the kind of data used with ARIMA models, perhaps for series similar to the one in the linked question? I would like to know how to build a model using state-space models rather than Box-Jenkins methods such that I can implement a Kalman filter to predict the random walk portion of the signal.
