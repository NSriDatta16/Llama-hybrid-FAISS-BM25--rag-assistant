Grabbing links using xpath in php

i am trying to grab links from the Google search page. i am using the be below xpath to //div[@id='ires']/ol[@id='rso']/li/h3/a/@href grab the links. xPather evaluates it and gives the result. But when i use it with my php it doesn't show any result. Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? There is nothing wrong with the cURL. below is my code $dom = new DOMDocument(); @$dom->loadHTML($result); $xpath=new DOMXPath($dom); $elements = $xpath->evaluate("//div[@id='ires']/ol[@id='rso']/li/h3/a"); foreach ($elements as $element) { $link = $element->getElementsByTagName("href")->item(0)->nodeValue; echo $link." "; } Sample Html provided by Robert Pitt LINK META
