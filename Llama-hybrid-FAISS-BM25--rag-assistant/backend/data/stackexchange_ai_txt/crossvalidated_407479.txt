What is the residual, seasonal component in time-series decomposition represents?

I am doing time series analysis on the below dataset- Here's link This is what I got on the decomposition of the dataset in python- Well, I know the meaning of every word i.e- The trend represents an increasing, decreasing trend in the dataset. Seasonality represents the repetition of a specific pattern in a seasonal manner (after some time periods). The residual represents the remainder component. But I am unable to relate these meaning with respect to the above graphs.
