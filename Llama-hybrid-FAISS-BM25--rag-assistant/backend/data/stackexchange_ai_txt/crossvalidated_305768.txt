So for each bird, the model is a Poisson process, where the lambda parameter is different for different birds? In that case I suggest that you assume a suitable prior distribution for lambda, and then make a Bayesian fit to the observations to deduce a posterior distribution of lambda for each bird. The likelihood of the observations given these posterior distributions is then the quality indicator for the model. For choosing a prior, first use a naive estimate of lambda for each bird. Then look at the empirical distribution of these. Then identify a distribution that fits it. If a gamma distribution is a reasonable fit then all the better because this is the conjugate prior for Poisson. Only a Bayesian approach is really justifiable with sparse data. OK, assuming a prior distribution is a big assumption, but at least it is explicit. Any fit to sparse data involves prior knowledge.
