Your distribution is not beta if your density plot is to be taken at face value. A beta distribution cannot have two modes within (0, 1). However, no density plot for a bounded variable (at a guess here from some kernel density estimation procedure) can be taken at face value unless the estimation includes adjustments for boundary artefacts, which is not typical. But, as it were, we see what you mean. However, to focus on the major issues: A regression is first and foremost a model for the mean of a variable as it varies with the predictors. Even if an assumption of normal errors is made, that is not an assumption about the marginal distribution of the response and it is the least important assumption that is being made. So, it is not surprising that your regression behaves fairly well as far as can be inferred from the distribution of residuals if the functional form catches the way that conditional means behave. The assertion of normality is more convincing if you show us a normal probability plot. That distribution looks to me to have higher kurtosis than a normal, although that is likely to be a little deal. You need to check that your model is predicting values within [0,1]. Some of your residuals are about 0.7 in magnitude and so it seems possible that some of the predictions are qualitatively wrong. At the same time, you should be able to do better with a regression that respects the bounded nature of the response. You could try beta regression or a generalised linear model with binomial family and logit link. The latter sounds wrong but often works well in practice. For a concise introductory review, see http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0147 Beta regression is supported in R and Stata (and likely so in other software) and generalised linear models are widely supported, although watch for routines that reject non-binary responses if a logit link is requested. Note: The exact form of your density plot for the response is a side-issue, so I will make this an added note. It's clear that the density for a variable bounded by 0 and 1 must average 1. Your graph has a useful reference line density at 1. Visually comparing the bump above 1 on the left with the area to its right underlines that some of the density has been smoothed away by the procedure beyond the support and discarded. That is, the graph shown truncates the display: the smoothed distribution has positive density below 0 or above 1, which is not shown. There are known ways to smooth a bounded variable more respectfully, in this case including (a) to smooth logit of the variable and back-transform the density (a little problematic if observed values include 0 or 1), or (b) to reflect density inwards at the extremes. Naturally, there is scope for disagreement about whether this is trivial or secondary on the one hand or incorrect on the other. (I'd rather see a quantile plot of the data, but I'll not expand on that.)
