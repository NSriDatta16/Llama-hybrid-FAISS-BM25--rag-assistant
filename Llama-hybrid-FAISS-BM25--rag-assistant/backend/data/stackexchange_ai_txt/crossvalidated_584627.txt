As indicated in the comments, your particular model with this particular small data set is uninterpretable. The odds-ratio estimates and confidence intervals (as best as I can tell from the image of the table) seem to be enormous. I suspect that you have something close to perfect separation with only 12 cases in the minority class and 4 continuous predictor variables. Otherwise, the interpretation of a coefficient for a continuous linearly modeled predictor in logistic regression is straightforward: it's the increase in log-odds of an event per unit change in that continuous predictor .
