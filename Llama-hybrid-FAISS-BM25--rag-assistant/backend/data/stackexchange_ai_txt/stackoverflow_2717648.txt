MySQL SELECT statement that groups results by id?

I am trying to create a MySQL SELECT statement that will select a bunch of rows from a table and will group the results by the id of the row (multiple rows will have the same id). Here's an example of what I'm trying to do. Let's say I have the following table: id | name 1 | Art 1 | Arnold 1 | Anatoly 2 | Beatrice 2 | Bertha 2 | Betty 3 | Constantine 3 | Cramer I'd like to have MySQL return the data grouped by id like so: [1] => Art, Arnold, Anatoly [2] => Beatrice, Bertha, Betty [3] => Constantine, Cramer I know I could do a simple SQL select, then loop over the result in PHP, but I'd like to let MySQL handle the grouping if possible.
