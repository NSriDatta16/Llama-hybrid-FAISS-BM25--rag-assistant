Cost capping Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

I find the fact that the service does not offer cost capping a bit scary. Are there alternatives (to Amzn s3 that offers capping), or is there a way to for example poll the current cost and disable the service if data or transfer volumes suddenly grow like crazy? Or is there some other clever way of capping the bills?
