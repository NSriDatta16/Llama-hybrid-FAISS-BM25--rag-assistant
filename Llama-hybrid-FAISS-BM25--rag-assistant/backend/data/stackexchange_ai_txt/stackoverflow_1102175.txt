Am I breaking my aggregate boundaries in this model?

I'm modeling a very basic ASP.NET MVC app using NHibernate and I seem to be stuck on my design. Here's a sketch of my model: As you can see this is VERY basic but I have some concerns about it. The User root entity and the Organization root entity are accessing the same Organization_Users entity child via two one-to-many relationships. This doesn't seem right and I think I am breaking the aggregate boundaries. This model smells to me but I like the idea because I would like to have code like this: var user = userRepository.Load(1); var list = user.Organizations; // All the organizations the user is a part of. and var org = orgRepository.Load(1); var list = org.Users; // All the users in an organization. Also the extra data in the table like flagged and role would be used by the Organization entity. Is this a bad design? If you have any thoughts that would be great. I'm still trying to get my mind around the thinking of DDD. Thanks
