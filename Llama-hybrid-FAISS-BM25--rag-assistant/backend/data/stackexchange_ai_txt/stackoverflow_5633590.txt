SO I agonized over this and I figured it out.. you don't need the other button or anything. All you need to do is select "Files owner", in the inspector drag from its textField outlet (or whatever you named it) to your actual textfield (via whatever you named it) This will be in addition to whatever inputs you already had wired up. and ofcourse in addition to the Control outlet (UIview changed to UIControl via inspector) to files owner via backgroundtouched...the first thing we all tried
