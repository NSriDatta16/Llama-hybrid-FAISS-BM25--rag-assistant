Activation function vs Squashing function

This may seem like a very simple and obvious question, but I haven't actually been able to find a direct answer. Today, in a video explaining deep neural networks, I came across the term Squashing function . This is a term that I have never heard or used. Our professor always used the term Activation function instead. Given the definitions I've been able to find, the two seem to be interchangeable terms. Are they really synonymous or is there a difference?
