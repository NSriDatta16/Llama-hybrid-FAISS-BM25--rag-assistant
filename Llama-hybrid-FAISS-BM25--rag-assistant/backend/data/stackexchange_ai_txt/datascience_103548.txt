One option is Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) , an algorithm for finding the distance between pairs of strings. It is based on word embeddings (e.g., word2vec) which encode the semantic meaning of words into dense vectors. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. For example: Source: "From Word Embeddings To Document Distances" Paper In your case, you would take your keyword(s) and compare it to each sentence. If the distance is below a threshold the keyword(s) are related to the sentence.
