The question: It seems that (univariate) forecasting stock market done by websites using DL and LSTM actually does not work that well if we focus on returns instead of prices. What is a relatively quick fix for that?(or most important fix) The motivation is quite simple. You can find it in any financial economic/econometrics text. As starting point we can consider stock price (log-price) as described from a Random Walk model (RW): $p_t = p_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ are iid gaussian noise. Then $E[p_{t+1}|I_t]= p_{t}$ $I_t$ stand for information set at time $t$ , but it boil down into $p_t$ in this model. So for log return = $r_t = p_t – p_{t-1}$ we have $E[r_{t+1}|I_t]=0$ for all $t$ Take away: price is non-stationary series, the best predictor for price in the future is price now, returns are stationary and best predictor for them is zero. Candidate predictive model have to predict better than RW, using in some way $I_t$ . usually is better to try with return than price, because the former are stationary (wide sense). Under usual definition of predictability, price are quite well predictable while return are hard to predict. So your evidence is usual. Machine learning can be used fruitfully in finance too, but beat RW is far from simple. NOTE : Just to note that some comments below touch interesting points as equilibrium or others; however here we have to stay focused on prediction only. Others comment ask empirical support. About the last request, the story above is a model (theory) and, apart any details, it represent the oldest stochastic model in finance (Bachelier model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#Applications; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelier_model ). RW became a benchmark model in stock prediction (and for other assets too). During the decades was proposed, in academy and financial industry, hundreds of predictive models. Models that, looking for predictability, refute the RW condition like $E[r_{t+1}|r_t, r_{t-1} …]=0$ . Them searched some model for which $E[r_{t+1}|I_t] \neq 0$ and, then, to beat the RW in MSE or other metrics. However until now no one of them can beat the RW for all dataset (all country/index, all stock/name, all data frequency, ecc). So, it is useless to cite here specific articles that confirm or refuse returns predictability, this is an endless empirical debate. Moreover, for some RW version we can relax gaussianity and independence with weaker conditions but the basic implications above hold yet. Finally, the history seems me the strongest as possible empirical confirm that the basic RW implications above, in some extent, is consistent with data. Therefore it remain the more simple and more convincing way for explain why stock price are easily predictable while returns are very hard to predict. Just another point. Some trader/analyst want to predict directly the prices and not the returns. Them intend this work as predict the direction of price in the next period and not the level (it is easy). These guys use something like “prices paths”. This target is not different that predict returns direction. However these guys do not realize that there are no way for infer something from non stationary and non ergodic time series.
