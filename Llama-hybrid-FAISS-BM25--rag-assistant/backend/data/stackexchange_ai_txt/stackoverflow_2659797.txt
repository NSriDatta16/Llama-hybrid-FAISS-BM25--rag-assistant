How do I use sqlite3 PRAGMA user_version in Objective-c?

I am trying to check the user_version of the sqlite DB. I have an admin tool to bump the version, but I don't understand the syntax of the pragma statement. I am expecting to test the value in an if-statement. Can someone provide a code sample? When I embed the pragma statement in my objective-c code, the compiler throws an error.
