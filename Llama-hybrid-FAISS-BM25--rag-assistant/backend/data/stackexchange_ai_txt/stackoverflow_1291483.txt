Leave only two decimal places after the dot

public void LoadAveragePingTime() { try { PingReply pingReply = pingClass.Send("logon.chronic-domination.com"); double AveragePing = (pingReply.RoundtripTime / 1.75); label4.Text = (AveragePing.ToString() + "ms"); } catch (Exception) { label4.Text = "Server is currently offline."; } } Currently my label4.Text get's something like: "187.371698712637". I need it to show something like: "187.37" Only two posts after the DOT. Can someone help me out?
