Dragging and dropping a file onto a executable (or a shortcut to an executable) will result in Windows passing the file name along to the executable as the first command line parameter. If the file name contains spaces, then the file name will be quoted. You can then retrieve this file name from the args parameter passed to your main method and do what you need to do from there. I suspect that Linux and OS X will behave in a similar fashion.
