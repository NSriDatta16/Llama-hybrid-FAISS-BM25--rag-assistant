EXTJS: treepanel move a branch programmatically

I have a tree where users can drag and drop branches. Now this works all well and good, but I need to be able to move a branch programmatically. I need to simulate a cut and paste (I will have the user using buttons instead of Ctrl - X and V ). Does anyone have an idea of where I should start?
