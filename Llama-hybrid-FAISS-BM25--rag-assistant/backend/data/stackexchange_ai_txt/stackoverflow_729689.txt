Binding Silverlight UserControl custom properties to its' elements

I'm trying to make a simple crossword puzzle game in Silverlight 2.0. I'm working on a UserControl-ish component that represents a square in the puzzle. I'm having trouble with binding up my UserControl's properties with its' elements. I've finally (sort of) got it working (may be helpful to some - it took me a few long hours), but wanted to make it more 'elegant'. I've imagined it should have a compartment for the content and a label (in the upper right corner) that optionally contains its' number. The content control probably be a TextBox, while label control could be a TextBlock. So I created a UserControl with this basic structure (the values are hardcoded at this stage): I've also created DependencyProperties in the Square class like this: public static readonly DependencyProperty LabelTextProperty; public static readonly DependencyProperty ContentCharacterProperty; // ...(static constructor with property registration, .NET properties // omitted for brevity)... Now I'd like to figure out how to bind the Label and Content element to the two properties. I do it like this (in the code-behind file): Label.SetBinding( TextBlock.TextProperty, new Binding { Source = this, Path = new PropertyPath( "LabelText" ), Mode = BindingMode.OneWay } ); Content.SetBinding( TextBox.TextProperty, new Binding { Source = this, Path = new PropertyPath( "ContentCharacter" ), Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay } ); That would be more elegant done in XAML. Does anyone know how that's done?
