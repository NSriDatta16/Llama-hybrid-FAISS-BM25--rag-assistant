Magento - Cronjob outside magento to update shipment status

I am working on a script which is out of magento framework and will be programmed to get all shipments and tracking number. After getting these shipments and tracking number i will check with shipping provider and update the status of shipment and order based on if its dispatched / scanned or delivered. following is half done code and I am stuck, addAttributeToSelect('*'); $allIds=$shipment->getAllIds(); foreach($allIds as $thisId) { $myShipment->load($thisId)->getAllTrackings(); echo " "; print_r($myShipment); echo " "; } Please help, Thanks and Regards, Saurabh
