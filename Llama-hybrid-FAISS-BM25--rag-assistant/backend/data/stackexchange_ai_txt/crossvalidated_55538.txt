Does Poisson Regression have an error term?

I was just wondering if Poisson regression has an error term? Can a Poisson regression have random effects and an error term? I am confused about this point. In logistic regression, there is no error term because your outcome variable is binary. Is that the only glm model that doesn't have a residual term?
