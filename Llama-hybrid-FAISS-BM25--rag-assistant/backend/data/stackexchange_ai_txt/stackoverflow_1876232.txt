You can sort of make it work. The code below displays a functional menu that relies on a:hover to trigger display. However, it comes with a few caveats: Since you can't nest tags in HTML or XHTML , you're limited to a single level of menu items. For the same reason, you have to use JavaScript onclick event handlers to handle user clicks on menu items. IE6 seems to require a :hover rule on the anchor tag itself in order to trigger hover behavior. Without the #menu:hover rule, the #menu:hover span was ignored. The rule needs to have at least one style assignment in it, and not all properties seem to work (e.g. background-color or border worked, but color didn't). Code: CSS Menu in IE6 #menu { background-color: #cccccc; color: black; text-decoration: none; position: relative; } #menu span { display: none; } /* I'm using tags for the submenu items, just to make the styling easier. */ #menu span b { display: block; font-weight: normal; } /* IE6 seems to require some :hover rule on the anchor element itself. Without it, the '#menu:hover span' rule below is ignored. */ #menu:hover { border: none; } #menu:hover span { background-color: #cccccc; cursor: pointer; display: block; position: absolute; top: 1em; left: 10px; } Menu Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Lorem ipsum doler sit amet... UPDATE : IE6 does sort of work with nested elements. I tried embedding a link within a submenu, and it displayed properly but mousing over the inner link caused the outer link to lose :hover , and the menu would disappear out from under the cursor. However, apparently if you wrap the menu in a table (as demonstrated here ), it will work. Note that the below code works, but won't validate and might blow up in other browsers: CSS Menu in IE6 #menu { background-color: #cccccc; color: black; text-decoration: none; } #menu ul { display: none; } #menu:hover { border: none; } #menu:hover ul { background-color: #cccccc; display: block; margin: 0; margin-left: 10px; padding: 0; list-style-type: none; } Menu Google Yahoo Stack Overflow Lorem ipsum doler sit amet...
