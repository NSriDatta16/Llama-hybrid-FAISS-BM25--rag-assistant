updating a distribution based on the non-occurence of an event

I have a dataset of devices, and the delay (days) in the time from when they are turned on to when they first register on the network. I've modeled it as a Gamma distribution, which decays very quickly. Let's suppose that I have a sample of new devices, which I know have not registered themselves within 48 hours. How do I update the distribution to take into account this information? I'd like to be able to provide a conditional probability that the devices will be registered on day 3, day 4, etc - given that they weren't registered within the first two days. If I just use the existing distribution, I'd still have probabilities at day 1, and day 2 - even though those times have passed and are no longer valid. But at the same time, I can't just shift the distribution forward 48 hours, as the probability for day 2 would be too high. Should I take a Bayesian approach, or is there some type of distribution which is suitable for these types of calculations?
