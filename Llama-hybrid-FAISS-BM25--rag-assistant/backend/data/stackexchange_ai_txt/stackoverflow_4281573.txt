Personally I group javascript code into files that make sense and then include them on the pages that require it. For example, if you have some code that is called on most of the pages then I would include it in the application.js. But, if I have code that is only included on my User controller pages then I would make a user.js file and only include it on those pages. By doing this the code is organized in a way that is easy for me to maintain. There might be some performance tradeoffs for this but in my case maintainability is more important.
