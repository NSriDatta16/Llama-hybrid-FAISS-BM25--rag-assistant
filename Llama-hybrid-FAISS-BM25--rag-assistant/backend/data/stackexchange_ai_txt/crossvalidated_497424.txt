R - Change threshold value for Random Forest classifier

After I plotted ROC and printed out the portion of values that I think it balances True Positive and False Positive. Say below. > head(roc_df[roc_df$fpp > 20 & roc_df$fpp and I think 0.5300 is actually quite good and I have the probability prediction of two classes below > rf_prob_df 0 1 190 0.696 0.304 265 0.847 0.153 191 0.154 0.846 122 0.167 0.833 423 0.465 0.535 I'm not sure how I can apply a new threshold to predict class based on the probability there. Do I use my threshold, 0.5300, on one of the columns? If so, which one do I use? If I use it on both columns, I predict class based on the probability that exceed the threshold. For example, first row is 0.696>0.5300, then I predict 0 as my class? What if I ran into 0.500 and 0.500 for both classes how do I make the prediction?
