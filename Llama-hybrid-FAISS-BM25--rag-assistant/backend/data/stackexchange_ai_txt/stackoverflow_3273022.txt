Getting all classes from the current workspace in Eclipse

am writing an Eclipse plugin, and I was trying to create a method that returns all the classes in the workspace in an ArrayList > (I added the "\" to include the generic brackets since html won't let me do so otherwise). Here is the code I have: private ArrayList > getAllClasses() throws JavaModelException { ArrayList > classList = new ArrayList >(); IWorkspace workspace = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace(); IWorkspaceRoot root = workspace.getRoot(); IProject[] projects = root.getProjects(); for (IProject project : projects) { IJavaProject javaProject = JavaCore.create(project); IPackageFragment[] packages = javaProject.getPackageFragments(); for (IPackageFragment myPackage : packages) { IClassFile[] classes = myPackage.getClassFiles(); for (IClassFile myClass : classes) { classList.add(myClass.getClass()); } } } return classList; } This, however, doesn't seem to be working. I had some printlines, and I figured out that it also includes irrelevant classes (ie. classes from Java\jre6\lib\rt.jar). Any suggestions?
