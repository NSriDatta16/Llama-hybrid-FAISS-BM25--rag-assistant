Two variables correlated to a third one but not together

Let's consider the following correlation matrix: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ which describes the correlation between 3 random variables $X,Y,Z$. It says that $X$ is strongly correlated to $Y$, $X$ is strongly correlated to $Z$, but $Y$ is not correlated to $Z$. Though possible, it seems a bit odd. So I would like to understand what the observations of these variables can look like. Can somebody provide an illustration in terms of three time series of $X, Y, Z$ realizations?
