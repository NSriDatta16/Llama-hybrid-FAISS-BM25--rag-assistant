Decent IDE's will give you the names of the variables in the current scope when you are typing them via Intellisense. This should severely cut down on the number of times you misspell a variable name. It also allows your variable names to be more descriptive than $foo Furthermore, you should always pay attention to undefined variable warnings, as they immediately tell you when you have made a misspelling.
