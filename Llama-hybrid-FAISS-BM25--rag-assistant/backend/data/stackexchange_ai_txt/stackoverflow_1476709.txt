My suggestion is you do this my $text = 'My cat likes to eat tomatoes.'; my ( $format = $text ) =~ s/\b(cat|tomatoes)\b/%s/g; Then you can just do this: my $new_sentence = sprintf( $format, 'dog', 'pasta' ); As well as this: $new_sentence = sprintf( $format, 'tiger', 'asparagus' ); I go with the others. You shouldn't want to do it all in one expression, or one line...but here is a way: $text =~ s/\b(cat|tomatoes)\b/ ${{ qw }}{$1} /ge;
