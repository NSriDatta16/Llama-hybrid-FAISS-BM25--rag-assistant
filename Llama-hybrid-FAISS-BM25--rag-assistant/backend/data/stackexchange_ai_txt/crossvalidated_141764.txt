The most standard way of dealing with variables having an array of values is using dummy variables , i.e. creating a column for each possibility and assigning 0 and 1 depending if a n attribute is absent or present, respectively. See for example how to do it in Pandas (if you are using Python) and Generate a dummy-variable in R . The good thing is that you can treat 0 and 1 as categorical (e.g. for decision trees or random forests) or numerical (for various regressions, k-nearest neighbors, principal component analysis, k-mean, etc). Sometimes you need to convert all variables to numerical, even if there is only a single attribute per entry. The bad thing is that if there are many options, either you need to restrict yourself to only the most common or perform some dimensional reduction with the principal component analysis. The ugly thing is that even if you are using categorical-only variables, then you typically present single-valued variables with text/id, while multi-valued with dummy variables.
