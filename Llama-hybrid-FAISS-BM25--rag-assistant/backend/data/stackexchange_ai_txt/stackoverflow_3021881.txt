Have to click twice to submit the form in IE8

A very peculiar bug in a simple html form. After changing an option, button has to be clicked twice to submit the form. Button is focused after clicking once, but form is not submitted. It's only this way in IE8 and works fine in Chrome and FF. PAY ATTENTION TO 'g^' right before . It has to be a letter or number followed by a symbol to generate this bug. For example, 'a#','f$','3(' all create the same bug. Otherwise it works fine. BTW, if you don't change option and click button right away,there won't be any bug. Very strange, huh? g^ Select English French
