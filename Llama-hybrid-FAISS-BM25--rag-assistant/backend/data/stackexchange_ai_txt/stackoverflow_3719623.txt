How do I obtain a list of all schemas in a Sql Server database

I want to retrieve a list of all schemas in a given Sql Server database. Using the ADO.NET schema retrieval API, I get a list of all collections but there is no collection for 'Schemas'. I could traverse the 'Tables' , 'Procedures' collections (and others if required) and obtain a list of unique schema names but isn't there a easier/shorter way of achieving the same result? Example: For the standard 'AdventureWorks' database I would like to obtain the following list - dbo,HumanResources,Person,Production,Purchasing,Sales (I've omitted the other standard schem names like db_accessadmin , db_datareader etc) Edit: I can get the list of schemas by querying the system view - INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA but would prefer using the schema API as first choice.
