Android - Going from Binders to Broadcasts

I started with a standard local android service, and used Binders with Listeners to communicate. Then: I began noticing some serious issues with handling orientation changes, so I decided to skip the whole binder thing, and just go with broadcasting intents (and using startService exclusively) that contain all the data/commands that need to be passed. My question is: what are some of the pitfalls I have to look out for when using this approach? Are there any disadvantages?
