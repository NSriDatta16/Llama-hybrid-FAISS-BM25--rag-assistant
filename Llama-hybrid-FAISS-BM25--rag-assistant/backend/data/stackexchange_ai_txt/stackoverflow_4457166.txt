jquery ui selectable combined with draggable works in IE but not in Firefox

I have a tree of resources which is set up as a table, and I want to be able to select a number of resources from the tree using Ctrl-Click to select multiple resources and drag them over onto a table of jobs to allocate resources to a job. This all works well in IE8. but when I try it in Firefox, selection doesn't work at all, when I disable the draggable then selectable works Ok, so its obviously a conflict between draggable and selectable that only occurs in Firefox. Using Firebug it appears that _mouseStart is not fired when clicking on one of the table cells, but it is if you click on some area of the table which is not a cell. I've set up a test page is to demonstrate the issue here: www.qualitech.co.nz/test.aspx
