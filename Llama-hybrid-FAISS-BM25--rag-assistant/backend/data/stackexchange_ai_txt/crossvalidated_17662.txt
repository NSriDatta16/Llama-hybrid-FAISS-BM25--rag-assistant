What is this method for seasonal adjustment calculation?

I got an example calculation for multiplicative model, which is shown as follows: Quarter 1 2 3 4 Average 0.866 1.0005 1.403 0.660 -------------------------------------------------- Adjustment 0.0176 0.0176 0.0176 0.0176 Seasonal factor 0.884 1.018 1.421 0.678 Then there is a note below: Sum of averages = 3.9295. These should sum to 4, 4-3.9295=0.0705. Adding 0.0705/4=0.0176 to each average, to obtain the seasonal factors. I saw from other resources that they are using "seasonal index" instead of "seasonal factor" by normalizing the values. Besides that, they also mentioned about X11, X12, ARIMA, and so on. I would like to know is, based on the example above, what is the method called?
