So what do I do in my app to be recognized as a servicing app for this particular type of attachment, especially since I expect it's not a good idea to try to open anything with this MIME type. You don't. Inventing new documents as email attachments doesn't work well pretty much anywhere. Android is just a notch worse in this regard. You cannot realistically set up an ACTION_VIEW by MIME type, because your MIME type is too general. You cannot set up an ACTION_VIEW by file extension, because there is no file extension on email attachments as is processed by the AOSP email app, and perhaps other email clients as well. I encourage you to abandon email attachments as a delivery vector for your files, and find some other solution where you can have a customized MIME type (e.g., download the files from a Web server, with the emails containing a link to the files). Then, an ACTION_VIEW by MIME type can work OK.
