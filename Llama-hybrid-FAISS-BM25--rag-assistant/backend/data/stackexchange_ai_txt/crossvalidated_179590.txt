When running the following R code > time2 for (d in 30*(1:20)) + times[d/30]=time2(d) > lm(log(times)~log(30*(1:20))-1) Call: lm(formula = log(times) ~ log(30 * (1:20))-1) Coefficients: log(30 * (1:20)) 1.011 I get a near perfect fit for $d^2$ as the average time to distance $d$: However, as pointed out by whuber, the fit in $d+d^2$ is better: > lm(log(times)~log(30*(1:20)+sqrt(30*(1:20)))-1) Call: lm(formula = log(times) ~ log(30 * (1:20) + sqrt(30 * (1:20))) - 1) Coefficients: log(30 * (1:20) + sqrt(30 * (1:20))) 1
