offline app using UIWebview for iPad

I am trying to build an iPad app which has one UIWebview. content is in asp.net. Now one of major requirement is that my app should support offline mode. First I tried looking Html5 cache manifest but as per this SO Answer it does not work with UIWebview Then I tried searching around caching mechanism available with UIWebview, I found many question on SO( This , This , This , This ) but nothing comes to conclusion or may be old in this context. my basic requirement is whichever page user browse that should get cache(html,css,js.images) and next time when user visit the same page it should be delivered from cache. So my questions are 1) How do achieve this using either Html5 cache manifest or UIWebview caching 2) My app uses lots of image some of them are in MB so is there any size limitation I would really appreciate if anybody can provide a complete tutorial reference. Thanks. **UPDATE: ** is it possible i can take advantage of local disk cache(for images) and html5 local storage (for data) together? if yes then how do i provide local image path.?
