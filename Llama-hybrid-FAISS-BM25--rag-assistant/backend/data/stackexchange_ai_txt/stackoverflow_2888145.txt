What would you use for deployment scripts in Java?

I'm working on a Java web project that uses Maven to build its artifacts. At the end of the Maven build we have a few jar and war files that we need to deploy onto our development/testing environment. Right now we're using a pretty hefty Ant script that performs several tasks (on both Windows/Linux machines) Starts/Stops services Copies/deletes files Builds some stuff and then executes it Etc Ant does the job well - but the script is quickly getting very large, and to be honest, it feels inadequate for the task at hand. Are there other alternatives? I've heard of gant, but I'm not sure that's the right way to go. Thanks for helping! EDIT: after more research, I found out about Gradle - it seems like a very good combination of reusing ant tasks and allowing real scripts to run. It's worth a read.
