"Redirection limit reached" means that the remote site was sending back a Location header, that Location was followed, and then the redirected location gave a Location header again. This process continued until some predefined number of redirections (Location headers) was reached. It's likely that the site is intentionally trying to redirect the client somewhere else, but has a bug that is causing a loop. You should consider trying another way to fetch the URL -- one that lets you specify things like the user-agent string. Try curl , it's ugly but it works well. Try disguising as IE6 or Firefox instead of PHP or curl. Edit: Pekka's comment contains a link with information on using fopen wrappers, including how to set the user-agent string.
