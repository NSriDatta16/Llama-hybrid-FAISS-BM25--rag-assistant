I guess that by "make predictions" you mean find a predictively accurate model, since you already know the true response values for this data. Logistic regression is the usual tool for probabilistic classification. It's hard to guess in advance whether it will be able to beat the trivial model that guesses a probability of .99 for every case, but you can try it. Fancier models are unlikely to do better in this situation.
