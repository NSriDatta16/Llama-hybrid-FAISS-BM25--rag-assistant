Write local file with jQuery or Javascript

I am creating a prototype that will be run in a web browser. I would like to store (and retrieve) various info submitted by a user during the use of the prototype. I know I can retrieve a variety of file formats such as xml, json... and I know I can do local storage using the plugin jstore. So I suppose I can do a convoluted solution where I get the first xml load from a starter file and then use local storage after it is manipulated and just check for local storage. I do not want to use PHP or ASP or other scripts as I need to be able to share the prototype with senior execs who will not have webservers running and I do not want to install the prototype on the webserver... but perhaps that is the best way to do this as I know javascript can not write to the local file system for security reasons. On the otherhand maybe I am making the combination of getting the initial xml and using the jstore plugin sound harder than it really is.
