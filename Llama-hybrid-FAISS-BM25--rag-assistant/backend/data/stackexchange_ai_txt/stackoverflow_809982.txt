Why don't you profile the existing game code on the Sun JVM (assuming you're porting a Java game)? Then you can take advantage of JProfiler, Yourkit, etc. and see what huge set of objects are being cleared up. (Use -XX:+PrintGCDetails to see the GC runs for when to look for it.) If it turns out to not be in the game, you've pretty painlessly figured that out, and can then turn your attention to your Android code. And unfortunately that I don't know much about.
