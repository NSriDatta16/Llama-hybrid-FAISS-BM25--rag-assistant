Comparison of performance of autoencoder with PCA

I am running PCA and autoencoder (2 hidden layer with relu) on a data. Both PCA and autoencoder give similar accuracy of the order 50%. I have tried different variations of autoencoder: changing layers, neurons,activations. But it did not perform any better. What can be the possible reason behind this. Can anybody suggest any analysis of data to identify the reason for autoencoder to not perform any better.
