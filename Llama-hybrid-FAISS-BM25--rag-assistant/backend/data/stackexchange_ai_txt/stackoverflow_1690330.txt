What is the relevance of Qt being licensed under the GPL? Keep in mind that this does not mean your code must be licensed under the GPL; we develop a number of proprietary applications using Qt. However, if you modify Qt and release an application using those modifications, the modifications (but not any of the rest of your code) would have to be released. We've had good success with building cross-platform Qt applications, modulo some teething problems, primarily with multithreading. As far as .NET, C++/CLI would probably be the least painful way to integrate with an existing C++ codebase. The .NET framework would have to be installed to run the application, but it does not necessarily have to be bundled with the installer, so that people who already have .NET don't have to download it again. It will certainly add some weight to the executable but the average desktop PC will not notice it; the design of your software and choice of algorithms will have a much bigger effect.
