I don't think the elf distribution is suitable for modeling count data, but rather it is suitable for modeling continuous data. A nice description of the generalized log-F distribution is available on page 163 of the book Nonparametric Statistical Methods Using R by John Kloke and Joseph McKean. (I am presuming that the extended and the generalized log-F distribution are one and the same thing.) In the earlier quantile regression literature for count data, people have used various tricks to translate their problem from count data to continuous data: log-transforming the count data and then applying quantile regression methods for continuous data to the log-transformed data, adding a quantity selected at random from a uniform distribution to each count to make it continuous and then proceed as one would for continuous quantile regression, etc. More recently, Bayesian methods for count data seemed to have gained traction as they provide increased flexibility. In your own context, not only do you have count data for your outcome variable, but these data may exhibit spatial dependence given how they are collected. So that complicates things further. (Not sure temporal dependence is an issue - it will depend on when your data were collected - a single time point or multiple time points.)
