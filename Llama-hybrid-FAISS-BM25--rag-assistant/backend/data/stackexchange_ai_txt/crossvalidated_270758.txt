What you call "quasi-variance" is simply the sample variance -- which is also the unbiased estimator of population variance based on the sample variance. You actually usually want this formula rather than the population variance (because you rarely compute variance from the whole population). In statistics, you are usually working with a sample from a population. If you use the population variance ($\frac{1}{n}SS$) on the sample, you will get the correct number for the sample , but you will underestimate the variance in the whole population. Since the population is what you are normally interested in, you should (in most practical cases) use $\frac{1}{n-1}SS$. Here is a bit of code that demonstrates this: set.seed(12345) # generate 100 sample sets each with 10 samples # each with mean=1 and variance=1 x Results > print(mean(xvars1)) [1] 0.9986701 > print(mean(xvars2)) [1] 0.8988031 As you can see, the average population variance calculated from the sample was by 10% lower than the actual variance of the population, from which the samples were drawn. The sample variance was a better estimate. TBH this is the first time I see the term "quasi-variance". There is nothing quasi about that.
