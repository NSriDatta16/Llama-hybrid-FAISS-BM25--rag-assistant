split long 2D matrix into the third dimension

Say I have the following matrix: A = randi(10, [6 3]) 7 10 3 5 5 7 10 5 1 6 5 10 4 9 1 4 10 1 And I would like to extract each 2 rows and put them into the third dimension, so the result would be like: B(:,:,1) = 7 10 3 5 5 7 B(:,:,2) = 10 5 1 6 5 10 B(:,:,3) = 4 9 1 4 10 1 I can obviously do this with a for loop, just wondering how to do it more elegantly as one-liner using permute / reshape /.. (note matrix size and step must be parameters) % params step = 5; r = 15; c = 3; % data A = randi(10, [r c]); B = zeros(step, c, r/step); % assuming step evenly divides r % fill counter = 1; for i=1:step:r B(:,:,counter) = A(i:i+step-1, :); counter = counter + 1; end
