TensorFlow 2.0 output specification in NLP model

I just started playing with TensorFlow 2.0 now that the new api is out. However, I do not get the model output specification. The model below is a simple example from their site with the mnist dataset. If I understand correctly, there are 60000 images (28x28) pixels. Each input image has one corresponding digit (0-9) output. import tensorflow as tf mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data() x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0 print(y_train.shape) # Note from the print out, we have one dimensional training array i.e.:(60000,) but in the last layer we specify 10 nodes! Why? I understand why 10 nodes if the output was one_hot'ed - but as shown we have a single digit. If someone can explain whats going on here - I would really appreciate it.
