The presumption I feel you might be making is that a Machine Learning model is required for this task, but to be honest statistical approaches and less fashionable algorithms are available. The reality is training a ML model on your data is going to be a struggle because of the significant class imbalance and low volume of anomalies. That is why pretrained models are attractive, in particular Neural Networks. To get a feel of the range of options, I find the Python library pyOD a great resource. It has about 30 different ways to detect outliers.
