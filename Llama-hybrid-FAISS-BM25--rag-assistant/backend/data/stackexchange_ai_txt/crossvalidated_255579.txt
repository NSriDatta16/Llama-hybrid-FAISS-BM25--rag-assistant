Pre-whitening is used to help in the identification of a relation between two time series. So your next step should be to apply your obtained AR model to another time series y of interest to relate to your input x. If this is the case, 1) You can use the function filter from the R stats package. Name: a_model, the model you fitted for your input x. a_model To illustrate, suppose a_model gives a AR(2) model with phi1 = 0.6 , phi2 = -0.3 ; the output y can be pre-whitened with the filter function: b . You could then ask for the cross-correlation between the residuals of the pre-whitened x and the series b. 2) You could also use the prewhiten function from the TSA package to transform both series (x, y) and obtain the sample cross-correlation function between the two pre-whitened series. TSA::prewhiten(x, y, x.model = a_model)
