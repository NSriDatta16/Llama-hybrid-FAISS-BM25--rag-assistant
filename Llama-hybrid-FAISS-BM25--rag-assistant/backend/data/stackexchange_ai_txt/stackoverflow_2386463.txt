Inserting image into NSTableView using bindings

I've an NSTableView bound to an NSArrayController with two columns. One column is bound to the arranged objects of the array controller and displays a string. I'd like to display an image in the other column, but I just can't make it work. I've dragged an NSImageCell to the column and set the image by hand but it won't show up at runtime. I've double checked and the image is in my resources directory. Am I missing something? What else should I do to make that image appear?
