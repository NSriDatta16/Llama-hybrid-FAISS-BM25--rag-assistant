Your intuition here is not quite accurate and the situation is a bit more complicated than the way you are treating it. Nevertheless, since the parameter $q$ is known, this problem is a simple variation of the standard beta-binomial model used widely in Bayesian analysis. Since $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ and $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(q)$ you have: $$Z = XY \sim \text{Bernoulli}(pq).$$ If we observe IID data $Z_1,...,Z_n$ from this distribution then we obtain the sufficient statistic: $$\dot{Z}_n \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i \sim \text{Bin}(n, pq).$$ Taking the prior $p \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ then gives the posterior kernel: $$\begin{align} \pi(p|\mathbf{z}_n, q) &\propto \text{Bin}(\dot{z}_n | n, pq) \cdot \text{Beta}(p|\alpha, \beta) \\[6pt] &\propto (pq)^{\dot{z}_n} (1-pq)^{n-\dot{z}_n} p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Consequently, the posterior density function is: $$\pi(p|\mathbf{z}_n, q) = \frac{(pq)^{\dot{z}_n} (1-pq)^{n-\dot{z}_n} p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1}}{\int_0^1 (pq)^{\dot{z}_n} (1-pq)^{n-\dot{z}_n} p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1} \ dp}.$$ The scaling constant determined by the integral does not have a closed-form solution so you would need to evaluate it numerically. Alternatively you could simulate from the posterior distribution using MCMC methods or importance sampling methods.
