Trying to make a 2D array of lists

I'm trying to write a model containing digital organisms. Within the model i'd liek the environment to be a fixed 2-d array, but each cell needs to contain a list of the organisms in it. I tried using a jagged array, but as the number of occupied elements varies quite a bit throughout the programm run, i need to use something more flexible than an array. I've tried making a 2-D array of the type list, but im getting errors with it. List [,] theWorld; public Environment() { List [,] theWorld = new List [100,100]; } public void addCreature(Creature c) { for (int x = 0; x this is the segment where i'm trying to declare the array at the beginning, as a type that holds lists (of the organisms), and later i try to add a creature (c) to each of the lists in each element of the array. when i run it i get the following error message- "An unhandled exception of type 'System.NullReferenceException' occurred in HGT_sim_2.exe Additional information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object." and the line "World[x, y].Add (c);" is highlighted. If anyone can tell me what i'm doing wrong, and even better, a way around the problem, it'd be amazing. thank you ain advance!
