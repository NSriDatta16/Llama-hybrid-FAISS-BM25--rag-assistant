Can you ignore an exception from a 3rd party dll IN A SPECIFIC PLACE with the VS2008 debugger?

I'm using a 3rd party library (Fluent NHibernate) that throws a harmless "file not found" exception on startup when I run with "break on all Common Language Runtime Exceptions" enabled (Debug | Exceptions... menu). I realize I could just uncheck the specific "file not found" exception, but then I wouldn't get a break if this occured somewhere else in my code. Is there any way (pragma? attribute?) to suppress the exception, but only in the one place I know it will occur?
