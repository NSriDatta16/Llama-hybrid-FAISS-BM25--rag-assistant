Why do fixed effects in a logistic regression model differ depending on the presence of a random intercept?

If I have a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random intercept, the mean of the random intercepts is identical to the fixed intercept. My understanding is that this stems from the assumption that the random intercept components are normally distributed with mean zero. However if I have a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept, the mean of the random intercepts is close but not identical to the fixed intercept. The random intercept components do not sum to zero. Why? Example: library(lmerTest) # fake data y .5) group $group[,1]) # the mean of the random intercepts... summary(mod)$ coefficients[1,1] # is identical to the fixed component of the intercepts # with linear regression, the random effects sum to zero sum(ranef(mod)$group) mod_logistic $group[,1]) # the mean of the random intercepts... summary(mod_logistic)$ coefficients[1,1] # is close but NOT identical to the fixed component of the intercepts # with logistic regression, the random effects do NOT sum to zero sum(ranef(mod_logistic)$group)
