If the changes are only for that user, you can parse the data of the page and store them locally. Using some of the HTML5 goodies: http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/storage.html Then, when the user comes back, render it with a Javascript template engine. My heart goes to PURE but there's plenty of other options if you prefer the double brackets family of templates. If the changes are for all users, you could call a third server you own(appEngine, Amazon,...), to store the data, and deliver them through JSONP. And again render them with a JS template engine.
