What is a figure of the learned function in binary classification called?

Correct me if I'm wrong. When we talk about overfitting and underfitting we talk about how the output function made by the neural network is fitted in relation to the data. What is this function called? Is this just a visual aid to help understand the concept of over- and underfitting, or is it possible to actually plot this function for simple problems with 3 or less dimensions? Image from Wikipedias overfitting article: Can I plot these lines? What are these lines called?
