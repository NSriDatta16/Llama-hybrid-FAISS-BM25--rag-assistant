Migrate data in mysql from old schema to new schema

We have recently improved the schema of our production database, changing column names and indexes etc. We also changed the storage engine to InnoDB to make use of transactions and foreign keys. What is the best way to import the data from the old schema into the new schema? Bare in mind that column names have changed (including primary keys).
