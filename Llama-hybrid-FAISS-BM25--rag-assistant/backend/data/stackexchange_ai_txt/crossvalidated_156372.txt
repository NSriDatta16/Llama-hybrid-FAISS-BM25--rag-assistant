How to deal with different numbers of days in a month for comparison?

My question is very basic, and I'm looking for a conceptual answer. We put about 55000 values (individual deliveries) on a graph. They are sorted by day of the month to see if there's a trend and to allocate ressources correspondingly. The result looks like this. Obviously, the fact that some month have 28/29/30 or 31 days completely skew the analysis at month end. So far I thought of omiting any value happening after a 28th, use an average of all last days and put it backward on the 28th, "spread" the end of month values onto the whole month, trending the last missing day(s) for shorter months and put them all on 31 days What the "proper way" to deal with it (the way a professionnal statistician would)? PS: I may lack the vocabulary to search for it in Cross validated SE. Please let me know if it has been already answered.
