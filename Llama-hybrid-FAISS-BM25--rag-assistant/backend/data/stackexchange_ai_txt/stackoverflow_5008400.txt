It depends on how you're accessing data. If you want to access (or even modify) parts of your data separately, you're probably better off with storing it in raw form, indexes are easier to create that way. If the rest of the system treats your data as a black box, you'll probably want to store your data in XML format. A third alternative is to use an XML-aware (or even native XML) storage, which will allow you to build indexes and do efficient queries on parts of your XML data. But these are just general guidelines, a decision has to be made on a case-by-case basis.
