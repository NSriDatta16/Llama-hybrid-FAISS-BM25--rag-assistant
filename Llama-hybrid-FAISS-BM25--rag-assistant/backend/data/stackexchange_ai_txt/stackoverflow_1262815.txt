I make web based CSR apps. What your manager is forgetting is now the application is MUCH more complex. We are asking more from our reps than we did 15 years ago. We collect more information and record more data than before. Instead of a "greenscreen" application, you should focus on making the web application behave better. For example,dont have a dropdown for year when it can be a input field. Make sure the taborder is correct and sane, you can even put little numbers next to each field grouping to indicate tab order. Assign different screens/tabs to F keys and denote them on the screen. You should be able to use your web app without a mouse at all with no loss of productivity if done correctly. Leverage the use of AJAX so a round trip to the server doesn't change the focus of their cursor. On a CSR app, you often have several defaults. you should assign each default a button and allow the csr to push 1 button to get the default they want. this will reduce the amount of clicking and mousing around. Also very important You need to sit with the CSR's and watch them for a while to get a feel for how they use the app. if you haven't done this, you are probably overlooking simple changes that will greatly enhance their productivity.
