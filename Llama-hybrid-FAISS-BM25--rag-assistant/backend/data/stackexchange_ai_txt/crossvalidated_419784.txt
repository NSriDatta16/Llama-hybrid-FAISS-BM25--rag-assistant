A VAE models a distribution $$P(x) = \int P(x|z)P(z) dz$$ When the output is continuous valued, then a common parameterization of $P(x|z)$ is as $$\mathcal{N}(\mu = f(z;\theta), \sigma^2)$$ Recall that a VAE is trained by maximizing the variational lower bound, which can be broken down into two terms: $$E_{z \sim q}[\log P(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q(z)||p(z))$$ But then the first term is merely the log of the gaussian density, which is (up to some scaling and constants) $(x-\mu)^2$ . Hence MSE.
