You may find the dragon book to be helpful. The actual title is Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools ( amazon.com ). Check out the Intel Architectures Software Developer's Manuals for the complete documentation of the IA-32 and IA-64 instruction sets. AMD's architecture technical documents are available on its website as well. Linkers and Loaders ( amazon.com ) is a good introduction to object formats and linking issues. (The unedited original manuscript is also available online.)
