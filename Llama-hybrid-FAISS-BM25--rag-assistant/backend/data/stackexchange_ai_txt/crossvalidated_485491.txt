As I understand how VAE works, the KL loss can be considered as the regulariser and reconstruction loss is one that drives the model weighs to produce the correct output. To answer your specific question: "Can I use a lambda parameter to capture the tradeoff between kl divergence and reconstruction"; yes you can use a parameter rather a multiplayer such that $reconstruction_loss + \lambda \times kl_loss$ . However, $\lambda$ would have to assume a smaller value ( $1/28^2$ ). I found this paper useful to grasp the concepts in VAE in general. https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908
