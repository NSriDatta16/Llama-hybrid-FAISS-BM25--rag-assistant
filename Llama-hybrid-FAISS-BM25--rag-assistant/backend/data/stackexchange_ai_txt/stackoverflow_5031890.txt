How to access a resource inside a jar inside webstart directory of webapp using JnlpDownloadServlet

I have deployed a swing GUI via webstart-maven-plugin and JnlpDownloadServlet to my webapp in a servlet container (Glassfish 3.0). My GUI classes and resources are in a mygui-4.8.jar file that is in the webstart directory of my webapp along with the launch.jnlp file. The app is able to start fine when access by its launch.jnlp url in a web browser: http://localhost:8080/myserver/webstart/launch.jnlp However when code in my webapp tries to access an image resource that is inside the mygui-4.8.jar file it is unable to retrieve it. The code I use in the GUI to get the icon is: URL iconURL = getClass().getClassLoader().getResource("/icons/Find.png"); Using a debugger I see that the iconURL.toString() is returning the following URL: jar:http://localhost:8080/myserver/webstart/mygui.jar!/icons/Find.png I notice that the version is missing on the jar file name (is mygui.jar instead of mygui-4.8.jar). This seems to have something to do with the version handling in jnlp protocol. Can any one tell me what how I should rewrite my client code to get at these resources inside the jar file? Thanks for your help.
