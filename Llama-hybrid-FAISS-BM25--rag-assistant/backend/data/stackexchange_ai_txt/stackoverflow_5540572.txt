Is there anyway to Like a Facebook Page from within the website, or with the API?

I'm just wondering if there is anyway to have the like-page correspond to the Facebook Page rather than the website. My organization mirrors it's efforts inside of Facebook, and so I don't see any reason to even make Facebook aware of the website.
