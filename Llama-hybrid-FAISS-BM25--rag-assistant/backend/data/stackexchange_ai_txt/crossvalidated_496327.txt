For daily observations $y_{t}$ the 7-day rolling average is $\frac{y_{t-1} + \dots +y_{t-7}}{7}$ . There is an issue on the beginning, since we do not have enough observations, typically you have to wait until enough observations are available. This is a crude metric, even if you are strictly doing time series analysis, let alone trying to infer conclusions for such a complicated problem as a pandemic.
