Entity Framework does get confused from time to time. What you need to do is delete the Entity Table from the model, then rename the table in SQL Server to TableName_Temp, refresh the model, now the Entity Table should be OK, so delete the entity table again rename it back to the original name and refresh the model once more. This time everything should be fine. I know this is a messed up procedure but this is the only way I found to fix this issue without blowing away the entire edmx and starting from scratch. Currently at my organization we have a policy not to make changes to the EDMX unless absolutely necessary so that we can delete and recreate when ever needed without any problems. Hope this helps!
