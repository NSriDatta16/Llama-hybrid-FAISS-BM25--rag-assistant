You are trying to use logistic regression to find a possible structure to your residuals. Residuals should be unstructured. If logistic regression picks up something the model is misspecified. Great. Important: logistic regression looks for a very specific structure. Your method works only if residuals are broken in a very specific way. For this sort of detection use non-linear regressions. Kernel or Additive regression on the squared/log residuals are far more useful. Even better: they will allow you to model the whole variance. This answers your question of where the large errors really are.
