What is Logistic regression with clustered standard errors?

I am learning mixed effects logistic regression from this link . In section "Analysis methods you might consider", the author listed several options: Mixed effects logistic regression, the focus of this page. Mixed effects probit regression is very similar to mixed effects logistic regression, but it uses the normal CDF instead of the logistic CDF. Both model binary outcomes and can include fixed and random effects. Fixed effects logistic regression is limited in this case because it may ignore necessary random effects and/or non independence in the data. Fixed effects probit regression is limited in this case because it may ignore necessary random effects and/or non independence in the data. Logistic regression with clustered standard errors. These can adjust for non independence but does not allow for random effects. Probit regression with clustered standard errors. These can adjust for non independence but does not allow for random effects. I think I understand 1-4, but What is "Logistic regression with clustered standard errors" ?
