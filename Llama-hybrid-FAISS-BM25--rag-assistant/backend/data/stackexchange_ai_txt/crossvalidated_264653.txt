Please refer to Andrew Ng's lecture note on SVM here for detailed derivation. The original optimization is to maximize $\gamma$ with the following constraints: $$y^{(i)}(w^{T}x^{(i)}+b) \geq \gamma$$ $$||w|| = 1$$ (see page 6 - 7 of the notes). The second constraint, however, is hard to solve. So, in the derivation, the optimization is transformed from max $\gamma$ to max $\frac{\hat{\gamma}}{||w||}$ (by definition of functional and geometric margin) and the constraint becomes: $$y^{(i)}(w^{T}x^{(i)}+b) \geq \hat{\gamma}$$ Then, by introducing the scaling constraint for $w$ and $b$ such that $\hat{\gamma} = 1$ , the constraint becomes $$y^{(i)}(w^{T}x^{(i)}+b) \geq 1$$ In short, the value 1 in the constraint is simply due to scaling constraint, but the geometric margin $\gamma$ is maximized and can have value greater than 1.
