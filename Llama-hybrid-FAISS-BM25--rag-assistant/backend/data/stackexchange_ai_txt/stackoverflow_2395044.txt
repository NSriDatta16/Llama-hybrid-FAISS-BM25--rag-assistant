Did you tuned the maxRequestLength in the web.config? The problem is that the request size is greater than the value you have provided. Change the maxRequestLength in the httpRuntime section of the system.web config section of your web.config to accept greater values. You'll have to pay attention to the timeout value too. Good luck!.
