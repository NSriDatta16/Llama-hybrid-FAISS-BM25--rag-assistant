How would I map categories between two similar but different sets of categories

Having multiple sets of categories from different listings sites (e.g. Yelp, yellowpages.com, Google My Business...). I want to figure out what category X on one site is on another site. We have hundreds of thousands of businesses and the categories on all the sites they are on, so we could see that "Galbi Foo Restaurant" is in category "Restaurants > Korean" on one site and "Restaurants" on the other. Some examples category mappings that will have to happen: Nail Salons = Manicure & Pedicure Eyelash Service = Visagist Tanning = Sunbed Salon Specialty Food = Grocery (Specialty Food child node doesn't exist) Diagnostic Imaging = Radiologist Where would I start to solve this? It seems like a classification (logistic regression) problem. But this ML stuff hasn't clicked with me yet, so I'm likely to drastically over or under complicate these things :).
