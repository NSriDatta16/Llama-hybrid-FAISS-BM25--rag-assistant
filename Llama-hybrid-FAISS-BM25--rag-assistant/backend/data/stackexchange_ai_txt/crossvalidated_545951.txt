Logistic regression multivariate : Odds ratio / Wald-test

I have a small problem with one of my analyses. I'm doing a multivariate logistic regression so some continuous variables have been discredited by quartiles. Here are my results: OR and IC Variable unit OR lower limit IC upper limit IC Variable A 20 1.3437560 1.0814409 1.6757319 Variable B first quartile 1 2.0054150 0.8881467 4.8872483 Variable B second quartile 1 1.2150582 0.5014275 3.1025704 Variable B third quartile 1 1.4801394 0.6200311 3.7682139 Variable C first quartile 1 2.5960149 1.1427893 6.3318406 Variable C second quartile 1 2.7227333 1.2000598 6.6519756 Variable C third quartile 1 1.9318410 0.8255948 4.8292896 Variable D -200 1.0308258 0.8215131 1.3461578 Variable E -10 1.0478705 0.8473907 1.2948567 Variable F 1 1.0802896 0.5128503 2.1359383 Wald test Variable Df Chisq p-value Variable A 1 7.0270868 0.0080286 Variable B 3 3.4891983 0.3221658 Variable C 3 6.4613940 0.0911975 Variable D 1 0.0573684 0.8107047 Variable E 1 0.1876317 0.6648951 Variable F 1 0.0455897 0.8309234 For my variable C, which has been discredited, the confidence interval of the first and second quartile does not include 1 so significant, but my variable C is not significant according to the Wald test. As I understand (With my humble knowledge in statistics) the Wald test in the context of logistic regression is used to determine whether a certain predictor variable is significant or not. It rejects the null hypothesis of the corresponding coefficient being zero. How can I interpret this result ? Should I reject the entire variable or just the third quartile?
