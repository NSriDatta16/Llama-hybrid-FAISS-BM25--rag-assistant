How would you design a good search UI?

I want to provide my users with an 'advanced' search engine. I basically have a lot of search criteria to chose from : some are very simple/common and will be largely use (ie time period, item id) some are a bit less mainstream and some won't be used a lot, but I still want to provide them Overall, I have around 30+ criteria to chose from The result is a dataset which I display in a grid. I've search for inspiration on internet, and even google doesn't seem to have a nice solution for advanced search. I've designed this kind of tools in the past, and I wasn't really pleased by the result, although the user were eventually able to use it quite effectively. Do you think the search panel should be visible all the time (ie displayed on top of my result grid) or available in a separate form (which would let me use more place for all the controls) Do you think it's better to display all the search criteria, or to let the user click on 'advanced' if he wants to see/use more criteria How would you organize the criteria? by usage frequency, or rather by area (ie. criteria related to user, to location, to time, etc.) Where should I put the 'Search' button? next to the more common search controls, or at the bottom, or both? And more generally, do you have tips you want to share on how to design a nice search UI ? What kind of functionalities do you usually miss in this kind of 'advanced' search engines?
