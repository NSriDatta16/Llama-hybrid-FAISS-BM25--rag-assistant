Bayes risk for Bayesian classifier with multivariate Gaussian

Suppose, I'm doing a classification with two classes in $\mathbb{R^d}$. The true class-conditional probability distribution of two classes are multivariate Gaussian with mean $\mathbf{\mu_1}$ and $\mathbf{\mu_2}$ but same covariance $ \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}$. What will be the Bayes risk (error rate) of this Bayes classifier? Is there a closed form formula? If not, how does it depend on $d$ i.e does it increase or decrease with $d$, dimension of the space? or What about $\sigma$?
