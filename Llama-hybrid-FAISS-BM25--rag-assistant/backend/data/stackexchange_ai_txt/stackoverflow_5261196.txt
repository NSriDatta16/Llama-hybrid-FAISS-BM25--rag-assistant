You don't state how you save customer interests, so I'll relegate that one to magic until you say otherwise. A good way to do this is to hook an event to the catalog_product_save_after event in Magento. This function will fire whenever you save products. Create an observer that looks something like this: public function observeProductSave($event) { $product = $event['product']; $customers = $this->getMatchingCustomerInterests($product); foreach($customers as $customer) { //send email to that customer } } public function getMatchingCustomerInterests($product) { // here you'll need to use your mechanism for saving // customer interests to grab an array/collection of // customers to send the emails to. } Obviously this code is not 100% complete, but that's the gist of it. You will probably want to add a facility to make sure that customers are not notified too many times about a product as well. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
