How to return a value from inside an interator in Javascript

I have a function that I want to return true or false. Inside the function I iterate through some elements on the page and check their values. But if I put a return statement inside the iterator, it will return from the anonymous function right? (and not the outer function). function someElementHasZeroValue() { $('.some-class').each(function(){ if($(this).html() == '0'){ return true; } }); return false; } So this function always returns false no matter what. What is the best way to do this? The solution below seems to work but it doesn't seem very elegant. function someElementHasZeroValue() { elements_found_with_zero_value = 0; $('.some-class').each(function(){ if($(this).html() == '0'){ elements_found_with_zero_value += 1; } }); if(elements_found_with_zero_value > 0){ return true; }else { return false; } } More generally, does anyone know why Javascript requires you to iterate through elements with an anonymous function as opposed to a normal iterator like most languages, or is there some way to do it I'm not aware of?
