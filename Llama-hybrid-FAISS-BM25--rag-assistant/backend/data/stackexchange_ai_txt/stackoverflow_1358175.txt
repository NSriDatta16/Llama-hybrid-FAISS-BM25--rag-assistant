keeping the selection "permanent" in the UITableView cell

I seem to be having a problem in my UITableView clicking behaviour. I'm using a Tree to create a hiearchy of tableviews. My problem arises when I enter the following screen ( I produced some screenshots to clarify ). 1) When I enter this screen http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/4050/samplec.png I can go to my next tableview by clicking on my info button below( second from the left)( so not by clicking on the cell ). This works. It will go to the tableview associated with the previous row. Here is where my "problem" starts. As soon as I click outside my current tableview , for instance on the empty cell below or if I click the same cell and drag it a bit, then my cell will become unselected. 2) As you can see in the image below. http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/5930/sample3i.png I do not want this to happen. I want my cell despite the fact that I'm clicking around to stay selected. Is there a way to realize this?
