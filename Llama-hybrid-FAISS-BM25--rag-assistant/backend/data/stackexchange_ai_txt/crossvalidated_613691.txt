The p-value is a function of both the effect size and the sample size. If you have a gigantic sample size but a tiny (or zero) effect size, then you still do not have to wind up with small p-values. In the case where the null hypothesis really is true and there is no correlation, the p-value should be $\le0.05$ only $5\%$ of the time. If the null is only slightly incorrect, then even a small sample size might result in $6\%$ or $12\%$ of the p-values being $\le0.05$ .
