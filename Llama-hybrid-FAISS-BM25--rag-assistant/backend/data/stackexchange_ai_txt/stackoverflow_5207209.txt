The purpose of compatibility with C is so that C++ programs can have convenient access to the billions (trillions?) of lines of existing C code in the world. It was never intended as a suggestion to code C++ as if it was C. Peripheral objectives were: Leverage the C skills that many programmers have (given that it is still one of the most widely used languages in the world). Encourage the use of C++ as a better C, for: a) easing the transition to C++, and b) improve C coding practices for programmers who have no intention of going to C++.
