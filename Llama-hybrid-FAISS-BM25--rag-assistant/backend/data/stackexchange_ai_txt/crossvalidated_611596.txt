You can also compute a standardized mean difference that does not assume homoscedasticity but that uses the square-root of the average of the two variances in the denominator. Then you don't have to choose which group's SD is used in the denominator. See Bonett (2008, 2009) for further details. Bonett, D. G. (2008).
