I don't know of any development that treats regular expressions by themselves. Finite automata, however, relevant since NFAs are the standard way to match those regular expressions, have been studied in NuPRL . Have a look at : Robert L. Constable, Paul B. Jackson, Pavel Naumov, Juan Uribe. Constructively Formalizing Automata Theory . Should you be interested in approaching those formal languages through algebra , esp. developing finite semigroup theory , there are a number of algebra libraries developed in various theorem provers that you could think of using, with one particularly efficient in a finite setting .
