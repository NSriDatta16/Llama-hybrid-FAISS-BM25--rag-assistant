Using SVM coupled with RBF kernel for EEG data classification

I want to classify the significant features obtained from nonlinear methods using SVM-RBF kernel function. I have used 10-fold cross validation that divides 180 samples as training set and remaining 20 as testing set. Can you please guide me through the steps on how to implement SVM with RBF kernel to classify the data into two groups?
