I've found that computing exponetially weighted running averages using $\overline{x} \leftarrow \overline{x} + \alpha (x - \overline{x})$, $\alpha a simple one-line method, that is easily, if only approximately, interpretable in terms of an "effective number of samples" $N=\alpha^{-1}$ (compare this form to the form for computing the running average), only requires the current datum (and the current mean value), and is numerically stable. Technically, this approach does incorporate all history into the average. The two main advantages to using the full window (as opposed to the truncated one discussed in the question) are that in some cases it can ease analytic characterization of the filtering, and it reduces the fluctuations induced if a very large (or small) data value is part of the data set. For example consider the filter result if the data are all zero except for one datum whose value is $10^6$.
