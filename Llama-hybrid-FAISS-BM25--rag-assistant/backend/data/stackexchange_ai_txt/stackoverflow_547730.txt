Modern day, unicode-friendly ".ini file" to store config data in VB6

I'd like to store the contents of a data structure, a few arrays, and a dozen or so variables in a file that can be saved and reloaded by my software as well as optionally edited in a text editor by a user reloaded. For the text editing, I need the data to be clearly labeled, like in a good ole .ini file: AbsMaxVoltage = 17.5 There's a GUI, and one could argue that the user should just load and save and modify from the GUI, but the customer wants to be able to read and modify the data as text. It's easy enough to write code to save it and reload it (assuming all the labels are in the same place and only the data has changed). With more work (or using some of the INI R/W code that's already out there I could pay attention to the label so if a line gets deleted or moved around the variables still get stuffed correctly, but both of these approaches seem pretty old-school. So I'm interested in how the brightest minds in programming would approach this today (using decade-old VB6 which I have to admit I still love). Disclaimer: I'm an electrical engineer, not a programmer. This isn't my day job. Well maybe it's a few % of my day job. Cheers!
