If I understand correctly, your question is about the reason to use MSSA for a system of time series, if one can apply PCA (or SVD) to this system. The general answer is that the result of PCA is mostly an unstructured approximation (I mean from the viewpoint of the temporal structure), while SSA takes into consideration the temporal structure. Note that SSA is related to so-called SLRA (structured low-rank approximation). The other (although there is a little point in this) answer is that if you have m time series of length N, m A more clever example is related to decomposition to a signal and noise when the signal is described by a few SSA components (it is fulfilled if the time series is well approximated by a finite sum of products of polynomials, exponentials and sinusoids). For example, let time series from the system consist of noisy sinusoids with some small Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). PCA does not help to extract the signal for any time series length N. SSA applies SVD (PCA without centering/standardizing) to the trajectory matrix, which consists of lagged subseries of length L. For sufficiently large L and N, SSA is able to approximately extract the signal; for any SNR! The same effect is for the case, when time series consist of temporal components like trend and oscillations. Direct approximation by PCA does not help to extract one of the components. SSA is able to do it due to the bi-orthogonality of the SVD. See SSA literature for a description of the 'separability' notion. Thus, for times series, PCA usually does not work. The other important question, what is better, to apply MSSA to the system of time series or to apply SSA to each time series separately.
