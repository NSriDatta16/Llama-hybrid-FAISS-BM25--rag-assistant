Should I reword the Factor if it shows all negative loadings?

I've seen very similar questions but none really address my issue. I ran a PCA on 29 items to identify different factors of stress and worry. All items were on a scale from 1 to 3 and none of these were reversed coded (Higher scores mean higher stress and worry). When I run the PCA the factors I obtain make sense in the grouping of the items; I've called these Depressive stress, Impulsive and Physiological. The fourth one incorporates items that reflect "Low energy" and they all have negative loadings. I have created factor scores for all 4 and run a cluster analysis. The cluster analysis only seems to make sense if I refer to the last factor as "High energy" rather than low, and I'm guessing this is because of the negative factor loadings. What should I do? I would like to use the name "Low Energy" so that it similarly indicates high stress as the other factors. Can I some how reverse the factor score?
