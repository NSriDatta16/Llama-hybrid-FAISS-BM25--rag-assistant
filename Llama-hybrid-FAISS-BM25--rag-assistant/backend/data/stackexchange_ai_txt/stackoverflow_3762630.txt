If you only have few experience of Drupal and CMS in general and only want to quickly add a form to collect files from registered users and only use Drupal as a basic CMS for your website, the Webform module is probably the easiest solution. It allows you to build a forms for PDF files and additional information submission. The submissions can be stored in the database, sent by email or even exported to a spreadsheet or a CSV file. Registred users are even able to edit their submissions. Another solution is to use the CCK and the FileField modules to build a content type for submissions and allow registred users create new content using this type. If you go this way, you can build many additional feature. You can use taxonomies to organize submissions by category and/org tags. You can allow users to view, comment, rate , or flag submissions. With Views you can create lists of submissions by state (accepted, rejected), category, etc.
