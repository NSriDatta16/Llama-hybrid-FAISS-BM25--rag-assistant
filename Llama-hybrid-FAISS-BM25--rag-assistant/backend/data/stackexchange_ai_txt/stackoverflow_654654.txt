Try returning HTTP 204 No Content. See the description of this response code in RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 ) where it says: If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although any new or updated metainformation SHOULD be applied to the document currently in the user agent's active view.
