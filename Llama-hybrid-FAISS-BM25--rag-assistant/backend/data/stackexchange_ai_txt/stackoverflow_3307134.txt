Bringing unit testing to an existing project

I'm working on an existing Java EE project with various maven modules that are developed in Eclipse, bundled together and deployed on JBoss using Java 1.6. I have the opportunity to prepare any framework and document how unit testing should be brought to the project. Can you offer any advice on... JUnit is where I expect to start, is this still the defacto choice for the Java dev? Any mocking frameworks worth setting as standard? JMock? Any rules that should be set - code coverage, or making sure it's unit rather than integration tests. Any tools to generate fancy looking outputs for Project Managers to fawn over? Anything else? Thanks in advance.
