This is a feature engineering problem. That patients have not been visited yet is valuable informationen but also clearly not on the same scale as minutes until visit. Create a new categorical variable 1=visited and 0=not visited. Additionally instead of imputation try using a model that can cope with NA like randomforest or XGB.
