Inject raw fragmented packets

I'm trying to inject a fragment packet and i can't. I see that if i have one udp packet witch has been split to two Ip packets i can't inject only the second part, my operation system (windows Xp) seems to wait for the first part before it injects the two fragmented packets. I don't have routers in the way or something like that, because I'm sending the packets to another computer which connected to my computer in cross. I have tried it with 3 different kinds of NIC. I'm sure that the packets are waiting in my computer (the sender) I have proved it if you want I will post the experiment. I have tried to play with the flags and nothing. If i try to send only the first part on one computer it seems to work (weird) but I can't explain it. please don't tell my to switch to Linux it is really problematic. Thank you all. It is really important.
