Because your fragments are shuffled, your algorithm needs to take that into account; currently, you're just looping through the fragments once, which is unlikely to include more than a few fragments if they're not in the right order. For example, say you have 5 fragments, which I'm going to refer to by their order in your sequence. Now the fragments are slightly out of order: 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 5 Your algorithm will start with 1, skip 3, then match on 2, adding a base at the end. Then it'll check against 4 and 5, and then finish, never reaching fragment 3. You could easily fix this by starting your loop again each time you add a base, however, this will scale very badly for a large number of bases. Instead, I'd recommend loading your fragments into a trie , and then searching the trie for the next fragment each time you add a base, until you've added one base for each fragment or you can no longer find a matching fragment.
