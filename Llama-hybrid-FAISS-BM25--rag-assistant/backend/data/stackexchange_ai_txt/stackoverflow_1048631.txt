In terms of encapsulation, each object, whether a class or an interface, should be in its own file. Even if the interface only contains one abstract method, the fact that it's in a different file allows for better organization and better encapsulation. You can store those different interfaces in a folder, give it an appropriate namespace, and therefore a cleaner solution.
