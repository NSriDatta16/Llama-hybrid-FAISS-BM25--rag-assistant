There was one about diet that looked at diet in different countries and concluded that meat caused all sorts of problems (e.g. heart disease), but failed to account for the average lifespan in each country: The countries that ate very little meat also had lower life expectancies and the problems that meat "caused" were ones that were linked to age. I don't have citations for this - I read about it about 25 years ago - but maybe someone will remember or maybe you can find it.
