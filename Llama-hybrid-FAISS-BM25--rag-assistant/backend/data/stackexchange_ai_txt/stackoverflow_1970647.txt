strcpy does not allocate any storage to hold the result. You're using a "random" pointer as the destination which is why you are seeing segfaults. A very simple implementation of strcpy would look like void naivestrcpy(char* destination, const char* source) { while(*source) *destination++ = *source++; *destination = 0; } strcpy does exactly what it says on the tin, it copies. It does not ensure you've loaded the right size of paper into the xerox tray.
