Power analysis of binary predictor in cohort

I'm trying to run a power analysis in Stata, using chi2 (even though I am using logistic regression, I just can't find an option for it and I'm new to power analysis) and it seems I have to choose how the groups are allocated. My study is a cohort study so there is only one group. Is power analysis not computable without certain group allocation? I know how many have the outcome and how many don't.
