How to store a trained Random Forest model in python or matlab as a matrix

Is it possible to store a random forest model in python (or matlab). Then use that trained model in a C program? I am trying to do this because I am making a myoelectric prosthetic, and you can only write to the chip we are using (PIC32MK0512MCF064) with C code. My first thought on how to attempt this was to store the model as a matrix but I dont know if that is even possible? Any clues? anything that could help would be greatly appreciated
