No, you do not need to know real analysis to learn statistics. In fact, in many universities (intro level) statistics courses are not even in the math department. One can make a lot progress in statistics by letting the computer do all the math and you worrying only in how the statistical methods are being applied. However, if you want to understand why the rules/tables are what they are then you need to know probability theory. The deeper you want to understand probability theory the more real analysis (really measure theory) you need to know. But at some point you reach diminishing returns. Sometimes you know too much and it just does not help you anymore in the uses of statistics. So it is not required to know advanced math. However, knowing more (up to a certain extend without overdoing it) lets you apply it better and use better statistical techniques that you otherwise would not come up with. Here are some books on statistics that do not use any measure theory: Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman, Statistical Rethinking by McElreath, Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by Krushcke, Statistical Models by Freedman, Linear Models in Statistics by Rencher. What do you notice about these books? These are all extremely well known books that are used to learn statistics, and they all avoid measure theory. In fact, there is not a single $\delta,\varepsilon$ proof in any one of them. McElreath's book even goes further to essentially eliminate all math from the subject and reduce it down to computer programming. Now look at one of the most well-known and respected books on measure based probability theory, "Probability" by Shiryaev. There are virtually no statistical applications in that book anywhere. He does mention a few, but that is about it. So if you are interested in learning statistics then you need to learn statistics. You can learn measure theory based probability on a need-to-know basis. However, if you start from the "ground up" and start with measure theory then you will hardly ever reach statistics in the end.
