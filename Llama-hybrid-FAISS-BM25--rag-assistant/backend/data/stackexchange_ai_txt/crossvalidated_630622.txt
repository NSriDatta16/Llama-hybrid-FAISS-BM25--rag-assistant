I would say the fact that you integrate them out is what makes them latent variables; they no longer appear in the likelihood either as parameters or as data. You could, in principle, regard the $z_i$ as parameters (and perhaps call them $\zeta_i$ ), and obtain a likelihood $p(X; \zeta,\theta)$ that would be written the same as $P(X|Z;\theta)$ . The problem with doing that is that the maximum likelihood estimators are not consistent. It's a technically valid choice, but a bad one. Or, if you were a Bayesian, you wouldn't make any technical distinction between latent variables and parameters. You would still need to make a basically similar decision about using a hierarchical prior over the $z_i$ (which is more like treating them as a latent variable) or using something like independent priors (which is more like treating them as parameters). Again, it would probably be better for estimation to use the hierarchical prior.
