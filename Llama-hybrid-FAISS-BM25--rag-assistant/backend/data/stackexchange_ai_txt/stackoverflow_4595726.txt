Disabling copying in dojo.dnd

By default a dojo.dnd.Source container allows you to hold Ctrl to duplicate/copy a dragged item rather than just move it. I know you can set singular=true to stop multiple items being dragged but how do I stop copying? Duplicating items makes no sense in the context of my items (I am making a draggable list for reordering pages on a website menu). Thanks
