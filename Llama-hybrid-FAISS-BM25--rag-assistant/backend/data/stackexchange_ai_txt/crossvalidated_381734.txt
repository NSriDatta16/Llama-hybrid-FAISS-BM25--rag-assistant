First of, since SNPs as an input are usually encoded as binary (or {0,1,2} when considering heterozygosity) and are very numerous, I'm not sure if the PCA output will be meaningful, but it probably depends on what you're trying to archive. Second, if your input is a set of SNPs, you're essentially looking at GWAS (genome wide association study) in case the response is categorical, such as case / control, or QTL (quantitative trait loci) analysis, in case your response is continuous, such as gene expression or an individuals height. GWAS is usually done SNP-wise via hypothesis testing using e.g. Chi-Square or more recently, using machine learning methods such as random forests, because they are (at least theoretically) able to deal with SNP interactions. QTL analysis can be done using ANOVA, but there might be other methods aswell.
