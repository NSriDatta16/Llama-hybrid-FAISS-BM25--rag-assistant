It's not much elegant but you can use some redirection trick to catch the number of bytes copied by dd and then use it as the exit condition for a while loop: while [ -z "$byte_copied" ] || [ "$byte_copied" -ne 0 ]; do sleep $X; byte_copied=$(dd bs=$Y count=1 2>&1 >&4 | awk '$2 == "byte"{print $1}'); done 4>&1 However, if your intent is to limit the transfer throughput, I suggest you to use pv.
