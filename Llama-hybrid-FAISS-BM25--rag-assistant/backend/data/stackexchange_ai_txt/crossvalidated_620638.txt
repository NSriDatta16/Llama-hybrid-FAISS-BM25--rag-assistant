Let $\mathcal C$ be the event where the person is in a car and $\mathcal H$ be its complement (not in a car). This event is random and your narrative implicitly supposes its probability $p = \Pr(\mathcal C)$ is unvarying. Let $x$ represent any number and contemplate the cumulative distribution function of $X,$ defined as $$\begin{aligned} F_X(x) &= \Pr(X\le x) \\ &= \Pr(H \le x\mid \mathcal H)\Pr(\mathcal H) + \Pr(C \le x\mid \mathcal C)\Pr(\mathcal C) \\ &= F_H(x)(1-p) + F_C(x)p.\\ \end{aligned}$$ These equalities use only basic properties of probabilities. This convex combination of CDFs is called a mixture distribution with weights $1-p$ and $p.$ When the variables $H$ and $C$ have densities (pdfs), the density of the mixture is the same linear combination of the densities: that's a direct application of the sum rule of differentiation. In your notation, $f_X(x) = (1-p)f_H(x) + pf_C(x).$ What is $g$ ? You ask to express $X$ as $X = g(H,C).$ That appears to be a form of weighted coproduct of random variables. I will sketch the construction. It generalizes a construction that has been called a "coproduct" where $p$ is limited to $1/2.$ The formal definitions tell us the random variables are functions $H:(\Omega_H,\mathfrak F_H, \mathbb P_H)\to \mathbb R$ and $C:(\Omega_C,\mathfrak F_C, \mathbb P_C)\to \mathbb R,$ possibly on two distinct probability spaces. Given these, define $$\Omega = \{(\eta, 0)\mid \eta\in\Omega_H\}\cup \{(0,\gamma)\mid \gamma\in\Omega_C\}$$ (the set coproduct of the sample space), push the sigma algebras forward into $\Omega$ via the canonical embeddings $\Omega_H\to \Omega$ and $\Omega_C\to\Omega$ and generate a sigma-algebra $\mathfrak F$ from them, and for a specified $0\lt p\lt 1$ define a probability measure on that sigma-algebra via $$\mathbb P((\mathcal H\times \{0\}) = (1-p)\mathbb P_H(\mathcal H)$$ for all $\mathcal H \in\mathfrak F_H$ and $$\mathbb P(\{0\}\times \mathcal C) = p\mathbb P_C(\mathcal C)$$ for all $\mathcal C \in\mathfrak F_C.$ The random variable $X$ can then be defined as $$X((\eta, 0)) = H(\eta);\quad X((0,\gamma)) = C(\gamma)$$ for all $\eta\in\Omega_H$ and $\gamma\in\Omega_C.$ It is an elementary exercise in applying definitions to verify that this is well-defined and $X$ is indeed a random variable whose distribution is the intended mixture of the distributions of $H$ and $C.$ A convenient notation to abbreviate this entire categorical construction would be something like $$X = H\coprod_{(1-p,\ p)} C.$$ Remarks For a fuller account of the definitions, see https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/149860/919 . For related calculations, including code to compute CDFs and quantile functions of mixtures, visit https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/411671/919 . To learn how to draw random variates from a mixture (with general-purpose code) see https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/64058/919 . You can conceive of any (non-constant) distribution as a mixture. The analysis at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/299765/919 gives an interesting example of running this operation in reverse by dissecting a given distribution into a mixture of two other distributions.
