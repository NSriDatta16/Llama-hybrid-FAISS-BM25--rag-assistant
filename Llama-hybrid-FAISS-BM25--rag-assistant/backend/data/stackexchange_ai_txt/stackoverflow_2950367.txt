Drupal drag-able blocks issue

Druapl offers great functionality whereby blocks can be dragged up and down to reorder as shown below. alt text http://citywest.bangtest.co.uk/with.png However, on a couple of projects I've been working on they have disappeared during development )as shown below) but I have no idea why! It must be something that I am doing wrong but for the life of me I can't work out why. alt text http://citywest.bangtest.co.uk/without.png
