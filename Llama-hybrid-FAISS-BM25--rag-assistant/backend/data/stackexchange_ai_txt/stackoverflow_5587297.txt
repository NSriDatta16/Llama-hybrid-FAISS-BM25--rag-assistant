I would argue that if you only need the top 100 values, why not use an inverted selection sort that cuts off after 100 iterations? Selection sort guarantees that one value will be put into the correct position on each pass, so after 100 runs through the list the top values should be the one you want. I'm sure a more elegant solution exists, but this should be simple to implement.
