Sorting a multidimensional array by numeric value of a dimension that's not the first

I am creating a search capability for a forum program I'm building. At one point I have an array called searchResults which is numeric and contains 'score' as one of its dimensions (others are 'timeStarted', 'authorUID', and 'TID') So, this array is in disarray at this point and I need to organize it to where $searchResults[1] will be the highest 'score' and [2] will have the second highest, etc. I looked at array_multisort on php.net but got rapidly lost in how it worked. So how would I sort $searchResults in numeric order (rearrange the keys) descending with a descending order of a further dimension 'sort' as the sorting mechanism? There really isn't any code to go with it but if you need a layout of how the array looks, here you go: $searchResults: [1] - ['timeStarted'] ['authorUID'] ['score'] Thanks for any help.
