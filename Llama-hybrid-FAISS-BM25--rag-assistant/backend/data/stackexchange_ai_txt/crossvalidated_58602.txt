have you read up on land degradation theory? i think the issue is that you are trying use RF to classify degradation into a static map, when degradation is something that occurs over time. in degradation theory, you would have a vegetation state at time t0...tn, but the static map cannot be used to evaluate a vegetative state in a time series. how a state or pixel changes over time would be the quantification of degradation. differences in a static state may actually be simply do to less growth potential such as inter-annual rainfall. i would use RF to create an estimate of the veg state-say biomass or production for say 2001-then repeat this map for a time series- say 10 years. regress the pixels over time. when the pixels decrease on a slope, you have degradation. when the pixels are stable or at 0, you have ecosystem stability or resilience. when the pixels increase, you have the anti-thesis of degradation.
