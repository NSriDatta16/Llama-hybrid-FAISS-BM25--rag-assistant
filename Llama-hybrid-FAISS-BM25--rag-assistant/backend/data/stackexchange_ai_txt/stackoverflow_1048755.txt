I don't know whether this also works in c#2.0, this is my experience in c#3.0: Why do you use TextBox_Leave for that? The Validating-event should be used for validating whether input is correct. Combine using the Validating-event with using an ErrorProvider (you can just drag it from the toolbox onto the form) to set an error message: it will be displayed as a (blinking) exclamation mark in a red triangle. An ErrorProvider can also block any submit-actions.
