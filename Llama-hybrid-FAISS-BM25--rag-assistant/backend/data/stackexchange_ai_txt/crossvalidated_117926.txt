I assume that you want to do (or start with) GLM, not any other model. First, the mixture of binary and numerical predictors does work for GLM. Second, you should split the diagnosis to 2, not 3, columns (normal->(0,0), intermediate->(0,1), severe->(1,1) or (1,0)), otherwise your matrix will be degenerate. Third, don't split the age column to 100 or so binary columns! If the age A is 0 to 100, you may split the column to, say, 10 binary columns: A, max(0,A-10), max(0,A-20) ... max(0,A-90) in order to take into account the possible non-linearity. Check the number of columns which behaves optimally for the cross-validation. Fourth, the weight alone, without height, is not very useful for predicting the outcome. You could at least use the ratio $\mathrm{Weight}\over \mathrm{Average\ weight\ for\ the\ gender\ and\ age}$. This ratio could be divided to several intervals as above. The important factor is how many records you have. A rule of thumb is, the number of predictors should not exceed the number of records divided by 5-10.
