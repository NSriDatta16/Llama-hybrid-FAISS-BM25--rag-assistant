Machine learning to find an optimal set of parameters for a segmentation algorithm

Using machine learning to find an optimal set of parameters for a given segmentation algorithm. In the "classical" case of machine learning, in the training phase, the data set is constant and the model fit -- produces a weight vector that maps the data set to the tag of each image label. Now let's assume a given segmentation problem X, which is done using a given classic segmentation algorithm Y (classic, not Deep-Learning). The goal is to find an optimal parameter set for the Y algorithm under the set of ground truth segmentation. (Motivation: every segmentation algo. Have tuned, parameters, we want to learn them not to fine tune them) I think about the two approaches of making the this: Offline - Extraction of General properties - let's say Haralick texture features and try to fit a model connecting between the parameters of the segmentation algorithm Y to the Haralick texture features. Online - Select random parameters for the Segmentation Y algorithm. Perform a segmentation for those parameters and a specific delta. Calculate the error and then updated the parameters accordingly. Any example/reference(paper) for the "online" approach would be welcome.
