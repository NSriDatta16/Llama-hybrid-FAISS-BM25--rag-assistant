How can I unit test RelayCommand DropFile?

I'm trying out MVVM Light, partly inspired by the EventToCommand capabilities which seem to make it easier to handle drag-and-drop from outside my app in the View Model and in the XAML. However I am a confused by how to unit test the RelayCommand. My RelayCommand is declared simply public RelayCommand DropFile { get; private set; } and then the functionality is assigned within the ViewModel constructor, not inline but using a method on the ViewModel this.DropFile = new RelayCommand (dropFileHandler); When I'm writing a unit test for the DropFile RelayCommand I cannot see what to call? Should I be calling testTarget.DropFile.Execute(params) and how does one construct the params since DragEventArgs has only an empty constructor, and its key properties are just getters not setters?
