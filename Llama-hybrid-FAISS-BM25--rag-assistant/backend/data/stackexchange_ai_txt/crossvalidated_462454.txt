Why are boosted trees difficult to interpret?

I might not fully understand the topic but: Bootstrapped/bagged trees are difficult to interpret because the decisions are made from averaging the prediction of possibly hundreds of trees (ensemble). But with boosted trees, don't we end up with one tree? If so, visualizing this tree should be as simple as visualizing a normal decision tree, right? The only difference would be that it's more unclear how it got to those specific rules since it uses boosting. However, I've also read that it's difficult to interpret a boosted tree. Could someone please clarify?
