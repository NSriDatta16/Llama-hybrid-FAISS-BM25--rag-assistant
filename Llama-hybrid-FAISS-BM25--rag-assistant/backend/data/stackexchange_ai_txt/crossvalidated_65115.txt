You have a response variable and a bunch of what may be explanatory variables. This makes classification possible (supervised learning techniques). Statistical modeling, for example logistic regression, is possible as well. There are a bunch of different techniques and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. You said you wan't the classification to be probabilistic, though I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. For example, the final output of a neural network is possible to interpret as a probability because of the final sigmoid function linking the information together. In a fraud detection context, the response variable tend to be very skewed. There tend to be very few positive observations (the frauding lot). Classification techniques tend to look to minimize the error between observated values and predicted values, and they do not care that it may considered more important to find the frauders, as long as the total error rate is reasonably low. This is why you probably need to oversample the minority class. My advise would be to look into the SMOTE-algorithm, it will minimize overfitting if used correctly. There are other ways to go as well, anomaly detection and techniques from that area might be worth looking into.
