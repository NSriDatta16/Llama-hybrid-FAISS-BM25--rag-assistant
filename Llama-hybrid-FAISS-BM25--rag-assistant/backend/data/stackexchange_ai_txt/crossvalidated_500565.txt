Low Correlation between Independent and Dependent Variable

I've been trying to look for an answer related to my problems but wasn't able to find any. Hope you can shed some light. I am running several algorithms to do Classification Prediction, however, when I checked my DV & IV correlation, I am getting very low result (highest is around 0.23, with majority lies in the 0.00x). From what I know, variable correlation is very important when you're applying ML algorithms such as linear and logistic regression? But I've also heard that some ML Algorithms are not affected by variable correlation? Mind you, when I checked the accuracy of my models it leads to very high accuracy of >90% (used logistic regression, decision tree, random forest). Thank you.
