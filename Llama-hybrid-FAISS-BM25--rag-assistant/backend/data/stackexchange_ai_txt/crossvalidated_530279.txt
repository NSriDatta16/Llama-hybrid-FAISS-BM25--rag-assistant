Accuracy assessment for multinomial probabilities

I am working on a classification problem where the input data are multinational proportions for each point, with $m$ >2 groups. And the outcome is likewise a multinomial proportion for that point. For example, if we have $m=4$ groups, then for point $i$ , the observed proportions would be something like: $y_i = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)'$ The result of the model is a new set of predicted proportions for point $i$ : $\hat{y}_i = (0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3)'$ Is there a standard way to calculate the accuracy of this output across all $n$ observations? It's not really a classification problem, since I'm not doing strict classification. It also reminds me of various kappa statistics in land cover classification, but again, I don't really have any strict classification. It's really about comparing how close one vector of proportions is to another. I can come up with a bunch of ad hoc ways to calculate the average error across my $n$ training points, but this seems like a standard question, and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. EDIT: The best I've found so far is the Bhattacharyya coefficient which is used for various image analysis feature selection and accuracy assessment. It's not super common otherwise, so I'm still hoping to find a better options.
