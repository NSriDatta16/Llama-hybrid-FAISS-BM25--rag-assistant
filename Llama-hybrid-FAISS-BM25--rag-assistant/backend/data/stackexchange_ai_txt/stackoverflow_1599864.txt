i just want to give my opinion about your post. You forget a important thing in your analyse. Developpers HAVE TO check variables in the server side script. If you use javascript (like uploadify, or your own script) or if you don't use javascript (just a simple FORM in html), YOU HAVE to check the data in the server side script. So no matter if you are using uploadify or not for your security. Don't forget that it's easy to buid HTTP request and send it to the server. So the security of a web application not depends of the client Thanks for your attention GUIGUI
