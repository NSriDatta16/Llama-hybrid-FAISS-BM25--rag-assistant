jade template engine (under node.js): multi-line block without pipe symbol

I'm currently using Jade on a new project. It seems well-suited to composing webapp layouts, but not for writing static content, such as a web page of elements containing text. For example, to create such a paragraph, I believe I need to do this: p | This is my long, | multi-line | paragraph. For a static web page full of real paragraphs of text, using jade becomes a burden due to that pipe symbol at the beginning of each line. Is there some sort of syntactic sugar for marking the whole block as a text node, as the pipe symbol does on a line-by-line basis? Or an existing filter I'm unaware of? One solution I'm exploring is the creation of a :block filter or something, that prepends each line with a | and then passes it to Jade, but jade's documentation on creating filters is sparse to say the least, so that may take a while to figure out. If anyone can provide guidance as to such a solution I'd appreciate it.
