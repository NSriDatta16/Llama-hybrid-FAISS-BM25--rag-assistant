If $X$ is a badly conditioned matrix or exactly singular, then your least squares estimator will be extremely unstable and useless in practice. If you limit your attention to the distribution of $\epsilon$, then you should keep in mind that the Gauss-Markov theorem ensures that the least squares solution will be a minimum variance unbiased estimator. However, if the distribution of $\epsilon$ is sufficiently extreme, then it's possible to construct examples where the distribution of the estimates has bad properties (in particular, the possibility (albeit with low probability) of extremely large errors in $\beta$) despite being minimum variance.
