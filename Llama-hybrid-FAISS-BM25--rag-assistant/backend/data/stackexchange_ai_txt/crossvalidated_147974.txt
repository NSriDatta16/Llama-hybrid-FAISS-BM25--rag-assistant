I think I managed to work this one out. I was assuming that the log likelihood of my dispersion was simply $-\chi^2/2$. If the size of the data $\sigma$ changes, it goes to $-\chi^2/2 + \sum \log(1/\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2})$. If this likelihood is used in an MCMC analysis, it seems to produce reasonable results (though I need to check further).
