Do you know of some performances test of the different ways to get thread local storage in C++?

I'm doing a library that makes extensive use of a thread local variable. Can you point to some benchmarks that test the performances of the different ways to get thread local variables in C++: C++0x thread_local variables compiler extension (Gcc __thread, ...) boost::threads_specific_ptr pthread Windows ... Does C++0x thread_local performs much better on the compilers providing it?
