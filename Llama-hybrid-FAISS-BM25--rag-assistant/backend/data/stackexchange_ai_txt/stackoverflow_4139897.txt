It looks like that you initialize attribute by yourself, instead of using Magento attribute initialization process: Mage::getSingleton('eav/config') ->getAttribute($entityType, $attributeCode) Because since 1.4.x Magento has separate attribute models for catalog and customers model and definition of default source model for catalog_product now is moved from EAV attribute model ( Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute ) to the catalog one ( Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource_Eav_Attribute ). As a result, some catalog attributes won't work with the EAV attribute model. Particularly those that use Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute_Source_Table but don't explicitly define it (color, manufacturer, etc.). The following code snippet should work perfectly on your installation: $attribute = Mage::getSingleton('eav/config') ->getAttribute(Mage_Catalog_Model_Product::ENTITY, 'color'); if ($attribute->usesSource()) { $options = $attribute->getSource()->getAllOptions(false); } By the way Mage_Eav_Model_Config model has a lot of helpful methods, that can be used in your development, so don't hesitate to look into this model.
