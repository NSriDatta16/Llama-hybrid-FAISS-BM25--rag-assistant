Multiple imputation chained equation followed by PCA

I've performed multiple imputation chained equations to address missing data but I would like to perform PCA to obtain a SES index for which one of the variables I had missing data (MAR). Could anyone suggest how I may go about this in Stata since the mi estimate: command does not seem to accomodate this.
