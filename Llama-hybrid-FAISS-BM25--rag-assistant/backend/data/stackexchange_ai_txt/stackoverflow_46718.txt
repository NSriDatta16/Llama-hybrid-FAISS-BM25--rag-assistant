Best way to make a printer-friendly ASP.NET page?

I'm just curious how most people make their ASP.NET pages printer-friendly? Do you create a separate printer-friendly version of the ASPX page, use CSS or something else? How do you handle situations like page breaks and wide tables? Is there one elegant solution that works for the majority of the cases?
