Aside from the obvious: " transform the response data such that we model the log of them and back-transform them to get the final non-negative estimates ", we can always set our modelling objective as reg:gamma or reg:tweddie and ensure the non-negativity of the predicted results. And if our modelling target is counts we can use count:poisson too. All these options can be found in the XGBoost Parameters page.
