This is a good question. I too have thought that the publicly available StackExchange datasets would make good subjects for analysis. These are sufficiently unusual that they might also be good testbeds for new statistical methods. Having such a large amount of well structured data is unusual, at any rate. cardinal suggested a bunch of things which would actually be useful for StackExchange. I won't restrict myself to this. Here is one obvious candidate for analysis, though it has no obvious use that comes to mind. It is a noticeable effect that high rep users are more likely to get upvotes, other things being equal. However, this effect is probably non-trivial to model. Since we can't compare usefulness across users very easily, an obvious approach would be to assume a users answers were always equally useful (not true in general but one has to start somewhere) and then add an inflationary term to account for his increasing reputation. One could then (I suppose) add in some terms that would account for his answers getting better with increasing experience. Maybe this could be handled by some kind of time series. I'm not sure how the data being interval would affect this. It might be an interesting exercise. I'll add more examples if/when I think of them. Is anyone aware of statistical research papers based on SE data? Also, Isaac mentioned that the data has errors. Does anyone know anything more about this?
