Are tags useful for navigation (on Stack Overflow or otherwise)?

I've done some research on using tags from social bookmarking sites for web search , but I'd like to learn more about other ways in which users might use tags for information retrieval. Do you use the tags on sites like Stack Overflow for navigation? Do you think of them like filters (narrowing down a large list of questions), or as categories (showing how the site is organized), or something else?
