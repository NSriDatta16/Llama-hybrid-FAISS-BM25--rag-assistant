To think about ways to infer whether your data is bimodal or unimodal you need to hypothesize on whether there is a good fundamental underlying reason that the thing creating your data is bimodal or not. If we change your question slightly to say "given a measurement of nitrogen oxide emission, what is the probability the emission came from a petrol or diesel vehicle?". From this we can begin to estimate what the distribution of diesel emission looks like vs distribution of petrol and can do tests to see if these two distributions are statistically different. Using standard Bayesian Inference and a Mixture Model, you can calculate these distributions and probabilities. Until you clarify your answer further, I will point you to this: General Wikipedia reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model python-based (and better theoretical explination) http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html If you can separate out the two types sources of diesel emission you can just run a the following tests to see if they are equal: Eyeball test (simple sanity check, not rigorous) Two-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test
