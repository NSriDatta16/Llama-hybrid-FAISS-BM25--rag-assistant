If you have daily data for 2+ years , you can construct a time series model that could include day-of-the-week;week=of-the-year;holiday/event structure. This model could then be used to detect level shifts or local time trends which could illuminate the nuances in your data via Intervention Detection schemes. I have been building these kinds of models for years with great success. One can identify particular days of the month that are consistently exceptional and even incorporate Monday-after Friday Holidays and/or Friday before Monday Holidays. Unfortunately SPSS does not support this kind of analyses so you might have to look elsewhere or write your own "stuff". In addition one can test for significant break-points or change-points in time where parameters have changed significantly using procedures like the Chow Test.
