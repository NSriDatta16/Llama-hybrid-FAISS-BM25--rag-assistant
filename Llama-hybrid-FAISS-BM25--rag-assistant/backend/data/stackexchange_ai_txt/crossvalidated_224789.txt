Statistical tables in old books purposefully wrong?

I remember having read a while ago that in old (pre-computer days) books, the last digits of the theoretical quantiles shown in the appendices were inaccurate in order to discourage plagiarism (the idea would be that if another book has a table in the appendix where the last digits are identical to the ones found in yours, then that author must have plagiarized your table). I am trying to find back the source for this story, or a link to a mention of it, but after hours of searching I couldn't.
