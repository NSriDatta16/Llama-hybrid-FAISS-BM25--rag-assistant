This doesn't really answer my question or satisfy my curiosity but it does seem to work if I pull the an_agent object out of the database immediately before trying to use it in the SecurityTag constructor. Previously I was passing a copy that had been made earlier with get_or_create. Did this old instance somehow go out of date or scope?
