Alternatively you can specify where the class should read this information from while calling the class, for example: dbName = $_SESSION['mydatabase']; ?> This way your class stays clean, and it can accept the database name (and any other information that might vary) from any source or method you prefer. As an added bonus, you don't have to pay attention to which version of PHP you're using, it'll work fine in both. Hope this helps! -Dave
