Excluding the effect of control variables in the assessment of a logistic regression model

I have a logistic regression model with ten independent variables of which two are included as controls. While their inclusion is necessary for correctly assessing the coefficients of the other variables, the two control variables are causing an extremely good overall prediction accuracy. To complement the evaluation of the individual coefficients, I would like to find a summary statistic of the predictive accuracy achieved solely by the combined effects of the other eight predictors of the model, excluding the controls. One of the answers here: https://www.researchgate.net/post/Questions_regarding_control_variables suggested first creating a model using only the controls, note the accuracy scores (AUC and Brier scores retrieved by means of bootstrap resampling in this case), then implement the full model and subtract the accuracy scores achieved using only the controls. The difference is then to give a measure of predictive success provided by the remaining variables. Is this a valid and recommended approach? I can't seem to find this anywhere on SE, probably due to my limited grasp on the relevant terminology or because the answer is glaringly obvious.
