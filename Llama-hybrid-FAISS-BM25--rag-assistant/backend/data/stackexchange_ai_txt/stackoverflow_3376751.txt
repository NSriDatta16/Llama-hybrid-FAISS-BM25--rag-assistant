If you are writing C++ or C# code, our SD Test Coverage Tools can be used to instrument your source code in a way that is compatible with embedded devices. These tools provide automated instrumentation of your source code, and instrumentation data collection procedures in source code so that you can control how the instrumentation data is collected and exactly how it is dumped, which is ideal for embedded software. A GUI display provides a programmer view of the coverage data imposed on the source code, and an XML report (which you can format at HTML using XSLT) provides summary data.
