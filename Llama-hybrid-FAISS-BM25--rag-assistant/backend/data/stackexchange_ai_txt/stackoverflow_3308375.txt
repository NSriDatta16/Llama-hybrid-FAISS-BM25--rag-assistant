Pass messages between two independent UIViews

What is the easiest way to pass information between UIViews? If i have 2 standalone views that push and pop from the navigation bar and I want from one UIview to do some logic when a button pressed on the second UIview?? Is the right way is to use delegates? or is there a simple way with the interface builder? I know that I cannot drag button to action that is not on the same view in IB thanks
