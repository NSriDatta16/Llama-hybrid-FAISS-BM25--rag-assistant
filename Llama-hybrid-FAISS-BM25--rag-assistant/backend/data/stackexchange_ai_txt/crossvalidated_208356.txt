I think it would be possible to use factorial analysis (PCA, MCA, ...) on each of your varibles subset so as to create multiple variables (PCA dimensions) which are linear combinations of your initial variables. So if your PCA first dimension yields enough inertia you could use it as a single synthetic variable for all the other and test correlation with it. The problem being that if your first dimension does not yield a sufficient amount of inertia then that dimension would not really be representative of your initial inertia. Your computed correlation coefficients would then have a weaker meaning. EDIT : Note that using ordinal variables is a violation of the continuity assumption made for PCA but it is often used anyway. You should also use MFA (used PCA as it is more renown) as you have both categorical and numeric variables.
