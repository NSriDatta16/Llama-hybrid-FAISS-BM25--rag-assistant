The harmonic mean may be a handy substitute to the arithmetic mean when the latter has no expectation or no variance. It may indeed be the case that $\mathbb{E}[X]$ does not exist or is infinite, while $\mathbb{E}[1/X]$ exists. For instance, the Pareto distribution with density$$f(x)=\dfrac{\alpha x_0^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha+1}}\mathbb{I}_{x\ge x_0}$$has no finite expectation when $\alpha\le 1$, which implies that the arithmetic mean has an infinite expectation, while$$\mathbb{E}[1/X]=\int_{x_0}^\infty \dfrac{\alpha x_0^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha+2}}\,\text{d}x=\dfrac{\alpha x_0^{\alpha}}{(\alpha+1) x_0^{\alpha+1}}=\dfrac{\alpha}{(\alpha+1) x_0}$$which implies that the harmonic mean has a finite expectation. Conversely, there are distributions for which the harmonic mean has no expectation, as for instance the Beta $\mathcal{B}e(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution when $\alpha\le1$. And many more for which it has no variance. There is also a link with Monte Carlo approximations to integrals, and particularly normalising constants, based on the Bayesian posterior identity$$\mathbb{E}\left[\dfrac{\varphi(\theta)}{\pi(\theta)L(\theta|x)}\Big| x\right]=\dfrac{1}{m(x)}$$where $\varphi(\cdot)$ is any density, $\pi(\cdot)$ is the prior, $L(\cdot|x)$ the likelihood, and $m(\cdot)$ the marginal, as discussed on that other question on X validated, where I comment on the dangers of using what Radford Neal (U Toronto) calls the worst Monte Carlo estimator ever . (I also wrote several entries on my blog on that topic.)
