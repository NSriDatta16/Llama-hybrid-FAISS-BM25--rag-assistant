Different accuracy of random forest and neural net

I ran a set of time series data in a neural net model and random forest model. For neural net I normalised the data split it into test 20%, validation and training 80%. Keras library neural net was used here.The accuracy is 85%(I get different accuracy every time). For random forest I didn’t normalise the data and the test train split is 20% and 80%.I used scikit learn here. I am getting 93% accuracy .Here time series data is used as well. Am I not supposed to get similar accuracy as neural net? What am I doing wrong? (I was reading some papers there they had similar kind of accuracy. That’s why I am asking. Also can random forest overfit? Is mine one overfitting?!
