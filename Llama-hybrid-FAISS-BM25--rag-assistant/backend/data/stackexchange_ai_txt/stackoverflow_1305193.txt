Why don't you implement a virtual copy method? AbstractBase* storage = base.Copy() By the way, this is quite C++ specific, because using C# it could be simply implemented by reflection. Activiator.CreateInstance(temp.GetType(), temp); Of course, there are some nice factory patterns around, but this really depends on the concrete problem you need to solve.
