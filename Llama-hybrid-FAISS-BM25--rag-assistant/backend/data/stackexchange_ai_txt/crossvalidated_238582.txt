There are several problems with your approach. First, you want to use confidence intervals for something that they were not designed for. If $p$ varies, then confidence interval will not show you how does it vary. Check Why does a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) not imply a 95% chance of containing the mean? to learn more about confidence intervals. Moreover, using normal approximation for binomial proportion and it's confidence intervals is not a good idea, as described by Brown et al (2001) . In fact, from your description it sounds like you want to estimate the Bayesian credible interval , i.e. interval that will contain certain fraction of $p$'s distribution. Yes, I said Bayesian , since in fact you already defined your problem as a Bayesian model. You say that you assume that $p$ is a random variable, while in frequentist setting $p$ would be a fixed parameter. If you already assumed it, why not use a Bayesian model for your data? You would be using beta-binomial model (see also An introduction to the Beta-Binomial model paper by Dan Navarro and Amy Perfors). In cases like this it is extremely easy to estimate such model. We can define it as follows: $$ X \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(N, p) \\ p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) $$ so, your data $X$ follows binomial distribution parametrized by $N$ and $p$, where $p$ is a random variable. We assume beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as a prior for $p$. I guess that if you wanted to use frequentist method, you do not have any prior knowledge about possible distribution of $p$, so you would choose "uninformative" prior parametrized by $\alpha = \beta = 1$, or $\alpha = \beta = 0.5$ (if you prefer, you may translate those parameters to mean and precision , or mean and variance ). After updating your prior , posterior distribution of $p$ is simply a beta distribution parametrized by $$ \alpha' = \alpha + \text{total number of successes} \\ \beta' = \beta + \text{total number of failures} $$ with mean $$ E(X) = N \frac{\alpha'}{\alpha'+\beta'} $$ To read more about calculating other quantities of this distribution check Wikipedia article on beta-binomial distribution . You can compute credible intervals numerically either by (a) inverting numerically the cumulative distribution function of beta-binomial distribution, or by (b) sampling large number of random values from beta-binomial distribution and then computing sample quantiles from it. Second approach is pretty easy since you only need to sequentially repeat the following procedure: draw $p$ from beta distribution parametrized by $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$, draw $x$ from binomial distribution parametrized by $p$ and $N$. until you draw sample large enough to find it confident for calculating the quantities of interest. Of course if you know mean and standard deviation of $p$ and you insist on using normal distribution for it, you can use simulation as well, but with using normal distribution for simulating the values of $p$. Below I provide code example in R for such simulation. R Or you can simply take appropriate quantiles using inverse of normal cumulative distribution function and multiply them by $N$. Remember however that this is not a confidence interval, but a credible interval. Brown, L.D., Cai, T.T., & DasGupta, A. (2001). Interval estimation for a binomial proportion.
