In the narrower context of facial analysis, your problem is called eigenface analysis . Since PCA works with vectors, you have to vectorize each image matrix by concatenating all the rows or columns before proceeding. ( Tensor decomposition has been tried too, but don't worry about that since you're new to PCA.) The important thing to note is that the images must be standardized---much like a passport photo. If you're trying to compare wildly different images, you'll find that you need a large number of eigenvectors, indicating that dimension reduction is not feasible.
