This works very well (taken from here: http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/82971/filename-may-not-contain-whitespace-in-xcode-325-is-back ): 1) In Xcode Organizer right click on the build date of the app and select "Reveal Archived App in Finder" 2) Open ArchiveInfo.plist in a text editor (i used Coda) 3) For me at line 12 it was creating the application with a space: XCApplicationName Example Name Change that to ExampleName and save the file. 4) Once you get back to Xcode Organizer, you should be able to go through fine.
