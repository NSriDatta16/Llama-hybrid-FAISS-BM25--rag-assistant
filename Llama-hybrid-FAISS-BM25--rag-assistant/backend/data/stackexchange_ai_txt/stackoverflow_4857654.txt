If the user is submitting, say, a value from a dropdown menu/list of radio buttons, you could check to see if the $ages array has that year set, and if not, display a default message: $year = $_GET['year']; echo isset($ages[$year]) ? $ages[$year] : 'DOES NOT COMPUTE'; Expanded Edit MVC men will likely put out a hit on me for saying this (if they haven't already), but I like to keep this kind of thing self-contained. That means a page (say, index.php ) that looks generally like this: I'll start with HTML. You'll want a form, like so: Movie Year: Note that the form's action is left blank. That means that the form will be submitted to the current page. That's where the PHP at the top of your document comes into play. You'll first want to initialize your array of years and titles: $ages = array( '1977' => 'Annie Hall', // ... '1970' => 'Patton' ); Then you check to see if the user submitted the form: if (isset($_GET['year'])) { $year = $_GET['year']; $message = isset($ages[$year]) ? 'The film for that year is called '.$ages[$year].'.' : 'There is no film for that year.'; } This sets the variable $message to some text that you want to display to the user. Now we make one last jump back to the HTML part of your document, just above the form: ', $message, ' Want to go again? '; } ?> And there you have it, a searchable array of movie titles, organized by year.
