Will correlated features reduce the accuracy of a classifier?

Will correlated features reduce the accuracy of a classifier? Most of the posts related to correlated features talk about using PCA to remove the correlation. My problem is not specific to any algorithms. Or is the question algorithm specific? I understand that correlation may cause numerical troubles in regression but what if we are talking about neural networks, etc.?
