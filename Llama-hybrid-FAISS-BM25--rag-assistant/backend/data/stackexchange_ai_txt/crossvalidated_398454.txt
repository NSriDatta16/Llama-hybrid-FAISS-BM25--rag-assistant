If the ordinary probability of Pass is $p,$ then you are right that on average you should expect a Pass every $1/p$ days. So roughly speaking, if $p = 1/10$ you might start to get suspicious something is wrong if you haven't seen a pass in 'many' more than 10 days. Here is one way to quantify 'many'. The probability of a Fail on any one day is $1-p$ and the probability of a run of $x$ consecutive failures is $(1-p)^x,$ so maybe you should get suspicious if $(1 - p)^x For $p = 1/10 = 0.1,$ that's about 29 days, because $0.9^{28} = .052$ and $0.9^{29} = 0.047 [Computations in R.] .9^28; .9^29 ## 0.05233476 ## 0.04710129 For $p = 1/5 = 0.2,$ you should sound the alarm at about 14 successive Fails: $0.8^{14} = 0.044.$ Using the same criterion, you should suspect that $p$ must be below $1/2$ if you see five fails in a row. Of course, you might choose an 'error' probability other than $0.05$ and then results would differ accordingly. Note: More formally, this is a test the hull hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ against the alternative $H_1: p at the 5% level. The relevant probability distribution is the geometric distribution . Notice that there are two forms of the distribution, one counting the number of tosses until the first Pass appears, and the other counting the number of Fails before the first Pass. (In R, the grometric distribution uses the latter formulation.)
