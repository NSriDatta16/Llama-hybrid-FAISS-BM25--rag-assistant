Feature selection for mixed binary, continuous, and categorical data

I have a dataset including ~100 features to predict a response variable with 9 possible categories. The type of the features can be any of continuous, binary (0/1), or categorical with more than two categories. Does anyone have any suggestion for the feature selection algorithm that can help to consider all of these variables together? I have already applied Random Forest, Recursive Feature Elimination, Correlation, MIC, Stability, ... but it seems there is a trick for mixed data and I am not aware of.
