Good guide on VIM Scripting?

I've used VIM for 10+ years, but never really into VIM scripting (always subjectively beliving that this was one area where VIM was weaker than Emacs). Recently, the realization "in a VIM script, I can execute normal mode commands" made my mind go "a-ha" and suddenly start realizing why parts of VIM script is the way it is. normal ma10jd'a20kp is much more elegant than Marker m = currentLocation(); advanceLines(10); Buffer b = delete(currentLocation(), m); advanceLines(-20); insertBuffer(b); Now question is -- what's a good resource to learn vim scripting from? Thanks!
