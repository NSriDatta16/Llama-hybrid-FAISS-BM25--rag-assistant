If you wanted to get a closed-form solution for the posterior distribution then you would use a conjugate prior, in which case $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ would not be independent. Since you are using an MCMC algorithm to produce an approximation to the posterior distribution, there is no need to have a conjugate prior. I believe the prior in your code is intended to approximate a flat prior, $p(\mu,1/\sigma^2) \propto 1$. But suppose you wanted to use an MCMC algorithm to simulate draws from the posterior using the conjugate prior just for the heck of it. Then you would write the code for the joint distribution for $(\mu,\sigma^2)$, which is not the product of the two marginal distributions. (You are correct that the marginal prior distribution for $\mu$ would be $t$.)
