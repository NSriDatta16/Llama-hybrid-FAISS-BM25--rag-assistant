First off, I did not know OpenMarkov. Anyway, from its website it has a particular focus on learning Bayesian networks (Bayes nets). Thus, I assume your figure represents a Bayes net, yes. Syntactically, it also qualifies since it is a directed acyclic graph. The arrows (edges) represent influences (conditional dependencies) observed in the data. For instance, the conditional probability distribution of carb , P (carb | hp,cyl,disp), is defined by the values for hp,cyl,disp . However, arrows do not necessarily represent causal relationships.
