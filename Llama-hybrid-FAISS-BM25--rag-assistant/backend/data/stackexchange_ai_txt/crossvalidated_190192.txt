Difference between bootstrap and resampling

I am using biological / microarray data. For example, one of my datasets has 50 samples, and 1000 gene attributes. They have 2 labels, Normal and Disease . I usually use a machine learning method such as SVM to classify them. In my field, 10-fold cross-validation is used very frequently, but because the sample size is small, robust results are difficult to acquire. So I usually use resampling to test. For example, make 100 subsets each of which contains 40 samples (80% of 50 samples) randomly from 50 samples. Recently, I learned the concept of the bootstrap, which means sampling with replacement. In my resampling example, there will be at least 60% (30) of overlap for 2 sets. So, I think bootstrap is the same concept as resampling, is it right understanding? And, I am using moderate ratio (80%) for resampling, is there any rule to decide it? There are some rules like 632+ in bootstrap, but I think they did not suggest the ratio of resampling.
