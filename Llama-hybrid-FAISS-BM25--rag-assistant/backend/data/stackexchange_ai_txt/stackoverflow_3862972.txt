I'm guessing the webservice is returning a different response depending on the user-agent or something else different about the request. Check all teh parameters are identical. Also check the HttpClient is doing a GET not a POST. There should be no difference in the response unless parameters or headers differ between your web-browser and your HttpClient request.
