Spurious relationship "Correlation Does Not Imply Causality" This saying relates in particular to the idea that correlation between two variables does not imply a causal relationship between the two variables. It does not always mean that there is an absence of causality. A typical example of the 'Correlation Does Not Imply Causality' is the presence of a confounding variable and is explained by the correlation between 'ice cream sales' and 'shark attacks'. The two are correlated, but the one does not cause the other. Yet, there are causal relationships present. Both are caused by hot weather which makes more people buy ice cream and more people go to the beach. This is your situation with the map of GDP per Capita and Life expectancy. There is most likely some sort of causal relationship present in that situation. The problem is however that the correlation alone does not allow you to determine what type of causal relationship is present. The phrase "Correlation Does Not Imply Causality" or the term spurious relationship relates to the situation where somebody falsely/falliciously concludes that there is a particular causal relationship based on a correlation. Spurious correlation Your case of the relationship between scripps and spiders is of a more specific nature and sometimes referred to as spurious correlation (see Misunderstandings of "spurious correlation"? ). It means that one falsely assumes that there is a statistical correlation where there is none. Examples may occur when data are correlated (e.g. time series Why do these time series appear to be dependent? ) or when people make multiple comparisons without correcting.
