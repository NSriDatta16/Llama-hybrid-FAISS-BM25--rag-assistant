There isn't really a reliable way to get the client computer's IP address. This goes through some of the possibilities. The code that uses Java will break if the user has multiple interfaces. http://nanoagent.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-to-find-evaluate-remoteaddrclients.html From looking at the other answers here it sounds like you may want to get the client's public IP address, which is probably the address of the router they're using to connect to the internet. A lot of the other answers here talk about that. I would recommend creating and hosting your own server side page for receiving the request and responding with the IP address instead of depending on someone else's service that may or may not continue to work.
