Confidence intervals are not only useful, but essential in some field, such as physics. Unfortunately, the most noise regarding CIs comes from Bayesians caught up in fake debates with Frequentists, usually in the context of social "sciences" and other science-like disciplines. Suppose that I measure a quantity in Physics, such as electricity charge. I would always supply it with the measure of uncertainty of the value, which is usually a standard deviation. Since, in Physics errors are often Gaussian, this directly translated into CI. However, when the errors are not Gaussian, it gets a bit complicated, some integrals need to be evaluated etc. Nothing too esoteric though usually. Here's a brief presentation on the CI in particle physics, and the definition: quantitative statement about the fraction of times that such an interval would contain the true value of the parameter in a large number of repeated experiments Note, that in Physics "repeated experiments" has often a literal meaning: it's assumed you can actually repeat experiments in the paper, and would actually observe that fraction. So, the CI has almost a literal meaning to you, and is just a way to express the information about the uncertainty of the measurement. It's not a thought experiment, not a subjective opinion, not your or my feelings about likelihoods etc. It's what you were able to devise from experiments, and what I should be able to observe when reproducing your experiment.
