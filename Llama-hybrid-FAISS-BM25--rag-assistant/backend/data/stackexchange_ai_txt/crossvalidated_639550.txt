In such cases I would personally go with a Bayesian model and an informative prior on the $\beta$ 's. Using R, such model could look like this: library(brms) # Specify an informative prior to handle separation prior_info There's lots of information on priors for logistic regressions. This gets you started: https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/default-priors-for-logistic-regression-coefficients-in-brms/13742 If you go this route you might need to adjust the prior to make it work on your specific example. Alternatively, it seems that PROC NLMIXED seems to be able to implement a " Penalized Likelihood Logistic Regression for Sparse Data Using Data Priors ". Or this one from the same author: https://www.lexjansen.com/phuse-us/2020/as/AS14_ppt.pdf I don't know enough about PROC NLMIXED to further commment on this though.
