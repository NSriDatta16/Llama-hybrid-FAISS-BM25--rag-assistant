In Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method, for each observation in our sample, say the $i$ -th one, we first fit the same model keeping aside the $i$ -th observation and then calculate the mean squared error for the $i$ -th observation. Finally we take the average of these individual mean squared errors. For example, suppose our model is $Y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ and we have some estimate for $f,$ say $\hat{f},$ which is computed on the basis of all observations. Now in LOOCV method, we calculate $\hat{f}$ after deleting the $i$ -th observation from our dataset, let's call it $\hat{f}_{-i}(x)$ and then compute $(y_i - \hat{f}_{-i}(x_i))^2.$ Finally we compute the average of these quantities.
