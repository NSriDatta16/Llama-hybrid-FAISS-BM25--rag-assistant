Treeview drag and drop

I'm using the jQuery droppable/dragable to reorder a treeview (made up of ul/li items) I have no problems making a element and dragging it into the tree When I define the items to be draggable, the code doesn´t work any more (the items are classed as "droppables" but the drop event won´t run) Isn't this supposed to be possible?
