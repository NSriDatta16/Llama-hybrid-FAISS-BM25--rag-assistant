What is perplexity?

I came across term perplexity which refers to the log-averaged inverse probability on unseen data. Wikipedia article on perplexity does not give an intuitive meaning for the same. This perplexity measure was used in pLSA paper. Can anyone explain the need and intuitive meaning of perplexity measure ?
