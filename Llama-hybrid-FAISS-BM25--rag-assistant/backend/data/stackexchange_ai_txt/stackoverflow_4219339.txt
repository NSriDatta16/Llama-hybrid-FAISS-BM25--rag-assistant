I was surprised to find out that I needed to use a C-style cast to avoid a compiler truncation warning I see it the other way around: You use a C-style cast to prevent the compiler from warning you , and I see this as a severe disadvantage of the C-style cast. if you feel you know what you're doing, then shut up the compiler for this one case by using a compiler-specific way. For example, for VC use something like #pragma warning(push, disable: XXXX) // code goes here #pragma warning(pop)
