I don't think this should be a problem in principle . It depends on what's your goal and the type of data you have. Maybe you can have good results treating the data as sequential (i.e. just dropping the missing points) or using some imputation method for the weekends. Or you can exploit a trend-seasonal decomposition for your prediction: e.g. prediction for next Monday will be the (trend adjusted?) average of all Mondays in the past 3 months.
