Calculate the number of times that cases were out-of-bag (out-of-bag sample size)

Breiman (Breiman, L. (2001), Random Forests, Machine Learning 45(1), 5-32) states that "In each bootstrap training set, about one-third of the instances are left out" . Providing the following example: library(randomForest) library(MASS) data(fgl) set.seed(17) table(fgl$type) model.rf how do I define the number of average proportion of out-of-bag cases in the analysis (which corresponds with BreimanÂ´s statement)? My take on it is to see the average OOB cases per number of trees, from model.rf$oob.times diveded by the number of ntree and then put that number in relation to the data size aka number of rows/records in the data to see the proportion of OOBs in the whole dataset, hence: sum(model.rf$oob.times)/model.rf$ntree/nrow(fgl) It comes down to 0.3664019 which is somewhat one third and close to another thread on CV that states the out-of-bag sample size theoretically (0.3678). Would this be an accurate answer to my question?
