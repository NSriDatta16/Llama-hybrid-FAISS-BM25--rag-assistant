Does it make sense to do feature selection after PCA?

I have a dataset of 50 features that resulted after PCA was employed (originally, the dataset had 343 features. The 50 features are the principal components obtained with PCA). Does it make sense to apply feature selection on those 50 features to choose the top 10 features? Thank you,
