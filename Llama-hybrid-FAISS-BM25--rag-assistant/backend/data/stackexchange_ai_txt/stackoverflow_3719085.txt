AppleScript code to loop messages in Entourage and delete them

I wrote a simple AppleScript which loops indefinitely inside Entourage Inbox and gets subjects of "unread" messages: tell application "Microsoft Entourage" activate repeat with eachMsg in messages of folder named "Inbox" if read status of eachMsg is untouched then set messageSubject to subject of eachMsg as string -- bla bla bla -- How to delete the message and proceed with the next one??? end if end repeat Now, the problem is, I want to delete messages after getting the subject. How can I do this? Could you please write me an example? Thanks again!
