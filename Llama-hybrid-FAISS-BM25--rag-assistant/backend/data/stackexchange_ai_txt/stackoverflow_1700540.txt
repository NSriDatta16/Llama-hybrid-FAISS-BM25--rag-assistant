There is certainly a trade-off between performance and accuracy here. You could use neural networks but may need some pre-transformations first: e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration . There are several more efficient algorithms like histogram comparison. Check The segmentation article at Wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_%28image_processing%29
