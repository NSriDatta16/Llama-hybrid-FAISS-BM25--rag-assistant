Lilypond has a preprocessor called lilypond-book that lets you mix LaTeX code with Lilypond code in one source file. Sample usage: tsst.lytex contains this: \documentclass{article} \begin{document} \begin[quote,fragment,staffsize=26]{lilypond} c' d' e' \end{lilypond} \end{document} It also supports inline notation (instead of a display), and reading from external files. Compile it with lilypond-book --pdf tsst.lytex , producing pdf images of each system along with a LaTeX file tsst.tex that includes the snippets, which compiles as usual with pdflatex .
