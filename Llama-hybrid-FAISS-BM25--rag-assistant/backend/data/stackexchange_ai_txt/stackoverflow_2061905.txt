I would avoid showModalDialog just because at some stage in the future IE6 will be depreciated and you will have to go back and fix it all. I know some large organisations are slow, but do you think they will still be using IE6 in 2 or 3 years? On the other hand, if it is a consulting gig, do it this way and then in 3 years time charge them again to fix it.
