Linear regression with prior

Im trying to estimate the linear curve (y~x) where I know intercept must be normally distributed around -100, and slope always positive and normally distributed around 2 (blue continous line in plots below). The example.data.1 below is "clean" and the linear regression (red dashed line) is ok. The resulting red dashed line is what I want. But example.data.2 has many measurement errors so the red dashed line becomes unrealistic. The resulting line should be parallel with the blue line, but lower. How can I assign a strong prior similar to the blue line in the plots, so that I get a posterior reasonably similar to the blue line? example.data.1 I need to do this for tens of thousands of data-groups like each example above, so a fast algorithm is important. I have tried to use Stan, Jags, and arm-package, but don't understand how to tell those functions what I want. My limited knowledge about statistics lead me to think that a bayesian approach is best, but I could be wrong.
