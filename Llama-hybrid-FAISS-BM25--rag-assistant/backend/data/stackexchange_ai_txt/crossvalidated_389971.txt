Any irregular time series fits your description. These are time series where observations are not taken in equally spaced intervals, but at irregular ones - but the sequence is still taken in time order. As an example, I offer the time series of my weight over time. Yes, I am the kind of person who weighs themselves every morning and then documents it - over four years. The "irregular" aspect comes in because I sometimes travel and don't get to my bathroom scale for a couple of days. Look closely and you will see it. (I removed the vertical axis annotation to forestall inappropriate comments.)
