Your response is binary and so you probably want to look at something like a binomial GLM for that, such as logistic regression. Having a group of $k$ predictors that add to 1 (e.g. the $k=3$ body proportion predictors) would imply that at most you can have $k-1$ of them in the model because of the multicollinearity issue. However, I'm going to suggest that you may also want to transform those percentages; they're unlikely to enter the model linearly; indeed with a logit link my first thought would be that you might want to try something like the logit of the proportions instead.
