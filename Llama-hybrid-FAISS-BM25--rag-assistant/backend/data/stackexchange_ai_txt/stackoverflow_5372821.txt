jquery drag and drop: Droppable doesnt work on elements with float:left or inline-block

Anyone else have this problem before? I cannot seem to drop into TARGET that has display: inline-block or float:left. Here's link to sample code: http://jsbin.com/arusu3/141 Some info I found: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/connecttosortable-fails-when-sortable-list-is-floated I noticed if might work INLINE if I dump it EXACTLY in the middle. but it would be nice for it to accept drop if any part of my drag touches.
