Here is a demo that shows it can be done, http://duopixel.com/stack/test.html , check in webkit and Firefox. Explanation: the only way to mask an image in Firefox is through svg masks: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Applying_SVG_effects_to_HTML_content , It can be done more elegantly (with an svg from an external source) but this makes it easier to understand. The actual code is pretty simple, just... mask: url(#id); Or if you want to reference an external source: mask: url(test.html#id); Also, the code is on my server because you must serve the html as xhtml, otherwise Firefox ignores the mask. This can be done through .htaccess like this: RewriteEngine on RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application/xhtml\+xml RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} !application/xhtml\+xml\s*;\s*q=0 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.html$ RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} HTTP/1\.1 RewriteRule .* - [T=application/xhtml+xml] jsfiddle is not serving xhtml/application
