Writing 'CONTAINS' query using LINQ

Given the output of query: var queryResult = from o in objects where ... select new { FileName = o.File, Size = o.Size } What would you consider the neatest way to detect if a file is in the queryResult? Here is my lame try with LINQ: string searchedFileName = "hello.txt"; var hitlist = from file in queryResult where file.FileName == searchedFileName select file; var contains = hitlist.Count() > 0; There must be an more elegant way to figure out the result.
