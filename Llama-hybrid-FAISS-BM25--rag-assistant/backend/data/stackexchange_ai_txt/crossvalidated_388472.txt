Should I standardize mixed variables before lasso or pca?

I have a large data of both binary, categorical and continuous variables. I would like to do the lasso to select the variables for regression. Besides, i also want to do pca to reduce the dimension. However, i was advised to do the standardization before lasso. But do I need to standardize the binary, categorical variables? If yes, which is the fastest way(in stata) to do the standardization for more than 200 varibles? Please help me with this. Thank you very nuch!
