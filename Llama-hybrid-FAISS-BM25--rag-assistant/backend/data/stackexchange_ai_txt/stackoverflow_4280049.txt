How can I fix the unsecure_base_url on my Magento installation?

I've been having problems with uploading images and in trying to fix it, happened to change the base_url in the config which has now caused my website to appear without any styling at all (inc the Admin). I've gone into phpMyAdmin and fixed the urls but i'm not having any luck. This is what i've got at the moment... web/unsecure/base_link_url http://www.northwalesdoorworld.co.uk/ web/unsecure/base_skin_url http://www.northwalesdoorworld.co.uk/skin/ web/unsecure/base_media_url http://www.northwalesdoorworld.co.uk/media/ web/unsecure/base_js_url http://www.northwalesdoorworld.co.uk/js/ Could someone please take a look at my site - northwalesdoorworld.co.uk - and recommend a way to solve my problem? thanks, Greg.
