Usually you can do the predictions in JAGS. Below is a regression example with FEV (something to do with lung capacity) as the dependent variable and age and smoking indicator as predictors. FEV20s and FEV20ns are the predicted FEV values for a 20 year old smoker and a 20 year old non-smoker. model { for(i in 1:n){ FEV[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],tau) mu[i] Example from: Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis
