jQuery Events on Elements in an UpdatePanel

I have some elements inside an UpdatePanel which may or may be displayed, depending on various conditions. You clicked on the image! I'm trying to wire it up so that the specialMessage SPAN is shown when the clickableImage IMG is clicked with the following: $(document).ready(function() { $("#clickableImage").click(function() { $("#specialMessage").show(); }); $("#specialMessage").draggable(); }); However, since MyPanel is often not visible when the page loads (but it may be visible later based on user interaction), the events aren't hooked up. Is there a way that I can hook up these events even if MyPanel is not visible on the initial page load?
