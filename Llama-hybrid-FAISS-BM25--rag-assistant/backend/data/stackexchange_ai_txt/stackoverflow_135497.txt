You've got RoR guys working on this program and you've managed to develop a complex rails app that has enough subtleties that the admin section is difficult to use. The answer to this problem is not to use a different programming language to create a whole nother kinda app to do the admin. It will help more to get assistance in simplifying and organizing your admin section. Work through some paper sketches to get a better idea of how to present this complexity and maybe reveal complexity as you go along. Complexity is handled often by using wizards or revealing suboptions as you go along. Spend some time with your users and watch them do their tasks. With more details I could edit this answer with more specifics.
