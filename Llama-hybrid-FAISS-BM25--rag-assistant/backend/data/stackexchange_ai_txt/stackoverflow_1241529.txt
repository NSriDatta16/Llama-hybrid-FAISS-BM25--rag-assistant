I don't know how to fix the caching problem, but 50 seconds sounds extreme. If the query itself takes 10% of that, that means 45 seconds to load a 100mb file. Even if Windows does read in the entire file in one go, that shouldn't take more than a couple of seconds given normal harddrive speeds. Is the file very fragmented or something? It sounds to me like there's more than just precaching at play here.
