The syntax wouldn't be any different. Just... public InnerClass InnerClass { get { return innerClass; } set { innerClass = value; } } By the way, if you're using C# in .NET 3.5, you can use the automatic property generation feature if all you have is a simple property that just reads and writes to a backing store (like you have above). The sytax is similar to that of an abstract property: public InnerClass InnerClass { get; set; } This automatically generates a private member for storage, then reads from it in the get and writes to it in the set .
