Because you're an MBA student and not a statistician, I will list a couple of reasons which may be applicable. First, note that expected number of complaints can not be negative. A customer can not complain -2 times on average. So there is an explicit requirement that the prediction be positive. It need not necessarily be an integer (because regression predicts the expected number of complaints, and expectations or averages need not be integers). The poisson makes this natural since the canonical link is the natural log, meaning $E[y] = \exp(X\beta)$ . You may say, "well, I can just take the log of my counts and presto, I can use OLS". This could work, say if there are a moderate number of complaints. However if you include customers who issue 0 complaints, then we have a problem since $\log(0)$ is undefined. Again, this is no problem for the poisson. The support of the poisson distribution is on the non-negative integers, so no matter what $\lambda = \exp(X\beta)$ is, 0 is always a possibility though it may not be probable. Excluding the 0s would mean you're modelling the expected number of complaints for those people who complain , which is different. You could do the $\log(1+y)$ trick, but its just more details to keep track of unnecessarily in my opinion. Lastly, were you to adopt a Bayesian perspective and compute a prediction interval, the prediction interval will necessarily be within a realistic range without you having to intentionally force it to be non-negative.
