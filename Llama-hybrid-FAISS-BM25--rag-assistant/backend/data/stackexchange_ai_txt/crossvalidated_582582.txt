To carry out a T test for two tests of data from one patient using the same metric do I have to assume the differences is normally distributed?

My supervisor told me that to carry out a t-test on two different models to see which one is statistically better I needed to carry out a normality test (or just find if the data is normally distributed by graphical means) on the difference between the two data sets. There are two data sets, Model A and Model B which calculated their accuracy using the same metric from the same patient just using two different Machine Learning models ( A and B ). Would I find the distribution of the difference between the two models? Or do I have to see if each model is normally distributed before satisfying the assumption to carry out a Paired T Test? Sorry If its confusing!
