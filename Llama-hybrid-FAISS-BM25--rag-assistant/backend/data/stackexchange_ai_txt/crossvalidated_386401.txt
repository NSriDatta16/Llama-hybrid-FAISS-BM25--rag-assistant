Logistic regression F value

I have a question that Iâ€™ve been struggling finding the correct answer to. I wonder if you can help? I am performing a logistic regression with multiple variables,only one variable is statistically significant in the output but when I try to introduce other variables (that are not significant) the F value becomes non-significant. The question is: can I still present those variables in the results section of my paper, or is that forbidden because of the F not being significant? Thank you in advance Corina
