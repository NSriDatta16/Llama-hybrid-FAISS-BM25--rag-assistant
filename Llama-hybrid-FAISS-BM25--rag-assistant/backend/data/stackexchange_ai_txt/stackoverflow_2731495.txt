So it seems to me your main challenges are to Express that the user needs to select an organization from the list (and only from the list). Express that there are a lot of organizations on the list. Provide some means for the user to quickly find the organization on the list. I would say present a selector control that fits in with the rest of your design with a search box just above it. You should then page the list as there will be lots of pages with that many elements indicating that the user should definitely use the search. The search essentially acts like the auto complete, but instead of the found options changing the text, it will change the contents of the paginated list. If you do this on a character by character basis (or throttle using Reactive Extensions ), it's very clear that you're just filtering the list to make selection easier.
