I tried contacting a few drone simulator makers including DRL (Drone Racing League) and Velocidrone but the latter does not have API for Python and DRL has not responded. Therefore, I looked at Unity ML Agents and saw that it's possible to create a simulation environment using free drone assets: https://unity3d.com/how-to/unity-machine-learning-agents https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/free-pack-117641 And they have a Python API: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Python-API.md
