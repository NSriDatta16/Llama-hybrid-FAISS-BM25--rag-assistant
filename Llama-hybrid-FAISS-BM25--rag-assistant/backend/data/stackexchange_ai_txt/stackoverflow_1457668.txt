Try //book[title/@lang = 'it'] This reads: get all book elements that have at least one title which has an attribute lang with a value of "it" You may find this helpful â€” it's an article entitled "XPath in Five Paragraphs" by Ronald Bourret. But in all honesty, //book[title[@lang='it']] and the above should be equivalent, unless your XPath engine has "issues." So it could be something in the code or sample XML that you're not showing us -- for example, your sample is an XML fragment. Could it be that the root element has a namespace, and you aren't counting for that in your query? And you only told us that it didn't work, but you didn't tell us what results you did get.
