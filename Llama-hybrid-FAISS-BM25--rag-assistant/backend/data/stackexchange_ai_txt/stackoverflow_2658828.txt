IE7 Jquery UI Sortable problem

I'm using Jquery UI sortable in my current project to make boxes drag and drop-able into new columns. It works in all modern browsers apart from ie7, in which you can drag and drop, but when you drop, it completely ruins the content of the box you're dropping. Any ideas?
