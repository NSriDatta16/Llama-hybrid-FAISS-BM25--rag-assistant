Create paragraphs with xsl

Hey, I was wandering if anyone had any suggestions on how to take new-lines from an XML file and convert them to paragraphs with an XSL transform. Here is a what the XML structure looks like: 1 “Dude, I can't believe you fed it to your cat. That's crazy!” “Yeah, dude, he just cuddled up next to me and started purring.” “Then what did he do?” “He just kept purring, man. He's been purring non-stop for like two weeks now. I can't even sleep.” And here is a copy of the XSL sheet I'm using for the transform. Chapter Again, my question pertains to what commands to use to preserve the paragraph structure using the existing XSL document. Thanks, E
