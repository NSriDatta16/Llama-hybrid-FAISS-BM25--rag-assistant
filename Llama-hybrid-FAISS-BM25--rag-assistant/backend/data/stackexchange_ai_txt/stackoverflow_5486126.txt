You don't specify that the virtual box is remote, but I'm going to make that assumption here (since a virtual box on your local host would by definition be slower than the machine it is hosted on). I would suggest connecting to your higher-spec machine remotely to work with the files and testing on that environment. Basically, use it as a development instance and make changes remotely. Then, check in those changes as necessary. I am very much a Linux developer so your toolchain is a bit outside of my expertise, but you should be able to mount the remote drive as a local network drive, or your IDE may even support mounting it over SSH (which would probably be a bit faster). Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe EDIT: I should say that, if your virtual instance is not remote, that changes my answer a little bit. Go rent a virtual dedicated machine with some reasonable stats, set it up for Magento, and then do go the above. The monthly cost of a virtual dedicated machine is quite low compared to any hardware technology upgrades you might buy, and it gives you a safe place to break things. The downside to this workflow is that you must be online to accomplish anything.
