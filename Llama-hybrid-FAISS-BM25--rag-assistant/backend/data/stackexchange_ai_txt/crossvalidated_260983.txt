You can't First things first: there are generalizations available for your case, but it's not that straight forward. Let me explain: What you have is, as it seems, a multivariate distribution. Every data-point consists of several (not completely independent I assume) values. Pay attention by saying: (The distribution can of course be though of as 3 different distributions.) NO! You do have one multivariate distribution in 3 dimensions. Of course you can make 3 projections which look at first glance like three distributions, but they do not represent the same data-set as your original distribution! See below for an example. The projections (1-dimensional distributions on the side) look like they are the same, but the 2-dimensional view tells otherwise. And here starts the problem: if you would just use 1-dimensional tests to tell whether the blue and the red one are the same, they would conclude that they are. Which they surely are not! So why don't just generalize to multi-dimensions? Because some things are not defined in multivariate distributions. For example, there does not exist an order (which does for the 1-dimensional case, you can sort them by their value). That's why comparing multidimensional distributions gets quite tricky. One of the best answers would be to use machine learning: train a classifier on your data and on your null-hypothesis. Use a good classifier, the better the classifier performs (CV) on the data, the more different they are. There are also other test outside, more statistically "approved" ones ;) But they are not a direct counter-part to their 1-dimensional smaller brother and it may even is better to use a completely, for multivariate analysis "created" test instead of a generalized 1-dimensional test. So find out what you really need, it also depends strongly on your data and the problem you are tackling.
