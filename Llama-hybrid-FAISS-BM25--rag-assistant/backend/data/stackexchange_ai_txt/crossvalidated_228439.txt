MCMC in general and Metropolis-Hastings in particular is quite distinct from rejection sampling. Note that rejection sampling is independent from one generated value to the next -- it doesn't matter what value you just generated, the distribution of the next one doesn't consider it. MCMC involves a series of moves. At one step you are at some value and then conditional on that value you have some way of possibly moving to a (possibly) new value next step. In addition, you left out of your description what happens when you reject . In rejection sampling you simply fail to have a value. You generate again. In Metropolis-Hastings, you fail to accept the move, so you retain the previous value.
