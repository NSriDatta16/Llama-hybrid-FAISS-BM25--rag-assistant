You really should not use process dictionary. I accept using dictionary only if It is short living process. I have full control about the process from spawn to termination i.e. I use minimum and well known set of external modules. I need performance gain badly. It means avoid copy of data when using ets and dict/gb_tree is too slow (for GC reason). ad 1. is not your case, you are using in server. ad 2. I don't know if it is your case. ad 3. is not your case because you need list of recipient so you don't gain nothing from that process dictionary is very fast key/value storage. In your case I don't see any reason why you should not include what you need to your State . IMHO State is exactly the right place for it.
