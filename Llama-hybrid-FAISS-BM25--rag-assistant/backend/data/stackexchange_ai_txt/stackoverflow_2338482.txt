Is there a better way to model the feeding behavior of an organism?

Basically each entity would have a collection of feeding behaviors that it would follow. For some reason the model I came up with does not feel right. I think the most troubling part is that using singletons made sense. Is there a better way? public bool IsEntityEdible(Entity target) { foreach (var feedingBehavior in FeedingBehaviors) { if (feedingBehavior.WouldEat(target)) { return true; } } return false; } public abstract class FeedingBehavior { public abstract bool WouldEat(Entity entity); } public sealed class Myrmecophagy : FeedingBehavior { public readonly static Myrmecophagy Instance = new Myrmecophagy(); private Myrmecophagy() { } public override bool WouldEat(Entity entity) { return entity is Ant || entity is Termite; } }
