The most mature and systematic approach to this question is to let the uncertainty distribution guide the degree of "conviction". The uncertainty distribution (under Bayesian or frequentist assumptions) of the $\hat{Y}$ encompasses all the information you have into its estimate. From there, you can choose to only display or accept $\hat{Y}$ values that have sufficiently "narrow" probability distributions, e.g. $P(a \alpha$ . Other systems, like the ones you describe where you are making marginal decisions based on the predictors ( $X_i$ ) are generally less statistically powerful than joint decisions made on all the information simultaneously. Edit: below is some example code to illustrate the general approach with a simple linear regression. require(ggplot2) lm1 $fit yhat_sd se.fit threshold_certainty threshold_certainty, "good", "uncertain")) ggplot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp, col = color)) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c("good" = "green", "uncertain" = "red"))
