In addition to difference versus average plot, Bland and Altman plots can also be ratio versus average. plots. For example, a new weighing machine gives the following data when people of weights 60, 70 and 80 kg step on it.. 66 kg 77 kg 88 kg In such a scenario, the weighing machine overestimates the weight by 10% every time. So a ratio versus average plot will give a better visualization of the data in this case.
