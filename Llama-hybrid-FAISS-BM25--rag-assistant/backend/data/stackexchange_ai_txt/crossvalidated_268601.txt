Differencing the data to deal with autocorrelation will be a poor solution most of the time. Differencing makes sense only when a time series is integrated. Meanwhile, when it is merely autocorrelated, by differencing you will not only fail to remove the autocorrelation (you will turn it from positive to negative, as you have already observed) but will also introduce an integrated moving average pattern in the error term, which is an unnecessary complication. To deal with autocorrelated errors, you may fit a regression with ARMA errors. (This can be done using auto.arima function in R and putting the regressor matrix in the argument xreg . I do not know how to do it in Minitab, though.) Alternatively, you may include lags of variables as regressors in the model.
