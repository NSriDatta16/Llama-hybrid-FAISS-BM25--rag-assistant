The question you really have to answer is the tolerance you have for losing data. A request per second transferring under 1k of data isn't much, especially using json vs. xml. Then again, battery life is something to keep in mind on mobile devices, so making a request every 5-60 seconds is also doable. There's no reason you cannot batch your updates to the server. If you have no tolerance for data loss, you could collect your batch of 50 updates on local storage, and upload them. If a failure occurs in transmission you can resend. In this case, however, I would want to have some record ID that's reasonably guaranteed to be unique, such as a UUID. This way the server can see which records it's already processed and exclude them from reprocessing.
