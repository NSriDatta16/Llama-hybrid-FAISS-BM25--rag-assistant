I had this problem with JavaCV as well. I am not sure where the exact problem lie, but I solved it by replacing the following line: storage.release(); with: cvClearMemStorage(lines.storage); It seems to be important to release the memory from the storage object within the resulting CvSeq rather than on the one you originally passed in. Hope this of some help!
