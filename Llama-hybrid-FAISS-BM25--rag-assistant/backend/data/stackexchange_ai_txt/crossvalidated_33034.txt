Typically, heteroskedasticity is modeled using a Breusch-Pagan approach. The residuals from your linear regression are then squared and regressed onto the variables in your original linear model. The latter regression is called an auxiliary regression . $nR^2_a$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $R^2_a$ is the $R^2$ from the auxiliary regression serves as a test statistic for the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity. For your purposes, you could focus on the individual coefficients from this model to see which variables are most predictive of high or low variance outcomes.
