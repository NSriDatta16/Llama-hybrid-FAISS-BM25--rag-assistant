Iterate through a string and add tags using javascript

I'm working on a website project and I have a paragraph containing a list of items (it would work great as a ul , but needs to stay a p ) that needs to have the first letter of each item bold . I've created a function to do this: function inserter(string, splitter, skip) { var array = string.split(splitter); var len = array.length; for(var i = 1; i '; var c = ' '; if(a.substr(0, 3) != skip){ array[i] = splitter + b + a.substr(0,1) + c + a.substr(1); } else { array[i] = splitter + a; } } var strFix = array.join(""); return strFix; } $(function(){ var text = $(".caps").html(); text = inserter(text, ': '); //bold the item after ': ' text = inserter(text, ', ', 'and'); // now bold after the comma ', ' and the skip variable which matches first three letters so the last and doesn't get bold text = inserter(text, ', and '); //now for the item after the last 'and' $(".caps").html(text); }); But it needs to be called and the string iterated for every different splitter (which could ruin performance on pages with more than a few of these), and I'm wondering how I could just call it once so all the splitters are looked at during one iteration? Example page: http://heidikratzke.com/about.php When you see the page, you will see that I will be doing this on multiple paragraphs within a jQuery slideshow. If it doesn't seem like this will be a performance hit for slower browsers, I'll leave it as is. Appreciate any suggestions on how to do it better.
