MATLAB: How to read first two columns of a .txt file. Then average the columns respectively. Repeat this for many sequentially-named files

I have 163 text files. I need to take just the first two columns and average them, respectively. And then I need to repeat this for all files. This is what the files look like: -5.0814,-3.8986,28.66,-39.8 -5.1558,-3.8614,30.42,-40.44 -5.1602,-4.0198,32.98,-39.16 -5.0674,-3.9762,27.02,-38.6 -5.1074,-3.9094,31.62,-37.24 -5.0822,-4.0018,28.78,-40.68 -4.9494,-3.8082,31.02,-37.08 -4.9782,-3.7758,31.74,-39.64 -5.0362,-3.9478,30.9,-37.08 -5.2798,-4.0558,29.34,-39.64 The pattern: 000-int.txt, 001-int.txt, 002-int.txt, ..., 163-int.txt. There are gaps in the numbering. I have multiple copies of these files saved in different directories. ATTEMPT: I tried using fopen/textscan/flclose, and even dlmread, etc. I couldn't get anything to work- at all. I could not figure out how to read one file, let alone create an average or repeat the process in some form of loop. My professor wanted me to help him with some data analysis. Thank you in advance!
