Odd Ratio and logistic regression

Say, I am trying to predict likelihood to buy ice cream (event =1 , non-event = 0) using logistic regression. I have only one variable "Gender" (2 value= Male/Female), so, the formula would be like this. $logit(p)=β_0+β_1∗female$ Odd ratio for female with reference to $male (A) = \frac{odd(female)}{odd(male)}$ Next, I added in "TodayWeather" (2 $value = \frac{Sun}{Rain}$). $logit(p)=β_0+β_1∗female+β_2*SUN$ Q1) Why does the Odd ratio for A with reference to male change? Shouldn't my Odd ratio for female still be the same as (A) above? Since it is still comparing female and male (i.e. the odd of female to buy ice cream if increase by one unit)? Q2) Say (A) above is 1? Why?
