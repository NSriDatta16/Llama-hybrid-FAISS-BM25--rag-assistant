java 6 broke webstart application installation with error 'java.lang.Exception: cache failed for'

After upgrading to the latest java version (Java 6 update 13) a webstart application that was being used in production environments for many years, stopped installing with the following error: java.lang.Exception: cache failed forhttp://localhost:8080/ReactorStudio/studio/installer.jnlp at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.updateFinalLaunchDesc(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareToLaunch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.launch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.launchApp(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.continueInSecureThread(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) The application jnlp is downloaded correctly and all the associated jar files. The application also contains a reference to an installer jnlp file that extracts a few files to the local disk the first the application is being run. Any ideas on what is the problem, or how I could bypass this?
