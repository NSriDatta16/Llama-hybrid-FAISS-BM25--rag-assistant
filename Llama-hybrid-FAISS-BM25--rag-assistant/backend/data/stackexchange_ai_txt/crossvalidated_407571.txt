I'm think the answer on the Biostars web site is wrong. Looking at the dendrogram on Biostars, you can see three Merc450 car models that appear in completely different clusters, when in fact these cars are almost exactly the same. Here's a way to label the vertical axis with 100 down to 0. Note the Merc450 cars near the left side of the dendrogram. mat = mtcars library(vegan) d1 $height has the heights of join points # original scale was [0, .63] axis(side=2, at=seq(0, max(h1$ height), length=6), labels=seq(100,0,-20))
