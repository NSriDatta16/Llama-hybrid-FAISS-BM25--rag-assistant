Using the %{HTTP_HOST} variable for session.save_path in .htaccess

I'm trying to write an .htaccess file that will be placed on a number of different sites, and I don't want to have to change the domain in the session.save_path for each site. I'm trying to use the %{HTTP_HOST} variable but it's not working. The paths to the session storage folders on the server look like this: /var/foo/vhosts/siteone.com/httpdocs/session/ /var/foo/vhosts/sitetwo.com/httpdocs/session/ So I'm trying to make this work dynamically, regardless of domain name. Here's what I've got that doesn't work: php_value session.save_path /var/foo/vhosts/%{HTTP_HOST}/httpdocs/session What am I doing wrong?
