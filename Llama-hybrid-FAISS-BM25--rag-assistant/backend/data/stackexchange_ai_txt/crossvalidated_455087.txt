OK, the service area is likely many hundreds of thousands for the U of Washington and for certain patients covers a five state area. The detection rate for a tertiary/quaternary referral center reflects the patient selection process, same criteria for referring patients in distress might lead to same detection rate. However, more precisely one cannot make inferences on that basis because the criteria for patient selection for testing is an uncontrolled variable. To explain this a bit more, a primary or community hospital would refer patients to a larger regional hospital which refers patients to a specialized tertiary care hospital, and for certain problems, tertiary care hospitals would send patients to a quaternary care facility. Even more complicated, a local physician in the community, might refer a patient directly to a quaternary care facility, or the patient might walk in to the emergency room off of the street. So, there are so many confounders that any correlation you might make risks being spurious. BTW, the raw data you linked to was not organized for peer review, I review for 17 medical journals, and I am telling you as simply as I can that without controlling for the referral pattern, there is only limited use for the raw data.
