How can I access a user role in Drupal from a separate application?

Is there a plugin/standard HTTP API for accessing user roles/permissions in a Drupal 6 instance from other applications, e.g., on different hosts? Our organization uses Shibboleth to allow easy authentication across all our hosts, but I'd like to use our central Drupal 6 installation to manage user roles rather than storing roles data in each separate application we build, e.g., in Zend Framework. Of course we could run direct queries on the Drupal DB from these apps, but I'd prefer to not.
