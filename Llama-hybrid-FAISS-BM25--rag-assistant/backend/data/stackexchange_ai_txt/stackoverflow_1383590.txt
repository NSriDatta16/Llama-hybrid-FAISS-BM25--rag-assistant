Code organization in Python: Where is a good place to put obscure methods?

I have a class called Path for which there are defined about 10 methods, in a dedicated module Path.py . Recently I had a need to write 5 more methods for Path , however these new methods are quite obscure and technical and 90% of the time they are irrelevant. Where would be a good place to put them so their context is clear? Of course I can just put them with the class definition, but I don't like that because I like to keep the important things separate from the obscure things. Currently I have these methods as functions that are defined in a separate module, just to keep things separate, but it would be better to have them as bound methods. (Currently they take the Path instance as an explicit parameter.) Does anyone have a suggestion?
