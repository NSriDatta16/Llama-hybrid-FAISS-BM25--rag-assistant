A pointer has following advantages: a) You can do a lazy initialization, that means to init / create the object only short before the first real usage. b) The design: if you use pointers for members of an external class type, you can place a forward declaration above your class and thus don't need to include the headers of that types in your header - instead of that you include the third party headers in your .cpp - that has the advantage to reduce the compile time and prevents side effects by including too many other headers. class ExtCamera; // forward declaration to external class type in "ExtCamera.h" class MyCamera { public: MyCamera() : m_pCamera(0) { } void init(const ExtCamera &cam); private: ExtCamera *m_pCamera; // do not use it in inline code inside header! }; c) A pointer can be deleted anytime - so you have more control about the livetime and can re-create an object - for example in case of a failure.
