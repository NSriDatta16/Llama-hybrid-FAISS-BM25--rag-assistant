Choosing layer hyper-parameters of a CNN

Context: I'm building a CNN on MATLAB to classify wallpaper groups . I'm using the following network type. CONV -> ReLU -> POOL -> CONV -> ReLU -> POOL -> FC -> DROPOUT -> FC -> SOFTMAX Should the parameters for the first CONV or POOL layers be the same as the second (or later) CONV or POOL layers succeeding it? If not, is there a meaningful way to choose parameters for the repeated succeeding layers? For example, for the first CONV layer you may pick a 5x5 filter. Perhaps for the second CONV layer it's more meaningful to pick a certain different size filter?
