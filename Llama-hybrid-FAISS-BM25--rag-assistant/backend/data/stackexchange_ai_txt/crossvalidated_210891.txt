ARMA errors and combining explanatory variables

Currently I'm working on forecasting the employee turnover of an organisation. To do this, I'm using a time series data of the employee turnover over the past 7 years, it is an annual data. To make a good prediction it is also important to add some explanatory variable. I want to use multiple regression with ARMA errors. But I'm not sure how to use these error to do some prediction. Do I need to make a prediction of each of the explanatory variable first, then add this predicted value in the model to do the prediction of the employee turnover? Or will the model do all the predictions of the dependent and independent variable and give me a predicted value of the dependent variable (turnover)? I am really having a hard time putting all the variables in a model that gives me a good prediction. Also, the internal data has only a few observation, whereas the external data has more historical data. How can I combine these two data to do a multiple regression?
