The way to do this on Mac OS X is using Launch Services. It replaces the older system services such as init and crontab and provides a single, unified framework for managing system services. In your case, you probably don't need a separate script - keeping an instance of your app running should be handled by the system. First you need to create .plist file that describes your daemon/script/application. You place it in one of the following locations, depending on the type of service: ~/Library/LaunchAgents : Per-user agents provided by the user. /Library/LaunchAgents : Per-user agents provided by the administrator. /Library/LaunchDaemons : System wide daemons provided by the administrator. /System/Library/LaunchAgents : Mac OS X Per-user agents. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons : Mac OS X System wide daemons. Once you have defined the service, you can use the launchctl command to control launchd . For example, you can list running services, start/stop services, and so on.
