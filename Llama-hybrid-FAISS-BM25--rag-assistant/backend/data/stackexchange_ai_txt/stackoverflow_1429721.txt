I don't think the goal of Resharper was to provide a utility to execute an entire test suite from within Visual Studio. That is usually the goal of a build server or test suite server running continuous integration tools (like NUnit launched from CruiseControl) The Resharper unit test runner appears best leveraged by running small sets of unit tests to diagnose and satisfy a particular unit of code. It allows you to create focused test suites that can be conveniently run from within the studio, debugged, repeated, and analyzed quickly without waiting for builds. I would recommend leveraging a build server for running the complete suite of tests.
