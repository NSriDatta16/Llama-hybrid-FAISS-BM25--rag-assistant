I'll have to disagree with most of the answers here and claim that Machine Learning has a very precise scope and a clear cut distinction from Statistics. ML is a sub-field of computer science with a long history, which only in recent years has found applications outside its domain. ML's paternal field and application domain lies within Artificial Intelligence (robotics, pattern recognition software, etc), therefore, it's not just a "hot term" like "Big Data" or "Data Science". Statistics, on the other hand, (which comes from the word "state") was developed within social and economical sciences as a tool for humans, not machines. ML evolved separately from statistics and, eventhough somewhere along the way it started relying heavily on statistical principles, it is by no means a subfield of statistics. ML and statistics are complementary, not overlapping fields. Long answer : As implied by its name ML methods were made for software/machines while statistical methods were made for humans. Both ML and statistics deal with predictions on data, however, ML methods follow a non-parametric automatised approach whereas statistical methods require a great deal of manual model-building work with an added explanatory factor. This makes perfect sense if you consider that ML algorithms were developed in AI research as a means of automatised prediction-making that was meant to be integrated in robotics software (e.g. for the purposes of voice and face recognition). When a "machine" makes a prediction, it doesn't care about the reasons behind it. A machine doesn't care to know the drivers/predictors behind a model which classifies email as spam or non-spam, it only cares to have the best accuracy of prediction. This is why virtually all ML methods are black boxes , it's not because they don't have a model, it's because the model is constructed algorithmically and not meant to be visible to neither human nor machine. The concept of "training" in ML relies on computational power, whereas statistical model-building with OLS-type of methods for parameter estimation relies on the knowledge of a human expert. In a multiple regression scenario it's strictly up to the statistician to use his expert judgement in order to choose his model and verify all required statistical assumptions. A statistician's goal is not just to find patterns and use them for predictions but also to understand his data and his problem in a much greater depth than ML. Of course in some occasions ML and statistics do overlap, as is the case with many disciplines. Logistic regression is one of these occasions; originally a statistical method, which bears so much resemblance to the simple Perceptron (one of the most fundamental ML techniques), that it is by some seen as a ML method.
