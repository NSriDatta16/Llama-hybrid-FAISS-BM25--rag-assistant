You could use exec or backticks and actually run it from the command line through php. Apparently the mysql command has a -H switch you can use, and it will output HTML formatted. Haven't tried it though, but that might look good too. echo ' '; echo `mysql -u user -ppass -e "select * from table;" database_name`; 2 lines, no pear packages, how much more elegant can it get for a quick and dirty stats page.
