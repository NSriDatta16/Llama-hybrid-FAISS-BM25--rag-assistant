Why is the kernel - $(1-|\gamma_i-\gamma_j|) \ k_{SE}$ - non-stationary?

Stationary kernel which only depends upon the lag between the inputs and not on the absolute values of the inputs. Having read this guideline, I was wondering why the following kernel mentioned in [1] (which deals with Gaussian process regression) is non-stationary. \begin{equation} k(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j)=(1-|\gamma_i-\gamma_j|) \ k_{SE}(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j), \end{equation} where $k_{SE}$ is a standard squared exponential kernel and $\gamma_i,\gamma_j$ are parameters depending upon the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ inputs. A standard squared exponential kernel is given by: $\hspace{90pt} k_{SE}(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j)=\sigma_f^2\ exp(-\frac{1}{2} \ \frac{||{\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j||}^2}{\sigma_l^2})$, where $\{\sigma_f^2,\sigma_l^2\}$ are hyperparameters. My question is : How is $k(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j)$ a non-stationary kernel, if it depends upon $||\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j||$ and $|\gamma_i-\gamma_j|$ (basically only lag between the inputs). Another question is : If I define $\gamma_i = c \ \forall \ i$, where $c=\{-1,0,1\}$ but the chosen value for $c$ depends on the $i^{th}$ input, would the kernel still be non-stationary?
