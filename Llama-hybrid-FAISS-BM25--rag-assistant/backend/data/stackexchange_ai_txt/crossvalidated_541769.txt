You may want to look at DAG-GNN where they essentially train a Variational autoencoder such that one layer in the encoder represents the structure $A$ of a Bayesian Network to be learned One of the key challenges there is to require the learned structure to have certain graph properties, like acyclicity in the case of a DAG. In case of the DAG-GNN, the acyclicity requirement puts a non-trivial constraint on the layer weight which results in a much more involved train method.
