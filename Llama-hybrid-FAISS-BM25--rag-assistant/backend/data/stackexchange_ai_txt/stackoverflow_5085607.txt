Its a little hard to explain so I made this awesome table. the first column's commands are listed below, the other columns marks wheter it deletes using an X. Original is the original file, thumbnails the thumbnails for the original and KV means the Key Value store reference. | Command | Original | Thumbnails | KV Original | KV Thumbnails | | #1 | X | X | X | X | | #2 | | X | | X | | #3 | | X | X | X | sorl.thumbnail.delete(filename) sorl.thumbnail.default.kvstore.delete_thumbnails(image_file) sorl.thumbnail.delete(filename, delete_file=False) As I understand it you really want to do #3. Now, your problem... a guess is that filename does not refer to a filename relative to MEDIA_ROOT (if you are using another storage backend the situation would be similar). But I think I need to know what you are doing besides this to get a better picture, note that ImageFields and FileFields do not overwrite, also note that django changed the deletion behaviour in 1.2.5, see release notes. Update: Anyone reading this should note that the above way to generate thumbnail filenames is extremely inefficient , please do not use if you care anything at about performance.
