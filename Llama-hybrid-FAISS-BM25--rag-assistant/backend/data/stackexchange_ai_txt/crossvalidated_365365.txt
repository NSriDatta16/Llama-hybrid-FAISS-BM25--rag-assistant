Why adding noisy predictors improves my random Forest prediction?

I am doing some tests with randomForest and I cannot understand the following results : set.seed(12345) library(caret);library(randomForest) rmse_vec1 cor_vec1)) # 47 length(which(rmse_vec2 In 94 % (for correlation) and 84 % (for RMSE) of tests, y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 is doing better than y ~ x1 + x3 even if y ! Could anyone explain me this result ?
