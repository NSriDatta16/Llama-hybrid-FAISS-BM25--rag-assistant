Effects of including the square term in a regression

my question is the following: when including squared terms in a linear regression, and possibily interactions of those with other controls, should I expect a specific change in significance of the estimates? For example, should I expect that coefficients are on average less significant because I am trying to estimate more of them (even if they refer to the same underlying variables)?
