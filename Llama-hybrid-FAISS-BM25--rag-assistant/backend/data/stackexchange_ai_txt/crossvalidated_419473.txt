There is a popular Tesseract OCR engine developed by Google. As of the time of this writing, the latest stable version is 4.1.0, released on July 7, 2019, which is neural network (LSTM)-based. The main Github repository is https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract . There are R and Python bindings for this engine. If you are using R, for example, you can browse this article covering the tesseract package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/vignettes/intro.html . It shows how it can provide a user with the coordinates of bounding boxes for each word in an image and a confidence score. If you are using Python, the pytesseract library can accomplish the same task: https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract , https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/ . As described in the first link, the image_to_data function returns result containing box boundaries, confidences, and other information.
