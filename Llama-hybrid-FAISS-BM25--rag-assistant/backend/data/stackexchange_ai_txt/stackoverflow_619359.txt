We have a development branch for each bugfix, feature or task, and involved projects tend to have multiple sub branches. Initially it is kind of wierd creating a new branch for just a one line code fix, but it allows merging the trunk into the branch, then regression testing and finally merging back into trunk. Ideally this means that anything merged into trunk will not break the build, and it means that you aren't scared of committing your code to make a fragile build. I often use multiple branches for the one issue, testing out different solutions while still getting the benefits of SCM. We also tag specific versions or releases, allowing quick deployment based off of known good code. Alot of our web based systems use svn:externals that point to specific versions of dependencies such as libraries and vendor code. A deployment is taken from the externals, rather than a straight checkout or export.
