If I understand correctly, you are trying to get a mean score for each vendor and you have multiple raters (people) who rate the vendors, but their scores are unreliable (because they consistently underrate or overrate a vendor). In that case one option would be to z-score (standardization) the raters' scores (not the vendors'), such that all scores for each rater are on the same scale. So if a rater consistently assigned higher scores than usual, this higher score will become his "normal" score - his average. After that you can estimate a mean z-score for each vendor. This will change the interpretation of the score. What you will get is a measure of which vendors are above average (>0) and which are below average (
