Selecting priors based on measurement error

How do you calculate the appropriate prior if you have the measurement error of an instrument? This paragraph is from Cressie's book "Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data": It is often the case that some prior information is available regarding the measurement-error variance, allowing a fairly informative parameter model to be specified. For example, if we are assuming conditionally independent measurement errors that are iid $Gau(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$, then we should specify an informative prior for $\sigma_{\epsilon}^2$. Say we were interested in ambient air temperature, and we saw that the instrument manufacturer’s specifications indicated an “error” of $±0.1°C$. Assuming that this “error” corresponds to 2 standard deviations (an assumption that should be checked!), we might then specify $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$ to have a prior mean of $(0.1/2)^2 = 0.0025$. Because of the instrument manufacturer’s specification, we would assume a distribution that had a clearly defined and fairly narrow peak at 0.0025 (e.g., inverse gamma). In fact, we could just fix at 0.0025; however, the data-model error may have other components of uncertainty too (Section 7.1). To avoid possible identifiability problems with process-model error, it is very important that modelers reduce the uncertainty in as much as the Science allows, including doing side studies designed to have replicated data. Does anyone know what is the general procedure to obtain the values of a prior as described above (although the paragraph only refers to obtaining the prior mean)?
