Shapelets for Cross Sectional Time Series Data

I'm currently investigating how to apply shapelet transformations to cross sectional time series (panel) data from this paper: https://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/pub/pdfs/grabocka2014e-kdd.pdf Say that you have panel data in the following format: Would it still be possible (or even appropriate) to be able to create shapelets? Also, could a kalman filter be used if the observation intervals are irregular? I have only seen discussions of creating shapelets with individual time series with real values. Any advice or insight would be appreciated!
