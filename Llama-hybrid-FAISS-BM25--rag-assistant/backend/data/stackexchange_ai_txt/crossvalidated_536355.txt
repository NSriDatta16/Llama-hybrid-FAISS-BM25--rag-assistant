Should you exclude one level of a categorical variable when it's part of an interaction term?

I know that in linear and logistic regression, if we have a categorical variable (X1) with 3 levels (a, b, c) and we create 3 dummies, there are two ways to model. Drop the constant and include all 3 dummies Keep the constant and only include 2 dummies My question is, if you want to build a model where (X2) is a quantitative variable: Y = X1 + X2 + X1*X2 If we would like to include the constant, would we want to have have two X1 * X2 terms or three X1 * X2 terms? That is would our final model be: Y = C + X1a + X1b + X2 + X1a * X2 + X1b * X2 Or Y = C + X1a + X1b + X2 + X1a * X2 + X1b * X2 + X1c * X2
