@ImperativelyAblative has many good points. Adding to that, many companies, especially banks, that rooted in SAS have started to experiment with R. This is because of the cost saving and maturing enterprise support, think of RStudio Server and Cloudera. SAS is great, but it comes with a premium price tag (some may argue it's even overpriced). I am a management consultant working at a top tier firm with specialty in data science. We serve most of the global companies and work with their executives and operating teams. Moving to open source tools, such as R, has gained the blessing of many top executives and building tractions among core analytics teams (Marketing, Modelling, etc.). The point being - the market is moving towards open source tools The other consideration, in my opinion, is the role you aspire to play in an organization. Here are some archetypes based on my experience in working with the analytics teams: General Business Analyst : R, Interactive visualization tools (Tableau / QlikView), some SQL, and Excel / Powerpoint (of course) Modeller : SAS is must, R (my clients are all trying to pick this up), deep in SQL / HQL (querying on Hadoop stack), and strong domain knowledge (risk model, pricing, operation optimization, etc.) Application Developer (people who put things into production): SAS is must, Python, and automation language Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but hope it provides some industry trend for your reference. There is always the superstar in any organization who knows all these stuff, could be you :)
