Wix: COM registration with heat or ComPlusExtension?

We build our setups with Wix . We have a mix of native and .NET components, and use COM for interop. Until now, I have used heat.exe to generate wix fragments for installing .NET assemblies and registering them as COM servers. The wix fragment created by heat takes care of writing the COM related registry entries. However, somebody just told me that you can also use the ComPlusExtension to do COM registration. The documentation I can find regarding this "ComPlus" stuff is quite cryptic. Is this ComPlusExtension a valid alternative to the heat.exe approach for registering .NET assemblies as COM components? Are there any differences or gotchas I should be aware of?
