I don't know about Visual Studio's test coverage tools. Our SD C++ Test Coverage Tool will combine test coverage vectors from a single instrumented set of source code, no matter how many times you compile/link it (as long as you don't change the source of the code being tested). This tool can be obtained for the Visual Studio dialect(s) of C++. SD's test coverage tools for other languages have this same property.
