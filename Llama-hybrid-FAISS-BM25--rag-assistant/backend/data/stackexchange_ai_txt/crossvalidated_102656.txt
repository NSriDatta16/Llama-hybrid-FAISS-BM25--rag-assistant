@Glen_b offered one solution. It is correct for each individual, and that's fine. But you have 190 individuals. By chance, some of them will be above chance level and some below. For example, here is a R code for a single case of 190 people flipping 20 coins. set.seed(19291010) choices If we say that 1 = heads and 0 = tails then 8 people got 14 heads, 4 got 15 heads and 1 got 16 heads; also, 9 got 14 tails, 3 got 15 tails and 1 got 4 tails. This makes sense, since, per Glen's table, 6 \% should get at least 14, and 6\% of 190 is 12 (with some rounding). This gets a little bit Bayesian. If you assume that the choices are random, then, by definition, anyone who gets a lot correct is just "lucky" (whatever that means!). But if it's really random, then in the next set of 20 tosses, mostly different people will get a lot of heads. If you assume that the choices are all skill, then anyone who gets a large number correct is "skillful" (or knowledgeable etc). If you don't know if it's luck or skill, then you might compare the first 10 questions to the second 10; if there is more than chance consistency, that person is "good". But then you have to figure out what the consistency will be, by chance.
