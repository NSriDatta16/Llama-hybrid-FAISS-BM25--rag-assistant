Reflection in C# -- want a list of the data types of a class' fields

My C# class MyClass (below) has members a, b, c, d, e, and f. I'd like to use reflection to obtain a list of the data types of those members; for example (borrowing from Python notation): [ char[], ushort, char, byte, uint, ulong ]. class MyClass { public char [ ] a ; public ushort b ; public char c ; public byte d ; public uint e ; public ulong f ; } class MainClass { public static void Main ( string [] args ) { // get an array (or some kind of list) of MyClass' fields' data types ... // for example: { char[], ushort, char, byte, uint, ulong } // I've tried the following, but can't get a column of just the data types, alone ... MemberInfo[] theMemberInfoArray = typeof(MyClass).GetMembers() ; foreach (MemberInfo mi in theMemberInfoArray) if (mi.MemberType == MemberTypes.Field) Console.WriteLine ( " \t" + " \t" + " \t" + mi ) ; } } Program output appears as below: Char[] a UInt16 b Char c Byte d UInt32 e UInt64 f I would like program output to appear as: Char[] a UInt16 b Char c Byte d UInt32 e UInt64 f
