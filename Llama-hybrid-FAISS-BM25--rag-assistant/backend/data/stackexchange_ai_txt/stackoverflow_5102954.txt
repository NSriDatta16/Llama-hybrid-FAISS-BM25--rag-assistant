Restore oryginal value after validation fails - infragistics UltraWinGrid

I've set RegexpPattern property in Infragistics UltraWinGrid column and it works - when user edit cell and given input doesn't match regexp cell is cleared. I would like to restore previous ( before edit started) value of cell instead of make it blank. How can I do it? thanks in advance!
