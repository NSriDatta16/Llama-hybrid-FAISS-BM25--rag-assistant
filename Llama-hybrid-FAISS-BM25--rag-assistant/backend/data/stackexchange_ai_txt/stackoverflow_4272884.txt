RoR: Parsing html < into < and other similar HTML to literals

I'm using the GCal4Ruby gems plugin. I'm trying to get it render an embedded google calendar. So the relevant method is to_iframe as described here: http://cookingandcoding.com/docs/gcal4ruby/classes/GCal4Ruby/Service.html When I call the method, it produces: Figure 1 text here " displayed as text in the page, which is sort of what I want but looking at the source it renders as: Figure 2: &lt;iframe src ="relevant_and_working_Gcal_URL" width="100%" height="300"&gt; text here &lt;/iframe&gt; So my question is there any ruby method that will take in a string argument and do the relevant replacements? In other words, it would take in the string figure 2 and return the string in figure 1. I'll post an exact example when I can get back in an hour or two.
