Resulting clusters are very uneven

I am clustering a set of 50k products. I would expect the resulting clusters to be things like "organic chicken", "orange juice", etc. I am using the bag of words model, and there are about 8k features. I have tried using mini-batch k means, tuning the parameters including cluster size from 100 to 500. The algorithm produces some clusters which are extremely specific (which is good). However, it places the majority of products into about 2 clusters (which is very bad). I'm trying to investigate why the clusters are so uneven. It clearly has the ability to detect similar products based on similar words for some clusters, so I'm not sure why it places the majority into a small number of clusters. Maybe I should be using a different NLP model or a different clustering algorithm. Thanks!
