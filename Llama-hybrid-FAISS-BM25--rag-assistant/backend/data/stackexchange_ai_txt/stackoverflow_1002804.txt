How can I invoke a post from VB code to an iframe on a page?

I've written the code to post the information to a page, however I don't know how to make the post target the iframe I've placed on the page. (I haven't tested this code so I'm not sure if the post even works) Dim param1, param2, result, url As String Dim request As HttpWebRequest Dim paramStream() As Byte Dim requestResponse As WebResponse param1= "name=" + Server.UrlEncode("My Name") param2= "email=" + Server.UrlEncode("email@mail.com") paramStream = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(param1+ "&" + param2) url = "https://www.mysite.com/dosomething.php" request = WebRequest.Create(url) request.Method = "POST" request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; sv-SE; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2" request.ContentLength = paramStream.Length Using stream = request.GetRequestStream() stream.Write(paramStream, 0, paramStream.Length) End Using requestResponse = request.GetResponse() Using sr = New StreamReader(requestResponse.GetResponseStream()) result = sr.ReadToEnd() End Using That is what I have written to post to the website, however I would like the post to affect an iframe which I have placed on the page. I know when you're writing html you can have a target specified in the form tag But I wasn't sure if there is one similar to target that I can specify from VB code. Just a note: I am trying to do a post from a ASP.NET page to a PHP page that is contained in an iframe. I have not tested that this even works to post yet, if you see anything in my code that needs fixing up or have any suggestions for how to do this a different way please let me know.
