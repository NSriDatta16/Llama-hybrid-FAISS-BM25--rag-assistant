When I check the JSON format I see that solidi are allowed to be escaped so json_encode is in fact working correctly. (source: json.org ) The bug link posted by satrun77 even says "It's not incorrect to escape slashes." If you're adamant to do without and (in this case) are certain to be working with a string you can use a hack like this: echo '["', addslashes($string), '"]'; Obviously that doesn't help for more complicated structures but as luck has it, you are using Magento which is highly modifiable. Copy lib/Zend/Json/Encoder.php to app/core/local/Zend/Json/Encoder.php (which forms an override) and fix it's _encodeString method.
