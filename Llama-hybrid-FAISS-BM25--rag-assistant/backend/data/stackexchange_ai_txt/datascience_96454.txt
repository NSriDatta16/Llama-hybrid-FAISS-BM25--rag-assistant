For me it sounds like Time Series Anomaly Detection. You can follow the example here: https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-anomaly-detection-with-pycaret-706a6e2b2427 . In Pycaret there are over 10 anomaly detection algorithms (wrapper of the pyod library). You should use several of them, play with the fraction (threshold) and check which combination works best for your data. In case that you have some collection of anomalities, you can use a classification (if you have several inputs in your dataset, that could describe the anomalities or if it is possible to generate inputs by yourself).
