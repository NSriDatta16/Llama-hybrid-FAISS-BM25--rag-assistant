Using object instead of AppDelegate for Outlets & Actions?

In all the MonoTouch examples I have seen everyone is using outlets and actions on AppDelegate, yet when I've been through some objective-C webcasts I see people using an Object they drag onto XIB in Interface Builder and using that (Seems a lot cleaner). Is there just not a way to reference any Objects like that that we create? Is there a particular way to access it? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks
