How to find 95% credible interval of a posterior predictive distribution?

I obtained a posterior predictive with 1,000 samples using MCMC, and I need to quantify the 95% credible intervals. I know that the difference between confidence intervals and credible intervals. One is on the frequentist; the other is in a probabilistic sense. The issue is how to quantify the 95% credible intervals of a sampled and discrete distribution since the analytical expression of CDFs and PDFs remains unknown. Here I attached a figure of the sampled posterior distribution. The mean and std are 9.4336e+4 and 1.1112e+04. Please help me with how to calculate the credible intervals with the above information of the targeted distribution. I appreciate your help and advice!
