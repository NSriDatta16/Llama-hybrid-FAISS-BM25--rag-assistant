Here's my take on it. Might be overly naive, but anyway: An "unbiased" guess would be to take the entire area of Chile and divide by 15. Any other choice would require us to justify why we think it should be bigger or smaller than the other regions. As for assigning probabilities for the intervals: Without any extra information and any extra guesses, I'd naively assume a linear cumulative probability function: I.e. the probability that the area of Atacama is less than A will be $F(A)$ where $F(0) = 0$ and $F(size-of-Chile) = 1$. Or in other words, assume a uniform probability density function. Interestingly, that leads to an answer that is independent of the number of regions. Because it's overly naive. Next up, with my naive assumption, I don't actually think that adds new information but I could be wrong. In that case, first remove that smallest region from Chile's total area, then use a cdf that is 0 for any area below that small region's area (because it's the smallest). Finally, in that case, take out the region's area from the remaining area (Chile minus smallest). But this time we don't gather additional information from the placement, because the smaller and larger regions can be (taken together) anything. So there goes. I feel like with Bayesian magic, with which I'm not overly familiar, one could do much more interesting things.
