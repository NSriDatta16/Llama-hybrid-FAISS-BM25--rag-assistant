Parts of image missing when using ScaleTransform with LayoutTransformer and Scrollviewer on Windows Phone 7

I am trying to have a scaled image in a ScrollViewer in my Windows Phone 7 application. On the application page I define the controls like this: The LayoutTransformer class is coming from the Silverlight Extension project. I have methods to handle the ZoomIn and ZoomOut events and I do the following there: private void ApplicationBarIconButton_Click_1(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Zoom In ImageScale.ScaleX = ImageScale.ScaleY = ImageScale.ScaleX + 0.5; LayoutTransformer.ApplyLayoutTransform(); ImageScroller.InvalidateMeasure(); } However when I have a Zoom-In and the Image is changed the ScrollView control has empty area at the bottom and at the right side of the Image. Almost as if the Image was scaled but clipped using the size of the original image before the scale transform. Any ideas what I am doing wrong? I also created a project that reproduces this problem: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2598447/ZoomTest.WP7.zip
