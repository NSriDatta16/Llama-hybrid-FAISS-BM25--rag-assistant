Simulating data for logistic regression with unbalanced classes

I want to simulate categorical data for logistic regression, and those data need to have unbalanced class representation. Simulating for logistic regression with (nearly) balanced classes is simple enough in R: n If I run this 10,000 times and look at the mean of the exponentiated coefficient, it always comes out nearly 1.5. But what if I want the same odds ratio and have a sampling that provides 25% cases and 75% controls? The only approach I've come up with is to simulate too many examples, and then down-sample the appropriate amounts from each class: n My interpretation is that I'm simulating a population and then sampling from that population. I tend to get a similar degree of error in the coefficient estimate as with the balanced case, but I want to make sure I'm not misinterpreting something or introducing an additional bias.
