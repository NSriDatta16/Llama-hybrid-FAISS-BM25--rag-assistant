How to different views (sheets) from the same sheet in Excel?

I want to create 2 sheets in Excel where one is the mirror of the other but with different organization. More precisely, I have one sheet with three columns that organize items inside their categories and one column for their price, like this: Category | SubCateg | Item | Price ---------------------------------- catA | | | | subA1 | | | | aaa | 80 | | bbb | 100 | subA2 | | | | ccc | 90 catB | | | | subB1 | | | | ddd | 100 I want to create another sheet with the same data but ordered by price, like this: Category | SubCateg | Item | Price ---------------------------------- catA | | | | subA1 | | | | bbb | 100 catB | | | | subB1 | | | | ddd | 100 catA | | | | subA2 | | | | ccc | 90 | subA1 | | | | aaa | 80 It doesn't necessarily need to look like this, but this ilustrates what I want. I can't just order by price because of the categories in different columns. I also don't want to do any macro/formulas to concatenate categories+items or something like this. I tried to make a pivot chart but I couldn't make it work, also because of the many columns to describe one item. Am I doing something wrong in the pivot chart? Is there a better way to represent items inside categories so I could make this work better? I also would like to make the changes made on the mirror sheet to be applied on the first, if I'm not asking too much... Any way to make this work would be appreciated.
