Human readable, recursive, sorted list of largest files

What is the best practice for printing a top 10 list of largest files in a POSIX shell? There has to be something more elegant than my current solution: DIR="." N=10 LIMIT=512000 find $DIR -type f -size +"${LIMIT}k" -exec du {} \; | sort -nr | head -$N | perl -p -e 's/^\d+\s+//' | xargs -I {} du -h {} where LIMIT is a file size threshold to limit the results of find.
