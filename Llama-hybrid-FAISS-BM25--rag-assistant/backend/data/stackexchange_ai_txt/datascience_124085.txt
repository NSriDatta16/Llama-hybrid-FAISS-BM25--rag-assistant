for multi-tasking training should I use big datasets as one file or each table as one csv?

Assuming we want to create a dataset of books. There would be dataset A: id_book, title, Author, Subject, Topic, Body [paragraph 1,2,3], Sites ... I was wondering what if i split each book into one dataset xy each, in varius forms but not always the same, always linking to the dataset A [id_book]
