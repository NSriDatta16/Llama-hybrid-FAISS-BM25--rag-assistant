I would create a heatmap with the data except for the totals, and add a separate row and column next to the heatmap showing the totals. This does not really capture the "decomposition" aspect, but it should at least draw attention to particularly high or low values. (Just be careful to actually use black body radiation colors rather than, say, rainbow colors - see also here .) R code (which I am not overly proud of; see also https://stackoverflow.com/q/46091522/452096 ): dataset 0.5,"black","white")) } rescaled_value 0.5,"black","white")) } for ( jj in 1:(ncol(dataset)-1) ) { rescaled_value 0.5,"black","white")) }
