When you transform the data, you're supposed to transform feature values of the training objects, and then use any parameters from that for transforming values of the same features for test objects. (do not transform all the data together). Thus, for mean-zero standardization: Estimate average and s.d. for feature values in the training set Standardize the feature values of the training objects. Apply the averages and s.d. of feature values of training objects to transform feature values of test objects. Same with normalization in range [0,1]. Dummy(0,1) variables don't need to be transformed. Imputing would follow the same logic -- use the training set to get the imputation information, and apply to the test set.
