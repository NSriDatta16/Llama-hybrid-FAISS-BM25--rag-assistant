Amount of data needed for deep learning vs support vector machine

I often read about the fact, that the amount of data to train and get a generalizing model for a deep learning algorithm is much higher in comparison, e.g. to a support vector machine. It makes sense, because of the huge amount of parameters in a deep learning approach, which potentially leads to overfitting. However: Are there any systematic studies on this? Do deep learning approaches really need more data? Best regards, Gesetzt
