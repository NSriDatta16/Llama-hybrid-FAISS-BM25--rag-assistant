Best way to sort XML attributes consistently throughout XML files in C#

I am trying to write a Xaml parser that would sort all the attributes of every tags in xaml files to keep the code organized and consistent. I have fairly limited knowledge of C# and LINQ as I'm a front-end designer / developer, not a C# guru. As far as I know, xaml is XML therefore, this would work with just any xml files. I will have parameters that will let the user order the attributes. I tried using Regexp, it didn't go too well, I then tried using "XElement.Parse", no luck. It seems to not like x:Name etc. What would be the best way?
