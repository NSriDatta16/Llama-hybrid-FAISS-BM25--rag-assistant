I suggest outlier detection models for your case. In particular Local Outlier Factor. Local outlier factor tries to detect samples that behave like an outlier within a group. It can be useful for your case. I don't know what are the survey questions but for example, let's say living in downtown with 3 children and going a cinema 4 times in a week form a group of people. Let's say average income of the group is 150k usd per year. You saw a family in survey results in that group and said 65k usd per year, you can easily say that there might be a misstatement since families like that have higher income. Local outlier factor provides you such anomalies. I hope its clear. You can find more information in Wiki and sklearn .
