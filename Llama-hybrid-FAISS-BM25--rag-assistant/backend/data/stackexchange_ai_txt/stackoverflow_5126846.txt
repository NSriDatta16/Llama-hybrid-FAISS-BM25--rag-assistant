Constructor chaining in conjunction with the base constructor invocation

Say I have the following: class Base { public Base (int n) { } public Base (Object1 n, Object2 m) { } } class Derived : Base { string S; public Derived (string s, int n) : base(n) { S = s; } public Derived (string s, Object1 n, Object2 m) : base(n, m) { S = s; // repeated } } Notice how I need formal argument n in both overloads of the Derived and thus I have to repeat the N = n; line. Now I know that this can be encapsulated into a separate method but you still need the same two method calls from both overloads. So, is there a more 'elegant' way of doing this, maybe by using this in conjunction with base ? This is so that I can have a have a private constructor taking one argument s and the other two overloads can call that one...or is this maybe just the same as having a separate private method?
