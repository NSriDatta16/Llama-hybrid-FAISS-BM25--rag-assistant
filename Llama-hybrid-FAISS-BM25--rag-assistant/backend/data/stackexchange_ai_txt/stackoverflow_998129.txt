Coverage is not a (meaningful) property of individual tests. As you say, one test should cover only a single behavior. Performance, although it is (generally) only significant in the aggregate, is very important, and here's why. We run tests for lots of reasons. The fewer barriers there are to writing and running them, the more tests we'll have - and the better our code coverage will be. If we don't run tests because it's too much trouble - we don't run tests; we don't discover our bugs; our productivity suffers. So they should be automated (zero trouble). If we don't run tests because it takes time away from coding - or because the time they take distracts us from the problem, jars our concentration: we don't run tests; we don't discover our bugs; our productivity suffers. So they should be fast enough that running them is not a distraction. If our tests hit the file system or the database much, that will slow them down and we'll run them less. So avoid that; abstract away the slow bits. Test early and often. Test lots. If they're slow, you won't. So keep them fast.
