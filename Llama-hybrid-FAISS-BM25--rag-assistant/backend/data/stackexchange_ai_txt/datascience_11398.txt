Mahalanobis distance depends on the covariance matrix, which is usually local to each cluster. If you want a distance of two clusters, the following two approaches stand out: the weighted average distance of each object to the other cluster, using the other clusters Mahalanobis distance. You could approximate this by using the distance of the centroid only. Maybe use the maximum of the two clusters to resolve asymmetry. This will likely not be a metric. divergence measures, that measure the overlap of the two Gaussians, and not of the individual data points. I believe some of the divergence measures should be metric .
