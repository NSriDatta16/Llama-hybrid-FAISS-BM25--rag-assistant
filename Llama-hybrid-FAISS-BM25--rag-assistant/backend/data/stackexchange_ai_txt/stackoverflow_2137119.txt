I'm not sure why you'd want to monitor the movement of the mouse in the whole window, but a quick and dirty solution would be to wrap everything in a FocusPanel and add a handler via addMouseMoveHandler(MouseMoveHandler handler) (check the other interfaces that FocusPanel implements - there's quite a lot of them :)). AFAICT, this shouldn't conflict with anything else (drag&drop is not part of GWT, BTW ;)) - unless you start to mess around with the event itself (like stop propagating it) or something.
