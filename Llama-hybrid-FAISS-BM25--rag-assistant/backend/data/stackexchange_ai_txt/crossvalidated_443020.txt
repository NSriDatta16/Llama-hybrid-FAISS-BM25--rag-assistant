Clustering of respondents based on their rankings of some items - I like to do hierarchical cluster analysis (for example, average or complete linkage) based on Canberra distance or Clark distance. These measures weigh the difference 1-2 higher than 2-3, higher than 3-4, etc. in a exponentially fading manner. It is like podium positions in sports: the advantage of gold (1 place) over silver (2 place) is greater than of silver (2) over bronze (3); while advantage of some 10th place over 11th one is already negligible. To see the formulas of these two and of many other popular distance measures used for quantitative data - open Word doc. describing my macro !PROXQNT - find it in collection "Various proximities", on my web-page (the link to the page is on my profile page here).
