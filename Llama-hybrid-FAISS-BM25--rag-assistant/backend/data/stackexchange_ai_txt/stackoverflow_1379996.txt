Given a good hashing algorithm, one that returns a seemingly random output, I believe there should be on average one input that gives itself as the output. Let's say the hash can give N possible outputs. That means there are N possible inputs for which this is possible. For each of those, the odds of the output matching the input is 1/N, so there the expected number of fixed points is N*1/N, or 1.
