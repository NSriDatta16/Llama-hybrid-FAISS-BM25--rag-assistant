Flex is not something I've dealt with, but I did some research. It looks like the code to call a remote stylesheet is this: Flex Quick Start: Building a simple user interface: Styling your components says this: Note: You should try to limit the number of style sheets used in an application, and set the style sheet only at the top-level document in the application (the document that contains the tag). If you set a style sheet in a child document, unexpected results can occur. The implication of this seems to be that multiple stylesheets are not really possible. It sounds like what you want to do is organize your stylesheets, check out Organizing Your Stylesheets and Architecting CSS for some ideas for approaches. It looks like you have classes and basic tags, but the W3C stylesheet specifications are different from the Flex stylesheet specification. As a non-Flex developer, Namespaces looks interesting as a way to organize namespaces: How to use the new CSS syntax in Flex 4 .
