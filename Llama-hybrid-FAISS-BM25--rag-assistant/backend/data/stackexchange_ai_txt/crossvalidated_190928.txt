Probably look at $k$-means clustering with two features, and calculate the (a) silhouette index, (b) Dunn's index, (c) Davies-Bouldin index, or (d) Hubert's $\Gamma$ for each value of $k$, which is preset before the clustering run. The peak value of silhouette as a function of $k$ might be the optimal number of clusters. The notion of finding the optimal number of clusters is called "cluster validity," and e.g. the silhouette index is one of the most commonly used metrics.
