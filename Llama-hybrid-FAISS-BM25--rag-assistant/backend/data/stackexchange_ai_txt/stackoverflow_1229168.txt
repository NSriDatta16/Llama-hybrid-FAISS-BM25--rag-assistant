I would highly suggest that you upgrade the JRE, especially if your applications are making heavy use of cfc components. There is a bug in the older JRE version that makes object creation slow. Using the registry will not work on linux. You can only use database or cookies, but I don't know what ColdFusion will do if registry is selected on linux. I would suggest the database for client storage. Be aware that users can modify cookies on their system if you use cookies for client storage. Apache JMeter may be a tool worth looking at if you have further problems. Also, have a look here for more info on performance issues and client storage.
