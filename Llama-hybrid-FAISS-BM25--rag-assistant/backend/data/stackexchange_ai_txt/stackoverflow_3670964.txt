If the object derivation hierarchy didn't have a single unified head, then it would be impossible to test for equality between any two arbitrary...uh...things without resorting to dynamic typing. Other than that, I suspect the functionality of object could have been handled just about as well by separate interfaces (IEqualable and IConvertableToString). On the other hand, object's virtual methods are pretty handy sometimes, especially ToString, which can be used by an IDE or debugger when displaying program state. It's really a pragmatic design.
