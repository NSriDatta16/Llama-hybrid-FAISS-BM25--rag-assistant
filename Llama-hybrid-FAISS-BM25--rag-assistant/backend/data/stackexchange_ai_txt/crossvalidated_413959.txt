But isn't the Random Forest in this case a Decision Tree? All random forest models are ensembles of decision trees. Random forest constructs many decision trees using a randomization procedure. Why using Random Forest and not something else (e.g. Logistic regression)? Because the author of this code made a deliberate choice. You'll have to ask the author why they chose Random Forest instead of a different method. Generically, tree induction methods like random forest are very flexible, whereas logistic regression is merely a linear model.
