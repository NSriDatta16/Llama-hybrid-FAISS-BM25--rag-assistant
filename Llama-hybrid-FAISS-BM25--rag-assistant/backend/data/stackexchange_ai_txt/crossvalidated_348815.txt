In principle you can add day as a random effect, but I would suggest adding it as a fixed effect for several reasons: only 3 levels (i.e. only three separate days on which individuals are measured) might not be enough to reliably estimate an among-day variance; similarly, with only 3 levels you don't gain much in the parsimony of the model (intercept + variance = 2 parameters for the random model vs intercept + (day2-day1) + (day3-day1) = 3 parameters for the fixed model) the 3 days might not be exchangeable , e.g. there might be a trend over time with crossed random effects of Subject and day you'd probably have to switch from nlme::lme to lme4::lmer . (With crossed random effects there are multiple grouping variables, which makes it hard for lme .) So I'd suggest something like response~...+day, random = ~1|Subject ; if each individual is measured at most once per day, then it's not worth nesting day within Subject - that term will be confounded with the residual variance. I'm not quite sure I understand your last paragraph. Do you have separate observations for each Subject-day combination, or just the total for each individual and the days on which it was observed? In other words, do your data look like this: Subject day response a 1 17 b 1 19 b 2 10 c 2 12 c 3 11 or this? Subject days total a 1 17 b 1,2 29 c 2,3 23 ... or something else ?
