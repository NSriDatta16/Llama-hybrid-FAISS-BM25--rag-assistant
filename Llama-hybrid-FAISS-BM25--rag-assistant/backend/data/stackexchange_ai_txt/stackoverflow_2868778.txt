JSF 2.0: use Enum values for selectOneMenu

I'm using JSF 2.0 and want to fill a selectOneMenu with the values of my Enum. A simple example: // Sample Enum public enum Gender { MALE("Male"), FEMALE("Female"); private final String label; private Gender(String label) { this.label = label; } public String getLabel() { return this.label; } } Unfortunately, i can't use Seam for my current project, which had a nice Tag that did most of the work. In Seam, to use the values of the Enum, i had to write the following markup (and create a factory that provides the #{genderValues} : The result is that i don't have to declare the Enum values explicitely anymore inside the markup. I know that this is not very easy in JSF Or can i even integrate the Seam JSF tag and the corresponding classes of Seam to get the same feature in a JavaEE6-App (without the Seam container)?
