UDDI is indeed dead. Three things killed it: Overambitious complexity Ignoring security The difficulty, still with us, of managing and collecting micropayments If a UDDI broker dynamically chooses a service provider for me, I have no opportunity to do any due diligence on the security of the service. And how much trouble would the broker take to ensure security for me? Not a lot, I would suggest. Web services are commonly used behind the firewall for SOA purposes, to integrate applications with business partners, and to call well-known APIs. UDDI is total overkill for these purposes. A large organisation should have a catalogue of its web services, but that could be as simple as a wiki page. A developer looking for a potentially useful web service needs a one paragraph description of what it does, a contact person, and some WSDL and technical documentation. UDDI is not necessary for any of that.
