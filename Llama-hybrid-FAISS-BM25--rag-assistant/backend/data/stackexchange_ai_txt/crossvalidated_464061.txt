You could solve the problem of the missing value in different way. Below I'm going to illustrate them. You should use the mean of the variable that includes NA values or impute the missing values with a linear regression. You should use missMDA and then FactoMineR or the pcaMethods . Below an example. library(missMDA) nPCs $ncp, scale = TRUE) PCA(completed_sleep$ completeObs) The other example is: library(pcaMethods) sleep_pca_methods If you'd like to deep the PCA or the factoMiner package you should visit its website http://factominer.free.fr/
