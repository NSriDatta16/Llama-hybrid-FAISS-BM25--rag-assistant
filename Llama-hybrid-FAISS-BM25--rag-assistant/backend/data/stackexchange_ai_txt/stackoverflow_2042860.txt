Help getting started with XML -> HTML via XSLT

can anyone start me off with regard to converting some XML to HTML. I've worked on XSLT conversions before, but never from scratch, and I seem to be missing something. Starting with XML that's something like this: ...and an XSLT file that looks like this: Name is ' ' and value is When I do the conversion using an XslCompiledTransform object from C#, I get the basic html but no content for the the lines. The code I used to the the transform isas follows: private static String GetHtml(String xml) { String result; var doc = new XmlDocument(); doc.LoadXml(xml); var transformer = new XslCompiledTransform(true); transformer.Load("foobar.xslt"); using (var writer = new StringWriter()) { transformer.Transform(doc, null, writer); result = writer.ToString(); } return result; } Any help greatly appreciated. Ross (as an aside, what's the point of the xsl:decimal-format element if, in using the format-number function, I have to provide the format string ?)
