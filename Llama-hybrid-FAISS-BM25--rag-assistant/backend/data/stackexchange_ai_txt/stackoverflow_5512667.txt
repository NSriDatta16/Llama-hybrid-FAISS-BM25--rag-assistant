Well, Scatter tries to send the data it has to send in equal proportions. Unfortunately the data in C gets stored rowwise, not columnwise. Therefore your call would cause Scatter to take the n elements, and then send each process m = n/(number of processes) floats. A common approach for this problem to create a new MPI-vector datatype (see the function MPI_Type_vector), in which you would be able to overcome the problem of the rowwise data storage of C arrays (because you can define the stride between to elements in the vector, which would exactly be the lenght of one line). I haven't used scatter with a vector this way, so I am not sure whether this will help for the call of Scatter, but at least you are able to access the data columnwise easily. Then it would be an easy way to communicate this data to the corresponing processes by making use of a loop
