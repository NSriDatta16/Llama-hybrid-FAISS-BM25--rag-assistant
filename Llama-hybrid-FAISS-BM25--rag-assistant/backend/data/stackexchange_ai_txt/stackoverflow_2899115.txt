Why does GANTracker outputs an error "GANTracker.m" not found?

I have used the Google Analytics Tracker in a previous iPhone OS project. Everything was working fine and I copy & pasted the GANTracker Library and the Tracker initialization. When starting my new project it tells me: Xcode could not locate source file: GANTracker.m (line: 177) To tell the truth, I don't know where to start to debug this one. I have included the library using #import "GANTracker.h" . The error message occurs right within the application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and does not seem to have any connection to what is really going on. If I set the breakpoint to [window makeKeyAndVisible]; for example and wait a second, it occurs right after that. That makes it look like there is something in the background going on with the GANTracker. The Tracker itself is created a little later by: [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"xx" dispatchPeriod:10 delegate:nil]; [[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackPageview:@"pageview" withError:nil]; Thank you all in advance for your help!
