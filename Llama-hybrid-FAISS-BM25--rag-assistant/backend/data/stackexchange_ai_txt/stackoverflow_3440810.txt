Grouping table data into columns rather then rows

Most of the time it makes sense to organize table data in rows. However right now I'm dealing with a table that compares data across several columns. Each column is a product, so I'd like to keep all product data grouped together. Name Price Weight Height Compatibility Designer Manufacturer Age Requirement Using the TR tag that row will run horizontally, is there a way to make it run vertically? Update: I would like the table to display like regular html in this example: Name Name2 Price Price2 Weight Weight2 Height Height2 However I would like to be able to code it by related content: Name Price Weight Height Name Price Weight Height In other words, I want the table row tag (tr) to act like a column.
