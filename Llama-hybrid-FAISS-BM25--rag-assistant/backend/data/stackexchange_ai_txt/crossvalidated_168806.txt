Comparing regression coefficients using F-test to assess for batch effects

Here's what I have: two datasets with ~27,000 variables (same variables for each dataset). I'm trying to test whether or not dataset1 and dataset2 display batch effects. Namely, I want to do PCA and do regression on the principal components, and then I want to compare the regression coefficients between datasets to see if there is significant difference between each dataset's "directionality". The worry I have is: datasets are measuring the SAME measures (27k methylation probes) from people with different diseases. Can you find batch effects if the prediction variable (y) is not the same between the datasets being compared? Secondly, I have read that an F-test can compare regression coefficients, but I'm not sure I understand how it works. If I do multiple comparisons where I ask: Model 1: disease1 = B0 + B1*x_1 + B2*x_2 + ... + BN*x_n + error Model 2: disease2 = b0 + b1*x_1 + b2*x_2 + ... + bn*x_n + error H0_1: B0=b0 H0_2: B1=b1 .... H0_N: BN=bn Isn't that just like doing N t-tests and then combining the p-values using a Fisher's combined p-value? How does the F-test handle the comparison of regression coefficients and how do you "verbalize" the null hypothesis of my situation described above? I'm self taught in statistics, and trying to learn, so any help would be appreciated!
