what R function fits a smoothing spline regression model with correlated errors?

I want to fit a smoothing spline regression model with correlated errors (it's a time series) using R. All I could find is function ssr , from library assist , which is not on CRAN anymore -- I am pretty lukewarm about installing a package from source when it does not appear it's maintained. So I am looking for an alternative, and I would be obliged for any suggestion. BTW, my model is meant to look like something like raw_measurement = parameter_estimate + {time of day spilne} + {other splines} + {AR(1) distributed error}
