How to analyze memory fragmentation in java?

We experience several minutes lags in our server. Probably they are triggered by "stop the world" garbage collections. But we use concurrent mark and sweep GC (-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepG) so, I think, these pauses are triggered by memory fragmentation of old generation. How can memory fragmentation of old generation be analyzed? Are there any tools for it? Lags happen every hour. Most time they are about 20 sec, but sometimes - several minutes.
