How to calculate lsmeans from a glm model with family=binomial?

I would like to calculate adjusted means from a glm model with family = binomial. This is my script: data $Phenotype Phenotype) data $Batch Batch) data $Tray Tray) data $Genotype Genotype) model = glm((Phenotype)~ Batch + Tray + Genotype, data=data, family = binomial()) leastsquare = lsmeans(model,"Genotype", rg.limit = 200000) leastsquare = lsmeans(model,~Genotype, rg.limit = 200000) leastsquare = emmeans(model,"Genotype", rg.limit = 200000) leastsquare = emmeans(model,~Genotype, rg.limit = 200000) leastsquare No matter what line, it doesn't calculate the lsmeans... I obtain this: Genotype lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL LM1_1_1 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_1_2 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_1_3 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_2_1 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_2_2 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_2_3 nonEst NA NA NA NA LM1_2_4 nonEst NA NA NA NA Results are averaged over the levels of: Tray, Batch Results are given on the logit (not the response) scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 Could you help me? Does anyone know how to calculate lsmeans from glm model? I expect to obtain adjusted means of my phenotype, corrected for localisation effects, thanks to a glm model with binomial distribution. Thanks, LM
