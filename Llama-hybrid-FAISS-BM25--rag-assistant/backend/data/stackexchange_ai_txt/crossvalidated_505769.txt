What method should I be using to find the lag with the best correlation? That can be seen in the autocorrelation curve. Or, in a broader sense, one other good heuristic would be using Persistence models , and see if which lag (or which weighted average of the last $n$ lags of the same multiple) best predicts the current day, according to your choice of error metric.
