To add to the good answer by @Alejandro: In the name of completeness, in XSLT one could define a key : And then reference this key like this : . . . . . . . In theory, the use of such key might be faster than other methods, if the test for any specific node is performed (in average) more than once. However, you may need a lot of memory for the indices.
