This is one of the use cases for ASIWebPageRequest . If you want something lower level, you'll have to create an NSURLCredential instance and an NSURLProtectionSpace and save them to the credential store . At this point, the UIWebView should use the credential for all requests that match the protection space (which basically represents your site). Here's some sample code, taken from here , which is not really where I'd expect to find it. NSURLCredential *credential = [[NSURLCredential alloc] initWithUser: @"userName" password: @"password" persistence: NSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession]; NSURLProtectionSpace *protectionSpace = [[NSURLProtectionSpace alloc] initWithHost: @"www.mydomain.com" port: 80 protocol: @"http" realm: @"mydomain.com" authenticationMethod: NSURLAuthenticationMethodDefault]; [[NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage] setDefaultCredential: credential forProtectionSpace: protectionSpace]; [credential release]; [protectionSpace release];
