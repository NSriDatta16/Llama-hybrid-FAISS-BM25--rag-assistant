Logistic regression: Why we don't plot the residuals against the fitted values?

I'm hoping someone can explain this bit of R code for me related to glm() . I don't understand the diagnostic plot that has been suggested. It seems a more informative plot would be to plot against the fitted values, but maybe I don't understand something. Here's the code: result Data to reproduce the above example: > dput(donner) structure(list(age = c(23L, 40L, 40L, 30L, 28L, 40L, 45L, 62L, 65L, 45L, 25L, 28L, 28L, 23L, 22L, 23L, 28L, 15L, 47L, 57L, 20L, 18L, 25L, 60L, 25L, 20L, 32L, 32L, 24L, 30L, 15L, 50L, 21L, 25L, 46L, 32L, 30L, 25L, 25L, 25L, 30L, 35L, 23L, 24L, 25L), sex = c(1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L), survive = c(0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L)), .Names = c("age", "sex", "survive"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -45L ))
