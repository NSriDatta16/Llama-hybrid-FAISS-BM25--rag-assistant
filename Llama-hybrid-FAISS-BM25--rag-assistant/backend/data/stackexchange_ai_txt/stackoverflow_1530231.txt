If you're just doing tints of colours then a straight multiplication will be fine - this ensures that the inks will all be in the same ratios. You can see this by bringing up the Colors panel in InDesign, and holding down shift and dragging one of the colour sliders. The other sliders will move proportionally. Adding two colours has the same effect as overprinting (where one colour is printed directly over another colour). So if 100% magenta and 100% cyan were printed, and then 100% black were printed on top, the result would be exactly the same as 100% magenta, 100% cyan and 100% black.
