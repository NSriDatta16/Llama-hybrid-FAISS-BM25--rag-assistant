The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is to some extent obsolete because it requires arbitrary binning of predicted probabilities and does not possess excellent power to detect lack of calibration. It also does not fully penalize for extreme overfitting of the model. Better methods are available such as Hosmer, D. W.; Hosmer, T.; le Cessie, S. & Lemeshow, S. A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model. Statistics in Medicine , 1997, 16 , 965-980. Their new measure is implemented in the R rms package. More importantly, this kind of assessment just addresses overall model calibration (agreement between predicted and observed) and does not address lack of fit such as improperly transforming a predictor. For that matter, neither does AIC unless you use AIC to compare two models where one is more flexible than the other being tested. I think you are interested in predictive discrimination, for which a generalized $R^2$ measure, supplemented by $c$-index (ROC area) may be more appropriate.
