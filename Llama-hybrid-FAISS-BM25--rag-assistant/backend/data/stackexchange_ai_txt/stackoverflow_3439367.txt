Redirect using SAML is not landing in my configured page

I am facing an issue while using SAML to implement SSO on my web application. After successful login I want to redirect to my application’s dashboard / main menu. But, it gets redirected to http://:/IDBUS/first-idau/IDP-1/SAML2/SSO/POST. The flow is, I request my application’s context url in browser. In josso I have configured it to be redirected to atricore. Then there is a change in request headers and the request comes back to same application url I requested. Now I use a filter and redirect it to JOSSO login page. So this single request lands in JOSSO login page. When I give credentials and login, then JOSSO authenticates and sets the user principal and sends the request to my url. Here I have a filter to forward to my dashboard. In this step after I give authentication information in JOSSO login page, instead of getting my dashboard, it gets redirected to some JOSS page (http://:/IDBUS/first-idau/IDP-1/SAML2/SSO/POST) this is in OSGi bundle in Atricore. When I debug, I see a HTTP header as “referer”. It pointing to the above URL. I think it should point to my application’s dashboard url which I have configured in josso-agent-config.xml I did one analysis and found something interesting. In step 1, I have used a filter in my application to redirect to JOSSO login page. Instead of doing that, I allowed to complete the request. Then it gets landed in a page in my application. Now in the same session (in browser), I manually made request to JOSSO login page. Then I got the JOSSO login page (this is step 2). Then I gave credentials and requested to login. Now it gets successfully forwarded to the intended my application’s dashboard page. So my guess is that, there should be something wrong with my filter where I redirect to JOSSO login page. I am using Atricore Identity Bus 1.0.0-m1+JOSSO 1.8.2+Spring 2.5.6.SEC01. Please help me on this.
