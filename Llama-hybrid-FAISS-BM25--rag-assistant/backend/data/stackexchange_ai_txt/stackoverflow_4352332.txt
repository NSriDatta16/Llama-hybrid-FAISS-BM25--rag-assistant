OK .hold on ... I am trying to get what u said above ... I initially thought I would answer it well ... because I have done something like that before ..but then I read ur whole question and answer by Jaime and it confused me a lot .. but anyways from what I interpret .. I can give u an answer So for the part of erasing .. I was drawing with the help of my array of points that u stored in touches began and moved ... I think u r drawing like that only .. so for erasing .. i momentarily emptied my array of points and then call "setNeedsDisplay".. which will find no points in array and hence will clear all... If u r not drawing with array in case of rough drawing , then I would recommend doing that . I would also recommend one more thing .. that determining that user wants rough or smooth curves should be done in the beginning and not on "touchesEnded".. and then draw accordingly with array ... I hope u know how to draw rough curves and for smooth curves I will give u a link to my answer CGContext Draw Line slowly responding to fast finger movement
