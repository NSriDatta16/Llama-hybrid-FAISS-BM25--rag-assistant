Hmm. I don't really like the idea of cron running something every second. That seems like way too often. If your application really needs to be that responsive, then I think you should keep it synchronous. That is, keep the processing in your web application and look for other ways to keep the server strain level down. If you can wait longer between checking, then it would be better to have your cron job check the queue for 1 item at a time. If there is one, process it, and then check again for the next one without exiting. If there isn't one, exit and don't try again for five minutes or so. However, all that being said, any decent Mail Transfer Agent (sendmail, postfix, Exchange) will have queuing built-in. It will probably do a better job than you could of making sure delivery occurs when the unexpected happens. There's a lot to think about in processing queued e-mail. I generally prefer to hand-off outbound e-mail to an MTA as early in the process as I can. -- bmb
