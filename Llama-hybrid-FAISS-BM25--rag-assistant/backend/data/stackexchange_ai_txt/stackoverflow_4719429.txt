Where are you keeping your configuration? public void changeTrue() { // load configuration from some file, database, other storage // update configuration // persist the new configuration } If this configuration is kept in memory, then you can make it a singleton or a static object so that there's only one instance. Then you just get the single instance and modify it. By the way, while(1==1) doesn't look right.
