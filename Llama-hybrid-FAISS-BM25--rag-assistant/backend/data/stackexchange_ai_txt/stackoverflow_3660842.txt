Add a date picker to system.xml on custom module

As stated in the subject, I am trying to add a date field with its date picker in the System > Configuration area for a custom module (thus using etc/system.xml). I tried to get inspiration from the thread below : Magento - Add a button to system.xml with method attached to it but no success. I'm sure this is a question of creating the right block or method to create a custom html field but I cannot read thru the Magento Matrix :) I am stuck at the step where I need to code the class (Datefield.php): Am I wrong in calling ..._Abstract? Should I call Varien_Data_Form_Element_Date? I've tried but no success either... $this->setElement($element); $html = // ------------------> what to put here? Call a block or some other method? ->setFormat('d-m-Y') ->setLabel($this->__('Choose date')) ->toHtml(); return $html; } } ?> Do you have a trick on how to do that ? Thanks a lot. Herv√©
