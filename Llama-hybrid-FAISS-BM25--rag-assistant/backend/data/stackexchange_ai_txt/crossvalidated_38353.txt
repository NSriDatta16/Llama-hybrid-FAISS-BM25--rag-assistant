Organizing cluster analysis results in a database

I'm a newbie in cluster analysis so please excuse me if my question seems to be very basic. I'm using SPSS and Matlab for performing cluster analysis in a variety of datasets. Dendograms are great for visualising the results. However, they are not helpful for comparing the results produced by different clustering methods or algorithms. Is there a standard way to do this? Does anybody had use a Database for this purpose? I'm kind of proficient in Access-VBA, but I'm lost in what data I should store (resemblance matrix, cophenetic matrix, etc) and how to transform them in a comprehensive database matrix.
