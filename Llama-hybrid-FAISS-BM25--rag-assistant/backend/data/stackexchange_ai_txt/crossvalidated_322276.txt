Is MASE specified only to time series data

Will it be correct to use Mean absolute scaled error in non time series data? I've got a set which contains a lot of zeros, so errors like MAPE can not be used here. MASE based on difference between yt and yt-1 ( formula like here ), but I don't have time series, just observations of some activity of 200 people (independent), so maybe I can just use difference based on second and first person and so on? If not, do you know any percentage measures that I can use in that kind of set?
