Constraints on low dimensional representations of data

Is there literature discussing introduction of constraints to loss functions in order to specify certain structures on low dimensional representations? If so, how do they compare the efficacy of the constrained representation? Specifically, suppose I have a data set for which I have found a low dimensional representation (via tSNE or UMap), which has been clustered via K-means. I want to determine whether this is a reasonable representation for another data set that I have. My current idea is to create an autoencoder, that maps the data to the same dimension, then attempts to reconstruct the original data. By including a term in the loss function that penalizes points in the low dimensional representation, for being far away from the nearest centroid in the K-means cluster, I can emphasize the desired structure in the low dimension, and study the reconstruction error in order to judge the efficacy of the representation. However, this is computationally intensive, and seems like too much of a brute force method. Are there any papers, or simple ideas that would help with this?
