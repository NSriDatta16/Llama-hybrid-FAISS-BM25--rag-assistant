The absolute value of importance is not very helpful, than how to calculate the relative importance of variables in a random forests Regression

I have used a random forest model for regression analysis. Now, I am having difficulty in working out what can be used in measuring variable importance. The importance function provides the mean decrease in accuracy and the mean decrease in MSE. the question is: why the absolute value of importance is not very helpful and how to build relative importance values.
