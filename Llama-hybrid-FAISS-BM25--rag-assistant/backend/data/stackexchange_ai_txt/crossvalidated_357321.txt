I would argue that MCMC methods aren't necessarily inappropriate , even when closed-form solutions exist. Obviously, it's nice when an analytical solution exists: they are usually fast, you avoid concerns about convergence (etc). On the other hand, consistency is also important. Switching from technique to technique complicates your presentation: at best, it's extraneous detail that may confuse or distract the audience away from your substantive result, and at worst it could look like an attempt at biasing the outcomes. If I had several models, only a few of which admit closed-form solutions, I would strongly consider running them all through the same MCMC pipeline even if it weren't strictly necessary. I suspect this, plus inertia ("we have this script that works") accounts for most of what you're seeing.
