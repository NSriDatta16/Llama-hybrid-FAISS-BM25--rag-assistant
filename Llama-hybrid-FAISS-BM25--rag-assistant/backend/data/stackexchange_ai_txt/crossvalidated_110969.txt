Using the caret package is it possible to obtain confusion matrices for specific threshold values?

I've obtained a logistic regression model (via train ) for a binary response, and I've obtained the logistic confusion matrix via confusionMatrix in caret . It gives me the logistic model confusion matrix, though I'm not sure what threshold is being used to obtain it. How do I obtain the confusion matrix for specific threshold values using confusionMatrix in caret ?
