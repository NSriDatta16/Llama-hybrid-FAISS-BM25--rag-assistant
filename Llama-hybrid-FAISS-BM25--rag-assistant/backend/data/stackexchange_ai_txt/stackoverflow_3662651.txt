Grails can't resolve plugin

When I try to run a grails app, I'm told that grails can't resolve the following dependencies: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES :: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: org.grails.plugins#code-coverage;1.1.8: not found :: org.grails.plugins#testing;0.5: not found :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Failed to resolve plugins. So I tried grails install-plugin code-coverage and grails install-plugin testing , and received: Plugin not found for name [code-coverage] and version [not specified] (Specifying the version shouldn't be necessary and didn't help.) What's happening here?
