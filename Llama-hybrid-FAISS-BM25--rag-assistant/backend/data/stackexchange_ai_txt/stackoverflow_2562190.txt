It is a shell dialog, you'll get the shell extensions injected into your process. You probably got a lousy one that is causing the crash. You can see them getting loaded with Project + Properties, Debug tab, tick Enabled unmanaged code debugging.

Short from uninstalling the trouble-maker, SysInterals' AutoRuns utility is a good way to disable shell extensions.
