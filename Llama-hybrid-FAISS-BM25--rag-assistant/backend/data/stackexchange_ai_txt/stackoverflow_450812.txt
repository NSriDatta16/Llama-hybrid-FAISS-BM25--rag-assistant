I think what Burns might be getting at their is exposure to other design paradigms . If you are programming in Windows and you get the latest and greatest WinMo phone, you're exposed to a different platform but really it's just a baby Windows. Contrast that with being a Windows programmer and getting an iPhone or a G1. You're being shown a very different way to get things done and you'll be able to pick up the parts you like out of someone else's vision. There's a competitive aspect to many fields that software is often lacking. Competition helps you by showing you how other people solved the problem that you're looking at. If they are selling like gangbusters and you aren't, well, something's up there huh?
