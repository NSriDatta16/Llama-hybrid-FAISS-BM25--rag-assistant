Gan in Keras - You must feed a value for placeholder tensor

i have a problem with the training of my GAN. I get the following error message: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/user/PycharmProjects/pythonTest/main.py", line 172, in train(1) File "/home/user/PycharmProjects/pythonTest/main.py", line 145, in train g_loss = gan.train_on_batch([[noise], word_as_sequence, [len(word)]], [valid_label]) File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site- packages/keras/engine/training.py", line 1217, in train_on_batch outputs = self.train_function(ins) File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site- packages/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py", line 2715, in __call__ return self._call(inputs) File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site- packages/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py", line 2675, in _call fetched = self._callable_fn(*array_vals) File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.6/site- packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 1458, in __call__ run_metadata_ptr) tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'ocr_input_img' with dtype float and shape [?,128,512,1] [[{{node ocr_input_img}}]] my Code looks like the following: ... img = self.generator([noise, word_embedded]) self.discriminator.trainable = False self.text_recognition.trainable = False valid = self.discriminator(img) ctc = self.text_recognition([img, labels, label_length]) combined = Model([noise, word_sequence, labels, label_length], [ctc]) I cant understand what the problem with the text recognition is. The Discriminator have the same input shape for the image as the text recognition. When i try to run it without the text_recognition and only with the Discriminator it works. The Part to start Gan training: g_loss = gan.train_on_batch([[noise], word_as_sequence, [len(word)]], [valid_label]) The Output of the Generator has the shape=(?, 128, 512, 1) dtype=float32
