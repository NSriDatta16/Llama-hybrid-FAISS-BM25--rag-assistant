What's the deficiency with SQL Server Database Diagrams? In any case, my surprising recommendation would be to try Sparx Enterprise Architect . While not primarily a database tool, it can reverse-engineer a database into an ER model, then you can create one or more diagrams from that model. It has a nice "Add Related Elements" command that allows you to create a new diagram to focus on one entity; drag the one entity onto the diagram; then add just those other entities related to the first. You can also customize the level of detail displayed on the diagrams, and print the diagrams as one or multiple pages. Oh, and it does UML as well.
