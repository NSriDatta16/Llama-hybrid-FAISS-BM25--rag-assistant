Make an image dynamically appear in FLASH

I'm new to flash, but I have drag and drop code for my movieclips and so can manipulate them in this way. But I would like to be able to display an image depending on where the user clicks on the movie scene. What would the code be that loads an image, onClick, at the mouse X and Y? Thanks
