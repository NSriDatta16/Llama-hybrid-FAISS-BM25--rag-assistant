I would suggest you try CNNs as they can save you a lot of preprocessing steps. In case you are going the classical ML way, it is hard to comment on the preprocessing of images without looking at them. If you are looking to reduce noise, you would probably want to apply smoothing and blurring. There are many blurring and morphological functions available in opencv library. You should try them out.
