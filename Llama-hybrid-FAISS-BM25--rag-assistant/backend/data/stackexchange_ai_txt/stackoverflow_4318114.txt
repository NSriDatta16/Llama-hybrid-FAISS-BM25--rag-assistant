Circumvent the sed backreference limit \1 through \9

The sed manual clearly states that the available backreferences available for the replacement string in a substitute are numbered \1 through \9. I'm trying to parse a log file that has 10 fields. I have the regex formed for it but the tenth match (and anything after) isn't accessible. Does anyone have an elegant way to circumvent this limitation in KSH (or any language that perhaps I can port to shell scripting)?
