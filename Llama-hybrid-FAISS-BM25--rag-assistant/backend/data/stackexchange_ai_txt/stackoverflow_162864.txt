I'd go with the XML text file option. You can use the XSD tool built into Visual Studio to create a DataTable out of the XML data, and it easily serializes back into the file when needed. The other caveat is that I'm sure you're going to want the end user to be able to categorize their RSS feeds and be able to potentially search/sort them, and having that kind of datatable style will help with this. You'll get easy file storage and access, the benefit of a "database" structure, but not quite the overhead of SQLite.
