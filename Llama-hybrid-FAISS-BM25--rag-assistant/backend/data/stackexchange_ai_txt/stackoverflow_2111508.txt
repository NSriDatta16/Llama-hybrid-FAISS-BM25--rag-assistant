Use HTTP "HEAD" request to get file size w/o downloading it. response field "Content-Length". Checking it in php or in js(ajax)... I would prefer js, cause it remove load from server to clients. Also, according to HTTP 1.1 no more connection should be used from one user-agent. And many users of your server could result in many simultaneous connections from your server to image hosting server.
