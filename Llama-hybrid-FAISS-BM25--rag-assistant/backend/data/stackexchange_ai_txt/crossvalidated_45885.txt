Goodness-of-fit of model derived from multivariate logistic regression

I have a question regarding the relationship between the value of Chi square and df in determining the goodness-of-fit in a model derived from multivariate logistic regression. If the N= 290, Chi square =26.57, p=0.003 in a model with 16 variables (df is not reported), can one tell if this is legit or would this model represent overfitting or multicollinearity? Hope that makes sense. I really appreciate any help in making sense of these results.
