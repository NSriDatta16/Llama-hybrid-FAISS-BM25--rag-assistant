Print empty XML element as opening tag, closing tag

Is there any way to print empty elements like rather than using org.w3c.dom? I'm modifying XML files that need to be diff'ed against old versions of themselves for review. If it helps, the code that writes the XML to the file: TransformerFactory t = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = t.newTransformer(); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc); StringWriter xml = new StringWriter(); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(xml); transformer.transform(source, result); File f = new File("output.xml"); FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(f); BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(writer); out.write(xml.toString()); out.close(); Thanks.
