Tools to manage manual testing results - possibly integrated with trac?

At work we currently use Trac to manage our test cases. However, we have quite a few TCs that are listed on test plan wiki pages instead of tickets. My manager has recently become interested in better documenting the results of manual testing. While this is a noble goal, and several of the people on the QA team are quite gung-ho about the idea, I actually feel that the overhead for such a system may be disastrous if not executed correctly. In fact, the only sane non-Trac integrated solution I can think of is just a simple task manager, where we can store and manage more casual results like, "X ran through Component Y on Env blah at this date and there were these problems". I think that porting over several TC numbers and stuff from the wiki would take ages and some kind of system like "X verified TC 23423432 at time Y and it's passing" is only suitable for automated tests when there's that many test cases (and a small team). I have seen a few plugins for Trac that allow you to create test plans and the like and report results - but nothing that exciting. Has anyone had experience with these tools? Integration with trac would greatly reduce the overhead, but we still have the issue of not every TC being filed as a ticket, which we'd have to address. What would you suggest for such a project? Have you been in a similar situation? Your input would be greatly appreciated, as I don't want to be the only nay-sayer on the team and look lazy because of my opinion that over-organizing manual testing with such a small team would be detrimental.
