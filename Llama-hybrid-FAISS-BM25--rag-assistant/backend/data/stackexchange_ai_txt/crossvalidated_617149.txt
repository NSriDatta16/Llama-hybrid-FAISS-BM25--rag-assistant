If you manage to use a Kalman filter, you can marginalize or optimize out the state at each time analytically. Thus the remaining likelihood is much simpler, having only the ARMA process variables, i.e., tens of parameters. If you use the direct variables, you have one (or more) parameters per state, so if your time series has 1000 entries, you have a 1000-dimensional likelihood. High-dimensional spaces are hard to explore.
