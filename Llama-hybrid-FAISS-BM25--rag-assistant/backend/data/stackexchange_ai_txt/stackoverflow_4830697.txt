I think GPU is the way to go. It's probably the most natural task for this type of hardware. I would start by looking into CUDA or OpenCL . Older techniques like simple DirectX/OpenGL pixel/fragment shaders should work just fine as well. Some links I found, maybe they could help you: Efficient GPU-Based Texture Interpolation using Uniform B-Splines CUDA Cubic B-Spline Interpolation (CI) Fast Third-Order Texture Filtering
