Webforms isn't as "drag and drop" as you make it out to be: you still have to set properties on the controls, and there's still a lot of complexity involved in hooking them all together. This is especially true as you start building your own controls. If you're not messing around in the markup for web forms, you probably haven't worked on a project of any real complexity. MVC has html helpers that do almost as much of the work for you, and do it in a way that more naturally matches the target html. There are also some big "gotchas" in web forms that just don't exist for MVC: ViewState, dynamic controls, the one big form limitation, broken back buttons... I could go on and on.
