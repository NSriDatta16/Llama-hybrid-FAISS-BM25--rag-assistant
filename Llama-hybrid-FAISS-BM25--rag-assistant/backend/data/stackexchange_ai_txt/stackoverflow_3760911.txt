You are serializing to a string rather than a byte array so, at this point, any encoding hasn't happened yet. What does the start of "messageToLog" look like? Is the XML specifying an encoding (e.g. utf-8) which subsequently turns out to be wrong? Edit Based on your further info it sounds like the string is automatically converted to utf-8 when it is passed to the database, but the database chokes because the XML declaration says it is utf-16. In which case, you don't need to serialize to utf-8. You need to serialize with the "encoding=" omitted from the XML. The XmlFragmentWriter (not a standard part of .Net, Google it) lets you do this.
