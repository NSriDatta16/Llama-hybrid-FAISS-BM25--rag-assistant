I ran this on anxiety data frame from the irr package on RStudio, which has 3 raters and 20 ratings. When running ICC function (psych package), this is the output: Call: ICC(x = anxiety, missing = FALSE, alpha = 0.05, lmer = TRUE, check.keys = FALSE) Intraclass correlation coefficients type ICC F df1 df2 p lower bound upper bound Single_raters_absolute ICC1 0.18 1.6 19 40 0.094 -0.077 0.48 Single_random_raters ICC2 0.20 1.8 19 38 0.056 -0.039 0.49 Single_fixed_raters ICC3 0.22 1.8 19 38 0.056 -0.046 0.52 Average_raters_absolute ICC1k 0.39 1.6 19 40 0.094 -0.275 0.74 Average_random_raters ICC2k 0.43 1.8 19 38 0.056 -0.127 0.75 Average_fixed_raters ICC3k 0.45 1.8 19 38 0.056 -0.153 0.77 Number of subjects = 20 Number of Judges = 3 So, here ICC interprets my dataset as having 3 raters and 20 ratings, which is correct. Now, using cronbach.alpha (ltm package) on exactly the same dataset, I get: > cronbach.alpha(anxiety) Cronbach's alpha for the 'anxiety' data-set Items: 3 Sample units: 20 alpha: 0.453 Thus, alpha is equal to ICC(3,k), but the function interprets columns and rows differently, that is it should be Items: 20 and Sample units: 3. Now, if I transpose the dataset and run cronbach.alpha on the transposed dataset, I get: > cronbach.alpha(anxietyt) Cronbach's alpha for the 'anxietyt' data-set Items: 20 Sample units: 3 alpha: 0.699 Now, the interpretation of rows and columns is correct: I actually have 20 items and 3 sample units, but the alpha value is higher than ICC 3,k. Now, as ICC 3,k and alpha are supposed to be equivalent, what is going wrong here?
