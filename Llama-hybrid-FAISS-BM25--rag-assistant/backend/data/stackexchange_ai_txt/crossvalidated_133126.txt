You are right that inferring a parabola from five points is too little data. But you have more than five points, namely all your measurements! Don't do any averaging (though this would already help), just fit the parabola to all your data. Model fitting doesn't mind multiple x values. Let's do this in R. Some dummy data over five different x values: set.seed(1) xx Now we can fit the model. Note the I() to protect your square term, and note that this really presupposes homoskedastic errors: model Now we have a quadratic relationship. Some elementary calculus gives us the (estimated) x coordinate of maximum of the fitted parabola: xx.max It's always a good idea to get an idea about the variability of our results. It may be possibly to derive a confidence interval for xx.max analytically, but the bootstrap is always easier, and given enough data (50 points should be enough), it should be valid: require(boot) foo Note that I am doing a stratified bootstrap , i.e., I am sampling with replacement within each x value , which makes sense here, since the data really are stratified. So we can plot our points, the fitted parabola and the x coordinate of the estimated maximum together with the bootstrapped confidence interval: plot(xx,yy,pch=19) rect(quantile(foo$t,0.025),-2,quantile(foo$t,0.975),6,border=NA,col="lightgrey") points(xx,yy,pch=19) xx.plot
