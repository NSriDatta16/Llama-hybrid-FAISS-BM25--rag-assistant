WPF - Elegant way of disabling and enabling different controls based on different states of the Model using MVVM

I am looking for an elegant solution for the following problem. Let's assume we have a (View)Model with the following boolean properties: Alpha Beta Gamma Delta Next I have 5 controls on the surface that shall only be visible when a condition based on those properties are met. Of course, as soon as one of those properties is updated the change should be propagated immediatelly: ControlA -> Alpha && ( Beta || Gamma ) ControlB -> Delta ControlC -> Delta || Beta ControlD -> Gamma && Alpha && Delta ControlE -> Alpha || Gamma The only solution I came up with so far is using MultiValueConverters. Example for ControlA: This ControlAVisibilityConverter checks for condition "Alpha && ( Beta || Gamma )" and returns the appropriate value. It does work.. well.. but maybe you can come up with a more elegant solution? Thank you, TwinHabit
