Tuff one. There's a snippet about it in the documentation for the ILockBytes interface. It says that the default implementations of IStorage and IStream implement IMarshal. Which would make them thread-safe, provided you follow COM threading rules. That's easy to forget when the interface pointers are in-proc. You'd have to use something like CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream() or IGlobalInterfaceTable. You'll get away with not marshaling by locking yourself.
