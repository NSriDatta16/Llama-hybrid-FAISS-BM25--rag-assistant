Forecasting ticket sales and city

I am learning data science. I have the following dataset for train tickets: 1. order_date_meduim order,date,medium 95062,2017-09-11,35 171081,2017-07-05,39 122867,2017-08-18,39 107186,2017-11-23, 171085,2017-09-02, 2. order_ordercityA_ordercityB [some order has only 1 ordercity, I think ordercity means here which city is something like source and destination] order,ordercityA,ordercityB 81773,4,11 105838,4, 76153,24,18 93058,12, 11623,24,3 3070,24,3 3. order_ticketcount,ticketclass order,ticketcount,ticketclass 246783,1,pax 1693998,2,pax 1958576,1,other 673681,1,pax 1593899,1,pax 194035,1,pax I need to forecast the ticket sales for a week and also the ordercity with medium of booking. As I am new, could someone give a possible answer about how to create a prediction model that could predict the sales for 1 week? Also, I doubt the data is time-series data. I code in Python.
