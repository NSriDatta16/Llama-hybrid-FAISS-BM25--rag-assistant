The Silverlight components for Telerik are far faster than the ASP.NET versions. You are correct there - the ASP.NET versions are bloated "one-size-fits-all" controls that can really slow an application when implemented quickly. The SL components do not suffer the same performance problems due to the underlying programming model (particularly no javaScript!!) I would recommend Telerik - with one caveat - fork out a few extra dollars for the support contract. Their control documentation has historically been really poor, but the customer support is EXCELLENT. Open a support ticker with a repro of an issue and they'll usually send you back a fixed version (or work-around) within a day or so. I've also looked at ComponentOne, Infragistics and ComponentArt suites. They all seem to have the same "usual suspects" as conrtrols, so there has never been any realy reason to switch over to them. NOTE: Try also the Telerik ASP.NET MVC Demo - those controls really fly!!)
