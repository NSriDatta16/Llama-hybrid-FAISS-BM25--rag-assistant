My first solution would be something along this lines (to add in the Matrix class if possible) : static Matrix AddMatrices(Matrix[] lMatrices) // or List lMatrices { // Check consistency of matrices Matrix m = new Matrix(n, p); for (int i = 0; i I'd had it in the Matrix class because you can rely on the private methods and properties that could be usefull for your function in case the implementation of the matrix change (linked list of non empty nodes instead of a big double array, for example). Of course, you would loose the elegance of result = a + b + c + d . But you would have something along the lines of result = Matrix.AddMatrices(new Matrix[] { a, b, c, d }); .
