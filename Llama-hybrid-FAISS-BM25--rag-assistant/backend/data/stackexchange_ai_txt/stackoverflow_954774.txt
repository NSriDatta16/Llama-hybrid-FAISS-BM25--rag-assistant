PXPost is the most straight-forward solution. You just communicate via HTTP POSTs and XML. You don't need any external dependencies, just urllib2 and ElementTree . Software toolkit can be used only on Windows platform, so it's not an option for you(or is it?). COM is also a nasty beast. Web service is a more elegant PXPost. You won't need to build your own XML request, the SOAP protocol does that for you. It just downloads the WSDL where it's specified which methods web service exposes and generates Python module with web service's methods. You just then import the module and off you go. The problem is that it's not always easy to generate that Python module. If web service uses some custom data types it can get quite complicated. Check this for more. So, I'd try with web service approach first, if that fails go with PXPost.
