370 rows, with approx. 900 features is not optimal. I would suggest some dimension reduction. PCA, factor analysis, PLS regression are some alternatives. You could try a lasso- / elasticnet -regression as well. Here is a good guide. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
