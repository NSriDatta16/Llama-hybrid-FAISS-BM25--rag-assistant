Confusion about Cross-Validation for Hierarchical Bayesian Regression Models

I had two questions regarding model selection for a Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) Regression Model and the purpose of Cross-Validation. 1). I understand cross-validation as one way to perform model selection for a Hierarchical Bayesian Regression Model. Is this understanding correct? 2). If cross-validation can be used for model selection, would one go about using it in the following way? Say you have 5 possible variables (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5), which I believe means that you have 2^5 possible models. Do you run your HB regression assuming a particular model (e.g., x1 + x2), find the regression parameters obtained, cross-validate to find the groupwise or overall predictive error, and then choose the model that gives the minimum predictive error?
