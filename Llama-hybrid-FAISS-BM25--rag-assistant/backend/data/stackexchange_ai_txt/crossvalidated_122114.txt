Time Series Function - Constant vs Piecewise

I have daily data for online marketing $ spend and the number of clicks to the website gained. I want to determine a function that 'maps' the two together. I cannot use normal linear regression because of the timely nature of the data (e.g. spend today may result in more clicks today because of spammers, tomorrow because of interested parties, the next day because of loyal customers and so on). I kind of 'know' it should look like a log curve starting from (0,something). Why? No spend = some organic clicks. And for each additional click you need to spend a little more but the payoff eventually will cut off as only so many people will be interested in clicking your website. I am unsure how to actually find the function that correlates the two using the data I have. I have no missing data. Do you have any ideas? Would the derivative of that function give me the $ cost per additional click? Bonus point: how do I prove that constant spend is better then ad-hoc spend? Would I calculate the area under the function above (ie constant spend) vs the sum of spend and sum of clicks and show that the sum of clicks is lower when ad-hoc bursts of investment are made? Edit: sample data here: http://pastebin.com/Ggjg8zR8 First row = date, Column B/C map together, Column D/E map together, Column F is what the company spent marketing $ on directly (so E = organic + billed + additional gained from investment).
