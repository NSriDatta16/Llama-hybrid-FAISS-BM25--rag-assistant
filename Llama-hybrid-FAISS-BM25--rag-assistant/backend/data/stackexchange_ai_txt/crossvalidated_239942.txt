Which one would perform better: logistic regression or discriminant analysis?

I have two groups (36 patients and 30 controls) and I want to check five or six normally distributed (as I checked using skewness and kurtosis values) variables (numeric) that discriminate between the two groups. Which is the best method to analyze my data? Should I perform a logistic regression or a discriminant analysis?
