One thing that people haven't mentioned yet is the use of the PHP extension Suhosin here. You can fix a number of known security holes in PHP's superglobals by installing Suhosin , and additionally, control the maximum array length/depth/size for each of $_GET , $_POST etc. It also provides transparent encryption of session data. Excerpt from the standard suhosin.ini configuration file: The encryption key used consists of [a] user defined string (which can be altered by a script via ini_set()) and optionally the User-Agent, the Document-Root and 0-4 Octects [sic] of the REMOTE_ADDR. Suhosin should still be used with $_SESSION over HTTPS, as there's no feasible way to protect against loss of information without using encryption in the transport layer. And you should salt your session ID with something similar to Suhosin 's method for encrypting the session data itself (using something semi-unique to the user, and maybe the time or date too).
