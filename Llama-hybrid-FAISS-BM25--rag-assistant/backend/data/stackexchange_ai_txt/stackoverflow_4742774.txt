extract a word from text considering punctuation

considering i have an offset marking the start of the word.. i need a method to get the size of that word considering all the sign of punctuation. example: $str = "my text bla bla-bla; hello! abc"; $offset = "22"; // start of hello now i need a function that returns 5 considering hello is 5 chars. this are some of punctuations may occur: array(',','.',' ','-',"'",'"',';',':','?','!','|','/','\\',' ') i can do some hard parsing but i would like to write something more elegant
