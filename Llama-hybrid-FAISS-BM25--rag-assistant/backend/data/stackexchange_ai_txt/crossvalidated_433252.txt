Why is this conditional dependency statement not correct?

I am taking an online Bayesian statistics course and here is a question from the quiz: "Is the following statement correct? $$p(a∣b,c)=p(a∣b)p(a∣c)$$ when $b$ and $c$ are independent." I thought it was correct, but learned after submitting that it was incorrect. Why is that?
