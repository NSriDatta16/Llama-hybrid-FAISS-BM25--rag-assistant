I assume it depends on what information you want to get/what you're trying to capture/predict. E.g. are you looking to understand influence of season on shopping rates? Yearly data wouldn't be of use then. Maybe trying to understand what your question is, will help to some extent give a first guidance as to the frequency/timestep in your data. As a brief point, make sure how you analyse time-series data, especially how you split it not only in the size of time 'chunks' but not just randomly using e.g. sklearn's train test split, cross-fold validation, due to correlations in time series data: https://machinelearningmastery.com/backtest-machine-learning-models-time-series-forecasting/ :)
