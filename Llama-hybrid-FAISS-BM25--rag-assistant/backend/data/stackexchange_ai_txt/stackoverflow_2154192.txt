The change from winforms to WPF is not a change I'd reccommend unless you have specific requirements which WPF fulfills - WPF is not intended to be a replacement, simply an alternative which is more suited towards graphically rich applications. If you do have a specific requirement then you also might want to consider embedding WPF controls into winforms applications, rather than converting your entire application.
