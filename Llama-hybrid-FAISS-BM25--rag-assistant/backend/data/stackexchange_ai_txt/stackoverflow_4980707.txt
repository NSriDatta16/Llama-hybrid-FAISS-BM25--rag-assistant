How to associate two DOM elements?

I have this simple HTML structure: One Foo is a fool. Two Bar is not Barbie. Three Baz likes bazookas. As you can see, there is a UL list. Each LI item contains a paragraph that is at all times hidden. What I want to do is this: Whenever the user clicks a LI element, the corresponding P element should be transfered to the #pane DIV. And then, when the user clicks the same LI element again, the P element should be transfered back to its original location. Live demo: http://jsfiddle.net/u5y6u/1/ This is the jQuery code that I'm using currently: var p; $('li').toggle(function() { p = $(this).find('p').appendTo('#pane'); }, function() { p.appendTo(this); }); The local variable p is used to store the reference to the paragraph when it is inside the #pane DIV. This obviously works only for one LI element, because if the user clicks on one LI element and then immediately after that on another LI element, the p variable is overwritten with the new paragraph reference. This is what I would like to do: Whenever a P element is transfered to the #pane DIV, I want to somehow associate that P element with the LI element that originally contained it, so that when the LI is clicked again, I know which P element I have to transfer back. How would I do this?
