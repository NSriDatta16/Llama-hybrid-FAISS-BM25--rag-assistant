It's an EMF Fragment Path. The Javadoc describes it like this: String org.eclipse.emf.ecore.InternalEObject.eURIFragmentSegment(EStructuralFeature eFeature, EObject eObject) Returns the fragment segment that, when passed to eObjectForURIFragmentSegment, will resolve to the given object in this object's given feature. The feature argument may be null in which case it will be deduced, if possible. The default result will be of the form: "@feature-name[.index]" The index is used only for many-valued features; it represents the position within the list. Parameters: eFeature the feature relating the given object to this object, or null. eObject the object to be identified. Returns: the fragment segment that resolves to the given object in this object's given feature.
