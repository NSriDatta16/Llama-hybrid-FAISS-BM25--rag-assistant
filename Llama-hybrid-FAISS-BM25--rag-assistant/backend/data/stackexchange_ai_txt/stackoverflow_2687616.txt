Oracle's Application Development Framework (ADF) does just this. You develop your application modules, database entities, and view objects. Then you can drag and drop them onto the page or frame. This allows you to develop the business logic once and keep the logic for handling each view separate. JDeveloper 11g (the IDE for developing software using ADF) handles AJAX well. It also allows you to declaritively create custom components that can be reused via drag and drop. The application's visual layout is somewhat abstracted through custom tags, but you cannot, for example, create a web page and then click a button to create a corresponding JPanel. (To my knowledge.)
