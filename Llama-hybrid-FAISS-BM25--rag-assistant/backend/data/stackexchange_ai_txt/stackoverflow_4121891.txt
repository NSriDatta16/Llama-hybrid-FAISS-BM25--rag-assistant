Lotus notes application access to microsoft exchange server

We have Lotus Notes based application, which is accessed by several users. We communicate with our users by using mailboxes which reside on Domino server. With mailboxes migrating from Lotus notes to Microsoft exchange. What are possible ways to continue communications categories mentioned below: 1) Send normal email containing attachment to users. - Is it possible to send email from lotusscript when mailbox resides on microsoft exchange server? Any other solution. 2) Send email with buttons to approve or reject - How will it be done through Lotus notes when mailbox is microsoft exchange? In case we do not migrate mailbox however our clients access outlook mailbox is it still possible to send email containing approval buttons etc? 3) Agents look up mailbox regularly to receive communication from backend - Is it possible to access Microsoft exchange mailbox from Lotus notes so that we can process incoming emails? Any other solution?
