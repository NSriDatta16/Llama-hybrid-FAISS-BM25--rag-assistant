There are many clustering algorithms out there, and the web is awash with information on them and sample implementations. A good starting point is the Wikipedia entry on cluster analysis Cluster_analysis . As you have a working k-means implementation, you could try one of the many variants to see if they yeild better results (k-means++ perhaps, seeing as you mentioned SVM). If you want a completely different approach, have a look at Kohonen Maps - also called Self Organising Feature Maps. If that looks too tricky, a simple hierarchical clustering would be easy to implement (find the nearest two items, combine, rinse and repeat).
