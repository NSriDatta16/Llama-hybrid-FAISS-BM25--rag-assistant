Extrapolating survey results for a larger data set

I have a set of survey results in Excel for a sample of "customers" which asks for their income. This is chosen from defined ranges such as "Less than 10k", "10k to 15k", "16 to 20k", etc. The sample was approx 11% of the whole customer database. I wish to extrapolate this to the larger customer set and find what the average income of all customers is likely to be. Is there a straightforward method to extrapolate the results? So far I've only placed arbitrary values to each income bracket (1,2,3 for each sequential category) and then used a Median and Average function. TIA CJ Sohal
