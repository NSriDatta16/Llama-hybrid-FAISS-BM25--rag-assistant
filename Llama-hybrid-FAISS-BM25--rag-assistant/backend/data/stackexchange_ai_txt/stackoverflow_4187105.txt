This won't help with your compile-time errors, but when you get to the point that you can actually try running this code then you should be aware that you didn't allocate any memory for ptemp - it's just a dangling pointer . Change the definition from: char *ptemp, *pfuncNum, *pcarID, *pstationName; to e.g. char ptemp[LINE_MAX]; char *pfuncNum, *pcarID, *pstationName;
