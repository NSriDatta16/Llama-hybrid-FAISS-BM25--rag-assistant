Create a ref dictionary in which the time-series of each component is appended to a list. You will end up with multiple time-series and just simply say if a time-series deviates dramatically from its moving average, it is an anomaly . This means, I would not go with feature extraction as your input will be literally some temporal info. This is a classic time-series analysis problem and better to look at it that way. Please note that the anomaly detection here is pretty basic and based on simple statistics. You can go much more complex e.g. train a prediction model for each time-series and output anomaly if prediction and actual value at a time are very (based on a user threshold) different.
