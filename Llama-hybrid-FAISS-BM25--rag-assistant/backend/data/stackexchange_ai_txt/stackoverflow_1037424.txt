Why the other answers are true in the general sense, in that you'll need to write your own actions to do anything meaningful the Yacc definition that you linked to actually doesn't have any actions associated with the grammar rules. What it does is that it defines the yyerror function and some code for extracting values from yylval based on the token type. If you have no clue what yyerror/yylval are about you should read a bison/flex tutorial. The Dragon book is also a good resource if you're more serious about this. There are also some excellent handouts from a Stanford course on compilers floating around the Net, which are based on the book.
