It might be worthwhile to learn about functional programming, too. Functional languages are well-suited to writing a compiler both in and for . My school's intro compilers class contained an intro to functional languages and the assignments were all in OCaml. Funny you should ask this today, since just a couple days ago I wrote a lambda calculus interpreter. Lambda calculus is the granddaddy of all functional languages. It's just 200 lines long (in C++, incl. error reporting, some pretty printing, some unicode) and has a two-phase structure, with an intermediate format that could be used to generate code. Not only is starting small and building up the most practical approach to compilers, it also encourages good, modular, organizational practice.
