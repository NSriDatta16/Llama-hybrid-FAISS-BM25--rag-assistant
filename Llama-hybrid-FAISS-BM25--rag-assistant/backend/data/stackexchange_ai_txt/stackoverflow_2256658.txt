Although I believe John Gietzen's answer is the most elegant solution, I was unable to implement do to a shared hosting environment. Determined to find a non-application driven solution I found this blog post which shows a good alternative method for IIS7. Thankfully DiscountASP.NET's has the URL Rewrite module available through the IIS Manager tool. Following this blog post on creating a rewrite rule any URL with www in the domain will do a permanent 301 redirect to the non-www site. All while preserving the full paths. Thanks for everyone's input.
