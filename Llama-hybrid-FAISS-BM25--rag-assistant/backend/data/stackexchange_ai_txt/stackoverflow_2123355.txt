It's all down to the query optimizer - that will by trying to optimize the query you enter into the most efficient execution plan (i.e several different queries could be optimized down to the SAME statement that is estimated to be most efficient). The main thing you should do when trying to optimise a query and find which one performs the best, is to just try them and compare performance. Run an SQL profiler trace to see what the duration/reads is for each version. I usually run each version of a query 3 times to get an average to compare. Each time, clearing the execution plan and data cache down to prevent skewed results. It's worth having a read of this MSDN article on the optimizer.
