Upcasting is formally defined in 4.10/3 of the standard. Downcasting is in 5.2.9/5, although that's not specifically what you're doing. Addressing the title of your question, it's not possible to pass (or return) a base class pointer to (from) a function whose parameters (return type) indicate a derived class pointer. If the parameters indicate a reference to base class pointer, then it's not possible to pass a derived class pointer by reference . If a base class pointer value, it is possible to pass a derived pointer because of the implicit conversion. I can't say why your code fails: as commented above, your real code must fail for different reasons than your example code does, since your example code doesn't work at all.
