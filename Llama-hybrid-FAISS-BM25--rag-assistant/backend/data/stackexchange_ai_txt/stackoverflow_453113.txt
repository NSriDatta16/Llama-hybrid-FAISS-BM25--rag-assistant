Along with depending on how often the content to be loaded in the div changes, one also needs to take into account how much data each div is supposed to contain. Consider, for example, you have 10 divs, each of which is going to contain a pretty substantial chunk of data. Now loading it either during initial page load or loading it all on the first link click would be inefficient if, on an average the user is going to click only a couple of links. Given this pretext, I think there are 2 main points you need to consider in deciding which option to choose for loading the content of the divs : Whether the content of the div will change frequently Whether a lot of data needs to be loaded in the div If the answer for either 1 or 2 is yes, I would suggest using AJAX to load the content of "only" that div. Otherwise you can load all the divs at initial page load itself
