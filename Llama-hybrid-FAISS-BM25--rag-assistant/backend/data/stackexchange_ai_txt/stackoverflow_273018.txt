It all depends on the usage: If you need only to list the results of one or more queries you should use the datareader. Has DOK pointed out, it's read-only and foward-only so it's fast. http://www.startvbdotnet.com/ado/sqlserver.aspx If you need to navigate thou the records you should use a dataset. http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/raghavnayak/DataSetsIn.NET12032005003647AM/DataSetsIn.NET.aspx The dataset also has the advantage of working "disconnected", so you build all the logic, and only when you need the data you call the Fill method. The dataset is populated and then you can start working with the data, now disconnected from the DB. Hope it helps, Bruno Figueiredo http://www.brunofigueiredo.com
