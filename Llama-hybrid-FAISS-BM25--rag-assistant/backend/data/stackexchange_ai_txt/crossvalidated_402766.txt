A feed forward neural network is just a function $f(x; \theta)$ of some inputs and its weights. There is a clear procedure for computing the values of each unit/layer in the network from the previous layer. You can ascribe your own interpretation for what the outputs mean (a probability value, an RL policy, a point estimate, etc) and train the model accordingly. On the other hand, an RBM models $P(x; \theta)$ . It doesn't have any outputs and can't do anything other than tell you the probability of the data given the parameters. You can't compute the value of any unobserved variables in the RBM, because they're random variables.
