How can I calculate the AUC of combined variables using SPSS

thank you for taking time out to read this. I have previously ran ROC curves to get the AUCs for single test variables but I do not know how to derive the AUC for combined variables (2 test variables instead of just 1). I read that I can use logistic regression to get the AUC but I have no clue on how to do it and how to interpret the output. The system I'm using is SPSS version 22. Please help. Thank you
