Per @Coffee's recommendation, I would recommend the text Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective by Sergios Theodoridis along with Pattern Recognition by the same author. These two texts combined are 2,000 pages total and cover everything from undergrad-level probability to linear models, and (as far as I can tell) everything covered by Elements of Statistical Learning , in addition to time series, probabilistic graphical models, deep learning, and Monte Carlo methods. The author makes an excellent effort to make all notation clear and consistent (thank you for bolding all of your vectors!) and seems to have used carefully chosen exercises. Having a background in probability as well as stats at the level of Casella and Berger would be extremely helpful to have before pursing these texts. There is some discussion of UMVUEs in here.
