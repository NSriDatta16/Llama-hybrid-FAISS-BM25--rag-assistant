Of course, this makes complete sense, as long as all the other variables are the same. In fact, if you think of logistic regression as a linear regression with the log-odds of the output variable (as in http://www.wright.edu/~thaddeus.tarpey/ES714glm.pdf ), then it is trivial that comparing the weights is the same as comparing them in linear regression, which makes perfect sense.
