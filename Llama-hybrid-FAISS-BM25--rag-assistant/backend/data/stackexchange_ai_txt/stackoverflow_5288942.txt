Makefile - applying a variable as a prefix to multiple parts of another variable

i have a small java project i want to build using a makefile, the code is in src/package... /*.java , the bytecode should go to bin/package.../*.class . My current file looks like this (simplified): JC = javac SRCDIR = src BINDIR = bin JCFLAGS = -d $(BINDIR)/ CLASSES = $(SRCDIR)/package/class1.java $(SRCDIR)/package/class2.java $(SRCDIR)/package/class3.java default: $(JC) $(JCFLAGS) $(CLASSES) It works and does what it should, but there has to be a more elegant way to do this. For example, is there a way to apply the path ( $(SRCDIR) and the package name) as a prefix to all class filenames, so i do not have to put the path seperately in front of every class? All classes have to be compiled in one javac-call, as there are circular dependencies in them, so using an own target for each class does not work: default: $(CLASSES) %.java: $(JC) $(JCFLAGS) $(SRCDIR)/$@ Thanks for your help.
