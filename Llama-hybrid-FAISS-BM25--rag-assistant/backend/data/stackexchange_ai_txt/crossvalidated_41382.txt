Your assumption that the measures will only differ by a multiplicative constant strikes me as certainly false. The fact that this would not work for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius demonstrates that. (A.k.a. #3) You will need to assess more than one part. You will not have enough degrees of freedom to determine the conversion between the two measurements if you only use one part. Moreover, try to get parts where the true values of the measurements span as large a range as possible, and certainly span the range within which you will want to make the conversion in the future. (A.k.a. #2) You can determine the conversion equation by means of a regression analysis. With multiple measures, you could use a multi-level model, but I suspect this is more than is necessary. If you make several measures of each part with each measurement instrument you can just use the averages, as you describe, to get a more robust measure. Then you can just use those two means as your $x$ and $y$ values for that part. The beta estimates from the regression equation will give you the shift required. Note that these won't be the same values that you could get via other conversion strategies, however, because the procedure differs; for example to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you can subtract 32 and divide by 1.8, but to use a regression equation, $\beta_0\approx18$ and $\beta_1\approx.6$. This doesn't matter, as long as you know which procedure you're using. Another advantage of the regression approach, by the way, is the conversion between two measurement instruments won't necessarily be linear throughout the possible range, which a regression analysis may allow you to model.
