I actually think it may retain cached information when you close out the UIWebView . I've tried removing a UIWebView from my UIViewController , releasing it, then creating a new one. The new one remembered exactly where I was at when I went back to an address without having to reload everything (it remembered my previous UIWebView was logged in). So a couple of suggestions: [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] removeCachedResponseForRequest:NSURLRequest]; This would remove a cached response for a specific request. There is also a call that will remove all cached responses for all requests ran on the UIWebView : [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] removeAllCachedResponses]; After that, you can try deleting any associated cookies with the UIWebView : for(NSHTTPCookie *cookie in [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]) { if([[cookie domain] isEqualToString:someNSStringUrlDomain]) { [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] deleteCookie:cookie]; } } Swift 3: // Remove all cache URLCache.shared.removeAllCachedResponses() // Delete any associated cookies if let cookies = HTTPCookieStorage.shared.cookies { for cookie in cookies { HTTPCookieStorage.shared.deleteCookie(cookie) } }
