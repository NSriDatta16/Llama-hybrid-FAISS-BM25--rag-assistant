This is essentially the difference between the output from a frequentist and Bayesian procedure. To get frequentist type output i.e. point estimates one typically uses the Bayesian Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This essentially chooses a threshold and returns the modes above that threshold. You are then back to the frequentist world of "what threshold is appropriate?" which is the same as asking "how long is a piece of string?". Typically people use thresholds based on the Bayes Factor, for example: http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/Pub/EckleyFearnheadKillick2010.pdf shows how this choice can be made and: http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/8189/1/PScpt2.pdf provides a histogram of number of changes against posterior probability too indicating that the mode of that histogram should be chosen.
