Autocompletion with qcompleter for fragments in the middle of a word

Is there an example available of a QCompleter subclass that will provide autocompletions for fragments that appear in the middle of words? eg: Suppose you have the wordlist { "apple", "pear", "banana" } . When the user types 'p' , the suggested autocompletions should be "apple" and "pear" , but not banana (because "apple" and "pear" both contain 'p' ); The default autocompletion will only suggest "pear" .
