Predictions from a Poisson model are the mean parameter of a Poisson distribution, which is not constrained to be an integer. (Think of the old "the average family has 2.4 children" conundrum.) Simulated outcomes from your model using those predicted means will of course be integers: for the predictor combination giving a predicted mean of 41.2 you might well get 45, 39, 42, or 40 as simulated outcomes.
