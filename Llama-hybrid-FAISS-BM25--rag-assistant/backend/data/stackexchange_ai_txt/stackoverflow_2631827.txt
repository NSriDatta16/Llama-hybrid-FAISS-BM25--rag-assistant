No, the jit compiler will convert property accesses into direct variable accesses on the backing field, so it's no less efficient than using a member variable directly. The advantage is that if you ever wish to convert the property into a nontrivial implementation, you can just add code to the get/set to allow additional checks or behaviours or a different storage mechanism to be used for a property without having to refactor any of the client code (in this case, all in the same class).
