While I recognize that you may have word count limitations, it makes very little sense to choose your model based on word count. If you can't fit a description of your model in the word count, it would be better to change the hypothesis (or otherwise reduce word count). Zero-one inflated beta regression does seem appropriate for your hypothesis. You may be able to describe this in a couple sentences, with citations. Or, depending on where you are submitting, you might be able to put it in an online appendix (many journals now do this). A quadratic term also seems right. The problem with using a regular, OLS regression is that a) You will violate the assumptions of the model and b) The model may (in fact, probably will) give predictions outside the range of 0 and 1. If you are using R, there is the zoib pacakage which does this in a Bayesian framework. If you are using SAS then see a SUGI paper by Swearingen, Castro and Bursac from 2012. Regardless of word count limitations, these are complex models. You may want to hire a consultant.
