From Wikipedia Research has focused on solving the minimum spanning tree problem in a highly parallelized manner. With a linear number of processors it is possible to solve the problem in O(logn) time. A 2003 paper "Fast Shared-Memory Algorithms for Computing the Minimum Spanning Forest of Sparse Graphs" by David A. Bader and Guojing Cong demonstrates a pragmatic algorithm that can compute MSTs 5 times faster on 8 processors than an optimized sequential algorithm.[9] Typically, parallel algorithms are based on Boruvka's algorithmâ€”Prim's and especially Kruskal's algorithm do not scale as well to additional processors. So, you might look into the algorithm mentioned in that paper, but Kruskal probably won't benefit from multiple threads.
