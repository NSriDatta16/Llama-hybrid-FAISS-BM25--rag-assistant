Ok I figured it out See soultion here http://jsbin.com/uraya5/10/ I had to: Set width to 19% of each button for some reason there is spacing between each button so 20% does not work. Set ui-bar-a background to black so it hides the spaces between my images Use this JS code to navigate pages $.mobile.changePage($("#about"), "flip", true, true); I would still like to use a single image instead of having 5 different images to reduce http calls. So if anyone finds a eligant soultion for this please let me know.
