PHP - How to re-encode a URI

I think I have the need to take a uri which has been decoded in PHP, and re-encode it. Here is the situation: JavaScript passes encoded uri as query string parameter to php script. PHP script embeds uri as a hidden input value in an html document, responds with the document to a user agent. JavaScript reads embedded uri and sets location of current document based on value of hidden input. On Step 2, I am finding that the Uri is fully decoded after reading it in via $_GET. So when I embed the uri in the hidden input, it becomes un-encoded. So I would like to run a PHP script which re-encodes the Uri properly ex: http://my.example.com/dog walk?is=very great ==> http://my.example.com/dog%20walk?is=very%20great Is there a pre-built php function for this or should I just write my own? PLEASE NOTE: urlencode and urldecode are not the answer to get the desired input/output I have in the example above. Thanks, Macy
