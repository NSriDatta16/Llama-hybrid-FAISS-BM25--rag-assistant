This might be a stupid solution. But it works. If you can improve it, please let me know. OnCreate of your Service: I have used WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH flag. This is the only change in service. @Override public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(),"onCreate", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); mView = new HUDView(this); WindowManager.LayoutParams params = new WindowManager.LayoutParams( WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH, PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT); params.gravity = Gravity.RIGHT | Gravity.TOP; params.setTitle("Load Average"); WindowManager wm = (WindowManager) getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE); wm.addView(mView, params); } Now, you will start getting each and every click event. So, you need to rectify in your event handler. In your ViewGroup touch event @Override public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { // ATTENTION: GET THE X,Y OF EVENT FROM THE PARAMETER // THEN CHECK IF THAT IS INSIDE YOUR DESIRED AREA Toast.makeText(getContext(),"onTouchEvent", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); return true; } Also you may need to add this permission to your manifest:
