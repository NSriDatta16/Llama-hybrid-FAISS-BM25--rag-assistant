People generally don't document their personal configuration that much, especially because they are generally aware what is what. The Emacs Starter Kit is targeting newbie Emacs users and has better documentation than average. It might seem a bit self-promoting, but I encourage you to take a look at my personal config as well, since I happen to monitor a lot of Emacs channels and use a lot of innovative stuff. My configuration is also highly modular and has more comments than most. That said I'd recommend you if find something in anyone's config you can't understand to just look up the library to which the configuration relates in EmacsWiki and drop by in #emacs irc channel on freenode and ask for help. The community there is great!
