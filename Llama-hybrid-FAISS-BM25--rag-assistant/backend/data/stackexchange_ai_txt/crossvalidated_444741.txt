Stochastic transition matrix clarification

I am studying stochastic processes, and I don't quite understand what does it mean to go from state $i$ to state $j$ in two steps. As given in the definition and properties page on wikipedia , if there is a stochastic matrix $P$ and $P_{i,j}$ is denoted the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to $j$ then transitioning in "two steps" is the $i,j$ th element of the square of $P$ . My questions are: 1)What does it mean to move from $i$ to $j$ in two steps? Can't we do this in one step? If there's a markov chain where you can move from $i$ to $j$ in only one way(one step) then how do you move onto the $j$ in two steps? 2)Why do we multiply the matrix in order to find the value? What's the intuition behind this? If you could provide maybe a simple example that would clarify this for me that would be great.
